WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
One of the things that we've spoken about privately that we haven't yet spoken about publicly is

00:04.400 --> 00:09.360
victimhood. And James Cantor came on the show. He's a sex researcher. He gave me this really

00:09.360 --> 00:14.240
interesting quote I wanted you to react to. Shifting from aiding victims to aiding everyone who

00:14.240 --> 00:19.440
claims victimhood has led to an awful lot of charlatanism. Shifting from doing good to looking

00:19.440 --> 00:25.120
good has led to an awful lot of virtue signaling. Their interaction is now western culture at

00:25.120 --> 00:30.080
least online. What do you think about that? I think it's true. And if you think about,

00:30.800 --> 00:36.880
you know, I believe people respond to incentives. That's fundamentally the driving force of all

00:36.880 --> 00:42.240
human behavior. We respond to incentives. If you incentivize victimhood, you're going to get victims.

00:43.680 --> 00:51.840
And I think online is really the shift that happens because the online world rewards it and

00:51.840 --> 00:56.160
it also allows people to fake victimhood in a way that in person you can't really. Like if you see

00:56.160 --> 01:01.040
someone living in a massive house, you go, well, you may be in victim in some ways, but you are

01:01.040 --> 01:06.800
actually well taken care of here. But online, you can create any avatar you want. And that avatar

01:06.800 --> 01:11.120
can be projected onto the online space from a mansion. And that's kind of where we are.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
Yeah, the fact that our opinions are more important than our deeds and our words are scrutinized while

01:18.000 --> 01:22.720
our actions are done in private. You know, how many people have we seen over the last few years?

01:22.720 --> 01:28.240
Ellen DeGeneres, Lizzo, who's that late night host that just got popped for apparently being a

01:28.240 --> 01:35.120
Jimmy Fallon, I think, allegedly has these people that outwardly are supposed to be

01:35.760 --> 01:41.440
champion for the underclass, like I'm supporting women of all sizes or I'm supporting people that

01:42.160 --> 01:46.160
have different sexual orientations or I do the whatever. And then you find out behind the scenes

01:46.160 --> 01:51.520
that they can't even treat a PA with dignity. I don't know, it seems to me like

01:53.040 --> 02:00.320
being someone who out front proselytizes about standing up for the underclass

02:00.960 --> 02:05.200
is almost becoming a red flag to go. I probably should scrutinize what's actually going on behind

02:05.200 --> 02:10.240
the scenes here. When I was a stand-up comedian in the comedy world, there's a golden rule of this.

02:10.240 --> 02:15.680
The more a comedian talks about how he's a male feminist on stage, the sleazier he is backstage.

02:16.640 --> 02:21.920
It's like a golden rule never fails, always the same. So anyone who goes on stage and talks

02:21.920 --> 02:26.640
about how brilliant they are, they're always, always, always sleazy and evil behind the scenes.

02:26.640 --> 02:31.440
It's just how it works. And I think it's actually, it's a kind of compensatory mechanism.

02:31.440 --> 02:35.920
People who are hiding a bunch of shit have to go out and then pretend to be something they're not.

02:37.040 --> 02:43.680
The morality sort of stands on the shoulders of this performative bullshit. Is there a solution

02:43.680 --> 02:48.160
to this? Is there a way that we can scrutinize, given that people's deeds and their actions and

02:48.160 --> 02:55.120
their words and their opinions are always going to be far apart? I think that we are living through

02:55.920 --> 03:01.760
a digital revolution for which we're not prepared. Naturally, that's what revolution is, right? It's

03:01.760 --> 03:08.080
a change in the paradigm of how we exist. So I think that 10, 15, 20 years from now, we will

03:08.080 --> 03:14.160
look back at the way we use social media now and be horrified by it. It'll be a little bit like

03:14.800 --> 03:20.640
tobacco companies promoting cigarettes as a healthy thing to do. And then we'll be like, whoa,

03:20.640 --> 03:24.720
this was actually causing a lot of damage. So I think the answer to this is a healthier

03:24.720 --> 03:30.480
relationship with the online world in particular. My hope is that we get past this stage and work

03:30.480 --> 03:35.920
out how to use all of that stuff better. I see it in myself, the way I use social media now is

03:35.920 --> 03:42.000
very different to the way I would have used it even two years ago. I'm much more responsible with

03:42.000 --> 03:46.720
the way I use it. And I mean in terms of my own life, in terms of how much time I spend on them,

03:46.720 --> 03:53.040
what I do, but also in terms of the way I act on social media, because I am trying to be more

03:53.040 --> 03:59.440
responsible in what I say is very easy. And I think especially on X or Twitter, whatever you want to

03:59.440 --> 04:05.920
call it, to get clicks. And I know exactly how to do that, which is dunk on somebody.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.560
And I spend less and less of my time doing that now, because I don't think that makes the world

04:10.560 --> 04:15.200
better. I don't think it makes me better. It's very rare on Twitter to have someone

04:16.560 --> 04:21.440
break the fourth wall and say, that was out of order. You're not allowed to say that. Everybody

04:21.440 --> 04:29.120
plays this sort of permanent game of sardonic tennis. Here's some blasÃ© comment about how you

04:29.120 --> 04:33.840
suck at some smart snipe back at what you said. And oh, I hit it back across the net with something

04:33.840 --> 04:38.480
else. No one actually says what they should say, which is that's fucking out of order.

04:38.480 --> 04:44.240
And then you're approved if you do. This is why it's disincentivized. This is coming back to the

04:44.240 --> 04:49.200
point about incentives. Social media rewards certain types of behavior and punishes others. So

04:49.200 --> 04:55.520
if you're the guy that says, maybe we shouldn't pile on this person. If your team is doing the

04:55.520 --> 05:00.240
piling on, you're like the one who's not willing. Do you know what I mean? You're not willing to

05:00.240 --> 05:06.800
join in with stoning somebody. And that's why you're a loser. That's the model that we operate in.

05:06.800 --> 05:13.840
So being responsible is disincentivized. I love this idea that an absurd ideological belief or

05:13.840 --> 05:19.040
an extreme ideological belief is a show of fealty to your own side and a threat display to the other.

05:19.920 --> 05:27.680
And the more absurd or extreme the belief, the more likely it is that your own side can trust

05:27.680 --> 05:33.920
you and that the other side should fear you. Do you know what I mean? That if you have to put

05:33.920 --> 05:41.360
reason and sensibility and common decency to one side in order to like, here I am holding my hand

05:41.360 --> 05:47.120
in the air for whatever the current thing is, your own side sees you as a reliable ally.

05:47.120 --> 05:53.200
And the other side sees you as a formidable foe. It's tribal mechanics, but multiplied by a thousand

05:53.200 --> 05:58.000
because it's online. With everyone scrutinizing you. Yeah. And so you have these weird pathologies

05:58.000 --> 06:01.920
like you've got, and it's not a comment on him personally, but you've got like a guy who lives

06:01.920 --> 06:07.440
in Malaysia commenting on American cultural issues and getting like millions and millions of views

06:07.440 --> 06:12.000
for his commentary and whatever. And he's going, I see what you're doing there, but are you actually

06:12.000 --> 06:17.360
contributing to anything? Do you know what I mean? Because it's just flaming, fanning the flames of

06:17.360 --> 06:22.960
whatever is going on. And I see that as a, you know, like I say, it's a period, it's a transitionary

06:22.960 --> 06:27.760
period. I hope that we get to a point where we start to use social media in a different way.

06:27.760 --> 06:33.200
And actually, you know, this is an unpopular thing to say, but I don't envy the big tech executives

06:34.160 --> 06:39.120
because it's a really hard job. Because on the one hand, you incentivize to encourage engagement.

06:39.680 --> 06:46.880
And on the other hand, the engagement is achieved by amplifying anger and division and all of these

06:46.880 --> 06:52.320
things. So I hope we can work that out as a society. How do we move forward with social media?

06:52.880 --> 06:55.840
What about the victimhood side of things then? You know, like it's kind of,

06:55.840 --> 06:59.680
it's almost like old trope to talk about snowflakes and all this sort of bullshit. It feels like,

06:59.680 --> 07:06.720
you know, five year ago, culture warrior, horse shit. But the underlying dynamic is still

07:07.600 --> 07:14.720
there, that we've got this sort of tyranny of the minority in some regards, that fragility is

07:14.720 --> 07:19.280
something to aspire toward, or at least it's something which is rewarded in a variety of

07:19.280 --> 07:23.760
different ways. What's your sort of conception and framework of this with a little bit more

07:23.760 --> 07:28.560
perspective that we've got now? Well, I'm going to be speaking at ARC Jordan's

07:28.560 --> 07:32.320
thing later this year. And one of the things I want to talk about is that I think

07:32.960 --> 07:38.800
everyone's embraced us now. We all now do it. I feel like those of us who have been concerned

07:38.800 --> 07:44.560
about wokeness have sort of got into that place where we are like, I'm a victim, I've been cancelled,

07:44.560 --> 07:50.240
I've been this and I've been that. And I think it's time actually for us to step into our power now

07:50.240 --> 07:55.360
and go, okay, well, we've created these new media organizations, we've created alliances,

07:55.360 --> 07:59.760
we've created community, we've created things. And the question really for us is now,

08:00.240 --> 08:05.600
we know what we're against, but not enough people are willing to say, what are we for exactly?

08:05.600 --> 08:10.800
And that's because it's much harder to do. But that is the mission now. It's how do you get past

08:10.800 --> 08:16.320
woke, anti-woke into the future? And the future has to be about offering people a better alternative

08:16.320 --> 08:22.960
to that victimhood, because it's more rewarding for the individual to see themselves in that way,

08:22.960 --> 08:28.320
I think. And this is why Jordan Peterson was so successful when he broke through,

08:28.320 --> 08:34.560
because he was saying to people, take responsibility. And I think we all actually now

08:34.560 --> 08:42.560
are in a position where we have to say it to ourselves. Yes, the right wing snowflake sphere

08:42.560 --> 08:47.760
that nobody really ever talks about. I'm pretty sure that you hate that even more than you hate

08:47.840 --> 08:58.800
left wing snowflake sphere. Using the call out culture to say this is something that

08:58.800 --> 09:04.480
shouldn't be happening, this is pedestalizing victimhood, so on and so forth. While some people

09:04.480 --> 09:09.440
waving that exact same identity flag themselves, it's like, I don't know, man, that doesn't seem

09:09.440 --> 09:13.600
like the way to go. No, it doesn't. I understand it, though. And I think people on the right

09:13.600 --> 09:19.920
could quite credibly say that, well, they did this and now we're using the weapons that they

09:19.920 --> 09:24.640
forged against them. It's understandable. But I'm interested in how do we move forward?

09:24.640 --> 09:28.800
How do we move forward? And I think there's a hell of a lot of questions in modern society

09:28.800 --> 09:34.480
about that that remain extremely unanswered. Where do you get meaning and purpose in your life?

09:35.440 --> 09:41.440
Now, in a society that has fewer and fewer children in which young people are delaying

09:41.440 --> 09:48.800
adulthood longer and longer and longer, where do you get meaning and purpose? Exactly.

09:48.800 --> 09:53.520
For some people, that's online activism, but actually how fulfilling that is, I don't know.

09:53.520 --> 09:58.560
So the big questions remain unanswered and perhaps increasingly so, actually. I think

10:00.080 --> 10:04.800
there could well be an argument that 80 years ago, people had way more meaning and purpose

10:04.800 --> 10:10.160
readily available to them at just through the course of normal life, get married, have kids,

10:10.160 --> 10:15.600
whatever. Now, obviously, that wasn't universally available to everybody, et cetera. But I think

10:15.600 --> 10:22.640
in the modern world, actually, way more people are lost. They don't know what they're supposed to do

10:22.640 --> 10:29.120
exactly. So in the past, we had a set trajectory you're supposed to follow, which hurt some people

10:29.120 --> 10:33.200
because it wasn't the trajectory for them. But when you take away all trajectory, then

10:33.200 --> 10:39.600
everybody is lost. And I think a lot of people are in that position now. And as I said, I think

10:39.600 --> 10:45.040
it's way harder to think about what the positive vision of the future is. But that, I think, is

10:45.040 --> 10:52.960
the task now. That's the mission. If you think wokeness is stupid and dangerous and harmful,

10:52.960 --> 10:58.720
which I do, well, what do you think in addition to that? What do you think beyond that? What is it

10:58.720 --> 11:04.400
that you think people ought to do? If they ought not to be victims, what ought they to think about

11:04.400 --> 11:10.480
with their lives? And that's a very difficult question that I have more questions than answers

11:10.480 --> 11:17.920
about. It's way easier to identify problems than proposed solutions. And you almost see this on

11:17.920 --> 11:25.200
the internet that if somebody identifies a problem, it's kind of hard to criticize a criticism. It's

11:25.200 --> 11:33.520
possible, but it's way easier to criticize a proposal. And it's almost like a defense mechanism

11:33.520 --> 11:40.480
that people have to front load or front run, avoiding the criticism that they know will become

11:40.480 --> 11:44.480
will be incoming. It's the caveat. It's like, I'm not saying that we don't need to care about

11:44.480 --> 11:47.520
such and such. And I'm not saying that this isn't a big deal, but maybe we need to think

11:47.520 --> 11:51.760
about this thing. It's almost like a conceptual equivalent of that.

11:51.760 --> 11:55.840
Yes. And I find myself doing that all the time. Fortifying with caveats.

11:55.840 --> 12:01.520
All the time, man. Because I think the other aspect of the online, the way the communication

12:01.520 --> 12:07.360
happens online is like, if you make a statement, a generalized statement, you might say exercise

12:07.360 --> 12:11.440
is good for you. And somebody will be like, yeah, well, what if you've got an ear injury?

12:12.400 --> 12:17.600
And before you know it, like you hate disabled people. That's kind of how the conversation

12:17.600 --> 12:23.520
happens. But I think when we stop being able to make normative statements, everything else

12:23.520 --> 12:28.960
breaks down. We have to be able to say, for most people, most of the time, pairing up with

12:28.960 --> 12:33.760
someone of the sex that they are attracted to and building a life together is better than not

12:33.760 --> 12:38.560
doing that. We have to be able to say that without the one person who was in an abusive

12:38.560 --> 12:43.760
relationship. Well, what about me? Yes, we understand you, but we're talking about the 95%

12:43.760 --> 12:48.640
of people, right? And you feel free not to go along with whatever we're putting on the table.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.760
It's like, if we put a menu of things on the table, you don't have to eat everything.

12:51.760 --> 12:56.160
No one is making you eat the gluten. It's the Ricky Gervais guitar lessons thing, right?

12:56.160 --> 13:00.480
Exactly. So I think we have to be able to say

13:01.920 --> 13:06.800
all other things being equal, family is good. This is the tyranny of the minority. I

13:06.800 --> 13:12.880
fucking love that phrase. I think it's so smart to optimize for the edges of the bell curve rather

13:12.880 --> 13:18.880
than the middle. And as you said before, it is important to recognize that there are people

13:18.880 --> 13:24.640
who fall outside of the norms of normality and that they need some care as well. And if you

13:24.640 --> 13:28.720
didn't have that sufficiently broad perspective view, these people would just fall through the

13:28.720 --> 13:33.360
cracks and that's fucking shit. And nobody wants that to happen. But when you optimize for that,

13:33.360 --> 13:36.960
you actually end up, if you were to net out what happens, you end up with more suffering because

13:36.960 --> 13:41.120
you neglect all of the fucking fat bit of the middle of the distribution.

13:41.120 --> 13:46.160
That's right. And we've stopped being able to make that point because we... And also,

13:46.160 --> 13:50.240
I think the phrase that I came across and I didn't come up with this, but somebody was saying to me

13:51.040 --> 13:53.840
the other day that we live in a world of trade-off denialism.

13:54.800 --> 13:55.360
What does that mean?

13:56.560 --> 14:02.960
Every decision has trade-offs. It has positives and negatives. And if you go, well, we should do

14:02.960 --> 14:07.120
this and someone goes, yeah, but what about the thing that... And then you can never really

14:07.120 --> 14:12.880
acknowledge. It's like the climate catastrophe. No one wants to talk about the fact that many

14:12.880 --> 14:19.040
of the solutions that are being proposed would be worse than the problem. So it's like, if you say

14:19.040 --> 14:24.560
anything about how we're approaching that issue, you are denying that climate change is real or

14:24.560 --> 14:28.240
you are denying that it's a problem or you're denying that we should address it. No, I just

14:28.240 --> 14:33.680
think your idea of how to fix it is stupid. And we've lost the ability to have that conversation

14:33.680 --> 14:37.280
as well. And I think we'll really need to reintroduce. It's one of the things I talked about

14:37.280 --> 14:42.240
in my Oxford speech, which I think is why it did well is because people went, oh, yeah,

14:42.240 --> 14:46.400
all right, because if we just do the stuff that we've been told we need to do, that's actually

14:46.400 --> 14:52.880
worse. And that sort of opened it up. I think we've totally forgotten that there are no solutions,

14:52.880 --> 14:55.680
only trade-offs. My favorite quote ever from Thomas Sowell.

14:55.680 --> 15:00.720
Yeah, it's lovely. And the difference between maximizing and

15:00.720 --> 15:05.120
satisfying from behavioral economics is an interesting one. So maximizing is everything

15:05.120 --> 15:12.320
must be 100, 100, 100, 100. Satisfying is hitting an acceptable level across everything.

15:12.400 --> 15:16.800
And what the satisfying allows you to do is it allows you to iterate much more quickly.

15:16.800 --> 15:21.280
And as you say, you can do it in your own life. It's like, how many times have you done it?

15:21.280 --> 15:27.840
Going to go away on holiday with the misses. And we're going to have a fucking Airbnb or booking.com

15:27.840 --> 15:32.960
favorite list with 30 hotels or 30 places in. And by the time that you get down to choosing them,

15:32.960 --> 15:36.080
the choice has been made for you, because all of the nice ones have gone and you're now two days

15:36.080 --> 15:40.480
before you leave. Right? That's maximizing. And you're so stressed, you need the holiday just

15:40.800 --> 15:43.280
because it was awful. You didn't even enjoy the experience of it as well.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.680
Yeah. Yeah. I understand, man, like, you know,

15:45.680 --> 15:49.600
people feel like they're being left behind. They feel like life is happening to them

15:49.600 --> 15:54.000
or happening for other people. And they're not a part of it. And I get that. Like,

15:54.640 --> 15:59.520
you know, fucking, it's disquieting. Life is going on. My friends are moving on. The world

15:59.520 --> 16:05.120
is changing. And I'm all confused. But I suppose this sort of information ecosystem

16:05.760 --> 16:10.960
conversation, which you guys have had a good bit. And I've had twice over the last few weeks,

16:10.960 --> 16:17.040
first with Sam Harris, and then with Eric Weinstein. What do you make of this? Like,

16:18.240 --> 16:24.560
the heterodoxosphere has its problems. The legacy media sphere has its problems.

16:26.160 --> 16:30.560
Independent creators that just get to shitpost anonymously on Twitter and Reddit. Also,

16:30.640 --> 16:35.840
I like very unreliable. Do you think about this? Like, how all of this comes together

16:35.840 --> 16:39.840
and how you move forward through it? I see a lot of problems with new media too.

16:39.840 --> 16:43.200
I mean, and I've said this from day one in terms of what we do at Trigonometry.

16:43.200 --> 16:50.560
It's we don't have a budget to employ a bunch of people to do extensive research on things

16:50.560 --> 16:56.560
or to do fact checking for us. So we can't do certain things that the mainstream media can do

16:56.560 --> 16:59.760
and should do. The problem is the mainstream media isn't doing it either.

17:01.040 --> 17:05.680
But there's a really important role for the mainstream media. I just wish they'd play that

17:05.680 --> 17:14.400
role. But I think where I agree with Sam, even though I disagree with him on COVID and

17:15.120 --> 17:19.280
to some extent, well, to a large extent, Trump and all those things, is not everything can be

17:19.280 --> 17:23.920
fixed on a podcast. That is absolutely true. There are certain things that are a matter of

17:24.800 --> 17:29.920
research and deeper study. And it's not everything can be sorted out in three

17:29.920 --> 17:34.800
hour conversation between two podcasters. There's not how that works. And I think

17:36.240 --> 17:44.880
new media has its own problems. It over rewards charisma. It over rewards passion.

17:45.760 --> 17:55.520
It massively under rewards any attempts to cling to truth. It encourages people to go off

17:55.520 --> 18:00.800
in the pursuit of the most exciting take. And truth isn't always exciting.

18:01.840 --> 18:06.560
So I think the truth is we need a vibrant ecosystem in which all of these different

18:06.560 --> 18:11.760
pieces play their own different roles, which is why I'm in favor of maximum freedom because

18:11.760 --> 18:17.760
that's where you get everybody doing their thing. And then over time, people who want

18:18.560 --> 18:22.480
wholesome content, if you like, when it comes to facts or information or whatever,

18:22.480 --> 18:29.600
can seek it out because people aren't stupid. They will eventually see through someone being

18:29.600 --> 18:34.160
super charismatic or whatever. They'll get to a point where they go, actually, what I'd like to

18:34.160 --> 18:38.160
do is have a look at what different sources are saying about this and make up my own mind.

18:38.160 --> 18:42.320
You saw with COVID, the mainstream media really suppressed a lot of very legitimate points of

18:42.320 --> 18:48.160
view, a lot of important information. But then you get the response to that, which is to go

18:48.960 --> 18:54.320
quite far off the other end. And I've ended up somewhere, what I hope is a kind of reasonable

18:54.320 --> 18:59.360
middle ground between those two positions. There's a really great blog post by Gwinda Bogle,

18:59.360 --> 19:05.280
gowinda.substack.com, one of my favorite writers, why you are probably an NPC. And he frames out

19:05.360 --> 19:11.520
five different types of NPC. And the most obvious two, like sort of the mainstream NPC and the

19:11.520 --> 19:17.040
contrarian NPC, he makes this really great point, which is that the contrarian NPC is no deeper

19:17.040 --> 19:22.800
thinking than the mainstream NPC, they're just the inversion of it. And he uses the line of

19:24.400 --> 19:32.080
being a black sheep might make you different, but you're still a sheep. And that allure, this sort

19:32.080 --> 19:39.840
of romance of being the independent thought leader, maker, sense maker, person. I understand

19:39.840 --> 19:45.600
why it happens. But yeah, reflexive contrarianism is no more nuanced than reflexive belief of the

19:45.600 --> 19:54.240
hegemony. Yes. And I don't judge people for that because I think that's an element of my thinking.

19:55.920 --> 20:01.920
I think it's very understandable, disillusionment with the way the institutions have been captured

20:01.920 --> 20:06.240
or have been corrupted or perverted or whatever it is that's happened to them.

20:07.440 --> 20:14.320
It is natural that that would produce an equal and opposite reaction. I encourage myself and other

20:14.320 --> 20:21.760
people to go beyond that. I try as best I can. And to go, okay, well, we're reacting to this. This

20:21.760 --> 20:25.840
is how we're behaving. What's the actual truth? Because that's where we started. We started from

20:25.840 --> 20:29.360
the position that we cared about the truth. That's why we're so annoyed with the mainstream.

20:30.320 --> 20:35.440
Can we find somewhere in between those two positions that actually is an attempt to find

20:35.440 --> 20:42.400
that truth? And it's the case with everything. We've had a bunch of, we just had the co-founder

20:42.400 --> 20:48.960
of Navara Media on Trigonometry, the far left YouTube, or maybe not far left, is a kind of

20:48.960 --> 20:53.920
Corbinista supporting kind of people and others because we're trying to speak to different people

20:53.920 --> 20:59.200
from different places and really get to what the bottom of is of different issues because

20:59.200 --> 21:03.360
those perspectives are valuable too. One of the things that Sam brought up on the episode with

21:03.360 --> 21:12.000
me was his infamous Twitter clip with you. What was the experience of that particular 180 seconds

21:12.000 --> 21:19.840
catching fire like? You know, I felt terrible when that happened. Really, really terrible.

21:20.560 --> 21:26.640
Because I've never been on the end of a Twitter shitstorm to that extent,

21:27.520 --> 21:34.080
but it's not pleasant. No matter how strong-minded you are, whatever, there's a reason that

21:34.080 --> 21:38.800
Rogan always says, don't read the comments, right? Like the great man Joseph Stalin says,

21:38.800 --> 21:45.840
quantity has a quality all of its own. So there's only a certain number of negative comments you

21:45.840 --> 21:52.560
can ignore until just the volume of shit becomes overwhelming. So my primary concern actually,

21:52.560 --> 22:00.320
I don't know Sam well, but was for his well-being actually. I just worried how he would experience

22:00.320 --> 22:06.160
that more than anything. That was my concern because our approach is always about giving a

22:06.160 --> 22:11.200
guest an opportunity to reveal themselves in the best light possible. And for some people,

22:11.200 --> 22:17.520
that light shines very brightly and can burn. But that's not our intention. We never go into

22:17.520 --> 22:22.320
an interview with a desire to out somebody or expose somebody. It's not a gotcha.

22:22.320 --> 22:27.600
It's not a gotcha. So I was worried about him. And I emailed him straight away just to check

22:27.600 --> 22:33.040
up on him. And also, we didn't put that clip out. We could have done because we obviously

22:33.040 --> 22:36.880
understood that it was a controversial thing he said. And actually, most people don't know this,

22:36.880 --> 22:41.200
but that was not the most controversial thing he said in that interview, in my opinion.

22:41.200 --> 22:46.080
We talked about COVID on locals, which was the paywall section of the interview,

22:46.080 --> 22:49.040
and what he said there, I found quite... What did he say?

22:49.040 --> 22:53.120
I don't remember the wording of people who have to go and watch it, but I came away from that

22:53.120 --> 22:58.320
thinking that he's overestimating the threat. And as a result of that, I was prepared to do

22:58.320 --> 23:05.600
some pretty drastic things or demand drastic things to be done. So first and foremost,

23:05.600 --> 23:08.880
as somebody who interviews people for a living, I was concerned for him,

23:09.840 --> 23:15.920
but I also felt that what he said was wrong. I didn't agree with it.

23:21.920 --> 23:26.880
My view on it is that if you overestimate the nature of the threat, all else follows. And I

23:26.880 --> 23:33.280
think on Trump and COVID, that is where Sam, in my opinion, is... Well, that's why he's doing what

23:33.280 --> 23:40.240
he's doing and saying what he's saying, because if I thought Trump was as bad as Sam thinks,

23:40.240 --> 23:45.040
it'd be very tempting to think along the lines that Sam thinks along. And likewise with COVID,

23:45.040 --> 23:54.160
if I thought this was like Ebola that spreads, I'd also be... We should also be honest. The

23:54.160 --> 23:59.040
conversation, people were like, well, there's never, ever, ever any reason for the government

23:59.040 --> 24:05.200
to mandate vaccines. And I broadly agree with that, unless the disease is really dangerous and

24:05.200 --> 24:11.680
deadly. I said this at the beginning of COVID. Imagine that the disease had 100% mortality

24:11.680 --> 24:16.000
rate for all women, or it was 100% mortality rate for all people under the age of 10.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.160
Maybe some people would support it. Well, yeah, but I think that the... Fundamentally,

24:22.160 --> 24:27.440
it came down to a risk and reward equation. And most people considered that the risk of getting

24:27.520 --> 24:35.040
COVID was not greater than the risk of either getting the vaccine or of opening up mandated

24:35.040 --> 24:39.200
vaccines as a pathway overall, right? And it's just, where do you sit on this equation? There's

24:39.200 --> 24:44.800
lots of other things, but broadly, I think it's where do you sit on this equation. And Sam,

24:44.800 --> 24:53.120
I completely agree with him that I think COVID, as an event, was like the worst kind of vaccine that

24:53.120 --> 24:58.320
we could have given our epidemiology, our medical system, the view of vaccines overall.

24:58.320 --> 25:02.880
Vaccine skepticism at large, I bet, has gone through the fucking risk.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.080
It has. It has.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.040
Have you had a look at this?

25:05.040 --> 25:10.080
Yeah, of course it has. I know anecdotally, just speaking to people, how much that's the case,

25:10.080 --> 25:10.400
yeah.

25:10.400 --> 25:14.640
So if we are to have something that comes around the next time, and it does kill fucking all

25:14.640 --> 25:19.280
children under 10 or all women or whatever the fuck, it's got some incubation period of 28 days

25:19.280 --> 25:25.520
and a mortality of 40%, it's just a Psyop. It's another Psyop. This is Klaus Schwab doing it again.

25:25.520 --> 25:31.520
This is the WEF. And it's like, oh, God, like that's, that's, it literally would have been

25:31.520 --> 25:36.000
better if COVID hadn't happened, right? Sure enough, we can get masks out of the way more

25:36.000 --> 25:40.240
quickly. And we've got like some, some inefficiencies in the system were opened up.

25:40.960 --> 25:47.360
But if you were to look at COVID as a like operational logistical vaccine, our response

25:47.360 --> 25:53.680
to it failed us way worse than if we'd never got it at all. And we got a vaccine injury from COVID.

25:53.680 --> 25:58.800
Yes. Yes, we did. And, and I also think the one thing that is sort of inexplicably neglected

25:58.800 --> 26:05.200
in all of this is I'd really like to know where COVID came from. I'd really like to know, don't

26:05.200 --> 26:08.640
you think that's important? Don't you think we should know where it came from? Because there

26:08.640 --> 26:16.720
are some credible assertions about its origins that would suggest that we may have another pandemic

26:16.720 --> 26:23.440
soon. Is that right? I haven't seen this. Well, if this came from a lab in Wuhan,

26:24.160 --> 26:29.040
because of gain of function research, and we are not willing to be honest about that,

26:30.320 --> 26:34.400
and gain of function research continues, why wouldn't we have another pandemic?

26:34.400 --> 26:38.320
I never looked into this much. I know that Sam had Matt Ridley and somebody else,

26:38.320 --> 26:41.520
somebody else on his show. We've had Matt on to talk about this as well. Okay, cool.

26:41.520 --> 26:47.120
And the truth is, we don't know. But I'm using the kind of the smell test here because

26:47.760 --> 26:56.720
I grew up in a communist society. And what communist societies do when there is something,

26:56.720 --> 27:00.800
and all societies do this to a large extent, because people don't like to expose their own

27:00.800 --> 27:04.960
flaws. And no one wants to be like, oh, I was responsible for killing millions of people,

27:05.920 --> 27:13.520
but they will cover it up in a way that is proper. And Matt actually gave this example of

27:13.520 --> 27:18.720
there was a leak somewhere in the Soviet Union, which was a radioactive leak, I think, or maybe it

27:18.720 --> 27:24.240
was a biological, and they covered up for ages. And then when the Soviet Union collapsed, we finally

27:24.240 --> 27:30.800
found out, no, no, it was actually a leak. So if this is a product of gain of function research

27:30.800 --> 27:35.360
getting out into the real world, which is credible, that there's very credible assertions about that,

27:35.920 --> 27:42.960
the world needs to know, and this type of research needs to end. But if we are unwilling to have that

27:42.960 --> 27:46.560
conversation, honestly, and do the proper investigations, which would be difficult because

27:46.560 --> 27:50.880
the CCP wouldn't want that. And on top of that, you've got all this other bullshit about how it's

27:50.880 --> 27:57.840
racist and all of that, we've got a problem. So I think my worry with everything that's

27:57.840 --> 28:03.840
happened with COVID is not only have we not learned the lessons, I feel like, like you said,

28:03.840 --> 28:09.200
we've got a vaccine injury from the experience, and everyone is sort of stuck in their corner.

28:09.200 --> 28:12.560
And like Sam said, to you, everyone's got their own facts about it now.

28:12.560 --> 28:16.240
Correct. That's a problem.

28:18.160 --> 28:24.960
It's interesting what you said about the felt sense of being in the blast radius of Sam's

28:24.960 --> 28:32.240
online experience. I noticed it, is someone called it Sam Harris's World Embarrassment Tour,

28:32.240 --> 28:35.200
because he did my show, he did Steven's show, and he did Tom Billu's show.

28:36.640 --> 28:42.640
And I don't know, man, like, there seems to be something, it's almost like there was resentment

28:42.640 --> 28:47.200
sat on the internet, latent resentment sat on the internet waiting for Sam to fuck up.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.640
And then he did a thing, or maybe maybe it's right.

28:50.640 --> 28:54.880
I don't think it was personal. That was the reason I paused there. I don't think it was

28:54.880 --> 29:00.240
personal to Sam. I think, particularly on his Trump comments, there are a lot of people who were

29:00.240 --> 29:07.520
like, this is what we always knew the Trump haters think deep inside. And Sam was willing to vocalize

29:07.520 --> 29:14.400
it, which is, I don't care how big the transgressions are on the other side. I don't care what Hunter

29:14.400 --> 29:19.600
Biden has done. I don't care what Joe Biden has done. No matter what they do, it can never be as bad

29:19.600 --> 29:26.800
as Orange Man bad. And that's sort of how he came across. And so the people who felt gaslit this

29:26.800 --> 29:35.600
entire time about, you know, the overestimation of the threat of Trump, they were vindicated in

29:35.600 --> 29:40.720
that moment. And I think Sam just was caught in the rage of people feeling like-

29:40.720 --> 29:42.880
They're kind of like the perfect time storm. Yes.

29:42.880 --> 29:48.320
With the perfect pebble in the perfect river that directed it. Yeah, it's so interesting,

29:48.400 --> 29:54.800
man. I had this conversation with a fitness influencer called Sarah Safari in LA a couple

29:54.800 --> 29:58.720
of weeks ago. I'd be interested to get your thoughts on this. I think it's analogous to this Sam

29:58.720 --> 30:06.560
situation. A lot of people, especially right of center, say things like, you can't judge somebody

30:06.560 --> 30:15.760
on just one thing that they say. Yet, when it came to a six pack of Bud Light being sent to

30:15.760 --> 30:23.280
Dylan Mulvaney by some marketing intern somewhere deep in the annals of the Anheuser-Busch thing,

30:23.280 --> 30:28.640
or Miller Light release one video, the Miller Light thing felt a little bit more produced.

30:28.640 --> 30:32.240
It's probably gone through a few more layers. But largely, I just wondered, I thought it was

30:32.240 --> 30:39.760
interesting that the charity that a lot of people right of center ask to be given to their

30:39.760 --> 30:44.800
commentators or, you know, their champions that are canceled for taking out of context points.

30:44.800 --> 30:49.600
There was that Rosanne Bar bit with Theo Von, where she made a joke about the Jews,

30:49.600 --> 30:54.720
which was the most egregious clipping that I've ever seen from anything ever,

30:54.720 --> 31:00.320
the end of a three minute long bit. And they took the final 30 seconds and put it up as if it was

31:00.320 --> 31:07.360
representative of the whole thing. It was so fucking bad. But I did notice nobody decided to

31:07.360 --> 31:13.920
use that same idea about, hang on a second, maybe this is just one small department in one small

31:13.920 --> 31:19.920
corner of one small brand's marketing push. And they gave this person who is very unpopular on

31:19.920 --> 31:24.880
the internet, a six packet Bud Light. And before you know it, Kid Rock's got an AR15 pointed at

31:24.880 --> 31:32.640
a few cases of your drink. What do you think about? So I would separate those two out. So Sam, I think

31:33.840 --> 31:37.680
that point applies very much. And this is the angle I'm coming from. And by the way,

31:37.680 --> 31:42.080
we're about to go back to America and we'll interview Sam, the sequel. So we'll see how that

31:42.080 --> 31:45.520
works out. I'm looking forward to it. But with Sam, what I felt was,

31:46.560 --> 31:50.880
for me, I don't know if it's true of other people, but for me, Sam has a lot of credit in the bank

31:50.880 --> 31:59.200
with me. And so I felt that while I strongly disagree with what he said, and I think that was

31:59.200 --> 32:06.560
clear in the interview, he has enough credit in the bank with me that I'm willing to have a lot of

32:07.360 --> 32:12.640
understanding and a lot of grace with him. And what I would say as well is,

32:13.760 --> 32:17.360
we were having a lot of tech issues on the day that we interviewed Sam and he sat there for

32:17.360 --> 32:22.080
like a good hour while we were trying to scrambling to get the microphones to work. And he was the

32:22.080 --> 32:29.200
most decent human being that we've had on the show. You see who someone really is when the cameras

32:29.200 --> 32:32.720
aren't rolling. That seemed to me like a really important thing that other people obviously

32:32.720 --> 32:39.600
wouldn't have seen. So I have a lot of time for Sam and respect for him. I don't have the same

32:39.600 --> 32:47.040
relationship with Dylan Mulvaney. And I also think- You haven't taken a world of wisdom from

32:47.040 --> 32:53.280
Dylan Mulvaney over the last few- You'll be surprised, man. You'll be surprised. And so I think, look,

32:53.280 --> 32:59.040
Dylan Mulvaney is a symbol to many people, like Sam is a symbol to many people for different things.

32:59.040 --> 33:04.000
But I think it's a slightly different issue because, I don't know if you saw, but immediately

33:04.000 --> 33:10.080
after the Dylan Mulvaney controversy, the marketing executive who was responsible for this,

33:11.200 --> 33:15.680
there was a video of her talking to, I think, a reporter about the thinking behind

33:17.200 --> 33:20.800
what the idea there was. Because it seemed a little bit more thought out.

33:20.800 --> 33:27.280
It was thought out and her angle was our customers are shit. That was her angle.

33:27.920 --> 33:35.360
Our shit. What's a shit customer? Well, it's just these guys who've got an old-fashioned sense of

33:35.360 --> 33:40.480
humor. Do you know what I mean? We're going to educate our customers. And I'm like, you sell

33:40.480 --> 33:47.120
beer. That's not your job. Sell them the fucking beer and shut up. And look, the trans issue for

33:48.000 --> 33:52.080
reasons I actually think are quite understandable and obvious is the lightning rod of our time.

33:53.040 --> 33:57.360
So, I'm not surprised that that caused the reaction that it did. And I understand it.

33:58.240 --> 34:05.760
I do think, and I wrote a substack on this at the time, that perhaps the giving so much attention

34:05.760 --> 34:10.880
to it is what prompts these brands to go down this route. Obviously, with Dylan Mulvaney,

34:10.880 --> 34:14.080
it backfired for sure. It's a role of the dice for attention.

34:14.080 --> 34:17.280
It's a role of the dice for attention that I don't think they'd consider. And I think that

34:17.360 --> 34:22.240
executive ended up being fired. I do understand why people got as fired up about it as they did,

34:22.240 --> 34:27.280
because you're rewarding behavior that a lot of people would feel is the wrong behavior to reward

34:27.280 --> 34:34.000
in the public eye. Dylan Mulvaney. But that woman is one lady. Maybe in her interview with the

34:34.000 --> 34:37.760
reporter, she said, this went all the way up and the director, CEO, the fucking chief marketing

34:37.760 --> 34:44.240
officer or whatever was involved in this. But if it wasn't the case, I don't... If it turned out

34:44.240 --> 34:50.000
that it was one small group in the corner, as I guessed or whatever, I don't think that the

34:50.000 --> 34:55.280
internet would have given Bud Light any more leeway. I don't think they would have said,

34:55.280 --> 34:59.840
we need to separate the art and the artist here. They've made beer for three decades,

34:59.840 --> 35:05.680
for however fucking long it's been around. And maybe it's right. Maybe it shows their

35:05.680 --> 35:12.080
woke bona fides. It shows that they're the man-hating, left-leaning, blue-head cucks that they always

35:12.080 --> 35:21.360
were. But I don't know. It seems like a lot of the time people want... It's a smart idea to be able

35:21.360 --> 35:27.360
to say, Rogan has been in a few controversies over the last few years. Most people said,

35:27.360 --> 35:32.640
I have faith that you're telling me this is the tip of the iceberg. I've seen the whole iceberg.

35:33.360 --> 35:38.080
I know that there is nothing lurking deep down in the depths. Massive advantage he has is he's

35:38.080 --> 35:44.720
published like 5,000 hours of content over the last decade, which means that you have a pretty

35:46.000 --> 35:51.040
good body of evidence that sits on the other side of the scale. But you don't know much about what's

35:51.040 --> 35:54.080
going on inside of the marketing department. But I just thought it was interesting. I thought that

35:54.080 --> 35:59.760
maybe this is a time where it would be illustrative and you should be careful about transgressing

35:59.760 --> 36:05.600
rules that you want to be enforced. So if you want the don't judge somebody by one single occurrence

36:05.600 --> 36:12.560
rule to be enforced and then you don't enforce it, that, as you said before, that tit for tat game,

36:12.560 --> 36:16.400
it opens up what they did it. So this is playground mentality.

36:16.400 --> 36:20.640
I understand what you mean, but I think I disagree actually. I think the reason that people

36:21.440 --> 36:28.560
were as upset about as they are is while these are different companies, the sense is... Imagine

36:28.560 --> 36:33.520
it wasn't just Rogan who said something, but it was Chris Williamson and Trigonometry and all the

36:33.520 --> 36:39.680
other podcasters who do what we do all at one point said the same thing. And then there was yet

36:39.680 --> 36:43.360
another example of a podcaster saying it. So when you look at the Gillette

36:45.360 --> 36:50.880
Mattoxic Masculinity ad, if you look at all the other instances where corporations put pride

36:50.880 --> 36:55.120
flags, they replace their brand with pride. But not in the Middle East. Well, obviously not.

36:56.160 --> 36:59.920
Do they do it in Russia? They can't do it in Russia either. I doubt it. I doubt it. I can't imagine why.

37:00.000 --> 37:06.960
Mother Russia gay has you. Yeah, exactly. So I think what people felt was here again,

37:06.960 --> 37:12.480
we've got a corporation just absolutely taking the piss, lecturing the ordinary public,

37:12.480 --> 37:19.200
and thrusting these very niche issues onto what is a very, very like normal household

37:20.080 --> 37:24.480
beer. And you just can't escape this shit. That's what I think people feel.

37:24.480 --> 37:27.040
So it's kind of a straw that broke the camel's back. I agree.

37:27.120 --> 37:31.280
Big corporation overall. That's interesting. Because what I was doing was I was taking

37:31.280 --> 37:37.040
Bud Light as a individual instance on its own. What you're saying is this is more endemic

37:37.040 --> 37:42.560
of a broader trend among big corporations. Well, broadly speaking, if you think about what the

37:42.560 --> 37:47.440
anti-woke narrative is, the anti-woke narrative is, and I agree with very large parts of it,

37:47.440 --> 37:52.640
is that most of the major institutions, whether that be media, whether that be the civil service,

37:52.640 --> 38:00.320
whether that be the political systems, the parties, the corporations, the education system,

38:00.320 --> 38:05.760
they've all been captured or corrupted or through some other mechanism become

38:07.120 --> 38:11.760
the projectors of a certain worldview onto the public who do not share that worldview.

38:12.480 --> 38:19.440
And so when you see the toxic masculinity Gillette ad, which is like, hey, you're a man,

38:19.440 --> 38:27.920
you're a piece of shit by a razor. You're a piece of shit by a beer, et cetera.

38:28.480 --> 38:31.760
It sort of builds up to a point like, why is everyone telling me I'm a piece of shit?

38:32.880 --> 38:40.720
And it gets old. And particularly this anti-masculinity narrative that you see

38:41.360 --> 38:47.760
everywhere in movies, in advertising, in all sorts of different genres,

38:48.560 --> 38:53.600
I think it's really, really dangerous because if you think about Gillette ads in the 90s,

38:53.600 --> 38:56.800
you're a bit younger than me. I don't know if you remember them, but they were

38:56.800 --> 39:02.080
the best a man can get. And it's like some blonde hot chick in like a whatever. She's like

39:03.120 --> 39:08.640
actually that wasn't the 90s Gillette ads. The 90s Gillette ads were a bunch of men

39:09.440 --> 39:16.160
being healthy masculinity. It was a man putting his tie on as he holds his baby up before he's

39:16.160 --> 39:23.440
going to work. It was a man hugging his son on his way to his wedding. It was a man protecting his

39:23.440 --> 39:28.880
wife. It was a healthy view of men and relationships and men and women and so on.

39:30.320 --> 39:36.000
And I sort of say healthy masculinity is the 90s Gillette ads. That's what it looks like.

39:37.200 --> 39:42.400
Men being responsible, men in relationships with women being respectful, being kind, but also being

39:42.400 --> 39:48.320
strong, looking after their children, teaching younger versions of men how to be men, etc.

39:49.440 --> 39:55.600
And I understand why people, men and women are fucking tired, really, really tired of this idea

39:55.600 --> 40:01.840
that men are bad and evil. I always say my wife is completely apolitical and as a result of that

40:01.840 --> 40:09.120
extremely based. She hates this shit and I can't tell you how many women I speak to

40:09.120 --> 40:12.640
who are very, very tired of men being demonized in this way and so am I.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.360
Especially given that a lot of those women will have sons.

40:16.400 --> 40:20.400
And they want their partner to be good and healthy. They don't want them to be feeble,

40:20.400 --> 40:26.240
you know. So I actually, I understand the pushback against that I really do and I think it's necessary.

40:27.120 --> 40:33.920
Yeah, I mean, I've spent a lot of time talking about modern masculinity and the challenges that

40:33.920 --> 40:39.920
everybody is facing. What do you think, like looking at it from your perspective, growing up

40:39.920 --> 40:45.680
where you did in a communist country, coming here at 13, remember that, coming here at 13,

40:47.520 --> 40:51.040
do you think the conversation around modern masculinity from both sides of the fence is

40:51.040 --> 40:57.440
missing? Like what don't they understand about being a man in 2023 and the challenges and the

40:57.440 --> 41:02.240
way that the culture sees them? I think we should zoom out more, even more than that and ask the

41:02.240 --> 41:12.240
question, what is it that we want as a society? And I pissed both sides of the spectrum off by saying

41:12.800 --> 41:19.360
what I'm about to say, which is any ideology, and I mean any ideology, that pits men against women

41:19.360 --> 41:25.120
or women against men is toxic and damaging and dangerous and unhealthy. And that includes

41:25.120 --> 41:30.000
some forms of feminism and that includes, you know, the incel worldview and all sorts of things.

41:30.000 --> 41:36.480
So the thing that we're really missing is a reminder of the fact that I'm going to do the caveat

41:36.480 --> 41:40.640
thing we talked about. Yes, some people are not heterosexual, but for the vast majority of people,

41:40.640 --> 41:44.640
the single most meaningful thing in your life is going to be the relationship you have

41:44.640 --> 41:51.040
with your intimate partner, almost always of the opposite sex, right? And we need each other.

41:51.040 --> 41:58.240
Men and women need each other. We've been working together for millennia and anyone who tells you

41:59.040 --> 42:04.320
that your enemy is the opposite sex, that person is your enemy. That person is your enemy,

42:04.320 --> 42:09.040
that person is my enemy, and that person is our society's enemy. They are destroying or

42:09.040 --> 42:14.960
attempting to destroy the very building block of our society. That comes from both sides of

42:14.960 --> 42:26.080
the advice as well. Yes. The red pillar sphere teaches men that women are adversaries to be

42:26.080 --> 42:30.960
avoided or resources to be used and discarded. Those are the only two ways. And, you know,

42:30.960 --> 42:36.160
that's black, that's the entire man's sphere, actually. That's black pill, migthau, incels,

42:37.040 --> 42:43.840
pick up artistry, red pill, sigma male, all the way, like the full, that's the entire gamut for

42:43.840 --> 42:47.760
anyone that doesn't know the memes. That's the entire memeosphere of the fucking man's sphere.

42:47.760 --> 42:52.960
And yeah, there's no one in there, very, very few people in there who say,

42:53.280 --> 42:59.520
you're supposed to be a collaborator with the opposite sex. Most of your competition is

42:59.520 --> 43:05.360
intracexual, not intersexual. Men and women have worked together for eons. You need each other

43:05.360 --> 43:10.880
to survive, just because you've outsourced protecting and provisioning to the police

43:10.880 --> 43:17.440
department and the local supermarket. And you women have outsourced the resources

43:18.000 --> 43:25.600
and the company to your ability to gain education and employment and Netflix.

43:27.040 --> 43:31.280
Still, broadly, we're not going to be able to out-technology ourselves from the last

43:31.280 --> 43:37.680
120,000 years of humans being the way that we are. There's more to relationship than dildo,

43:37.680 --> 43:41.200
right? You're not a dildo to your partner. There's more that you bring to the table.

43:41.200 --> 43:46.320
Sometimes. Well, I'm speaking for myself, maybe I'm not sufficient in that department. But

43:46.320 --> 43:50.080
my point is, let's frame this in a positive way. What is it that we're trying to say?

43:50.080 --> 43:54.640
Well, what you're trying to say is men and women need each other. Men and women need to work together.

43:55.200 --> 44:02.400
Men and women are not enemies. The most powerful you are ever going to be is with a

44:02.400 --> 44:04.880
good woman by your side. What do you say to the people that go,

44:05.520 --> 44:12.080
this is Treadpill nonsense, like Treadcon talking point 101. This is just another NPC

44:12.080 --> 44:17.840
meme but coming from someone that's steeped in a type of relationship that men or women

44:17.840 --> 44:21.040
don't need anymore. Well, you know how Bitcoin is saying have fun staying poor?

44:21.600 --> 44:27.760
Have fun being a loser. You want to spend your life being unhappy with the opposite sex,

44:27.760 --> 44:32.240
whether you are a feminist or one of these people, go for it. I'm not going to tell you

44:32.240 --> 44:35.760
how to live your life, but I don't think it's going to lead you to a good place.

44:36.480 --> 44:43.600
You know, I have male friends who've recently found their soulmate or their partner and they

44:43.600 --> 44:51.440
blossom. They blossom the moment that it happens because we evolved to be together. We evolved

44:51.440 --> 44:58.000
to work together. We evolved to drive each other forward in really powerful ways. I wouldn't be

44:58.000 --> 45:03.040
a 10th of the man I am without my wife. Did you read the post I put up a couple of weeks ago

45:03.040 --> 45:08.800
about the fuck you family? No, I didn't see that. So fuck you money, right? You're able to become.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.080
Oh, I did see that. Yes.

45:10.080 --> 45:13.520
It's sufficiently financially independent that money, you don't need to do things you

45:13.520 --> 45:16.960
don't want to do. Fuck you freedom. You don't need to do things that you don't want to do.

45:16.960 --> 45:22.560
But then the final stage I see amongst my male friends who are, you know, 30s and 40s

45:22.560 --> 45:29.760
is the fuck you family, which is a all that I fundamentally care about in the end is me

45:29.760 --> 45:36.560
and the people that are a part of this nuclear pod and everything else can go to hell.

45:36.560 --> 45:39.600
Everything else can fall apart. Jimmy Carr was just sat in that seat.

45:39.600 --> 45:44.720
He's been through his fair share of like roller coasters and he's been with his partner

45:44.720 --> 45:48.400
like a decade and a bit like fucking forever, like maybe even 20, like 20 something years.

45:48.400 --> 45:54.800
And now he's got a son and a daughter and yeah, the coming home to know that as long as that's

45:54.800 --> 45:58.880
okay, as long as that's set and presuming that you've stacked the fuck you money with the fuck

45:58.880 --> 46:04.080
you freedom and then you add the family on top, it must be kind of similar to being indestructible.

46:04.080 --> 46:08.240
I'm still working on the fuck you money. It's still a long way to go on the fuck you money.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.040
The freedom and the family. The freedom and the family, yes.

46:12.080 --> 46:19.120
My wife and I, we met by complete accident when we were 18, married by 20 and been together

46:19.120 --> 46:25.760
ever since. And just on a very practical, like what did I get out of it level,

46:26.320 --> 46:32.560
it's been the single most beneficial source of inspiration, comfort,

46:34.080 --> 46:41.440
pick each other up when you're down, all of that. I mean, I admire people who don't have that and

46:41.440 --> 46:45.600
still do lots of stuff in the world, but it would be so much harder, so, so much harder.

46:46.720 --> 46:50.320
So again, I'm not telling other people how to live their life. I'm just saying

46:51.280 --> 46:56.560
this has been one of the most tried and tested solutions to various problems that human beings

46:56.560 --> 47:02.480
experience throughout history. We evolved to be together. And if it's a trad talking point,

47:02.480 --> 47:07.200
then maybe that's right. Maybe that some trad talking points are correct.

47:07.200 --> 47:11.040
Getting back to the masculinity conversation, why do you think it's so difficult for people to

47:11.040 --> 47:14.320
publicly advocate for the problems of men and boys?

47:16.240 --> 47:19.360
Because victimhood doesn't work for men the way it works for women.

47:19.360 --> 47:23.200
We don't feel sorry for men. And rightly so, by the way.

47:24.320 --> 47:27.600
Rightly so. I mean, biologically, men are disposable in a way that women aren't,

47:27.600 --> 47:32.640
for the obvious reasons. If you have a tribe of 10 men, 10 women, you send the women off to war,

47:32.640 --> 47:36.240
you're screwed, you send the men off to war, one comes back, you can still replenish

47:36.240 --> 47:40.160
the population. So men are disposable, always will be, much more than women.

47:40.960 --> 47:46.720
And so we don't feel sorry for men in the same way. And I'm not advocating that we feel sorry

47:46.720 --> 47:51.920
for men because I don't believe that's the solution to men's problems. The solution to

47:51.920 --> 47:54.800
men's problems is for men to be better. What does that mean?

47:55.760 --> 48:01.360
It means, you know what I mean. Look at you. This is what your entire life is spent on bettering

48:01.360 --> 48:06.800
yourself physically, emotionally, psychologically, mentally. You're obsessed with performance.

48:06.800 --> 48:11.280
You're obsessed with being better. You're obsessed with being happier, more fulfilled,

48:11.280 --> 48:13.840
all of these things. It's a pursuit of your own greatness.

48:13.920 --> 48:18.560
There are structural disadvantages that are faced by men as well, right, that very few people

48:18.560 --> 48:25.040
are willing to accept at the moment. Socioeconomically, men are falling behind, education, employment,

48:25.920 --> 48:30.000
mental health, we're currently suicide awareness, suicide prevention week in the UK.

48:31.040 --> 48:33.520
According to one of the guys I was literally talking to, half an hour ago,

48:34.240 --> 48:37.760
if you are a man, the single biggest threat to your own life is yourself.

48:38.880 --> 48:42.800
You are more likely to die by your own hands than by any other way.

48:42.800 --> 48:47.760
Are you? Am I? I've got suicide in my family, so...

48:47.760 --> 48:50.560
I know, but I don't think you are the greatest threat to you.

48:50.560 --> 48:51.360
That's true, but...

48:51.360 --> 48:53.600
And I'm not the greatest threat to me, and why is that?

48:54.160 --> 48:56.400
Not everybody has the same genetic predisposition.

48:56.960 --> 49:02.880
Sure, but you just said you do, and yet you're not the greatest threat to you. Why is that?

49:02.880 --> 49:08.000
Because you're fulfilled, because you are successful, because you're striving and achieving,

49:08.000 --> 49:11.280
because you have in life what you should have in life,

49:12.400 --> 49:15.200
the meaning and purpose and the pursuit of a goal, right?

49:15.200 --> 49:19.760
And for men, this is one of the problems with this mental health conversation.

49:19.760 --> 49:24.240
One of the reasons that men's mental health is not as good as it could be is that,

49:26.240 --> 49:30.800
A, we do live in a society which discourages them from being men,

49:30.800 --> 49:32.880
and being the way that men are supposed to be.

49:33.840 --> 49:39.600
But the other reason is that most of the personal development and psychology fields

49:39.600 --> 49:46.720
are geared towards female ways of being, and most of the ways that we treat, for example,

49:46.720 --> 49:51.040
depression, men don't need the same thing as women do when it comes to that.

49:51.040 --> 49:54.800
What men need is to feel powerful and capable, right?

49:54.800 --> 50:01.680
The reason you are not the greatest threat to you is that you feel in charge of your life,

50:02.160 --> 50:05.760
right? And that's what men need to pursue with every fiber of the being.

50:05.760 --> 50:09.440
That's what I mean when I say better. You need to struggle, and you need to fight,

50:09.440 --> 50:13.840
and you need to achieve. And then all of this other shit falls by the wayside,

50:13.840 --> 50:17.360
and it's always been like this. I'm someone who's been depressed at points in my life,

50:17.360 --> 50:21.360
and it's not because I was having a mental health problem, it's because my life was shit,

50:22.080 --> 50:28.880
and I was shit. That's why, right? So what men need is to pursue their dreams,

50:29.520 --> 50:35.040
to fight and struggle and to achieve. There was a point that you brought up earlier on about how

50:36.080 --> 50:44.960
no guidelines is liberating and terrifying altogether. And I think it's interesting to talk

50:44.960 --> 50:51.440
about how there isn't only one way to be a good man, but there aren't an unlimited number of ways

50:51.440 --> 50:58.080
either. And the problem of breaking open the expectations around men means that guidance

50:58.080 --> 51:04.320
for men and boys also largely dissipates. I had this conversation in Qatar, and the guy I was

51:04.320 --> 51:08.320
debating had this conception of the man box. And he said, if you're inside of the man box,

51:08.320 --> 51:12.800
it can be constraining because he was a member of the LGBT community,

51:12.800 --> 51:17.440
Kuwaiti American group in the Middle East and wanted to be a dancer as a boy. I imagine it's

51:17.440 --> 51:22.240
pretty fucking difficult for you to find a man box that fits that conception of you in it.

51:22.240 --> 51:22.880
Sure.

51:22.880 --> 51:25.920
But if you completely blast it open and you can be anything that you want to be,

51:26.720 --> 51:31.120
there's no guidelines at all. There's no guidance. So how fucking hard is this going to be? You've

51:31.120 --> 51:37.360
got to reinvent from first principles what it means to be a man. And I mean, you've heard this

51:37.360 --> 51:43.600
from Mary Harrington and Louise Perry, but a lot of the guidance that was given to men previously

51:43.600 --> 51:50.240
around chivalry, it is simply a difference of degree, not a difference of kind to go from

51:50.240 --> 51:53.760
men should hold the door open for women and make sure that she gets the front door safe at night

51:53.760 --> 52:00.160
to you shouldn't hit your wife. It is one single thread between those, which is women

52:00.160 --> 52:07.840
are more vulnerable and should be protected, right? Lovely conception that Mary in classic

52:07.840 --> 52:15.760
Mary style said the bourgeois rules that benefited women who had had a partner that

52:15.760 --> 52:20.080
grew up in a two-parent household that went to some highfalutin institution,

52:20.080 --> 52:25.520
was around people that had good male role models. Yeah, sure. You can break open the doors of

52:25.520 --> 52:30.160
chivalry and maybe pay for the first date or maybe you can drive yourself home or get the

52:30.160 --> 52:34.000
taxi on your own or whatever it is, because the environment that you're in is largely very different.

52:35.280 --> 52:40.240
The guy that grew up or the woman that grew up in a relationship with a man who comes from a

52:40.240 --> 52:45.760
single-parent household whose mom or dad was addicted to alcohol or drugs or there was multiple

52:45.840 --> 52:49.920
partners coming through the house, they never got taught not to beat your wife,

52:49.920 --> 52:54.960
let alone not to hold the door open. And like the rules for the, but not for me, it's like

52:54.960 --> 53:01.680
the rules for us protect everybody, not just me. And yeah, I think it's a really interesting

53:01.680 --> 53:07.600
frame to think about where the cultural changes come from. A lot of the time they come top down,

53:07.600 --> 53:11.840
but the environment can be so different that getting rid of something that seems quite innocuous

53:11.840 --> 53:16.000
up here can actually cascade down to the bottom. And the same thing goes for this tyranny of the

53:16.000 --> 53:20.320
minority again. Absolutely. There are people that will be outside of the man box and maybe we

53:20.320 --> 53:26.240
should expand it so that they can fit in it. But if you blow the doors open, where's the guidance?

53:26.240 --> 53:29.840
Like what does it mean? And this is also a consequence of luxury beliefs, which is Rob

53:29.840 --> 53:36.080
Henderson's term. I'm sure you've had him on the show. And the principle luxury belief of our time

53:36.080 --> 53:41.200
is there's no difference between men and women. That's a luxury belief. There are people who

53:41.200 --> 53:45.440
can afford to have it, but most people can't afford to have that belief. And then all else

53:45.440 --> 53:49.840
follows from this. Because if you accept that there are differences between men and women,

53:49.840 --> 53:55.520
then men and women should act differently. And that also means that it's okay for men to be men,

53:55.520 --> 54:02.080
and it's okay for women to be women. One of the things that I find really fucking weird, man,

54:02.080 --> 54:10.720
since we had our son is people will go to my wife, oh, you're just at home. And I'm like,

54:10.720 --> 54:16.240
what do you mean just at home? Are you fucking insane? She's raising our son

54:18.480 --> 54:25.600
and providing everything that we need as a family. And that you're calling that just a thing.

54:27.360 --> 54:34.320
But a lot of women will judge other women for just being at home. And actually, I think,

54:35.280 --> 54:41.120
and it doesn't apply to everybody, caveat. But for most women, the greatest gift their partner

54:41.120 --> 54:45.280
can give them is opportunity if they want to be at home with the children to do that.

54:45.280 --> 54:50.240
About 85% of women say that being a stay-at-home mum is an opportunity,

54:50.880 --> 54:54.160
an option that they aspire to have. Yes. And financially, for most people,

54:54.160 --> 55:00.320
it's very difficult right now. So it's the greatest gift. And so it's not just like men

55:00.400 --> 55:06.640
are treated badly or women, it's this whole dynamic hurts everybody. And so men and women

55:06.640 --> 55:11.040
need to work together. Dads need to be involved in their kids' lives. These are some, yeah,

55:11.040 --> 55:14.480
they look their trad points one-on-one, if that's what you want to call them. But it's what works.

55:15.040 --> 55:17.520
It's what works for the kids. It's what works for the family.

55:17.520 --> 55:23.680
Did you read the Men Are Lost Can We Find a Way Out of the Wilderness article by Christine Ember,

55:23.680 --> 55:28.640
who's in the Washington Post a couple of months ago. Was Washington Post? It's in the something.

55:28.720 --> 55:33.440
Anyway, she had this beautiful conception in it that said many young men feel that

55:33.440 --> 55:38.720
difficulties are often dismissed out of hand as whining from a patriarchy that they don't feel a

55:38.720 --> 55:45.040
part of. It seems like a lot of modern men are being made to pay for the sins and advantages

55:45.040 --> 55:49.360
of their fathers and grandfathers. And I thought that that was very interesting that

55:51.280 --> 55:54.640
kind of like in comedy, right? You're allowed to punch up, but you can't punch down.

55:55.120 --> 56:00.320
And because men have had it good for so long, you have this concern in giving them any sympathy.

56:00.320 --> 56:07.840
And even though largely pick most of the extreme negative outcomes that you want in life,

56:07.840 --> 56:12.240
apart from sexual assault, and you're going to find a man on the receiving end,

56:12.240 --> 56:17.040
whether it's homelessness, drug addiction, violent crime, mental health, being in jail,

56:17.120 --> 56:26.320
suicide, like all of it. And there was this video of a, I think it was a trans man,

56:26.880 --> 56:34.080
so a woman who became a man or looked like a man or whatever, who was absolutely horrified

56:34.720 --> 56:38.560
by the lack of attention. Oh, people cross the street when they were walking.

56:38.560 --> 56:43.120
It wasn't even just that. It's just like people ignore you. When you're a woman, you get attention.

56:43.120 --> 56:48.480
And people just ignore a guy most of the time for most intense and purposes.

56:48.480 --> 56:53.040
But those are, in my opinion, in erratical differences between the sexes,

56:53.040 --> 56:58.000
the way our biological roles are, when women are going to get more attention.

56:58.000 --> 57:02.880
I think you can definitely see, listening to your, pull yourself up by your bootstraps kind

57:02.880 --> 57:08.160
of mentality, especially when it comes to men. You can definitely see that sort of Soviet,

57:08.240 --> 57:13.200
like man be hard, man lift thing, man protect woman. That was actually money and a throw,

57:13.200 --> 57:19.760
but that's the best rush you can get now. Yeah, I think that you can see that. And this is why

57:20.480 --> 57:24.560
there's a multiplicity of opinions about how to do this. And I think it's why it's interesting

57:24.560 --> 57:29.520
that everybody can contribute in it. Give me a critique of what I'm saying. I'd love to explore

57:29.520 --> 57:34.160
that with you. There's nothing that I would disagree with massively. I think that it's

57:34.160 --> 57:38.560
important to recognize the structural disadvantages faced by men and boys at the moment, going from

57:38.560 --> 57:43.440
a brawn based to a brain based economy, when you have a disposition to be less conscientious,

57:43.440 --> 57:48.720
where you are put into an education system that doesn't suit the disposition of boys,

57:48.720 --> 57:56.720
but you're graded in the same manner as an entire sex who does boys are naturally going to fall

57:56.720 --> 58:01.360
behind. And I think that you're seeing the outcomes of this in the way that schooling

58:02.320 --> 58:09.520
and between the ages 21 and 29 women earn a grand and a bit more than men do. The gender pay gap

58:09.520 --> 58:15.360
isn't a gender pay gap, it's a mother pay gap. That's the penalization comes to mothers.

58:15.360 --> 58:19.520
I don't disagree with any of that, but the question is what's the answer? What's the solution to that?

58:19.520 --> 58:25.360
I think that creating a positive view for masculinity, creating, and this is again why

58:25.360 --> 58:30.400
Peterson and Andrew Tate as well have been so successful because they said, you can be something.

58:30.880 --> 58:35.680
You can actually step out there and wrangle the world and I believe in you and I'm proud of you

58:35.680 --> 58:41.760
and it's not wrong for you to try and want to get mastery or conquer something or achieve something,

58:41.760 --> 58:46.160
have ambition, to be able to make decisions easily and stand up well under pressure like,

58:46.160 --> 58:49.200
you know, these are all fucking good things that are not only good for you, but they're good for

58:49.200 --> 58:53.040
the world as well. I think that there needs to be a positive vision, that would be one.

58:53.760 --> 58:58.080
I think that that creates a positive feedback loop for men. I do think that there's some manning

58:58.080 --> 59:06.480
up in the most transcendent and include like Wilburian way that we can, but I also think that,

59:06.480 --> 59:09.760
you know, we need to look at structural initiatives that can help boys and men

59:10.320 --> 59:17.040
because there's no other group on the planet who, when they fall behind, are pointed out and said,

59:17.040 --> 59:21.040
this is your problem, you need to sort it out. Every other group, we would spend billions in

59:21.040 --> 59:25.680
taxpayer-funded money to create committees and charities and initiatives that actually work

59:25.680 --> 59:30.720
out what's going on and help them boots on the ground to be able to do this. I don't think,

59:31.840 --> 59:36.240
like, if a man has a problem or if a woman has a problem, we say, what can we do to fix society?

59:36.240 --> 59:40.800
If a man has a problem, we say, what can a man do to fix himself? Now, maybe that's the fundamental

59:40.800 --> 59:47.120
asymmetry at the heart of the sex difference, but in a society that has surplus resources

59:47.120 --> 59:54.640
that can help, I don't see why we wouldn't afford the, why we would make men unnecessarily swim upstream,

59:54.640 --> 01:00:04.240
if that makes sense. It does make sense. However, I think that my view is what you said earlier,

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:12.240
it's the fundamental asymmetry between the sexes. Now, it's true that all groups face various

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:18.800
structural inequalities. For example, I'm 5'9", barely. And do you play basketball? Not very

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:24.240
well, I should say, for that reason alone. Actually, if you look at the evidence,

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:31.680
heitism is one of the biggest openly available forms of discrimination that isn't condemned

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:37.840
or dealt with in any way. And one of your team is Scouse, so that must be...

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.000
He's even shorter than me, believe it or not. It must be awful.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.840
Yeah. So, what's the answer to that? My answer to that has not been to get leg extensions,

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.880
or to complain about structural heitism. Do you know that like...

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.240
Structural heitism.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.640
You joke, but if you want to play this fucking game, this is my point.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.720
I'm not laughing at that, I'm just... Structural heitism is a term that I haven't heard before.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:07.920
So, if you look at the CEOs of the top Fortune 500 companies, like 90% or something,

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:13.360
don't quote me on it, you can look it up. A very, very, very significant portion of them

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:17.520
are over six foot tall. Almost always the taller president wins, I think as well.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.360
Right. Now, is the answer to that, not in Russia, by the way.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:28.880
In Russia, you don't need that. So, do we complain about that?

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.880
Should we complain about that? Should I sit here and be like,

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:35.280
Oh, because I'm five foot nine, I don't get the... It doesn't help anything,

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:40.160
it doesn't change anything. And I remember it's so funny because I have a friend of mine,

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:45.760
he was like a Green Party voter, the most woke person that you could possibly imagine.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:50.400
And he is like five five. And I made this point to him, I said,

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:55.200
yeah, but you talk about only structural issues with this group and that group and whatever,

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.640
and you're five five, did you know about heitism or whatever? And he was like,

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:06.080
yeah, but being five five has just made me who I am. I was like, yes, yes, you are what you are.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:11.280
The world isn't going to change to you. My favorite scene in Game of Thrones,

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:15.680
have you seen Game of Thrones? Is Tyrion, when he's talking to Jon Snow and he calls him a

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.320
bastard and Jon Snow takes offense and he goes, have I offended you bastard? He goes,

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:27.680
let me give you some advice, bastard, never forget what you are. The world won't wear it like armor

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.960
and it can never be used to hurt you. That's the answer to all of this, right? And you're right

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.640
about Peterson and Tay who I think are very different figures, but nonetheless, their success

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:40.800
is based on the fact that they're telling men what men do need to hear in that respect, which is,

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:46.320
it's okay to be a man. It's okay to have drive. It's okay to have ambition. It's okay to have

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.680
aggression. It's okay to want things. It's okay to want status. It's okay to want money. It's okay

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:56.720
to want power. These are all things that are okay. They have pathological side effects when

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:01.600
not handled properly, but the drive to achieve, the drive to succeed, the drive to dominate,

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:07.120
the drive to win, these are good things and pursue them. And by the way, here's the interesting

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:14.240
bit. Those woke women, they love that shit. This is what I'm going to teach my son, right?

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.240
Whatever the society tells you about how it's wrong to be a man, at the end of the day, they're

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:23.920
all going to reward you for being a real man. This is the best time in some ways to be a real man

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:30.000
because you clean up. The competition is outing itself, is taking itself out of the picture.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.640
If you act like a man, you clean up. That's the position we're in.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:40.720
Well, there's a number of left-leaning women who are lamenting the fact that they can't find

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:49.760
a man who meets both their political preference and also will woo them appropriately on the date,

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:54.400
right? It's like, why are all of the men who do the things that I want from the other political

01:03:54.400 --> 01:04:00.160
party? I think it's like 30% or 40% of Democrats and Republicans fear that their son or daughter will

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.720
marry somebody of the opposite political belief. This tribalism that we spoke about earlier on.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.480
Speaking about toxic masculinity, as part of that debate, I did a little bit of preparation

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.440
and I found some of my favorite headlines of things that are toxic masculinity.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:20.080
Mass shootings, gang violence, climate change, the financial crisis is toxic masculinity, Brexit,

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:25.040
the election of Donald Trump, not wearing a mask, eating meat, physical fitness, fast food,

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:30.560
capitalism is toxic masculinity and communism is toxic masculinity, hip hop, smelling of

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.520
ax body spray, which is links for the British people, being stoic, risk-taking, religion,

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:42.080
but also secularism and atheism, playing board games, being interested in cars and saying hello

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:47.600
or have a nice day, all toxic masculinity. I'm saying hello is fucking atrocious, mate.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.600
Yeah, that's sort of, I think that's part of the male gaze. There was this,

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.840
I think it was a rule, was it not put on the London Underground for a while that

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:02.720
like the men's wandering eyes or something, that was a concern. But here's another thing,

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.600
right? I'd be interested to get your take on this. I brought this up with that same

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:11.200
fitness influencer a couple of weeks ago, Sarah, really good response as well.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:22.960
Internet incidents, big ones. People in the real world use the response of the Internet.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.520
They crowdsource their sense-making to how other people responded. So you'll have seen

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.280
these Jim TikToks of girls videoing themselves, working out, and sometimes there's a guy in

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:35.200
the background. And if the guy looks over a bit much, because for whatever reason, he's looking at

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.880
her, he's looking at the camera, he's looking at himself, he's doing whatever. Sometimes they make

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:44.560
a big song and dance about it. The first big one of those that happened, it could have gone either

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.760
way. You could have tossed a coin and I would have said, I don't know. The Internet may say that

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:53.360
this is reprehensible. I thought it was fine, but I could have seen the Internet going on the

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.520
other side of the fence and saying, sure, find this guy, dox him, shoot him, blah, blah, blah.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:08.240
It didn't. And that now has created a new bar of behavior, expected behavior, both for men and

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:14.400
for women. The interesting thing that it made me realize is the women who saw that TikTok,

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:18.720
had it have gone the other way and had it have been completely reprehensible and totally not

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:28.720
allowed, would then have reset their worldview expectation way more sensitive. Their radar is

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:33.600
now looking for, did that guy glance over three times or more in the space of 90 seconds? If so,

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:40.960
this equals a dangerous situation, because the Internet told me so. And it's a very sort of

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:46.880
slippery slope in one direction only. It only moves towards more sensitivity, not more robustness,

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:50.800
right? I thought that was interesting. Perception is projection.

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:59.120
What's that mean? It means that you see what you expect to see. You perceive your own projections

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:05.760
of the world. You had that fucking hyper viral moment about the scar makeup. Tell it again for

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:10.000
the people that don't know. So they did an experiment where they told a group of women that

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.040
they're going to put scarring on their faces or visual disfigurements of some kind. And then they

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:20.720
would go into an interview. And the purpose of the experiment is to work out whether the interviewer

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:26.240
is going to treat them differently because of their facial disfigurement. What they didn't tell the

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.640
women is as they were leaving to go for the interview, they touched up their makeup and

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:36.800
without showing them the facial disfigurement removed the scarring. So they went into the

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:42.400
interview thinking they're facially scarred, but they weren't. And they came back reporting massive

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:47.680
levels of discrimination, specific comments that the interviewer had made about them that they

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:54.320
perceived. So you see what you expect to see. This is why teaching people victimhood is so

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:59.440
dangerous because it makes them victims. It makes them expect certain things and then they will

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:03.680
react differently. I mean, you know, police interactions are a good example of this. If

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:08.000
you expect the police are going to treat you badly because of who you are, you're going to act in a

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.800
different way and therefore cause more problems. And I say this to somebody, you know, I was a very

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:19.760
angry young man and my wife used to piss me off so much. She would constantly say, like,

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.160
I'd get into an argument with somebody and I'd be like, that guy's a prick. He did this. And she'd

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:28.400
be like, you are creating those situations. You know that, right? And I was like, no, you're

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:32.880
forever. And it took me like a good 10 years to work out. Absolutely, I was.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:39.200
Absolutely, I was. Right? So we perceive the things that we put out into the world. And this is,

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:43.840
you know, Peterson talks about this is you can't see without hierarchy because your brain has to

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:50.160
know what to focus on. And what you focus on is a function of the filter that you project onto the

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:54.480
world. I'm focusing on you now instead of the bookshelf behind you. I could have been sitting

01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:00.560
here picking out a good book this entire time. It's been a waste. But so that's what's happening

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.320
there. But it's interesting. I mean, I said something at the time, I was like, look, these

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:09.200
creepy men need to stop staring at women in gyms. Otherwise, they're going to stop wearing lingerie

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:15.600
to go there and then everybody loses. And what I'm trying to make is that like, you know,

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.160
this is a very, I'm going to say something very controversial here, Chris, you ready?

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.400
Men are attracted to women.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:28.720
I've heard about that. Let's sit with that for a moment. I've heard about that. So, you know,

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:36.240
this idea that you're going to be barely clad, and men aren't going to notice that.

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:43.200
Sorry, that's not what our brains are for. Our brains are for looking at your ass. That's what

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:48.400
they're for. That's what they evolved for. I know it's crudely put. I learned the term for this new

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:54.400
style of gym short. It's got what's called a butt scrunch. Right. Have you seen the butt scrunch?

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.720
Yes. Right. Yeah, you're a married man. Online. Of course. Yeah, someone showed me a photo. I

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:04.240
tried to look away. Yeah, which is for the people that haven't seen it and aren't training in gyms

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:09.840
with like 20 year olds in, it's like a normal pair of shorts, training shorts for a girl,

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:15.600
like kind of tight. But then it's got kind of like a thong bit that separates the ass cheeks out,

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:22.320
which has been normalized very quick. Do you remember the first time that wearing just leggings

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:28.960
became a thing? Because I do. Because it wasn't when I went to uni. So it was after 2006. It was

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:34.400
after, maybe it happened while I was at uni. So maybe before 2010. But I remember thinking, wow,

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:40.400
that's like, that's like everything on display. That's kind of like, kind of like no pants.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.560
But then also kind of not. And then now it's like, oh, that's kind of like

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:50.880
no pants. Well, like that's kind of like just a thong, but blue or like purple or lilac.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:54.880
I feel you've dedicated a lot of time to describing this accurately, which I appreciate.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:59.520
I mean, casual ornithologist on the side. I wanted to tell you about this.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:06.240
Can I say some just on that before you move on? Because I think we sort of like,

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:12.560
we're trying to pretend things all the time, which, yes, men shouldn't be pigs.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:18.720
We can all agree on that. But in order to not be a pig, I first have to see your ass that you've

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:26.480
shoved in my face. So I see it. I am then after that, not a pig. But I see it. And it's there.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:32.960
And my brain isn't calibrated or designed or evolved. I mean, the sole purpose of our genes

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:37.440
is to reproduce, right? How is that just what I'm saying? Well, there's a female frame that's

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:44.800
placed around this conversation specifically that I don't think fully, maybe goes far as to say,

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:53.680
like sympathizes with the male brain reward system. There is an inbuilt reward system that men have

01:11:53.680 --> 01:12:00.400
for looking at sexually gratifying objects, even things like two rocks that look a bit like boobs.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.840
Right? What's the first thing a boy does when he gets a calculator?

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:10.480
Right boobs. Yep. Now, is that because of toxic masculinity or is that because

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:16.880
men evolved for millions of years throughout evolutionary history, including pre-human animals,

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:22.720
to seek the opposite sex and the drive in males is just overwhelmingly strong? Now,

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:30.160
once you have noticed that, how you act is where culture and society and civilizing men

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:35.600
comes in, right? Just because you saw someone's ass doesn't mean that you're allowed to go and

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:43.360
stare at it or grab it or whatever. But you saw it. And you're not... It's almost like it happens.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:48.480
And then you're like, okay, I need to... Fuck, yeah. Yeah. That's how it works. Now, what do

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:54.160
you want me to do about that? What are you supposed to do about that? I'm open to suggestions.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:01.360
Blinkers. Blinker men. Big... Some people would be in favor of that. The big veil that goes over the

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:06.000
top. Right. A little bit of inside baseball for people who aren't familiar with what's going on

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.640
in the podcasting world. And apparently this one's slipped by you as well. Theo Von and other

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:16.640
significant podcasters allegedly defrauded of approximately $4 million and then calls out

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:22.400
the fraudster in a video. In an unexpected turn of events, Colin Thompson, the man who was working

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:27.840
under cast media and with Theo Von, is accused of orchestrating a fraud operation that cost Theo Von's

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:33.840
podcast this past weekend and potentially other podcasts an estimated $4 million. Theo Von and

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.800
his crew detected inconsistencies in their payments, which is when trouble started, advertisers

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.360
allegedly paid Colin Thompson and cast media directly, leaving Theo with less money than

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:49.680
anticipated. And I know, from my side of the fence, that there are quite a few other podcasts

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:55.840
that were with this particular company. And it seems like this gentleman has been living a good

01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:02.080
life. Meanwhile, he's been robbing Peter to pay Paul to keep on cycling this through photos of

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:08.720
Lamborghinis and nice houses allegedly. And people aren't happy. And then Theo did a 10 minute video

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:17.520
that said, sorry, brother, you messed with the wrong rat. And this video, I think within 24 hours,

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:24.720
it hit a mill, plays photos of the guy, all the rest of it. So ructions, ructions in the podcasting

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:33.440
world. I can't wait to be able to be defrauded of $4 million. That's my dream goal to get to that

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:40.640
position. Yeah, you got to be careful, man. You got to be careful. That's why what we're building

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:44.400
trigonometry and we've got some big plans beyond just trigonometry itself is

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:50.000
bringing cool people together, but doing it under our own steam, under our own umbrella,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.360
having everything managed by us with the right values and the right team. It's really important.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.360
For the people that don't know how podcast advertising works, I handle almost all of my

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:07.040
big partners as well, directly. But a lot of the time, there'll be an agency that sits in between

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.600
you and them invoicing is kind of hard. Oh, there's an IO and did the deliverables get done and how

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.920
many numbers did that podcast hit and so on and so forth. And also, who's advertising at the moment?

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.320
Oh, there's a new company in town, maybe we can increase the costs or the price that we're charging

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.840
for this all that like it's messy and it's back and forth and whatever, whatever, especially if

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.560
you're doing lots of little deals as opposed to how I have it, which is a small number of larger

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:33.440
partners. And yeah, you have these guys that sit in between you and them classic agency model,

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:36.480
it's like a modeling agency, right? Like you have a model, there's your talent, you have

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:41.200
clients that want models and you take a bit off the top, take somewhere between 10 and 25%

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:46.640
depending on who the partner is and how big the deals are. But they hold the money, like they

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:52.640
get paid the money from the advertiser and then less they're cut, they'll pass it down to the

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:58.240
podcaster. These podcasts are largely run, I mean, you'll get your YouTube AdSense revenue,

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:02.640
which is not nothing, but fucking hell, it's not what you're making from your proper partners.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:09.520
And yeah, if I don't know, man, I mean, it's such a it's obviously you can chase these people down

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.880
for like, we're going to fucking get them for fraud, but they're just going to declare bankruptcy,

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:19.120
you're fucking moved to the Cayman Islands or whatever. So yeah, I feel this is the first

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:26.000
time that we've seen a big case like this, which is slap bang in the bullseye of the

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:29.840
of our world, right? It's the first time that this has happened. And

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:35.520
kind of surprising it hasn't happened before, but hopefully it's a formative experience that

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:42.560
that's one other thing. If you want to fuck some people over for $4 million, don't fuck people over

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.400
that have a combined reach of 20 million YouTube subscribers, you know what I mean?

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:53.440
Absolutely. No, it's not a smart move. But look, I think we're sort of living through a wild,

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:58.480
wild west of the internet. I mean, actually, the wild, wild west of the internet is over,

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:02.720
but the podcasting world, it's very new. So there's going to be a lot of this shit going on. I

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:07.920
imagine this isn't an isolated incident, actually. So yeah, I think we all got to be careful and

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:14.800
smart about how the way we build, we build things that we build. Rule Britannia. Rule Britannia.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:19.520
Rule Britannia. Come on, mate, you're actually British, unlike me. I'm trying. Rule Britannia.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.760
At last night of the proms, hijacked by activists waving EU flags.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:28.960
The site of hundreds of European Union flags. The last night of the proms have prompted an

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:34.000
outrage from Brexiteers and a call for the BBC to investigate those waving the EU flag.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.560
And the Royal Albert Hall appeared to outnumber those waving the Union flag at the event,

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.040
which is usually a patriotic display following a campaign by pro Europeans. The spectacle of

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:49.040
so many EU flags being waved as the whole belted out rule Britannia provoked disgust

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:56.560
from leading Eurosceptics. What's going on? That's from the Guardian.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:04.160
I voted to remain in the referendum and I've largely, I don't know if I've changed my view

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:09.120
of that, how I would vote, but my view of that issue has evolved so much precisely by seeing

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:15.280
these fucking morons who just completely are incapable of understanding what democracy means.

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:22.160
Democracy means that when you lose, you accept it. There's some other parallels for that particular

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:30.320
statement. When you lose, you accept it. And we've had for the last seven years, these just

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:37.200
absolute fucking lunatics running around acting like what democracy means as they always get their

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:46.560
way. And they have to insert this into everything. They've just become obsessed. And it's mind boggling

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:52.400
to me. How we're still talking about Brexit is mind boggling to me. I don't get it.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:57.440
Yeah, that's insane. It's insane. That's like a Eons old talking point now.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:02.000
I think if you are still talking about Brexit, your brain is broken.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.200
When do you think that rule gets applied to COVID?

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:16.480
I think that with COVID, I actually said this before COVID was over and in this instance,

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.840
I get things wrong all the time, but this was something that turned out to be right,

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:26.000
that people will want to forget very quickly. And they have done. Even I want to move on from

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.920
COVID. We talked about it earlier, but I don't have any great desire to talk about it. Most

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:36.800
people have moved on without learning the lessons of the thing. So I think the reason to still talk

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:43.520
about COVID is that there is a future pandemic coming and we ought to learn the lessons of this

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:50.880
one while we still can. With Brexit, it's a political decision that is not reversible unless

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:55.280
you have another referendum, which in which case you're free to campaign to have another referendum

01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:00.720
if that's what you'd like. I'm not sure showing up with EU flags at the proms is the way to achieve

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:04.720
a second referendum. I'm not a political expert, but that's my type.

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:11.520
Yeah. There is a resurgence of activism occurring at the moment, but it's always in criticism of

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:18.000
stuff. So George Mack, one of my friends, highlighted that the last time that there was a

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.840
ticker tape parade for someone that wasn't healthcare professionals in America for

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:33.360
something, not against something, was Nelson Mandela in the 90s. So you have a culture of

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:42.720
activism and of public displays of passion, however, can only be against something,

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.520
while people are only choosing to do it against something.

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:55.120
And people respond to incentives. What's that saying? Ever a great cause begins as a movement,

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:57.840
becomes a business, and eventually it degenerates into a racket.

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:04.320
And there are many people in this country who made a career out of being prominent

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:11.840
remainers. And when Brexit was over, what are you going to do? So they just carry on.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:17.680
And the people, they feed this crap like having this crap fed to them. So they just,

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:25.120
they keep going. It's a reward incentive-based system because it's a pointless conversation.

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:30.640
You're not going to change the result of the referendum. Even if you succeeded in proving

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:36.240
that Brexit was a bad idea, it's already happened. So you can argue for a second referendum or

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:41.520
another referendum if you want. But that's it, right? But talking about how shit Brexit is,

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:47.760
isn't about achieving a result beyond your own personal enrichment satisfaction status, etc.

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:53.600
And Femi, this Marina Perkus woman, there's a shit ton of these people on Twitter whose only

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:57.920
thing that they do is talk about Brexit and get thousands and thousands of views.

01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:05.200
Yeah, it makes me sad to think about people who, I know there's one incident that occurs,

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:11.840
especially like public stuff, like some catastrophe or news stuff, like people that

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:16.560
are still talking about Madeleine McCann. Do you know what I mean? Like I understand

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.000
fucking terrible situation, but there are people whose entire lives I want-

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.040
I mean, they are her parents.

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.000
I once stepped into-

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.840
Fuck's sake, Constantine.

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.720
He was there. You left an open goal out to me.

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:50.960
Yeah, you can take the comedian out of comedy. I once descended. I got hit with the fucking

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:56.160
like blast radius of these two investigative journalists. I had them on the show when

01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:59.840
the disappearance of Madeleine McCann came out on Netflix. And these were the two main people,

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:02.160
her husband and wife. And I brought them on. I thought,

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:05.040
fucking hell, like these are the two, these are the fucking experts. These are the guys that

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:07.840
Netflix went to. They must be like fucking legit, you know what I mean?

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:15.920
Brought them on. Turns out there is an ardent fucking group of people who really do not like

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:20.880
them on the internet. And I was a part of like Madeleine McCann law for a couple of weeks,

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.520
because this guy has platformed these people that we know they're a part of the,

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:29.520
like whatever the fuck cover up scheme and they didn't know the thing that went on.

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:33.200
Do you haven't read the original police report from Portugal or wherever she was from?

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:39.280
And it's, there's part of me that thinks like noble cause you're chasing after it.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:44.720
It's part of me that thinks, holy fuck, you've been captured by this one thing,

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:49.360
like this one incident has just completely controlled your life forever.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:55.520
I mean, the one thing that doesn't get set off and enough is, you know,

01:23:55.520 --> 01:24:01.440
there's a certain proportion of society that's not mentally well, massively overrepresented online,

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:06.720
right? So I think a lot of people are just, you know, it's, it's, it's an obsession of theirs or

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:11.680
whatever. You don't get to see what's driving. This is what I often think when I'm reading

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:16.800
Twitter replies, because I'm like, well, these people are like, you know, normal and right,

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:20.960
and most of them are, of course they are, but like you read something weird and then I sort of like

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:25.920
go, okay, let's imagine what sort of circumstances I would have to be sitting in to write this.

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:29.920
And then I see that picture and I go, okay, this makes sense. You know what I mean?

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:36.080
Like when I see people saying really crazy shit, I'm like, so this, I just think what we forget

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:41.200
sometimes is a lot of people are, you know, in that situation. I was telling you about this

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:46.160
preventative medicine place that I've been to in America. So it's called Fountain Life.

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:52.560
And I did a podcast with the founder forever ago and thought, that sounds fucking cool. Didn't

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:56.160
really know what preventative medicine was, although it's kind of encapsulated in the name.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:02.720
And I ended up getting like everything done. Full body MRI, CT scan, heart angiogram, brain

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:07.920
angiogram. I need to do that, man. Full works. Yes. I will 100% link you with them. One of the

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:15.280
things they do, I think it's called contrast. So you're hooked up to an IV, which is like a

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:20.800
mechanical IV. So when they press a button, just shit goes into you. So they've got you in the

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:25.760
fucking cannula or whatever it is, they've got the thing in there. And then there's this huge,

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:31.840
big wheel spinning around you unbelievably quickly. So you're kind of an MRI machine,

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:36.240
it's a little bit more open and this huge fuck off wheel that's obviously like scanning shit.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:44.560
And then this, they pump stuff from this machine into your vein. And it lights up your heart

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:51.440
it goes into the ventricles of the heart while this thing's in a very specific position

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:57.760
over you and blah, blah, blah. But the felt sense of it is heat starting in your neck

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:02.640
and going only through your torso doesn't touch any of your limbs going only through your torso

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:08.800
and finishing in like your bladder. And then it cools off around your bladder for about 20 seconds.

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:15.200
It is one of the strangest fucking experiences. It's not unpleasant, strange. I would definitely

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:19.200
wouldn't even say it's that unpleasant, to be honest. It's like, must be what feeling like a

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:24.880
dragon is like, just fucking heat moving around inside of you. So yeah, that was very interesting.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.680
I can't wait. Preventative medicine though, we were saying it before.

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:34.240
Playing a game where you try to catch up to a disease that's already happened

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:42.720
by design is a losing fight, right? Absolutely. No, I think that seems to me to be the future

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:48.160
of the direction that we're going is like looking into genetic predispositions. I know people who

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:53.680
are having procedures because they know they have a certain risk, etc. Chris Hemsworth found out on

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:59.440
that discovery documentary that he's got, I think he's got genetic predisposition to alximers.

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:04.560
So he's spending way more time with his family and he's doing other things. He adjusted his entire

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:08.880
life because I might not be able to remember this. Should learn a second language. That's protective

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:12.720
against alximers? People who speak multiple languages are much less likely to have it.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:21.360
I wonder... Which way the causal effect works, I don't know. But I imagine exercising your brain

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:24.560
in multiple ways is helpful to protecting yourself against things like that.

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:34.080
Yeah, I don't know, man. There's a multiplicity of ideas about how we're supposed to live our lives.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:41.360
And in some regards, it's amazing. The promise of free access to information 24 hours a day,

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:47.280
all of human civilization's knowledge at your fingertips, that combined with the falling

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:53.920
away of the gatekeepers and this loss of trust in institutions actually makes for really fucking

01:27:54.800 --> 01:28:01.520
disquieting journey for a lot of people. Because who do I trust? Do your own research?

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:06.800
Fuck, I've got a life to live. I've got to try and... To the family and the kids and the house

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:13.280
and the dog and the me and you want me to... I've got to go and do my own... Give me the medical

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:16.960
journal. I'm going to go through this, whether it's about health. Are carbs good? Is sugar good?

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:20.320
What about... Should we be eating more butter? What about meat? Is meat killing me or should I go

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:26.560
vegan? What about paleo? Libert King says I need more testicle and it's everything.

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:33.760
I'll see you and I'll raise you, which is what if the way for you to live your life that's optimal

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:40.560
is different to mine? My wife's very into Ayurvedic medicine and that's the entire concept of it,

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:46.000
is the different types of people that need different food, different times that they eat,

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:55.440
all sorts of different things. A lot of it is experiential. When I found out that you could

01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:02.000
just eat protein and greens, I was like, whoa, this is amazing and that's what I do. I have carbs

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.360
every now and again, but it fits how I am wired and my wife's the exact opposite.

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:15.440
She's water, wind, you're fire. Fire is the lead for me.

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:19.440
Anton. Anton's wind. Francis. Water.

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:25.200
Knew it. Bloody water. It's pretty obvious. Bloody water. Water is great if you can get it off the

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:30.880
sofa. Then it's like a bowl rolling down the hill. You can't stop it. It becomes unstoppable,

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:34.960
but it's a fucking hard... It takes a lot of fire to get water off the sofa.

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:40.960
Yeah, I was fascinated. He taught me about this in Austin when we were hanging last time. I thought

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:48.080
it was really fascinating. He taught me as well, ambient water, ambient, not refrigerated water,

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:56.000
should avoid drinking cold water too much. Yeah. That's their way. That's how they see it. I'm

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
by no means an expert, but generally, ingesting cold things is not good for you.

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:05.280
Yogurt. I love yogurts so much, though. Dairy also not great, as I understand it.

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:09.920
I mean, look, I'm not supposed to eat red meat and I mostly red meat, so you break the rules

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:15.200
sometimes. Yeah. But no, I understand what you mean, that different strokes for different folks.

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:19.120
But fucking hell, even if there can be different strokes for different folks,

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:24.160
I should be able to find a source that can... I'm this kind of a person, therefore, I can do this

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:34.800
kind of a thing. This is where the... If I was more conspiratorial, I would say that the goal of a

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:41.840
messy information landscape is not to convince you of any one narrative, but to convince you that

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:50.880
no narrative can be trusted. And it seems to me that if I was maybe even in a various domestic

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:59.520
actor wanting to make a sort of nihilistic, fatalistic, placid, not compliant, but just like

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:06.960
surrendered populace. Well, you know the rat electrification experiment, right? Where they

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:13.600
put a rat in a cell where the floor gives them an electric shock. And what they found was,

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:19.120
in psychology, this is called... What's the term? Learned helplessness? Yes. This is the

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:26.880
Learned Helplessness Experiment, where if the rat is able to end the electric shock by pressing a

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:33.360
button, then the rat will continue to do that. If the rat has no control over the electric shock,

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:39.200
it will just lie down and take it, right? So I think this... What you're talking about is a system

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:44.720
that creates learned helplessness in people, which is one of the reasons... While, of course,

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:49.040
it's super tempting to bash the mainstream media and they deserve a lot of the bashing,

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:55.120
we need a media ecosystem that's trusted. We do need politicians who can be trusted.

01:31:55.680 --> 01:32:01.760
I'm not happy with the status quo that we've got the moment where we trust no one and with good

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:06.880
reason. But the solution to that isn't to trust the mainstream. The solution is for the mainstream

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:11.520
to become trustworthy. Yeah. Do you think that's even possible? I think it's very difficult in the

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:17.120
modern environment. It's very, very difficult because I just see that us, we're running a small

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:22.560
media organization, just you are too, right? It's like, do you get everything right? Is your

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:27.840
research always on point? So it's very, very difficult. Interesting what you said earlier about

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:34.400
there are certain things that they're able to do that we're not, like fact-checking and stuff.

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:39.040
They're also, because of how they're incentivized and subsidized and the expectations,

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:48.880
like non-sexy stories, digging into weather and accounts and stuff, tell me which

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:56.080
YouTube channel is going to predict tomorrow's weather. No one, right? Not sexy enough. Too much

01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:02.240
of a cost to be able to do. And no one's saying the fucking Met Office, they're captured by the

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:06.560
woke. Although there was that thing this year, right? Where they made most of Europe look like

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:10.720
it had turned to ash because anything over 35 degrees Celsius meant that it was like

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:16.480
the blackened end of a cigarette. So maybe there is a little bit of fuckery going on.

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:22.160
Yeah. Well, there is a lot of fuckery going on. What's interesting is I find the climate issue

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:28.880
absolutely fascinating. It's genuinely fascinating to me because the historical ignorance on that

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:34.320
issue that is being deliberately spread is like mind-blowing to me. Do you know the Romans when

01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:42.160
they occupied Britain? They grew grapes on Hadron's Wall. Hadron's Wall for people listening used to

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:49.760
protect England from what is now England from what is now Scotland, right? One of the

01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:53.920
northernmost points on the British Isles. Now, if you don't know Scotland,

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:58.160
fucking cold. It's average weather in, I used to live in Edinburgh for seven years,

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:03.440
average weather in Scotland in August is like 18 degrees and rain at best, right? So

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:14.240
what we are being told about that issue is absolutely mind-blowingly, incredibly

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:18.880
unhelpful and inaccurate. Wasn't there, I think it's still around somewhere in London

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:23.600
or somewhere in the South Coast, 40 miles inland from the coast, there's ports.

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:28.880
Pevensey Castle. Yeah. Pevensey Castle, you go there and they're like, yeah, the sea used to be here.

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:37.200
I don't see this. 2000 years ago. Yeah. So this whole conversation is very, very odd to me and

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:42.880
after my Oxford speech went viral, I had a lot of invitations to go and speak to different people

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:47.440
and I was talking to this guy who works for the Indian government at a high level and he told me

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:54.960
when India became independent in 1947, average life expectancy was 37 years old in India and

01:34:54.960 --> 01:35:01.920
today it's I think 82 and that's because they burn fossil fuels. Now, are we saying to a billion

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:06.800
plus Indian people they're not allowed to do that anymore? Do you know what I mean? Like the way we

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:13.120
talk about this issue, just it's a cult. It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any logical sense.

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:16.880
The things that are being suggested that we do don't make any sense. The way we're approaching,

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:22.080
it doesn't make any sense. It's incredible to me the way this conversation is being had

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:27.280
and I'd love to understand, you know, Eric, who you just had on, he always says this, like

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:32.480
we're lying about the climate for the wrong reasons. Do you know what I mean? Like his

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:37.520
point is climate change is happening and it's a serious issue, but we're lying about the way

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:44.800
to deal with it and lots of other things around it. That's one of the most weird things to me about

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:51.360
what's happening. Like Bjorn Lomborg during that, oh my God, heat wave, we're all going to die,

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:55.760
posting stuff about, you know, like actually the number of forest fires is the lowest it's ever

01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:02.160
been and the number of hurricanes in America, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And I would love

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:06.400
to know what's going on with that shit. I would love to know. Do you need theories?

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:13.680
Well, one thing that's interested me a lot is obviously people are familiar with the concept

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:20.800
of group think, but there's another thing which is the Abilene paradox. I don't know if you're

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:26.560
familiar with it. It's basically the idea that people will often do things because they think

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:32.320
other people want them done. And you combine that with mass panic, indoctrinating kids into being

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:39.200
terrified, et cetera. And I also think human beings love a doomsday narrative. And a portion of the

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:43.120
sort of side that I've been arguing on, which is this anti-work side, is like the barbarians at

01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:48.000
the gates. Now, I genuinely think that's true. I think we are undermining the founding pillars

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:53.840
of our civilization, but there is an appeal to that worldview. And if you look back, neither of us

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:58.800
are old enough, but in the 1970s, the planet was cooling and everybody was terrified of global

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:04.480
cooling. Terrified. Terrified of the population bomb. Absolutely. Now we're terrified of the

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:09.360
depopulation. It's what we love. We love to think. And I think there's a kind of like,

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:14.400
we live in special times. Oh, like a mass solipsism. Yeah. Yeah. Like, look, look,

01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:18.720
last 2000 years, shit has happened and you had Jesus in World War II and whatever,

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:23.520
but now is the real time when shit is happening. And he knows, maybe it is happening.

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:28.960
Not on this issue, I don't think. But yeah, the idea that we are living through a climate catastrophe

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:34.160
seems highly suspect to me. Highly suspect. But also somehow very sexy. Very sexy. Now,

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:37.840
that's not to say the climate isn't changing. The climate is changing. But the question I think

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:43.360
we also ought to be asking is, is the climate changing a bad thing? Well, climate-related

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:48.320
deaths have decreased by 50 times over the last 100 years. That's Alex Epstein's he

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:52.640
been under. Yes. We haven't had him on, but yes. Oh, dude, you guys will fucking love him, right?

01:37:52.640 --> 01:38:00.560
I'm sure. He's an interesting dude. Climate-related deaths have decreased by 50 times. More people

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:05.200
are killed by cold weather than hot weather. Yes. Way, way, way more. And we know that because

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:10.240
this is the thing about the idea of pursuing net zero is it makes energy more expensive.

01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:16.880
That's the method by which you achieve this to some extent. And pensioners freeze to death

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:21.280
every winter in this country. Now, that doesn't seem like a good thing to me. I don't think

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:26.800
making energy more expensive for poor elderly people and them freezing to death on their own

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:31.280
in their homes in the winter, I don't think that's what, I don't think if we were setting out to

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:35.600
improve the world, that would be one of the ways that we'd do that. But because we're trade-off

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:40.160
denialists because we refuse to understand that actions have consequences good and bad,

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:49.680
we ignore that. And this hysteria, it's cut like and I find it very strange. I find it very strange.

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:54.480
Whatever you think about the climate issue in and of itself, our response to it is strange.

01:38:54.480 --> 01:39:00.560
People are just looking for a cause, right? Yeah. And this is why COVID was so captivating

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:07.360
on both sides because it gave us a righteous war to wage. And again, when you've got a

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:12.160
multiplicity of ways that you can go with your life, the man box has been blown open.

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.080
Nobody says that you should be this for masculinity. Maybe I don't even need to get

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:20.720
into a relationship. I can just boss bitch or like incel my way through the next however many decades

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:26.960
of my life do all this sort of stuff. Ah, here's a single vector along which I can move. I'm no

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:32.480
longer in an open field. I'm on a set of railway tracks. And yeah, you know, Peterson had the

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:38.880
ordering chaos, like paradigm out there. It feels like there's a fucking hell of a lot of chaos and

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:44.160
not a massive amount of order for people. And then the people that live in chaos land and prefer

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:48.960
that look at the people in order land as tyrants and the people in order land look at the people

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:54.240
in chaos land as fucking vigilantes. And yeah, it's, it doesn't surprise me, man. You know,

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:59.520
and this is where I said to Eric, I wish that I'd got Eric to watch the Sam episode

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:03.360
before he sat down with me because it was difficult for me to

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:09.120
portray a three hour conversation in 20 seconds. But I don't think that those guys are too far

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:13.360
apart. Like Eric saying we've lost faith in our institutions, but we can't get rid of them.

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:21.360
Independent media is both advantageous and not going away. But we fucking can't like

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:26.240
outsource our sense making to them as well. How do we live in this new world? What does success

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:30.800
look like in this regard? I thought it was fucking interesting. Look, I think we're living in a,

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:35.760
this is a metaphor that is overused, but it's sort of the invention of the printing press kind of

01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:42.320
situation. I mean, that caused two centuries of religious war. So I think what the social

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:47.040
media in particular and the internet more broadly has done, it is as broken our ability to make

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.480
sense of the world and we are all reaching for a way to do that. I think it's going to take some

01:40:52.480 --> 01:41:01.280
time and it's not going to be without consequence. And it's interesting because the argument about

01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:07.600
free speech is made very complicated by the existence of social media because there are people

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:12.560
who say they're free speech absolutists. I've never called myself that because I don't believe

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:16.800
anyone is a free speech absolutist. What's your conception on free speech? Give me the

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:22.240
framework. Well, think about this. So Elon Musk says he's a free speech absolutist. He buys Twitter

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:29.280
and then the moment people trigger his personal preferences, he shuts that particular form of

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:34.080
conversation down when it was about children or something like that, so spreading something.

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:40.080
I think he said it about Alex Jones or whatever. Anyway, my point is X, Twitter, whatever has a

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:48.960
moderation policy because it has to because the technology is so powerful. I'll give you

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:54.320
both sides of the argument, right? But the argument for moderation as in content moderation

01:41:54.960 --> 01:42:02.720
is that the technology is so powerful if you can start an assault on the Capitol or an undermining

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:07.600
of an election or whatever it is or a riot or a mass shooting or whatever. If you can start that

01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:14.400
from your phone, the technology is too powerful to be left uncontrolled. I have a lot of sympathy

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:20.880
with that argument. However, let's flip it the other way around. You live in the United States,

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:24.880
now a country for which I have a tremendous regard and the history and the formation of the country

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:29.680
is very interesting because it creates a country that is fundamentally very different to every

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:38.240
other country that's existed before. Do you get 1776 if there is Twitter and it's moderated?

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:45.040
I don't think you do because who would allow a revolution to happen? You think King George would

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:53.040
allow the spreading of misinformation, right? So we are stuck in this place where on the one hand,

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:57.520
yes, free speech is absolute and is really super important. On the other hand, actually,

01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:03.200
most people, it's very easy to be a free speech absolutist until you're in the hot seat making

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:09.280
the decision and imagine you are in the hot seat and you've got the CIA, the FBI, the heads of

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:14.640
government, whoever's your friends coming to you and going, if you don't do something, people are

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:19.600
going to get killed and they are going to get killed and that's on your conscience. It's up to you,

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:26.400
right? So it's a very, very difficult thing with the power of the technology that we have that has

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:34.400
the ability to multiply information, narratives, opinions, whatever to such an extent. So we have

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:40.560
not worked out how to handle that at all and everybody who says they have a solution to it,

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:45.280
I'd love to see them be in the hot seat for a day and then we'll see how absolutist they are about

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:51.040
free speech or how pro censorship they are because there's a flip side to the coin which is you do

01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:58.000
moderation, you're going to get accused of bias from both sides, right? So I don't have no envy

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.840
for those people. Now, I do think they've made a shit ton of mistakes. I'm just saying, I suspect

01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:07.520
I probably would have done too. Yeah, Sam had an interesting analogy where he was saying, if I

01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:16.400
spend five years building up the waking up social media platform and I want only Nazis to be allowed

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:21.520
on it, I should be allowed to only have Nazis on my social media platform or the inverse. I should

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:26.880
be allowed to kick Nazis off. It's not my job to have people I don't want on my social media platform.

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:33.040
And this comes back to the pipeline versus public service argument. I mean, there's a very strong

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:37.360
counter argument to that argument, which is the one you've just made, which is once you've captured

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:42.320
the entire market, you're a monopoly and we regulate monopolies for a reason, which is

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:50.480
to be kicked out of the local pub does not prevent you from going and having a drink in a pub. To be

01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:54.720
kicked off Twitter prevents you from communicating in that element of the public square.

01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:01.360
Has there been any, there's usually concerns around monopoly. Has there been any of that

01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:06.240
to do with online platform? Is there such a thing as too big of an online platform? Like fucking

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:14.000
Facebook and TikTok and YouTube have got like, you know, large portions of the planet as users.

01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:20.240
So this is a new category in that regard. Absolutely. The banks got so big that they

01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:26.560
needed to be split up. You take large things and make them into smaller things, right?

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:30.720
But you can't not with this because no one wants to be on the third best Twitter. Nobody wants to

01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:35.280
use the third best Google, right? You do it, you split them off and then everyone just converges

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:39.600
back on which is the biggest one. The monopoly is what makes it valuable. The fact that it's on

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:45.120
there is what makes it valuable. That's why Elon Musk bought Twitter rather than building his own

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:50.560
from scratch. Because he has the money to build his own Twitter, but you just can't drag people over

01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:56.400
enough. So the monopoly is the point. This is why it's such a tricky thing. The new category of

01:45:56.400 --> 01:46:04.320
business. That's why it's the point. With sort of frictionless gravitation

01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:13.680
toward whichever thing you want to choose to use, people will always converge on the biggest,

01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:20.080
the best, the whatever one. Whereas, yeah, if Jim Shark gets two and a half billion

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:26.320
users or to customers and they say, you need to split up into Jim and Shark, right? Or Lloyds and

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:32.960
TSB. It's not quite the same. Not everyone's going to converge on this particular one.

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.200
It's interesting. One of the analogies I used to use from my nightclub days,

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:45.600
and Twitter's kind of like this. In nightlife events, it's one of the only industries where the

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:52.880
other users of the product are the primary value of the product itself. So if you ask one of your

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:57.840
friends on your 20s, mate, how was last night? And they'll say, mate, it was amazing. So many

01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:04.160
girls in that club. No, I asked you how your night was. I didn't ask who were the other people that

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:10.160
went to the event. You don't say, why do I use an iPhone? I use an iPhone because David Beckham's

01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:14.480
got an iPhone. So I use an iPhone because the camera and the apps and the battery life and

01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:19.040
stuff like that. But nightlife was very, very interesting in that way, which is why it was

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:25.920
so mimetic. It's the same reason why, I'll open this up to you, internet, some industry secrets

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:30.880
here. Sometimes nightclubs hold cues and sometimes they make the cues thinner than they need to be.

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:34.640
So they look really long and then they take a photo because it looks like it was busy.

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:39.040
We did that. We did that all the time. We still do. It's Freshers Week next week in Newcastle.

01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:44.400
It's exactly what every single nightclub will do. But you have that same thing with regards to

01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:50.800
the social media as well. The other users of social media largely determine your experience on it,

01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:58.320
which is why Rumble is this and Truth Social is whatever, right? Is there a left-leaning?

01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.560
Well, they had one, Mastodon, didn't they? I don't know what happened, which tells you quite a lot.

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:09.120
Speaking of Mastodon, I had a guy called Ben Lam on the show. He's the CEO of this company called

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:16.080
Colossal. He is using ancient genetic information to bring the woolly mammoth back to life.

01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:22.800
Within 20 years, we will have actual woolly mammoths walking on this planet. So they found,

01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:27.200
in the Arctic, very good for preserving DNA. They found bones and all sorts of other stuff.

01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:34.000
Mammoth carcass remains. From that, they've taken, I think it's maybe 40 or 50 different because you

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.920
don't get a full DNA sequence in any one of them. Then they've brought them all together,

01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:45.840
used AI to fill in the little gaps. They're then going to implant a, whatever it's called stem cell,

01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:53.200
pluripotent stem cell, inside of the Asian elephant. So an Asian elephant will give birth

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:59.360
to a woolly mammoth. And then after a sufficiently long amount of time, they'll get placed up north.

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:04.960
And they can do all sorts of awesome stuff for helping to fertilize the Arctic. And he also

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:09.360
wants to bring back the dodo bird. The interesting reason he wanted to bring back the dodo bird was

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:16.320
the reason that the dodo bird was killed off was because of unsustainable hunting practices.

01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:22.160
So you'd think that the mammoth has a real function. The dodo bird, people laugh at it for

01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:26.080
being this stupid pigeon that couldn't fly away. But maybe it was because of the introduction of

01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:31.120
a particular predator or whatever. Yeah, it might have been ecological imbalance that was done by

01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:36.560
manmade. And his point is mammoth does a thing. It's like the farmer of the Arctic.

01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:45.280
Dodo bird is like a symbolic representation of, do you see all of the work that we had to

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:50.080
fucking go to, to bring this thing back to life? Be more careful when you introduce invasive species

01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:55.440
into different ecologies. I was like, fucking hell. And he's super fired up about it. I found

01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:58.240
him really charming. So I had a conversation with him the other day. I thought that was cool.

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:01.760
So they're going to bring back prehistoric animals. I think I remember seeing a movie about

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:09.520
that. I did say, you know, how far back can we go? Real problem, bones and teeth don't

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:13.840
hold much genetic information, which is a fucking massive shame. But we can do stuff like

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:19.440
sabertooth tigers, like particular types of sabertooth cats. I was asking him, what else

01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:25.520
did he want to bring back? There was this huge fucking sloth, this massive thing that it was

01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:30.160
like the largest marsupial. They live like on an island, but there were no predators.

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:37.360
I think so. Yeah, this gigantic fucking sloth. So there's like a laundry list of different

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:43.360
ridiculous megafauna prehistoric animal, prehistoric, like deceased. It's called de-extinction

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:49.760
extinct animals that he wants to bring back. I just thought like between that and preventative

01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:56.640
medicine and AI. What do you thought on AI? How are you feeling? Are you fucking scared

01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:01.760
that you're going to lose your job to GPT-6? I'm not scared I'm going to lose my job. No.

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:11.280
He's going to make a very significant impact on the world, but what that's going to end up looking

01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:17.600
like, I don't think anyone really knows. I think there's probably, there's a lot of fear porn about

01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:21.840
it and it may be justified or maybe I don't have any profound thoughts about it. I think

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:27.440
if you look at human history, people always use technology for basically the same things,

01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:34.480
right? Getting laid, killing each other, etc. So you'll produce amazing porn,

01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:39.360
you'll produce amazing weapons, you'll produce amazing everything and then human beings are

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:44.720
going to do what they always do, I think is the truth, right? Like I remember, I think it was

01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:48.000
Desmond Morris, I used to read a lot of his books. I don't know if you're familiar with them,

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.440
but it's one of the things he talked about. He said like when you dig up a clay tablet

01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:58.800
in Egypt from 4,000 years ago, you read it is basically the same shit that we talk about now.

01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:04.240
My son doesn't write to me or doesn't visit me or whatever. Human condition doesn't change.

01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:10.800
The tools we use to express it do. I saw a report from an ancient stone tablet

01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:17.520
from I think Egypt or ancient Rome that was a justification for why this

01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:21.520
employee hadn't turned up to work. It was a sick note that he'd written and it's this

01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:27.600
fucking elaborate story about what happened and the wife and there was a catastrophe and all

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:32.080
this stuff and yeah, you do realize that human nature is pretty fucking resilient over a long

01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:36.480
enough period of time. But coming back, here's another thing I'll say about the free speech

01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:44.720
conversation, which is that we haven't made nearly an honest enough case about free speech,

01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:50.080
which is why we're having a stupid debate about it, because no one wants to say the truth,

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:57.600
which is free speech has consequences that are bad. There are people who say

01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:03.040
are atrocious, horrific shit. There are people who will use the opportunity to be on a social

01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:10.240
platform to mobilize and do terrible things. Now, there's a big conversation now about

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:16.400
whether there's a lot of antisemitism on X and actually there is. I have to block more people

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:22.560
than I used to have to block to on Twitter, but I'm still in favor of that being allowed

01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:28.080
because I'd much rather these people were in the open and people could see what they are and they

01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:33.600
can have their conversation instead of going off into a kind of like a private place where it's just

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:37.920
them and arguments are never challenged. So I think one of the things people don't say enough

01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:44.000
about free speech is yes, it causes harm, but the harm's worth it. And we don't make that argument

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:49.360
because it's too honest and complicated and unpleasant and whatever. But the other side of

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:53.360
the argument is terrifying to me. I don't think I've told this story publicly, but last time I

01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:59.200
did Question Time. Question Time is this big political discussion program here in the UK.

01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:07.600
Before they show, they do a warm-up question that's not recorded and it's not released.

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:14.400
So it's like a warm-up. And the conversation at that time was Donald Trump had just been

01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:21.840
unbanned on Facebook and they were asking whether that was okay. And they went to me first and I

01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:26.080
was like, look, not that I'm his biggest fan, but I do think the former or sitting president of the

01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:30.800
United States should be able to speak in public. Yeah, I do. Controversial as that is. And then

01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:35.920
they went around the table and whatever. And then they went to the labor woman who was there. Very

01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:43.600
nice woman. And she without batting an eyelid went, I think we should have the safest internet in the

01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:51.520
world. And I would say for the North Korea, right, this is coming back to this point about trade

01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:56.880
off denialism. Like they think safety doesn't have a price. And the other argument is freedom

01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:00.480
doesn't have a price. And the truth is they both have a price. And what we're trying to find is

01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:07.040
the right point in the middle between those two. We want enough freedom and enough safety. And

01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:10.800
that line is somewhere in the middle. Because if you think about it, that's true of any issue.

01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:18.160
I can end murder outside of the prison system today. I can stop murder and rape. Do you want

01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:24.480
to stop murder and rape? Yes. Okay, let's lock up all men between the ages of 15 and 40 until the

01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:30.720
age out of it. You've ended murder. Right. But we don't do that. Why not? Because there's a trade

01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:35.680
off between safety and freedom. And so it's the same of everything. And it's the same with free

01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:42.080
speech. You mentioned Trump. What do you think happens in 2024? I'm not an expert on it, but

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:50.240
it looks like they're going to try and put him in prison. And it also looks like he might win.

01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:56.320
Is that possible? Yeah. Can both things happen? Can you be president from prison?

01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:00.560
Yeah. You can be president from prison. Yeah. Fuck off. You can't be president from prison.

01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:04.320
Look it up. You can be president from prison. Oh my god.

01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:07.280
And you can run from prison. More interestingly.

01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:18.480
I wonder, maybe if you are, I don't know, maybe you can't be president. You can definitely run

01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:22.640
from prison. Maybe you get elected and pardon yourself.

01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:35.440
Right. So you're okay. Let's say, let's say that there's no prison. What happens? Presuming

01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:40.240
that everybody is a... But why would we presume that? I mean, I think it's pretty clear that

01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:45.680
that's what's going to happen. Okay. The path that they're on, it looks to me like they're going

01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:51.360
after him. We just had to score Adams on the show. And this is, he said Trump needs to win

01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:57.440
to stay out of prison. That's what he thinks. And I also think that the other thing he said

01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:01.840
is like, he actually interestingly said that he thinks Trump started this because when he talked

01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:07.040
about Hillary and he said, I'm going to lock you up, they were like, oh, oh, you want to play?

01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:11.360
Let's fucking play. So I think they're going after him now and they want to put him in prison.

01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:15.360
And I think they will. But you also think that he...

01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:19.920
I think he'll win the nomination for the Republicans. Yeah.

01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:24.480
And then it's, I mean, who the fuck? Look at the last election. Who the fuck knows what's

01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:28.240
going to happen? But he can run from prison that much, I know.

01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:34.080
That's fucking insane. Vivek Ramiswani playing tennis with his top off whilst Trump's in prison

01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:39.760
as the Trump Ramiswani 2024 fucking thing. That looks like what it's going to be, right?

01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:41.600
I think that's what Vivek's going for. Yeah.

01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:43.280
He's angling for it for sure. Yeah.

01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:46.560
And who do you think gets nominated for the Democrats?

01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:50.320
Well, it's going to be Biden, isn't it? I mean, they're not going to abandon him.

01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:51.520
Unless...

01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:55.120
Well, he falls down a flight of stairs.

01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:57.760
Yeah. And in his case, it wouldn't even be a conspiracy.

01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:01.680
Who do you think's the running mate? Any idea?

01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:06.000
Nah, man. Look, let's be honest, neither of us is an act. Well, although you are now

01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:08.160
an adopted American, so you probably...

01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:10.400
An immigrant to that great nation, I know even less than you.

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:16.720
You know, I try... The more people listen to what I say, the less I try and talk about things

01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:22.000
I don't know enough about. I mean, that was a Douglas Murray thing. He was... Someone had asked him

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.400
about two years ago, had asked him why he hadn't written many articles. He writes like four,

01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:32.000
five columns a week. It's like 3,000, 4,000 words every week. And then his books and then

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.120
his speaking on top. Someone had asked him something along the lines of,

01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:40.160
why haven't you commented that much on COVID? He says, I'm going to do something which is very

01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:44.400
rare in the modern world, just to not comment on something which I know nothing about.

01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:52.480
I thought, what a fucking beautiful and outlier philosophy to have. But this is...

01:58:54.240 --> 01:59:01.200
I see this allure in myself and I have to check myself and probably fail almost all the time at

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:09.760
doing it. People start to listen to you about a thing or for a thing and you go, well,

01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:16.880
why shouldn't I comment on the Ukraine? Maybe my take on the Ukraine is

01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:24.160
useful. Maybe the world does deserve to hear what my thoughts are about immigration crossing the

01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:29.760
channel. And then you realize... I mean, I've commented on both those things, but thanks mate.

01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:35.760
But you are from the fucking region of the Ukraine and an immigrant to the UK, right?

01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:42.000
That's a lived experience. Yes, exactly. I know exactly what you mean. Your point is very,

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:47.120
very, very valid. It happens with comedians incidentally, which is why comedians political

01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:52.800
opinions generally speaking are so demented. Because you stand on stage all day making other

01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:58.000
people throw their head back and admire you or be enthralled by you or whatever. And you're like,

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:02.400
oh, maybe I do know something. Let me give you my opinion about Brexit. It's like, no,

02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:06.080
no, just be the clown. Shut the fuck up. Now, that's why I don't do comedy actually,

02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:12.000
it's one of the reasons. I was more interested in making a point than I wasn't being artificially

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:17.600
funny. You know what I mean? And I always thought of myself more as a satirist anyway,

02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:23.040
which was a different thing. But yeah, being in front of a microphone imbues you with a level

02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:28.880
of confidence that is very often inappropriate. Right. It's like permanently being on

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:36.880
oratorial Viagra. Yeah, if everyone's listening to me, I must be worth listening to. That's

02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:40.800
what happens in your brain. Regardless of what it is that I'm talking about, regardless of the

02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:47.760
format or the, yeah, I've got these live shows coming up towards the end of the year, November,

02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:57.680
mid-November. That's awesome. Thank you. What's your advice for someone who have touring comic

02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:04.160
played fucking thousands of shows across your career? What do people who haven't put that time in

02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:09.920
on stage not know about how being on stage works? This is going to sound like a shit answer. But

02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:14.720
actually, it's stage time is just like air miles on the clock. Like with pilots, you have to fly a

02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:21.840
certain number of miles. But I always think about whatever charisma, whatever else it is,

02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:28.480
is really about a comfort with yourself in front of other people. Not everyone is equally charismatic

02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:33.360
naturally, but if you're comfortable with who you are and you are able to do that while you're on

02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:40.400
stage or in front of a camera or wherever, that's the magic ingredient. It's like my favorite quote

02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:44.800
is the most important thing in show business is authenticity. If you can fake that, you can do

02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:50.720
anything. Authenticity is the key ingredient, which is why I think you've been successful. I think

02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:54.240
it's why Joe is successful. I think it's why Francis and I have had the success we've had.

02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:58.640
I almost feel, I don't know if you feel this, but the longer we go, it's like the more layers of

02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:03.600
the undone we peel off to reveal more of who we truly are. Yeah, I would say so because

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:13.840
you become more comfortable with things that you masked over before. Yes. There's uncertainty or

02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:22.960
like nerdiness, I suppose, like unnecessary rabbit holes that you want to go down. And I've never

02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:26.480
had this before. Obviously, you had this and you may have had it before comedy, I don't know.

02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.920
But I never had a single pursuit that I got to go as narrow and deep on as I have on

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:37.680
having conversations with people. And when you really, really start to fucking like drill down

02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:44.000
into, okay, what does mastery begin to look like? Which I'm not at, but I can glimpse.

02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:48.080
I'm like, okay, what does that actually look like? What does that feel like? What does it look like

02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:52.960
to make rules and then break rules and then put them back in again and do things? I'm talking

02:02:52.960 --> 02:03:01.680
to some of the guys now I want to start doing slightly more scripted bits as a part of maybe

02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:06.720
some of our ad reads as a part of maybe some of the intros. And that's like, if you actually look

02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:11.600
at that, that's a very inauthentic way of doing what is supposed to be an unbelievably authentic

02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:18.560
relatable medium. We're taking the rules from, you know, like sitcom legacy media to try and apply

02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:24.240
that to this. But I actually think that that's breaking rules that have been made. And the

02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:28.960
reason you can is because you've learned them unbelievably well, right? It's not not knowing

02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:34.080
the rules. It's disregarding them purposefully. And I'm just excited. I'm excited by all of the

02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:38.880
different options and opportunities and ways that there's cool stuff to do. And it's fucking awesome

02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:44.000
to see what you guys are doing at Trigonometry. What I know about what's coming that more people

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:49.360
will find out at some point over the next however long is fucking amazing. I think that the UK needs

02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:57.040
a nice movement, a good conglomeration headed by people who understand this industry

02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:01.680
that can be a platform for others who have amazing and interesting things to say

02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:05.840
but don't yet have the platform that they deserve to be able to say them on.

02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:10.800
Well, this is what we've been working on for a long time. And I can't quite say exactly the

02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:14.160
people and who are going to be involved other than to say they're going to be fucking awesome.

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:20.880
But we want to use the platform that we've built to make it so that Trigonometry is the

02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:26.240
main show on that platform. But there will be other shows with other people and me and Francis

02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:32.720
interspersed with other interesting, funny, hilarious, clever commentators, etc. So rather

02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:36.960
than two Trigonometry interviews a week and some raw shows and a bunch of them,

02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:43.280
we've started doing a lot of scripted stuff ourselves, comedy. I often record my sub-stack

02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:48.080
pieces now and we put them out as videos. We had a couple of really viral ones. One I did

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:51.120
about communism and fascism. You did one about Jordan Peterson recently.

02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:53.520
I did, yeah. That one's done very well, surprisingly.

02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:03.600
But also we want to start thinking about how I'm thinking about us now as a media organization.

02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:09.040
That's my frame for what we're doing. I want to bring other people through, help them make

02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:12.880
exciting content that fits with the values of what we do. There's going to be entertaining

02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:19.840
for our audience. There's going to be informative and grow it over time into a real hub for awesome

02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:25.840
content. That to me is a super exciting next phase of this because I think the media industry

02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:31.920
that we are in, the new media industry, is going to change rapidly. One of the things I see coming

02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:37.680
down the pipe quite quickly actually is consolidation. This idea that you're going to give five quid a

02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:42.640
month to your favorite 70 creators, it's not going to happen. The admin alone will kill you.

02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:47.920
People are going to want a place. Obviously our politics are very different, but the model

02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:52.160
of the daily wire is, I mean, they've executed it incredibly well. I went to go and see them.

02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:59.600
I filmed on Brett Cooper's show four, five months ago, something like that. Anna, dude, it's a

02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:08.160
machine workshop for creating content. Over there is the merch team. All they do is make

02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:14.640
fucking tumblers and designs for t-shirts. Here's an entire three by 10 row of editors all

02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:21.040
working away. Millions of meeting rooms. Here's an entire different building with everyone's

02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:27.360
studio in it. Here's a control center that allows us to edit anything at any time. I found this out.

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:35.840
I'll check that this is okay to say. Shapiro has got some special fucking landline thing,

02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:43.040
some special type of connection that runs from where he is in Florida to where the hub is in

02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:50.240
Nashville that allows them to cut his show live as if they were on site. Wow. I didn't know that.

02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:55.680
I've been in that studio a couple of times now in Florida. I've been to that one, but I've been to

02:06:55.680 --> 02:07:00.800
the pipeline where that shit ends up at. Yeah, I've been there too. It's impressive. It's very

02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:06.000
impressive what they built. Here's an interesting thing for you. Two analogous stories that I'm

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:16.240
sure that you've thought about before. The slow dilution or fucking explosion of the young Turks

02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:25.440
and Crowder Daily Why, that you're talking about congealing or bringing together.

02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:33.200
Meanwhile, a lot of the groups and affiliations and organizations, IDW, largely disbanded,

02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:39.040
that wasn't an organization though. Loose affiliation of people. Young Turks, you say the

02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:42.560
wrong thing slightly and downstream from that. Some people on the network don't agree with

02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:46.720
other things that you've said. Like fucking apparently Ben Shapiro was Crowder's first

02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:52.800
ever lawyer or some bullshit as well and then they've split off and they're big C conservative and he

02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:58.160
turns out that he bought the URL only a couple of months after they spoke, but months before he

02:07:58.160 --> 02:08:04.320
announced that he'd recorded these phone calls and all this sort of bullshit. So I think that

02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:10.240
sometimes we're too quick to try and pattern match stuff. Yeah. And it's like, oh, all organizations

02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:17.040
devolve into fractured individual groups or whatever, or all power becomes centralized

02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:22.160
into one thing. It's like maybe it's just flux. Maybe it's just tides. Maybe there's like ebbs

02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:27.520
and flows and stuff. Well, I think you're going to be able to continue to do what you do in

02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:33.280
whichever way you want to do it. I'm interested in bringing people through who are very talented,

02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:37.200
but who basically what we had to do with trigonometry and one of the reasons I haven't

02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:43.200
made there a few money is that we have a big team as you do, but we've always had a big team

02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:49.280
because we wanted to create the foundation for what we're about to do. And so Francis and I

02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:54.080
really don't make a lot of money from it because we're investing in the future. And what I want to

02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:59.600
do is we've kind of created a factory for making content. I want to bring people in who don't want

02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:05.600
to build their own factory, but who are very good as creators of making content. Yes, exactly.

02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:10.480
I mean, Carl Benjamin, load the seat. Yeah, he's done that. Spanked it. Yeah, he's doing very well.

02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:16.800
They're playing a game of monopoly around the fucking some like transport police bullshit

02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:22.720
somewhere in the country. And it's like they're slowly taking up the transport people have got

02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:28.400
the corner office and got all of the ones that I decide. Apparently one of the guys was telling me

02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:33.520
that he had some incident that had occurred at the railway line. He had some sort of stalker

02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:38.160
that followed him at the railway line. And because it happened at the train station,

02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:42.080
it's the transport police that pick up on it. And he rang them and the guy rang him back and he

02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:44.880
could hear him through the wall. He said, mate, should I just come through, open the door and

02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:48.480
was talking to the guy that was dealing with his case. It's like, fucking hell, that's interesting.

02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:54.080
But yeah, you know, this, it's cool, man, it's cool. And it feels way more cool to see it happen

02:09:54.800 --> 02:10:01.200
from grassroots, where you can watch episode one of some horse shit show.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:02.400
Thank you.

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:06.400
With terrible lighting, fucking audios all over the place. And no one knows what they're doing.

02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:07.200
Ugly host.

02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:10.560
Ugly host. Yeah, that wasn't shit. And then you work to the stage where you're like,

02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:15.920
holy fuck, like I can actually see the full trajectory of this entire thing laid out in

02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:21.360
front of me, as opposed to like, oh, fucking Rupert Murdoch and is it part of...

02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:24.000
Shady McShade face invested a million dollars.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:27.520
Nameless fucking like hooded figures drinking adrena chrome dancing around a pentagram.

02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:28.480
Yeah. Yeah.

02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:29.760
That's where we want to go.

02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:30.400
I understand.

02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:38.320
No, but closing the loop on all of that, I just think this is the next phase in terms of what

02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:43.200
we started with, which is let's stop whining about how we've been cancelled. You know, I think

02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:49.760
it's been a thing of mine, which is like, we keep saying, well, the mainstream media isn't

02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:51.840
doing this, then well, let's fucking do it.

02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:52.880
Make your own mainstream media.

02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:57.040
If you think that they're doing it wrong, let's fucking do it right. Let's do it.

02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:01.680
And let's see who wins. That's the thing for me is like, I love the competition. I love

02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:05.520
attempting to build new things, the creating the challenge of that,

02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:07.840
working out how to run a business with...

02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:09.680
Fucking immigrant mentality, man.

02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:12.000
To me, this is the most exciting thing.

02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:18.320
We were talking with good friends of mine last night about how much money you need to be happy.

02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:23.120
And I was like, and somebody said that the statistics are $70,000 a year.

02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:26.160
And maybe it's in like $2,000, but whatever.

02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:28.560
Beyond that point, it doesn't really make any difference.

02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:30.720
And I was like, well, for me, it does make a big difference.

02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:33.520
And then I thought, you know what, what if I made a million dollars a year,

02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:39.760
which is way more than I make now, but I wasn't having the experience of growing,

02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:41.680
working with my friends, all of that.

02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:43.680
And then I was like, actually, yeah, I don't think it is the money.

02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:46.640
It's the doing it. It's the creating. It's the building.

02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:53.360
This is why of all the people that I love to watch, I love Dana White interviews.

02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:54.480
I was about to bring in Dana White.

02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:57.280
He's a fucking... I just, I cannot wait to interview him.

02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:59.440
You got him in America?

02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:01.120
We are working on it.

02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:04.720
So he's basically, he's open to it, but it's just about finding the right time.

02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:06.080
As you can imagine, he's a busy guy.

02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:12.400
I fucking love that guy. I love listening to the guy.

02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:16.320
I love the way he dealt with COVID. I love everything about it.

02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:17.520
You've seen that clip.

02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:19.920
It went super viral a couple of times where he says,

02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:21.840
bet against me. Fucking bet against me.

02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:24.080
Tell me it's not going to work. I love that shit.

02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:25.920
Every single time, man, like that energy.

02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:26.880
I'm the same.

02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:29.520
I really, really enjoy it. And I think that it's missing.

02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:35.280
I think that there's not enough like conquerors in the world of personal development and business.

02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:42.160
There is from a performative level, but I don't look at Dana White and think that he's saying

02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:44.560
what he thinks sounds cool for people to hear.

02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:50.400
I think he's speaking his philosophy forward, which is one of,

02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:52.480
stand on this hill, come and have a swing.

02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:57.840
Yes. Yes. And I've always been like incredibly competitive.

02:12:57.840 --> 02:12:59.200
I thrive on it. I love it.

02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:05.360
One of the things, by the way, you've told me, I will say this, is you were the first British

02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:12.800
podcaster who was in our space who, when I've met, has been from a, who had a growth mindset,

02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:18.000
which is why I said when we first started, how unsurprised I am by the amazing success you're

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:22.480
having because you've always had that attitude and it shows. And that's why you're successful.

02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:28.800
And that's why you're friends with everyone in the industry. I just, I think it's a natural

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:33.040
concept. Your success is not an accident is what I'm saying at all. It's a natural consequence

02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:36.880
of the person that you are. And Dana White inspires me in the way that I'm inspired by

02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:41.520
your success as well, because it's just like, this is a guy who got his friends together.

02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:46.240
They bought this thing for $2 million or whatever it was. At some point,

02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:51.520
there were 30 something million in the hole and they just kept going until they crushed it.

02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:54.160
And there's a lot of other things that they do very well. I think as a,

02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:58.720
if you just switch on the fights on a Saturday night, you wouldn't see, but

02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:06.640
they make it entertainment. They make reality TV shows out of the content. The way they present

02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:10.800
the fights is like very well organized and it's beautifully shot.

02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:16.480
Think about it this way. Think about what, if you watch boxing now, how fucking pedestrian,

02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:23.200
unnecessarily ceremonial it seems. This fucking guy carries out a mace and Doth's cap and fucking

02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:29.280
a list of 50 people who've donated money to this thing. We are here in the presence of the

02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:35.440
by the Nevada state and the this and this and this. You're like, no, fucking just tell me the fight.

02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:39.440
Yeah. Show me the fight. Give me the tail of the tape. Get me amped up. Let them punch each other.

02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:45.280
And also what they've done incredibly well is with boxing, no one gives a shit about anyone on

02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:51.680
the undercard or the card. They just care about the headline fight. UFC, the headline fight may

02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:56.640
very often isn't the best fight that actually happens on the night. They'll be the best fighters

02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:59.520
on the night, but it won't be the best fight. So you fight of the night will, I would guess,

02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:03.520
only maybe 30% of the time go to the main car. Yeah. And it's just they, and therefore they

02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:06.480
are building up other talent. This is what we're talking about with what we're doing. They're

02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:11.920
building up talent who are not the headline fighters, but you're seeing them from an early

02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:15.280
start and you follow them and you're like, oh, this person is getting better and they're fighting

02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:20.880
this guy and whatever. So just from a business perspective, I am so inspired by that attitude.

02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:26.640
I think it's, I love it. And I think we're probably going down very different paths in

02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:31.920
that you've gone to America where that attitude is prevalent. I'd love to take it. Every time I go

02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:36.880
to America, I come away buzzing, but I'd love to bring more of that shit here. That's how I see

02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:40.880
our future. Sat next to the opposite Stephen Bartlett yesterday and said,

02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:44.720
if I could gift the UK anything, it would be enthusiasm. Yeah. You know, there's just so

02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:49.680
much enthusiasm in America. And there's fucking, there's also stuff that they're super shit at.

02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:54.480
That's trade-off. Yeah. That's trade-off. I wish I could take some of Britain to America as well.

02:15:54.480 --> 02:16:00.480
I went to LA, man. I spent three days in LA, sort of in the kind of like entertainment world,

02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:08.000
you know, doing Bill Maher and stuff around that. That is a different fucking world, my friend.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:18.160
How so? Oh, it's, I'm not a religious person, not yet anyway. But when I was there, I was like,

02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:26.160
I can see why people need religion. This place needs God. It fucking does. I'm serious, man.

02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:33.600
The way people think about other people, if all you have is your success, if your value derives

02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:39.760
from your status and success, whoa, that gets dark quickly. Whoa, that gets dark quickly.

02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:44.800
Finding disposable objects everywhere. Oh, man, it's fucking, the way people see each other,

02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:49.120
there's no humanity there. It's just like you're an object for what I'm trying to get to.

02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:56.640
And that was eye-opening to me. Hollywood makes sense to me now. The movies they put

02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:02.080
out make sense to me now that I've been there. A lot of it makes sense in a way that I'd never

02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:08.080
realized. See, I never realized how powerful Hollywood is at shaping our idea of what reality

02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:14.560
is because the movies, like, we in Britain, we think we understand America, right? Because we

02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:20.320
watch their content. That's why. But that's not the reality of America at all. And the more you

02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:25.600
travel around America, the more you are confronted by that fact. You know, the more time I spend in

02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:34.560
the US, it makes me more right-wing in the American conception of, like, states' rights.

02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:43.840
Because I'm going, I had a flight from Salt Lake City to LA. And you get on the plane in Salt Lake

02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:49.120
City and you arrive in LA, which is not that far. And you go, these are different fucking,

02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:54.640
these aren't just different countries. These are different worlds, different religion, different

02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:59.600
people, different way of thinking, different philosophy, different culture, different everything.

02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:06.320
And the values are completely different. You know, America's an incredible place.

02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:13.440
I'm really enthused by it. And there's also trade-offs to some of the way that people are

02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:18.080
there as well. So it's actually, you know, we talked about masculinity and femininity. And I think

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:24.960
I actually know what people mean when they talk about toxic masculinity and toxic femininity,

02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:30.480
which is you need both. You want to be thinking about it as raising both bars at the same time.

02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:36.080
If you want to be a good leader, for example, right, you need to be strong and you need to be

02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:40.080
able to say the thing that people don't want to hear and make yourself say the thing that you

02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:43.920
don't want to say because you don't want to upset people. And on that hand, you also need empathy

02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:48.320
and compassion too. Like you want to be raising both up. And I see that in the same way as culturally.

02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:52.320
I want to take the best of the US stuff and the best of the British stuff and meld it together

02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:54.560
into something really exciting.

02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:57.440
Truck, yeah. Constantine Kiss and ladies and gentlemen, where should people go? They want

02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:01.440
to keep up to date with your stuff. The best place to find my work is Trigonometry, of course,

02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:06.480
on YouTube and the podcast. And I write on Substack, which has got really blown up at the moment.

02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:10.320
I'm excited about that as well. And Twitter at Constantine Kiss and everywhere.

02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:12.720
Hell yeah. Constantine, I appreciate you. I appreciate you, my brother.

02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:17.520
Thank you very much for tuning in. If you enjoyed that episode with Constantine,

02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:23.120
