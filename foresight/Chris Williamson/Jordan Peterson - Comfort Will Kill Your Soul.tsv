0	4960	Talking about the individual one of the things that I see holding people back is comfort
4960	9240	So it's easy to get life to a stage where it's not that bad
9680	13760	But it's not that good either at least when you have a full-on breakdown
13760	17000	There's only one way to go right you're only going to go up from there
17000	21560	But I think it's possible to wallow for years in a just about passable life
21880	26600	Right sedated by comfort and I see this temptation in myself as well to give up the good for the great
26920	31400	What would you say to people who are trying to escape this curse of mediocrity?
34120	37320	Well, if you're satisfied with it in some fundamental sense
37320	39520	I mean, there's there's something to be said
39520	44360	I suppose for walling off of private space for yourself if you can maintain it and
45000	48000	Detaching yourself to some degree from the troubles of the world and
48560	54600	Maintaining your own little private garden the problem with that is the snakes tend to seep in from the outside, right?
54600	59040	It's it's pretty difficult to wall yourself off in any real sense from the concerns of the world
59560	62640	So it isn't clear to me that that's a viable solution
62840	68480	It also means that you might justify to yourself lack of civic engagement, you know, I shouldn't go to church
68480	75380	I shouldn't take part in the political process because it's all so corrupt. I should hide myself from all the annoying
76240	81680	Noise that's generated constantly on the media front and I have some sympathy for that viewpoint, but I
82240	86160	Don't believe it's really possible because you can't have
87000	89800	You can't have a walled garden independent of
90560	96200	Independently of the health of the broader society. It's just not possible. Maybe you can have it for a very short period of time
96200	98040	but so
98040	105400	But if you're if you're comfortable with what you have and it's Jen it's genuine comfort and I think okay, but generally
105400	109160	It's not I think for the most part. It's it's people that have become sedated, you know
109160	114240	They've forgotten their dreams, but they've forgotten that they've forgotten them pink Floyd's comfortably numb is about this, right?
114240	119800	They've become comfortably numb. I think most people said I have this friend and this this story really hit me
119960	121960	So during the pandemic
122560	123520	Running a podcast
123520	128880	I was able to have the thing that I feel I'm good at my artistic
129200	134240	Pursuit and outlet that was available for me to continue. It was actually increased because I didn't have other stuff to do
134640	136640	now have a friend that's a barber and
136800	140720	He got a job at a supermarket barbers shut down for a long period of time
140720	143960	He got to job at a supermarket stacking shelves overnight and I asked him I was like man
143960	148440	How are you? How are you finding the new job? This is a big a big change. He's like, do you know what it is?
148440	149400	I
149400	152600	Actually don't mind the work and mind the people that I work with mm-hmm
152880	160000	But man, I miss being good at something right, right, right. Well, dude that hit me. Yeah, so hard, right
160000	166520	I missed being good at something. Yeah. Yeah, well people need the opportunity to be good at something
166760	171880	It so then you might ask yourself. Well, what's the best antidote to the discomfort of life?
171880	175760	and you might say well, it's comfort and I
178120	181960	Suppose that's what you act out when you swaddle a baby
183000	187640	but a better antidote is something like adventure to excellence and
189800	194560	That's far better antidote to suffering than the mere absence of suffering
195360	196600	So
196600	201720	Not to say that the mere absence of suffering. That's not nothing, you know, stepping out of that
202440	207880	Sedation from comforts difficult that especially if you've become routine eyes to it. Yeah, well, that's the difficult
208560	214480	Difficulty of maturity. You know the Freudians said very wisely that the good mother necessarily fails
215120	216480	What's that mean?
216480	223000	I mean, she stops providing the comfort that insulates people against the need for adventure. I heard you say recently that
223960	230480	A mother's ability to let her child go out into the world knowing that they're still vulnerable and that it's now
230640	235320	Down to them and the world still look after them. That's one of the bravest things that it's the female crucifixion
235760	239360	So and that's exemplified best in well the best
240760	245720	Portrayal of that I've seen is Michelangelo's pieta. You know, it's it's a statue of Mary
246680	255440	And she has Christ's body on her as an adult on her lap and he's broken and destroyed and you know, she's displaying that
257840	259240	That's
259240	266320	That's the bravery of a mother to allow that to happen, but not only that to to facilitate it
267360	274360	Facilitate it. So what about we go kid? Where you go? Where you go? Well, why it's dangerous out there. It's like, yeah, no kidding
276600	281920	It's more dangerous here if you stay with me by a lot
283520	287560	So you might lose your body out there in the world, but if you stay here you lose your soul
291320	295520	How do you see that as an individual let's say that there isn't the mother there that's pushing you along
297280	300640	Well, you know, one of the things young Carl Jung
300880	307440	Was very interested in the edible complex and that's basically that overprotective maternal and
308960	310960	he
310960	314800	He criticized Freud or presuming that it was
315480	317480	Really something the mother did
317800	324280	He says it's more relational than that first of all it would be something the father would allow to happen assuming there was a father around
324280	328640	So let's not forget about the paternal contribution to allowing that to occur
329640	332640	Because in some sense, it's the father's role to
333200	336640	Serve as the antithesis of that maternal over protection
336640	342760	So a woman is extremely bonded with her infant say between zero and nine months and the infant is utterly helpless
342760	348920	And so complete compassion and the provision of comfort is the only job that matters
348920	353440	And that's really the case and then the woman has to switch gears to some degree
353440	357040	The mother has to switch gears as the child starts to become more
357520	366060	More mobile fundamentally and more independent. She has to let go of the infant, which is a real grieving process and
366760	370800	She has to start to facilitate this movement towards independence
370800	378240	But that's a hard shift and so partly the role of the father in that is to be an advocate for the child's independence and to
379080	384600	Comfort the mother to let her know that that degree of security provision is no longer necessary, but also to
385200	388120	Act as an advocate for the child's outgoing
390120	394840	Outgoing desire and so so it's the edible situation is not only the mother
394840	400760	It's also say the weak father, but then it's also the child so you can imagine because you don't
401920	403920	believe that these
404640	406640	negotiated agreements were
406640	409960	We're relational so, you know, you're six
410680	412680	You're in grade one
413160	415160	Maybe you're feeling a little ill
415400	417000	Maybe you're not
417000	424280	Maybe you're playing with being a little ill and maybe you're playing with exaggerating how ill you are and your mom comes downstairs and says
425000	430160	You know, you've got a test today at school. Maybe you haven't quite prepared for it. Maybe, you know, you should have and
430760	434240	She says but you know, you you seem to have a tummy ache
435080	439120	Maybe you're too sick to go to school and the kid thinks
440360	442360	Maybe I could just stay home and
442680	448760	You know, mom could tuck me in and I wouldn't have to take that test and I wouldn't have to confront the world and he says, yeah
449560	451720	Yeah, mom my stomach really hurts and
452320	454320	and away we go and
454960	460480	The child has made a choice and you think well, that's and that's a catastrophic choice
460480	464600	And you think well children shouldn't be held accountable for choices. They make at that age. It's like
467160	470480	That child soon gonna be an adult that's going to make very similar decisions
470760	478880	The the choice has consequences and to be held accountable for that is to recognize purely that the choice has consequences
478880	482000	And that it is a choice now, you know, you could say well
483040	488600	95% of the blame is to be put on the mother and maybe that's an overestimate. I think it probably is but
489520	494240	the child could say mom you don't have to worry about me. I'm gonna get up and go do this and
496720	498720	That's choice and
499280	501280	That's the right choice
501320	504760	so these are always chicken and egg problems obviously but
505560	512880	That that fleshes out the complexity of the situation, you know, if you're if you're being enticed down a pathological road
513800	516320	You can accept or reject the invitation now
516320	524280	Some people are better at enticing and some people enforce it more harshly and you know, there's all sorts of individual variability in situations like this, but
525280	530320	Just because you're offered debate doesn't necessarily mean that you have to take it
531160	536000	So and I'm not a determinist. I do believe that people have free will whatever that means
537200	540680	That's a murky subject and it gets complicated the more you look at it
540680	547200	But whatever it's still a good shorthand way of describing the fact that we seem to be
547960	552000	Cursed with responsibility for our own destiny at least to some degree
