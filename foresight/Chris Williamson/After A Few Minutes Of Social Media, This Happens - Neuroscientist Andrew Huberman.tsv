0	3280	Just how triggering are our phones when it comes to dopamine?
3280	10400	Okay, great question. We often hear that social media getting dopamine hit after dopamine hit.
11200	16400	When we first get on social media for the first time or after a long period of time,
16400	20800	the amount of dopamine that's released we think is quite substantial. It's novel. Remember,
20800	26240	dopamine is about novelty, surprise, and the sense that we are on some exciting track.
26240	30800	That's what dopamine is really about. It puts us into states of readiness, anticipation, looking,
30800	36080	seeking, et cetera, almost always for things outside the confines of our skin. Just to contrast it,
36080	41200	maybe for a bit more of a future discussion, serotonin does the opposite. When there's a lot
41200	46080	of serotonin in our brain and body, typically it makes us feel satisfied, sated, and more quiescent,
46080	51280	comfortable with what we have in our own immediate sphere and within us. The comfort of a good meal,
51280	55840	the food you have, dopamine is about go, go, go. If you look at somebody who's high on cocaine or
55840	60880	methamphetamine, it's all about pursuit because that's a very dopaminergic drug. You look at somebody
60880	65360	who's taken a drug, and I'm not suggesting people do this, but it really ramps up serotonin. Let's
65360	71040	say a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, prozaxol, et cetera. The side effects of those drugs,
71040	76960	if the dosages are too high, lack of appetite, lack of libido, kind of meh about life,
77680	81120	then so they'll adjust the dose down. That's because those are serotonergic drugs.
81760	89040	So in general, when we are in pursuit of things, dopamine is quite high.
90640	93680	Now you have to remind me your question because I've set up the dopamine serotonin
93680	100720	parallel cell phones. Yes, forgive me. So the thing about cell phones is when you first get on
100720	106720	there and you have no Wi-Fi on the flight or something and you land, it can actually be quite
106720	111840	stimulating. You get a lot of dopamine. Oh, there's this. Oh, there's that. But very quickly,
111840	117200	when you're scrolling on social media, you're no longer getting the novelty, but you're continuing
117200	121200	to do it and you almost don't know why you're doing it. At that point, it shifts over to something
121200	126400	that's a bit more like an obsessive compulsive behavior, where we can define an obsessive
126400	130560	compulsive behavior where the obsession leads to a compulsion. So the obsession is a thought,
130560	136000	the compulsion is a behavior, but the acting out of the compulsion merely serves to increase
136000	141120	the obsession. This is very different than being obsessed with food or obsessed with cleanliness.
141120	145840	There's no payoff. Right, exactly. There's no anxiety relief by carrying out the compulsion.
145840	152720	With OCD behaviors, like scrolling social media, the dopamine quickly wanes and then you find that
152720	156480	you're just sort of, and we've all been there, you're scrolling and like, why am I doing this?
156480	161440	This isn't that interesting. This isn't that interesting. Now, the algorithms for social
161440	165760	media are very clever. And I don't want to demonize it. I provide a lot of, a lot of my life
165760	173760	has spent on social media now, but the algorithms that they've incorporated function on the most
173760	180880	powerful way to keep people doing a behavior or an animal for that matter is intermittent random
180880	184640	reward, a random intermittent reward that you don't know when you're going to hit the jackpot.
184640	188480	So you're scrolling, you're scrolling, and then you see something. Typically, it's very high,
188480	193040	what in nerd speak, we'd say signal to noise. So if you're reading some interesting things,
193040	198880	this came out in the news, this came out, and then it's all of a sudden a riot or a person that
198880	205280	is jumping, is based jumping off a building or for people that are scrolling, looking at bodies
205280	209520	or something like that, live bodies that hopefully people aren't looking at dead bodies. But look,
209520	215200	if something's very tragic, then that has this gravitational pull. And then what happens is you
215200	220320	start getting the system working for that next dopamine hit that you don't know when it's going
220320	226080	to come. It's just like gambling. So I look at social media as initially being very dopaminergic,
226080	230960	driving rewards, surprise and excitement, but very quickly transitioning to something more like OCD
231680	237040	and the kinds of behaviors where it looks, if we were to look at ourselves through the lens of an
237040	242640	experiment like we would an animal experiment, we think that animal is sick. If you saw an animal
242640	246640	digging in the corner, looking, looking, looking, looking for a bone, the dog is looking, looking,
246800	251760	looking, looking, looking, looking, looking, looking, you'd think that's really sad. That's us.
