1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
You say that you're useless to the world if you're not competing and you need enemies to drive you. Why?

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,160
I think most people who say they don't have enemies

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,480
They probably don't want to tell others they have the enemy or they don't want to disclose it

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,960
They're great poker players. I don't know a single person that doesn't have an enemy

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,680
Everybody does

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,880
We're we're very good at concealing our

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,680
Our insecurities our emotions our fears our wildest desires our

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,480
Enemies or comments that rub us the wrong way that wire us

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,600
We are very good actors

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,240
Incredible actors right now if you have a long time of talking to somebody and you kind of watch them closely

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,960
And the more they talk and then eventually you're gonna find some leaks. You're like, oh, I just found one right there

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,880
Boom, I found one contradiction right there. Boom. I found one and they're okay interesting. We all have a little bit of that

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,280
But I do think that when you study the people that do something very big. I'm not talking about small

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm talking really really big. We're talking about some interesting people today

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,000
You and I have somebody we both respect a lot Robert Green his books

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,640
I'm sure you love his books. I love his books 33 strategies of war. I couldn't put it down for two years straight. I

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
listen to that book every day

18
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,680
in my car

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,880
Straight every day. It was on repeat for two years straight. Why though?

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,240
because I innocently got into sales and

21
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,200
I had a good time in sales and business after I got out of the military and

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,480
I wanted to be a bodybuilder and then I realized I'm six four

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,480
It's not gonna work for bodybuilding to win Mistro Olympia because everybody's five eight five nine five ten

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,560
Maybe five a lemon Ronnie Coleman, but the six four days are behind us even Luc Ferigno didn't win at that height

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,680
Arnold did and then when I got into sales and

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,080
Everybody was a fan then I started competing still a little bit of fan

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,080
But when I started the insurance company and then I started growing market share really

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,120
Then a lot of those people that were fans then started

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,920
Undermining and I said got it. This is how it works. You can't be this naive. You can't be this innocent

30
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,880
Competitions out there if you want to kind of go out there and take market share from others

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,080
You want to get bigger?

32
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,320
You can't expect for people to sit there and like everything you're doing. That's what I realized

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,680
You got to choose your enemies wisely people want you to do well. They just don't want you to do better than that. Yes

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,640
Yes

35
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,240
Yeah, it's interesting. There's this story of Churchill and

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,720
He's showing a young MP around the House of Lords in the UK

37
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,640
This is before World War two you can imagine that they're wandering through these dusty hallways over there's the

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,760
Toilets and over there's where we have a cigar and blah blah blah

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,640
Anyway, they go into the chamber they go into the House of Lords, right?

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,800
The difference actually the distance between the two front benches is the same distance as a longsword held out at arm's length

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,200
From both sides. She's a kind of a funny vestige of evidently what they were worried about in the Middle Ages

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,840
And they've just continued to update but they've never changed the distance of the front benches

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,200
Anyway, but this young guy who's probably full of testosterone and you know, he's finally he's here with Winston Churchill

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,560
He go in and this young MP starts just

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,360
Sticulating at the other side he keeps referring to them as the enemy

46
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,000
Churchill turns to me says that's the opposition dear boy. The enemy's behind you

47
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,920
And I love that story and the reason that I love that story is that it often reminds us that

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
symbolically we believe

49
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,760
That the biggest obstacle we have to overcome is out there and many times the call is coming from inside of our own house

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,720
I think that the worst enemy that many people have is the voice that's inside of their own head

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,680
Now this voice has probably maybe come from the outside world, but we've now internalized it

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,800
You know, we have become our own worst enemy in some regards. Yeah, and by the way, that's one of the enemies

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,920
That's one of the enemies and there isn't one is the famous

54
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,880
Matthew McConaughey speech that he's given. Hey one guy asked me who's the greatest actor in the world and he says hey

55
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,640
You know, I'll tell you and then you're like I want to meet the 35 year old version of me

56
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,000
And hey when I get to 35, you know, I want to make it 45

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,440
It's always looking forward to what that next better version of you is going to be but

58
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,000
At the end of the day, even Alexander one of his famous quotes is quotes is I have met the enemy it is I right and

59
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,560
Although that is one element of an enemy. That's great. We need that

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,800
Michael had it Brady had it Kobe had it, but

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,680
There's a there's a crazy

62
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Psychologically you can call it, you know psycho competitor that

63
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,200
They're constantly in the search of recruiting their next enemy

64
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,840
It's it's like, you know, life is boring if I don't have my next target, you know

65
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,720
I'm almost you know bad for myself if I don't have the next target the next enemy

66
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,600
And if I choose it the right way, then I'm able to bring out a side of me. I've never seen before

67
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,840
What's the function of an enemy? What is the function of an enemy? What is the function of?

68
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,800
Fallen in love. Why do you need to fall in love? Why do you need to have a wife?

69
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,420
It's pleasurable. It's fulfilling. But what does it do to you though when you're in love?

70
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,280
You know, you know how they say when when a person is in love and they go and test their brains

71
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,960
And it's like somebody that's on drugs. You've seen this before you probably read this before, right? Okay

72
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,320
so

73
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
But what's the risk of love?

74
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,920
Heartbreak

75
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,360
Losing years of maybe you love the wrong person. Maybe they don't love you in return as much as you love them

76
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,840
Maybe you're gonna give more than they're gonna give you maybe a betrayal

77
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,680
Maybe it's an act. Maybe it's just good for the season

78
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,280
Maybe they're gonna change your minds if they really find out what you're out

79
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:56,320
There's a lot of risk to love, but why do we love? You know, it's a very unique relationship that risk is exhilarating

80
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,360
It's exciting, you know

81
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,960
Maintaining it. It's a lot of work. It's not easy. It's why nowadays most people don't want to get married nowadays

82
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,520
There's a movement of I don't want to get involved to getting married. I don't want to have kids. It's too risky

83
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,040
I want to live for myself. I don't want to have the

84
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,400
Responsibilities I don't want to be heartbroken. Okay, great. I think you know one time a friend of mine and I

85
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,000
Arash we're in Italy and I rented this place in

86
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,960
Tuscan, Italy, this is like 10 years ago and we're staying there and Arash and I when we're together

87
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,720
We like to debate and we debate about anything. It doesn't matter what the topic is anything, okay?

88
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,160
He's like the Middle Eastern Bradley Cooper too good looking of a guy one of those guys kind of like you're a good-looking guy

89
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,800
He's a good-looking guy

90
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,920
So we have a three-hour drive to Cinque Terre, okay?

91
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a beautiful place you go to and it's a long drive to go to it. You know what we're debating about love

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Here's what the question was

93
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,560
Can you love somebody you know define love for me says love is a feeling it's emotion

94
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,640
It's this it's a great. I said say you're in jail

95
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Your wife is somewhere else

96
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,960
How does she know you love her? How do you show her love is love a verb is love a feeling is love a noun?

97
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
What happened this conversation right and

98
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,560
Then

99
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,360
You realize the risk of loving is worth it. I can't imagine live in life without having that love

100
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,360
It introduces you to a person you've not met before man a great enemy does that as well a

101
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,920
Formidable enemy is gonna introduce you to a person you've not seen before by the way could be ugly could be scary could be oh

102
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,160
My god, who is this person? Why are you acting like this? Why are you thinking like this?

103
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,520
So most of us when we come almost like that the movie venom

104
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,040
It's one of my son's favorite movie, right? The venom comes inside

105
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,080
There's a there's an ugly side to it if you lose control of it, right?

106
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,240
And you become reckless then you hurt people around you then you're actually not good for yourself. You're destroying your own life

107
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,080
That's why the key word is what?

108
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,920
Choose your enemies

109
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Wisely, it's not it's not have an enemy. It's choose your enemies wisely

110
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,200
If I choose the right enemy and then I have this relationship with this enemy

111
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,680
Sometime it's a one-month enemy. It could be a one-week enemy could be a one-day enemy could be a lifelong enemy because it's yourself

112
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,680
because that's a permanent enemy and

113
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
Just like a love affair

114
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,640
There is an affair with this enemy. It's actually a beautiful thing. I

115
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,440
Love the idea of it bringing out a side of you that you didn't know

116
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,120
Bringing out a person inside of you that you want to wear existed. So I think there's a

117
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,560
There's definitely a function to get that into you come on crack it in there's definitely a function to

118
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,040
To people looking to be well balanced. Oh

119
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Yeah

120
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,320
Delicious good wow fantastic. That's what I want to hear six months of taste testing

121
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,200
So I'm glad that it takes time to fly to Liverpool to do that

122
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
There is definitely a

123
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
culture on the internet of

124
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
people wanting to

125
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
ameliorate all of their difficult and

126
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,480
Uncomfortable emotions to transmute them into something closer to equanimity, right?

127
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:18,360
balance peace sanity and I've said this a lot and I think that I'm quite averse to

128
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,920
Conflict by nature. That's the way that I tend to operate. I often just bow out opt for peace

129
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,680
and

130
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
then

131
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,680
Two things changed

132
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,440
First off, I realized that I am leaving an awful lot of motivation on the table

133
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,180
Okay by not utilizing a very specific very potent kind of fuel

134
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,360
Because I was aware that over a long enough time span. I think it can be toxic

135
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,600
I think that if you're fueled by hate and distaste and fear and scarcity for long enough

136
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,200
It becomes something that damages you more than it helps you win

137
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,160
But it's unbelievably potent especially in times of war

138
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:06,640
The second thing that happened was I became a little bit more of a target for people's ire and distaste and that meant that the

139
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,680
underdog

140
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,040
Loving support that everybody has for the person that's on the come up

141
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,920
Dissolved a little bit and started to evaporate because people don't mind you doing well

142
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,840
They just don't want you to do better than them. You know when you're on the way up

143
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,560
Everyone roots for you because you remind them of their dreams and when you're at the top

144
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,120
Everyone tries to tear you down because you remind them of what they gave up on

145
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,280
So those two things changed now had a great conversation with Alex Homozy that really drove this home to me

146
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,640
Said use what you have and a lot of people have more pain than they do pleasure

147
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,280
Don't use it for too long 10 15 20 years like that's how you end up having a breakdown or some sort of dependency or addiction or vice

148
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,680
But it's potent so use it and I think that

149
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,720
The inside of enemies can bring out a side of you that you are not aware you want to where even existed is

150
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,400
Kind of like alchemy

151
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,200
Right. It's turning something that is both toxic and useless into something which is golden and your choice

152
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,560
Yes, and by the way your eyes. Okay. I'm looking at your eyes right now

153
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,000
Your eyes don't tell me a guy that is just doing this

154
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,960
To just have fun. Okay

155
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,480
Your eyes have a lot of fire in them. Okay, a lot of fire in them

156
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:28,240
You your eyes tell a story of maybe you have a crazy side a side inside of you

157
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,480
Okay, a side that maybe you keep inside. Okay, we're very few people maybe see

158
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,000
But that's why you're doing as well as you're doing. I walk into this place. I do a lot of podcasts

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,160
I walk into this place you chose a walk in. I'm like Sam. Where are we? He says honestly, I don't know

160
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,680
But I think we're at the right place

161
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,960
We walk in and I see why you do what you do and the amount of time and resources and your team putting into

162
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,520
Hands selecting a different set. We don't do that. So what does that tell me? You're maniacal your detail oriented

163
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,200
You got it. You're moving up right now on the podcast across the board competing with everybody

164
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,400
You have a vision. Maybe some of it. We know probably all of it. We don't know

165
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,040
Okay, some of it's kept even the smiles telling the story right now. You're a perfect example of this, right?

166
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,940
If you and I sit down we get the benefit I don't know if you read Elon Musk's recent book or not Walter

167
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,760
I think so not yet

168
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,680
No, I've heard from every single person that's even glanced at the blurb that you need to read it

169
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,320
You need to read it. You're gonna flip out. You're gonna love it. You'll appreciate it for a guy. That's wired like you

170
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,320
We get to judge Elon from the outside. Okay, why would somebody?

171
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,520
You sell a company for 180 million dollars. You take a hundred million dollars. You put it in a

172
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,840
Solar, whatever you take 70 and Tesla you put 10 in, you know, another company vice versa, whatever the structure

173
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,640
No, you put 100 million in SpaceX 70 million in in Tesla and 10 million you put it in solar

174
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,120
Then you're a billionaire

175
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,920
Then you want to do what you want to go to the next thing then boring company then you got Twitter

176
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,760
What for and you read a story in the book about his father on how his father was are you kidding me?

177
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,720
Oh, I mean if you some of the biggest people that we read about we watch movies about it's one of their two parents

178
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,600
That did something to them. I'm Tom Brady a

179
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
month ago we haven't met the event and

180
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,200
The the formula I see with a lot of people that do something biggest three things one at one point in their lives

181
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:34,440
They experience unconditional love because you need it. It's fuel. You have to have it even if it's just from one person

182
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:42,160
Okay, unconditional love means what you screwed up you went to jail. You got a DUI you got kicked out of school

183
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
You got expelled

184
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,200
Everybody ousted you and said you're a nobody you're not gonna mount to anything you're a loser. You're this but that mother

185
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
They're always said honey. I love you

186
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,480
You can do anything to lose this one person's love

187
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,400
One person. It's all you need. You don't need 50 of them. Just one unconditional love number two is

188
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,040
you need somebody who

189
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
brought

190
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,440
Unbelievable pain in your life that you loved

191
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,480
This is a person you and I loved that they destroyed our heart

192
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,640
We couldn't do anything to gain love from this person nothing

193
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,320
Perform talent. We love them go above and beyond give them money buy him gifts

194
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,480
Give them incredible experiences become buff have a six-pack drive a Ferrari have a Lambo own a penthouse

195
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,480
Have a yacht be best friends with the best athletes with billionaires no matter what you do

196
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,160
This person brought you so much pain. You can never win this person over

197
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,880
It is a battle your entire life try to win this person over you're never going to do it

198
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,440
It's not going to happen. Well, you need that person as well

199
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,240
You know what the last one is obviously choosing your enemies wisely you take a person that has those three combination by the way

200
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,760
very rarely

201
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,840
Will they ever tell you the entire reason very rarely will they?

202
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,840
Fully disclose everything some of them will take it to their grave with them

203
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,720
We will never know about it, but for someone to have the kind of a fire that goes

204
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,000
Yours beyond 99% of people would have stopped. What's the reason for it?

205
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,480
What else do you need? How many more accolades? How many more tens of millions of dollars?

206
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,280
How many more cars? How many more houses? How many more top charts on podcasts number one this? What's the reason for it?

207
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You know, it's a

208
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,000
Again, we're not talking about everybody most people will listen to this whole concept of choose your enemies wisely and they'll say

209
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,680
That's hate. What a miserable life. What are this? What are that?

210
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,120
No, most people chose the wrong enemies the enemies they've chosen is about being entitled is about being victims about feeling sorry for themselves

211
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:56,560
And it's destroyed them the stolen stolen years away from their lives. So yeah, the way you're describing what you're saying

212
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:02,040
You know, you'll typically see a pattern with those three things of people

213
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:09,440
Who do something big they experience those three and unfortunately the reason why I like Musk's book is when you read it

214
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,120
You see the pattern with all three unconditional love mom and Kimball his brother

215
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,920
unconditional pain father

216
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
choosing his enemies wisely

217
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,880
industry

218
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,240
Conditional, you know guys who are like this is the way we do with NASA, you know governmental agencies

219
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,780
Censorship, you know establishment. He's just recruiting new enemies for himself every day

220
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:37,880
It's like bored. He needs more enemies and more enemies, but guess who's talking about him around the world

221
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
Everybody is in a hundred years from now

222
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,760
Our kids our grandkids will look back and say and who was this Elon Musk guy

223
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,280
Unfortunately, we're not gonna be around to talk about who it was how we viewed him

224
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,840
But they're gonna be watching plenty of documentaries and movies about a guy like that because he chose his enemies wisely

225
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Feels to me. I've got in my mind the image of Pac-Man, you know, when he is able to eat the ghost

226
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,080
Yeah, and the ghosts

227
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,400
since were previously a threat to him now become fuel and

228
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
that to me is I

229
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:15,440
learned the three most common traits of elite performers and it was

230
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,520
Acrippling sense of insufficiency a superiority complex and maniacal focus

231
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,800
Yeah, and I think that those three things map on to what you were just talking about there

232
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:32,000
Have you read this book? I've read the first half just so you know that part from your podcast is in the book. You're in the book

233
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:39,080
Did you know this or no? No, you're in your podcast is in the book. Those three things you just talked about. Okay. It's in the book

234
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,160
Hell, yeah. Yeah, so those three things, right? I'm scared that I'm not enough

235
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,480
I believe that I can do more. Yep. I have the impulse control to be able to keep me focused and keep me moving forward

236
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,920
What would you say to the people that say

237
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,280
What you're describing sounds an awful lot like a competitor. Okay. Yeah, what's the difference between a competitor and an enemy?

238
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Yeah, it's not a competitor because to me

239
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,240
So so in the last 20 some years

240
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,840
I have worked my tail off to figure out a way of writing a business plan that I can teach others how to write a business plan

241
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,840
So when you go buy books on business plans

242
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,240
It's all boring

243
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,440
Technical it's for a fortune 500 company or somebody that wants to go raise capital and it's so

244
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,440
Complex and dense you will not think about a business planning book

245
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,160
That you're gonna walk away and here's how I can write a business plan

246
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,520
That's simple that I can look at it over and over and over again. Great. I'm good to go, right?

247
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:38,120
There isn't something like that out there. This is supposed to be a business planning book that turned into an

248
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,720
enemy's book so when I'm talking to the

249
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,040
CEO the the publisher of a portfolio, okay

250
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,360
Adrienne and we're going back and forth we had five hour zooms five one hour zooms

251
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,640
Just on the title and in many cases we would sit there for 15 minutes. No one's talking

252
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,960
We wanted what who won what he wanted what?

253
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,920
So they wanted to figure out a title that was a straight-up title like you know

254
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,880
Well, how to think and grow rich, you know, how to just stay very much of a business

255
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,320
Exactly something like that and then eventually I'm selling Adrienne. I'm simple. That's not what it is

256
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:23,840
This is much deeper than that. It has to do with enemies and eventually on the fifth time of choosing the title

257
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,040
Guess who finally says the title the book has to be choose your enemies wisely Adrienne does from portfolio

258
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
And I said that's the one it was a battle of attrition

259
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,360
It was a battle of attrition a few hundred of them, right?

260
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,800
But but it's an interesting concept when you're saying

261
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,160
Competition to me the 12 building blocks that I talked about in this book, you know

262
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,640
We have different categories because one side of the building block has to do with emotion

263
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,400
The other side of the building block has to do with logic and you read this when you were going through the book

264
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,640
So on the emotion side, you know, it's gonna move us. So for example, I mean, what skill says do I need to learn?

265
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,960
Well, I need to learn how to do podcasts how to ask questions

266
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:08,400
How to do research you told a Churchill story at the beginning with the sword the size and hey, your enemies are not ahead of you

267
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,280
They're behind you. Okay, you have to go find that story. That's content, right? Okay, so that means you're constantly reading

268
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,920
Why is this guy so good at what he does with content? Okay? He's very detailed. Look at the lighting

269
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Look how he doesn't look at his sets. He's intentional. He's not winging it

270
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,600
Everything you're doing for the most part 95% of it can be replicated by somebody else

271
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,800
But the 5% is your wit is your interest is the curiosity. I did a person has it or they don't have it, right?

272
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:39,760
Okay, so yes, I can pick up those skills, but do I have your willpower? That's emotional. Yes, I can go study the competition

273
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,720
Let me see the top podcast is out there what they're doing. What is the category for politics for business for sports for comedy?

274
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,680
Yes, but enemies bigger study competition all you want

275
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,160
But enemies a complete different criteria that you're talking about you can have all the money in the world

276
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,800
Fantastic, that's finances. That's money. You can go raise money. There's plenty of companies that raise money

277
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,200
Quibi a few years ago raised two point thirty billion dollars from who all the big money guys

278
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,960
Everybody gave Quibi money. What happened to them Katzenberg make Whitman. Everybody behind it went out of business in

279
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
1962

280
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,360
1962 was a super-saving center

281
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,520
Which is the year where Target came out Walmart came out and Costco came out all the same year

282
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,280
1962 okay in

283
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
1962 when these companies came out

284
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:30,960
Kmart goes and raises a ton of money five years later Kmart has 250 locations

285
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,200
Walmart has nine locations five years later

286
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:43,320
Kmart on a leader's bulletin within five years guess who's winning Kmart's dominating all logical all numbers

287
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,520
Spreadsheet etc. Etc. You couldn't tell me the founder of Kmart

288
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,600
Who he is if I ask who's the founder came you're not gonna say mr. Kmart, right?

289
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,440
That doesn't make any sense. What happened to Kmart a few years ago Kmart goes out of business. They're no longer round

290
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,040
You know how many employees Walmart has around the world 2.3 2.5 million employees

291
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,480
Do you know Walton Sam Walton when the best books you can ever read is made in America?

292
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,960
It's 200 pages. He walks to you through how he built

293
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,200
Walmart

294
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,720
Do you know what his poorest kid is worth today poorest kid is worth 50 billion dollars today?

295
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,120
He's got four of them. Can you imagine these guys at Thanksgiving? They're like hey Johnny

296
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,320
I noticed man. You're only at 50 billion. Do I need to you know go for me?

297
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,840
You know raise some money for you now. It's gonna be all right. You're gonna make it through

298
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,880
What's the moral of the story the moral the story is

299
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,760
One is logic the other one is emotion emotion brings out a different set if it can be controlled madness

300
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,920
Controlled emotion

slash modern wisdom

318
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,000
Let's start competition. You're saying competitors, right? Okay. No problem

319
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
um

320
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,920
In high school

321
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,880
You can see somebody who was the best basketball player super competitive at that level say they're tall

322
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,600
They're six six. They can jump 40 inches. They have a quick first, you know step

323
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,240
They're very athletic in every way. They're the best athlete in the county even in the state for that position. No problem

324
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,240
They go to college

325
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,520
They can compete

326
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,240
But maybe they're coming off the bench average in 7.2 points a game three rebounds to assist no problem

327
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,480
They may not make it to the NBA

328
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,280
But let's just say he makes it to the NBA plays a year two years

329
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,560
Then he goes to Puerto Rico

330
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,840
Then he goes to spain then he plays in turkey then he plays in china 10 years later never comes back to the NBA

331
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,200
He's out now. He's an assistant coach in Puerto Rico or somewhere else

332
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,480
Then there's a guy that comes to the NBA. He competes. He's talented. He shows into work

333
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,360
He's a very good worker stable guy doesn't do the drugs doesn't do the alcohol

334
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,000
He hooks up with a lot of girls, but he doesn't get in the way

335
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,440
He doesn't respect, you know, he respects his teammates wives. He doesn't do anything

336
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,560
He plays for 15 years makes 200 million dollars good for him

337
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Then you have the cycle competitor

338
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,120
who

339
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,240
Counts

340
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,360
The 55 kids ahead of him that were chosen as the best high school basketball player

341
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,360
And he's ranked number 56 and one by one by one

342
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,280
He targets every one of them until he takes him out his name is Kobe Bryant

343
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Then you have michael jordan in 1984

344
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,800
Where the number one draft pick is a kimalajuan fair good a lot good selection for the rockets number two is sambui

345
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,080
I think portland picks him up or seattle picks him up. Number three is michael jordan. You pick me number three

346
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
Yes, what happens to michael?

347
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,440
these guys

348
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,760
michael was never the highest paid guy in the NBA the only time michael was the highest paid guy in the NBA was

349
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
The last year made 33 30 million dollars

350
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,800
Scotty pippin made more money in the NBA than michael jordan ever made

351
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,600
michael jordan today's worth 30 billion dollars scottie pippin is not what's the difference

352
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,400
It's a very different mindset scottie's a competitor, but he's not at michael's level by the way

353
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,120
It's very easy to criticize a guy like you who wants to compete

354
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,640
And maybe internally you don't want to compete you want to dominate

355
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,760
Maybe internally you want to show everybody. No, I'm going to be number one. Let's just say with him because professionally want to do this

356
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
totally cool

357
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,840
But there's a lot of other competitors out there that have good podcasts and they're doing a good job

358
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,640
It's just a different mindset when you have that enemy. By the way

359
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:19,440
Very rarely will those guys ever truly again reveal their top driver and the top enemy why?

360
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,880
Because it's it's it's an element of insecurity. Yeah, it's a signal level of status

361
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,600
It is it's it's and it's also I don't want to give the other person credit power

362
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,320
I don't want to give that other person more power than the person thinks they have you don't have power

363
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,440
Or because somebody may be like, oh, I'm your enemy. I control you exactly

364
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,000
Well, when it's a part of the come-up story. Yeah, it's romantic

365
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,960
Right. It's it's uh, it's grassroots. It's what's keeping you

366
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,680
Going look at look at how I was mistreated by my first high school coach. They didn't see the I'm going to prove it to them

367
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,360
That's

368
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,360
a beautiful origin story

369
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,360
age 20

370
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,880
age 45

371
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,520
That just sounds like someone who can't get the chip off his shoulder. Yeah

372
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,680
So yeah, I think it's it's interesting how the tools that got you here aren't the ones that will get you there

373
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,680
And how the strategy this is again one of the reasons why continuing to rely on

374
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,600
Resentment and bitterness and the chip on your shoulder and enemies for too long becomes a very toxic fuel

375
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,480
And it's also importantly optics are very very important

376
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
It's a signal of low status

377
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,640
Okay, you brought I don't disagree when you brought up a story of Churchill, right? Okay

378
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,760
The world is weeks away from all speaking german

379
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,240
Okay, if we lose the war the guy wins no problem

380
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,960
chamberlain

381
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,760
Cannot hold it together and the story about

382
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,920
How the only way Churchill said he was going to come back is for chamberlain to come and beg him

383
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
The only way

384
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,440
Does it sound like something Churchill would do by the way? Absolutely. Yeah, Churchill sat there and said, okay

385
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,520
He has to come and ask me because chamberlain sent other people he said no no no no no

386
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Only one person

387
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Has to come look at me face to face

388
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,160
And say you can do a job. I can't do come back and help us think about

389
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Think about that now

390
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,840
Visualize that scene we can see it in a movie or we can read in a book and by the way

391
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,920
Say 50% of it is true. The other 50% is true, right?

392
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,520
The other 50% is a lie and it's like build up mythical over generations, right?

393
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,960
I believe that Churchill would want to hear it from

394
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,920
A chamberlain. Have you heard of Churchill's ministry of ungentlemanly warfare? No, so this is a phenomenal book that everybody can go and read

395
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,280
uh

396
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Before the second world war

397
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,280
It was considered ungentlemanly to use guerrilla style tactics and in fact one of the

398
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,120
British politicians said something to the effect of if this is what it takes to win the war

399
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,360
I am prepared to lose they were

400
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
The brits saw

401
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,360
anything shy of gentlemanly conduct in war as a loss even if it resulted in a win

402
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,680
And Churchill came in and changed that he was the one that changed that culture

403
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,680
So he puts together this crack squad of eccentric weirdos

404
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,320
One guy invents the limpid mine, right?

405
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,200
Which you can descend to depths and then it'll attach using magnets and it'll blow things up another group

406
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,400
Develop what is the uh predecessor to the sas another group are working on disguises and and guerrilla tactics to disrupt

407
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,240
Infrastructure as the german advance is trying to move forward. Uh, so yeah, Churchill was prepared to play dirty

408
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,320
But you know, you look at the tactics that were used

409
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,480
They only came about because of one man who legitimated it and and he said we will do whatever it takes to win

410
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,960
Now, here's the thing when you hear a story like that

411
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,480
Um, somebody may say well, you know, what a what a what a cold-blooded bastard?

412
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,280
Oh my god, no wonder people hate him

413
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
No wonder he is who he is

414
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,720
Where many president moved the bust of Churchill in the white house of wins that take this out

415
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,080
So I don't represent what he represents. Everybody acts all hard, right?

416
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
We can hate a Churchill during peacetime

417
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,520
but during wartime

418
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,320
You you beg for a Churchill to rise up

419
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,320
wartime leaders like Churchill you only appreciate during

420
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,840
wartime

421
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,920
There's a really interesting insight from evolutionary psychology here. There's two types of leadership

422
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,360
One is from dominance and the other is from prestige, right? One is uh more authoritarian

423
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,360
It's tyrannical. It's very aggressive. The other is uh more altruistic. It's uh the

424
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,080
The rise to power is denoted

425
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,960
It's spread through the group everybody chooses together that this is someone who we all believe has the skills and

426
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:01,200
The dominance is not the same and there are specific times when you want dominance and when you want prestige

427
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,520
And in times of conflict you want

428
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,240
Dominance sure sure you could say it in business. It's startup versus when it's more established, right?

429
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,320
But here's also the thing like the part where you got to give a lot of credit to steve jobs

430
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,360
steve jobs had a startup mentality

431
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,600
and then he took that to the company and then he hires

432
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,960
You know his uh scully that comes in from pepsi and he says you want to sell sugar

433
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,600
Can you know water for the rest of your life or you want to change the world?

434
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,200
He brings him in then he ends up being the reason to fire jobs

435
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Jobs leaves goes builds Pixar

436
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,960
Sells it to disney most of his wealth is tied to disney not at apple then he comes back

437
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:45,440
And he realizes that style of leading is not going to work to take the company to the next level when he comes back to apple

438
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,480
The first phone call he says he says the idea of thinking microsoft is the enemy is behind us

439
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,680
We can't think like that anymore

440
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:57,200
This is what steve job says and he goes to microsoft and he gets 300 million dollars from microsoft

441
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:03,840
To invest into apple and these guys hated each other microsoft came out in 76 apple came out in 77 a year apart

442
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,600
And everybody was always comparing the two together bill gates ended up being much richer than

443
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,760
steve jobs, but steve jobs was admired way more than

444
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Bill gates. So what does this mean?

445
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,040
The individual has to

446
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,040
Evolve like you have to also

447
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,320
Recreate yourself as you're going through this the same enemy that drives you when you're 22 years old

448
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,920
Should not be driving you at 32 years old or else you haven't matured

449
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,720
You should also out matured that enemy

450
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:37,200
And then 32 something else should be driving you then 42 then 58 and 63 then 75

451
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,800
But you are going to have those love affair with those enemies

452
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,480
That's a love affair

453
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,920
You had an affair with this enemy over an eight year span over a 13 year span over a six year span over a six month span

454
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,600
But you know, there is truth in the idea of you still being driven by that enemy

455
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,720
18 years after you beat that enemy 13 years after you beat that enemy

456
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:03,760
Someone who I think is particularly good at creating enemies from modern pop culture and our industry is bench of hero

457
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,040
Okay, what do you think about what he's doing at daily wire from an enemy perspective and and generally

458
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,200
You talked about recently with his feud with Tucker Carlson or period everything overall

459
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,880
um

460
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,720
I think Tucker's a true believer. I think Tucker is not somebody that

461
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,320
If he's doing it intentionally to get under your skin

462
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:28,720
Let's say that's 20 percent. Let's say it's 10 percent because he's witty and he's smart and he's sharp

463
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,800
Tucker or ben i'm sorry ben ben Shapiro. So you're talking about right? Yeah

464
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,880
Let's say ben is doing that 10 or 20 percent intentionally to get under your skin. Okay

465
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,720
But this guy at a young age wanted to be supreme court. Just you know, he's been wanting to be that for a long time

466
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,920
This is not a regular guy. I think at 12 or 13 years old. He performed in front of a couple thousand people

467
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,560
His level of intelligence of how early on he got a degree went to college 15 16 years old that all the stuff that he did

468
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,000
so

469
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
He's 100 true believer

470
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Does he have an element that he can

471
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,720
Talk to somebody and say I can murder you in a debate right now if you really want to go there. Yes

472
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,000
He has that element as well. Yeah, does he have a side of him that's a maybe a bully type a little bit? Sure

473
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,560
Well, don't forget during school. He was very heavily bullied himself very heavily bullied

474
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,720
But that's what happens typically to people like him, but that may be

475
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,680
the number one driver

476
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,520
That he's continuing because he wants for the rest of his life for those bullies to talk about that ben Shapiro used to be a

477
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,720
Classmate

478
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,520
What makes him go out to pace that he goes you think it's just all these other guys that we see there's no way

479
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,120
You think he would ever tell us you think his own family knows that highly doubted

480
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,360
It's to himself many of these people that he has in his life

481
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,000
Anybody that goes at that pace like tucker Carlson today. I don't know if you saw the approval

482
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,440
He got I think they got 150 million dollars today from some organization who did took his organization

483
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,120
Yeah, so finally today the ward is out that he raised money. It's it's a hundred

484
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,440
It's a big amount of money that he finally raised today

485
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:01,200
Who's his enemy? He's got a very easy enemy. He's got fox news former employer as an enemy

486
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,640
He's got a lot of political people as an enemy people with silo some as an enemy

487
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,360
You know how many enemies tucker got you think tucker needs another 300 million dollars that he has in a bank account

488
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,800
I highly doubt so

489
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,520
He's doing it for a complete different reason because he wants to give the middle finger to five 10 15 different people in his life

490
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,000
You just sense it with tucker and by the way, you know, it's wild right now

491
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:27,520
Ben Shapiro went after tucker this week. What happened because of uh, uh, israel tucker's position where he says we should focus on

492
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,600
a hundred thousand

493
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:35,200
Uh, uh, people in america that are dying from fentanyl not focused on what's going on in israel and gaza and ben Shapiro says

494
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,760
You know, we can chew gum and walk at the same time specifically from the moral standpoint

495
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,840
We can handle two different moral issues, but you know, they're going back and forth whether it's a seasonal thing or not

496
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,280
That's a complete different, you know competition that we're talking about. I suppose

497
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,320
Uh, how would you say enemies of convenience are sometimes good for optics?

498
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,320
You know, what have we just seen dylan danis logan paul ksi tommy fury jake paul tommy fury

499
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,880
logan paul

500
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,880
jake paul and

501
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
Who's the jiu-jitsu guy stocked in slaps

502
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,680
Diaz, thank you. Nate Diaz love that guy

503
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,880
Enemies of convenience. Yeah, you know like nothing gets people's tongues wagging more than you creating a little bit of a feud

504
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,040
on the internet

505
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,560
dc, uh

506
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,080
They announced yesterday speaking of feuds and speaking of disney

507
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,240
That the daily wire are going to do that own version of snow white with brett cooper starring in snow white. I saw that

508
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,960
I saw that I mean that to me is you know, largely a

509
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,800
declarative statement of culture war on what's happening with

510
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,800
Children with children's movies, you know, it's synthesizing down all of the little tangential issues that have been included

511
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,640
Is there anything to do with the push toward the sort of books that are in school? Is it us?

512
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:57,840
You know denying this uh rachel's ziggler ziggler throwing snow white under the bus like she doesn't have a prince charming

513
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,560
She has a stalker. We don't need that. What do you think about that?

514
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,000
I think that it is a very dangerous lesson to teach young girls that

515
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,320
Boys that show interest in them are dangerous and to be avoided

516
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,280
I think it makes for a generation of fragile

517
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
narcissistic fearful young girls

518
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,720
That I wouldn't want as a daughter and that I don't want as a mother. You know what a perfect example that is

519
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:27,200
The movement of feminism is the ultimate example of not choosing your enemies wisely

520
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,360
You chose men as being the enemy

521
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,920
40 years later 50 years later you're 65 years old

522
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
Single not married no kids

523
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,920
You're living in an apartment or a condo with a dog

524
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,160
Or a cat that that's all you ever talk about and you're lonely and you're sitting there saying

525
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,080
I was wrong

526
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Men are not the enemy, but guess what?

527
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,040
That movement stole 50 years of your life. You know how painful that is

528
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,680
What what she's doing right now with the messaging she's given and then getting out there and saying well

529
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,440
I don't want to be able to have to do this. No, you know

530
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,040
That's not necessarily going to be that way nowadays, you know, women don't need that anymore

531
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,440
It's a completely different era right now. We're talking about and to do this at a hundred your anniversary of disney

532
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,640
Yeah

533
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,600
Really

534
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,200
With what waltz and many of us I remember living in iran watching disney cartoons translated in farce

535
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
Literally in farce

536
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,360
It's it's very weird when you watch it in farce because the language is a rough language, you know, you watch pinocchio

537
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,080
In farce it's not as appealing right, but we grew up with this stuff

538
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,200
You know, we grew up with watching these cartoons to see that taking place

539
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,240
Is uh, if you ask me, it's absolutely pathetic, but you're seeing how many back-to-back-to-back flops disney has right now

540
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,600
Yeah, and it's not a good look. Um, by the way, the buyers who want to buy disney. They're loving this

541
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,400
Apple's one of the most qualified buyers. They they hope disney makes five more flops

542
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,720
apples sitting there saying make five more flops. Iger, please by the way

543
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:04,160
Have you read the ride of a lifetime by bob Iger? Okay another interesting guy what he did with a 38 career at abc

544
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,040
Obviously he's been there a lot longer, but when you read the book the first 38 run

545
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
To be one of the best power brokers

546
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,440
Then to finish your career up the way you're doing right now

547
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,440
very

548
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,800
Very bad way of finishing it. He's not an idiot, right? You don't have the excuse of not knowing

549
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,680
He is for what a point you just made he is 100 not an idiot

550
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,320
This guy was about to run for president bob Iger was gonna he was one of the guys that everybody was trying to get to

551
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,880
Run for president him and oprah. They were supposed to be this literally. This was the conversation

552
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,600
so he also ended up choosing the wrong enemies and

553
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,920
The wrong allies

554
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,120
Not realizing your best allies are parents. You're losing parents who have been watching this for years

555
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,520
You're losing the people that this is a legacy product

556
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,800
It's another example of a complete screw-up that's going to come out of discount for somebody else like apple

557
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,560
I mean look at to go back to ben and what jeremy are doing over the daily wire

558
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,320
Hershey's do a campaign that they don't like within five days. They've released their own chocolate bar

559
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,400
That shaving company does something they don't like within

560
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,040
24 hours, maybe they filmed a video with a mclaren for jeremy's razors

561
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,760
They don't like the way that's fantastic commercial by the way. Well done. Jeremy's got jeremy's got skills

562
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,760
I listened to him and shepiro talking about the fact that originally jeremy was the talent

563
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,880
And ben was the money man and the the the uh data guy behind the scenes

564
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,600
Do you know zack levi? I think it's him exactly by the actor who played the uh, what is the movie?

565
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,840
the the

566
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,880
the

567
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,760
Super hero for kid movies. What is the guy's name? Ben 10? What is it? Ben 10? No?

568
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,360
It's a recent one. You're the one with like yeah four kids. Yeah, trust me. I've seen this movie a couple times

569
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,560
He played kurt warner a recent movie that came out the american underdog. He played kurt warner

570
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,480
him

571
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,200
and

572
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,400
Jeremy used to have a production company apparently 10 15 years ago

573
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,160
And zack ended up being a big time actor in hollywood doing very good for himself

574
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,200
And by the way, jeremy is another great example of a guy that's got enemies. Just look at his eyes

575
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
When you talk when you hear jeremy speak

576
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,800
You see the fire built for enemies. He's got enemies and he wants to take those enemies out

577
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:24,000
But that's why I thought the daily y was an illustrative example because they are as far as I can see largely a company built on

578
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,080
Identifying enemies, you know, they're very much in opposition to ideas that they don't like to movements

579
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,880
They don't like to people that they don't like and uh

580
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,040
Yeah, man, I mean it's you have to be built for that

581
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,280
You really really do need to be built for it. And it certainly seems to me that what ben and what jeremy are doing over there is

582
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,240
Purpose built to be

583
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,920
The anti this the anti that and a lot of the time it's new movements that they don't just they don't agree with

584
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,760
The market's gonna prove if the concept is gonna work or not

585
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,760
And if it can't sustain because if it's a built to solve concept, they're gonna be they're gonna succeed

586
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:06,080
But can somebody else come and pick up that concept and continue with that with the same level of fire?

587
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,520
It's gonna take a couple decades to figure that part out. It's interesting to think, you know from from our side

588
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,880
When you see those rachel ziggler interviews and she's saying courting is stalking

589
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:23,520
Um a girl doesn't need to be saved by a prince. You know, she's busy thinking about how she can fulfill her own dreams

590
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,000
And becoming the woman that she always knew that she could run and so forth

591
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,480
You think a lot of people are

592
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,120
Is that really the you know the highest

593
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,160
Manifestation is that real self-actualization for young women nowadays?

594
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,400
That's the question they ask and you're totally right that look ultimately the market will choose

595
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,440
There's no question about it. The market will choose the market is brutal. You know, you know, it's a great thing about

596
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,600
It's always right. It's always right, you know, you can you can say well, let me tell you I'm the best bodybuilder in the world

597
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,880
Yeah, okay. Look at your calves. Yeah, good luck. You go put those a little skimpy, you know

598
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,440
Shorts on and see what your

599
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,000
You know legs look like now. You're not as good as you think you are you're full of it. Yeah market is brutal

600
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,240
podcast business concepts investments drinks

601
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,480
You know alcohol books you write when we first wrote

602
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,040
When I first wrote your next five moves and we launched at august of 2020

603
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,960
This is during the peak of kovat

604
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,320
My publisher simon and schuster asked and says so how do you think the book's gonna do?

605
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,600
How you gonna judge the book me and greg dinkin are talking I said

606
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,880
If the book is doing well three years from now, it was a good book

607
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,320
You can have a great marketing campaign the book does well the first 30 60 90 days

608
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,880
But is the book selling three years later if it is

609
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,600
That's a great book because the market will tell you that

610
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,360
Yeah, very interesting to think about how

611
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,840
optics

612
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,880
and

613
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,440
There are ways to game the system and I think people are very

614
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,400
They're hyper aware of this

615
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
They understand that there are

616
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,960
People who have managed to use

617
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:02,640
Tactics and hacks to get themselves into a position that they maybe didn't quite deserve that the legitimacy of the product the book or whatever it is

618
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
the person who

619
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,600
Maybe uh when megan markles autobiography comes out perhaps people would

620
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,960
Accuse her of doing something like this, right? It's not to do with the actual product. It's to do with the positioning

621
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,160
And sometimes that does work

622
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,320
but ultimately

623
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,760
Form is temporary and class is permanent

624
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
navals got this great quote where he says

625
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,520
Um

626
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,520
Karma is just people repeating their beliefs

627
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,880
Actions and behaviors until they finally get what they deserve

628
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,760
You just roll the dice you keep rolling the dice, right?

629
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,800
Every single time every single thing you do the way that you interact with the uber driver

630
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,440
The way that you pay or don't pay the bill or invoice that you've got every tiny little thing each time

631
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:48,000
Is an opportunity for your true nature to come up and people just keep on rolling the dice

632
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,360
Keep on rolling the dice and then every so often someone hits double one and you go. Oh, there we go

633
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:00,000
But it's temporary you can't do permanently megan merkel whether her motives are really because she loves

634
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,000
The prince and it's like harry. She's in love with them or she's using the power to bully and

635
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,640
Get what she wants out of it

636
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,920
The market is brutal. Look what happened to amber herd for how many years did everybody think?

637
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,880
You know johnny depp was a bad guy for how many years? Oh johnny depp was an abusive

638
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,240
You know relationship all this up and then they start showing the clips

639
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,080
The videos and johnny's comfortable. Would it be in public?

640
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,720
and all of a sudden

641
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,480
180

642
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,040
The world is like what an asshole

643
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,120
She is

644
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,120
Not him. I love johnny the next thing you know the love affair was like

645
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:45,920
How many more men are going through like johnny is and then how many women said she ruined it for women who were actually abused

646
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:53,440
So yeah for longest time. Oh my god crying is so such a so difficult time what he was so when he hit me

647
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,440
We fell for it

648
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,840
But we will only fall for it temporarily not permanently the market will reveal eventually

649
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:06,080
Hopefully yeah, I again man form is temporary classes permanent and people will ultimately get what they deserve

650
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,280
Uh when it comes to the courting is stalking

651
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
Culture that we have at the moment

652
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,640
You've got a daughter. You've got young sons

653
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,400
You also spend some time undervalutainment talking about

654
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,520
Intersexual dynamics and what's going on between the sexes

655
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:28,160
What do you make of the current dating scene for men and women and why do you think it's being demonized in some ways?

656
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,640
From what perspective from I think that there is an anti dating culture at the moment

657
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:39,360
I think that men and women are being encouraged to be treated as equals. Uh, sorry as adversaries not as equals, right, right?

658
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,480
Um, I think it's transactional today. I think it's easy today

659
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:51,840
I think the swipe right community is it's friday night 11 o'clock. Let me swipe right. I'm gonna use 20

660
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,800
Someone's gonna get back to me if they swipe right and they so and typically I would go after an eight and a half nine

661
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,680
But it's friday night. I'm gonna go do a six and a half seven. No one's gonna know

662
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,280
I'm gonna invite her back to my place. She knows if she's on tinder. I'm not on bumble. Whatever these dating apps are

663
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,720
And so it's transactional strategic

664
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,520
No one's gonna know and literally not a lot of people are gonna know you can really run through 20 40 50 100 nowadays and it's not a

665
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,080
Big deal. Okay

666
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:23,040
So what does that do? Whatever is too easy to come you devalue it. You don't value it that highly

667
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,000
You know my era you had to court

668
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,520
You had to prospect you had to have scripts. You had to build relationship. You had to follow up

669
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,480
We didn't have these types of things to do. We had my space the last time I was single. There was my space

670
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,960
Okay, I DM'd uh

671
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,040
My wife on my space my wife and I knew each other for five and a half years

672
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,640
Eventually we're in palm springs for the first time. She's single. I'm single ever for five and a half years

673
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,880
We're both single

674
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,480
And

675
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,480
You know we go on a date first date

676
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,440
PF Chang's December 29 of 2007

677
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,760
Used just when PF Chang used to be good when they had their uh, their their noodle soup

678
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,520
They don't have it anymore used to be they took that away phenomenal item on the menu. I'm convinced they they fell apart after that

679
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,040
So anyways, we go to well PF Chang's by the way, if you're watching bring it back

680
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,520
It was actually a very good item on the menu. So we go on a date. There's magic

681
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,520
She's smiling. I'm smiling. You know the smile. That's kind of like I'm happy to see you

682
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,960
And then it's midnight where the last people left at PF Chang's

683
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,640
You know waiter comes up to me and he says what's going on

684
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:32,160
I said, you know, my wife wants to follow divorce. She doesn't want to be with me anymore. So your wife why?

685
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,840
Yeah, I come from a different religious background and her family's convinced we got to split up and he has no clue

686
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,840
We're not married. We're just on our first date

687
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,720
He sits down for 15 minutes convincing her to stay with me if you love him stay with him

688
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,400
It was a beautiful, you know

689
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,880
Seeing that we have we go in the car she goes home the next day I take her we go do stairs in Santa Monica

690
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,320
We go to church. We go to earth cafe in Santa Monica

691
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,840
Then we go to boarders

692
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:01,520
I buy her book on our second date called 101 questions to ask before you get engaged on our second date by norman right

693
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,200
She's like, what's this? I said, I'm not looking for a girlfriend. I'm looking for a wife. I'm 28 at the time

694
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,160
Uh, I said, I know exactly what I want. I've already done this exercise with three other girls

695
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,080
If you want to go through it great

696
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,400
You need to answer the questions. Let's meet up when you're ready and let's go through it week later

697
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,800
Six hours at her place one by one by one each question we go through

698
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,880
I said, this is somebody I can date and by the way, it's ugly because you got to talk about everything in the book

699
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,840
so today

700
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,160
That's not it anymore today. It's too

701
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,840
Risky today. It's you don't have access to that anymore today percentages are coming out where

702
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,440
marriages from dating sites have the least chance of working out versus marriages where you meet somebody through a referral

703
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,160
Where you say pat I've known mary for seven years. I think you and her should talk not know what's going to happen

704
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,080
Let me set you guys up. Let's take our girls and do a double day. Cool. Hey, I kind of like her

705
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,920
This is good. Well, you're telling me seven years. I've only seen her be with one guy larry five years

706
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,800
He was an asshole then she's been with this other guy two years, but she's single now

707
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,440
Now I have some kind of a history I'm dealing with right

708
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,520
So it is a different climate now with kids. It's a different story on how you raise him

709
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,480
my

710
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,480
10-year-old son he's he's been

711
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,440
He's had a girlfriend since he was five years old literally at a birthday party at five years

712
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,280
So he's making out with this other girl at this they've embossed they've embusters. I'm like babe

713
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,200
What is going on his mom is asking me, you know, our kids are kissing. I said, well, I got a son

714
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,760
You got a daughter. You may want to stop your daughter, but I'm not gonna stop my son

715
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,320
So she's like well guys guys. No stop stop. They don't even know what's going on

716
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,000
So there's you need to have the conversation with kids early today

717
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,520
Uh, I remember having conversation with my boys when they were six and five in the shower and I said, okay

718
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:47,360
We need to have this conversation together. What's that? Okay, stand up. That's your dangling. That's his dangling

719
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,120
This is my dangling

720
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,800
Only you get to play with your dangling one day. You're gonna find a girl

721
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,280
That's gonna play with your dangling till then

722
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:59,280
God gave you that dangling for only you to play with your dangling now. You got to see how they're looking at me

723
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:05,360
By the way, they're looking at me like this and my wife leaves quickly. She's like, babe. This is unconscious, babe. You can leave

724
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,520
So we have that conversation

725
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,960
I think you need to have the conversation today because most parents are on middle eastern

726
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,960
They don't have those types of conversations

727
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,760
No one's talking about sex and condoms and all this kind of stuff

728
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,560
You need to start early but the dating scene today

729
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,560
Very very different than what it was when I was single

730
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:29,600
Uh, I if I wanted to go date today and find a wife my approach would be very different than what most people are doing today

731
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:31,680
Very different

732
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,440

733
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,280

Why does he like working with you? I don't know but you do something right for him to want to work with you

760
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,520
And then you told me what you're doing with them structure. That's private stuff that you told me

761
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,240
So you watch people you watch

762
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:47,680
Values principles you watch how they treat people you watch how people treat them you watch how people respond to them you watch

763
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:54,720
How they are with powerful people you watch how they are with regular average day-to-day people you

764
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,840
You look for that today

765
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:04,720
It's not the cars the the lambos the ferrari's the houses all that stuff. By the way, i'm a capitalist and I love all that stuff

766
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,480
but

767
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,480
I like that stuff because

768
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,200
Different reasons. I enjoy the game. I'm a kid

769
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:17,360
I'm turning 45 tomorrow. I'm 44 today for the last day tomorrow. I'll be 45

770
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,880
But there's an element of childlike stuff that brings out

771
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,840
The 14 year old kid when I look at a baseball card. I'm a kid when I look at a baseball card

772
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,200
The average person's like who cares about baseball cards. That's a different element, but

773
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,840
The relationships the way they treat people values and principles what they value

774
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,400
you look for those types of things and

775
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,080
Eventually enough will be revealed the more you pay attention

776
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,760
That's one of the byproducts

777
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:49,440
I think that is dangerous sometimes of people who play the game that they get captured by the game and they forget that it is a game

778
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,400
And they see the game as reality

779
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,880
They don't realize that there is something which is supposed to be deeper which is hidden below the surface

780
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,200
So I did rogan's show last year

781
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,120
And I listened back to the episode he said something on it that I really wanted to dig into

782
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:09,040
And he listened back I listened back and and pulled this this really really powerful insight for me

783
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,040
It was one of the most powerful things I learned last year

784
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,280
and he said

785
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,960
Just because something is hard to obtain does not mean that it is valuable

786
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:24,320
Just because something is hard to obtain doesn't mean it's valuable. Correct. Yeah, just because it's difficult to get

787
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,400
Doesn't mean that it's valuable

788
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,040
Look at the car. He's arriving. Look at the watch. He's wearing. Look at the girl

789
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,720
He's with these things were hard to obtain so you presumed that they were valuable

790
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,680
But you didn't realize that what's genuinely valuable are friendships and relationships

791
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,840
And a comfort and a confidence in yourself and peace of mind and sanity

792
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,760
And being able to positively impact the people around you. So it got me thinking

793
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,920
I've been really sort of reflecting on this over the last year

794
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,600
And I did some research into the history of the pineapple

795
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,120
so

796
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,320
1492 christopher columbus lands on the island of guadalupe

797
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,160
And for the first time ever a westerner sees a pineapple and you look at it

798
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,920
It's kind of a royal fruit that's got this stupid crown on its head and he writes in his journal

799
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,000
He describes the taste of a pineapple if you've never had a pineapple before you blow your head off

800
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,240
You know if you haven't got processed I remember the first time I had a pineapple. Yes, it's insane

801
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,000
Of course, anyway, they take a shipload literally back to

802
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,880
the prince of spain

803
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,040
Prince aragon the second

804
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:27,760
Take this entire shipload back one of them makes it that isn't rotten and the prince is allowed to eat it

805
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,120
And again almost gets this sort of mythical quality to it the pineapple

806
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,720
Very quickly the british quite rightly so they

807
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,680
They start to see it as this symbol of opulence, right? They see it as this symbol of wealth

808
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,880
So they would parade pineapples around at dinner

809
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,560
On a platter and they would use them over and over and over again

810
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:55,280
You could rent a pineapple, right for the evening. This is the sort of house in which you might be able to see a pineapple, right?

811
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,480
Castles had pineapple statues on the top of them there would be

812
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,000
Fountains with pineapples at the front of someone's estate

813
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:10,400
All of this occurred because of the scarcity of a pineapple. It was 8 000 pounds to get one pineapple. Wow, right?

814
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,480
That was the equivalent back then

815
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,240
8 000 pounds. It was a symbol of of privilege and opulence and wealth and

816
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,080
What it meant was that people really

817
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,640
looked up to this one object then the french a couple of hundred years later. They invent greenhouses

818
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,560
And that allows us to grow tropical fruits at higher climates higher

819
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,520
latitudes

820
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,520
Price drops and guess what?

821
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,760
No one starts parading the pineapple around anymore

822
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,240
The scarcity of it was largely determining the value of it

823
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:52,640
And that story and what I called rogan's value difficulty conflation just because something is hard to obtain does not mean that it is valuable

824
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,720
Now I would argue that a pineapple is valuable no matter how hard or difficult

825
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,480
It's like a dialed fruit no matter how good or how difficult it is to get a hold of

826
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,360
But I really love that insight because I think that it shows how

827
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,680
non valuable

828
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,280
But difficult to obtain things get slipped into our desires

829
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:18,080
I see that particular expensive possession that intrinsically I don't actually care about maybe I've never been a watch guy

830
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,800
Maybe I've never been a shoes guy. Maybe I've never been a car guy

831
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,680
But I want it I want it because it's hard to get okay

832
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,120
Well, what if there is a quicker route to what fulfillment?

833
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,040
What if there is a more direct path because there are some people out there for whom

834
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,200
Keeping up with the jonesism materialism is an inbuilt part of their life

835
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:40,240
But I can say as someone that doesn't have that bone in my body particularly that for me material possessions

836
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,160
They don't make a massive difference to my quality of life. I like nice things. I like to fly business

837
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,080
I like you know, I like a nice house and blah blah blah

838
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:52,160
But there's people who are tuned into that, right? Maybe it's the upbringing the genetic predisposition whatever whatever whatever

839
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,320
But I think that people should be very cautious. Why is it that I'm chasing this thing?

840
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,440
Am I chasing this thing because it's something which is valuable or am I chasing it simply because it's something that's difficult to get

841
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,680
Yeah, that's a by the way a very good story

842
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,160
And a great quote. I remember in iran

843
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,760
Pineapple is on on us. That's how we say we say on on us

844
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,960
And anybody in iran who had pineapple you were rich two things pineapple and banana in iran

845
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,120
Only rich people have pineapple and two good fruits. Yeah, two good fruits. And then I go to germany

846
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And bananas are everywhere

847
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:27,280
But the first time I had pineapple. I had it in the states. I couldn't believe we were having pineapple

848
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,640
I thought we were rich when we had pineapple. I said mom, are we finally rich here?

849
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,760
We made we retired on a pineapple. Yeah, it was on on us and I remember I was in

850
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:42,560
Ninth grade first time ever we went and ate at sizzlers. I thought we had made it. I'm like guys you will not believe what restaurant

851
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,720
I don't know if you know sizzlers, but sizzlers in us is not a fancy restaurant

852
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,720
I thought we made it because we ate at

853
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,720
sizzlers. Yeah, you know what say

854
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,440
I used to think

855
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:58,320
And you know this whole concept of people who are too much about

856
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:03,200
Fancy things it's kind of like well look at this guy all he cares about his money all he cares about his fancy things

857
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,800
All he cares about is these cars and life with the rich and famous and all this other stuff

858
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:14,400
Eventually I realized not everybody is driven by the same thing all I care about that's something that drives you

859
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:20,160
Okay, my oldest son could care less. You know what he wants for a car his favorite car a jeep

860
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,160
That's his dream car. My daughter says I want a white Ferrari

861
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,600
Okay, and I said, who do you think's gonna buy that for you? Well daddy, you're gonna buy

862
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,160
I'm not buying you white for are you gonna buy yourself a white Ferrari?

863
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,000
Dylan wants a completely different car my oldest son. You know what you know what is

864
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,000
Absolutely a great day for him outside

865
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,320
in the dirt

866
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,160
playing with lizards

867
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,160
catching animals

868
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,160
Playing with dogs and cats

869
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,440
That's an incredible day. By the way, he's been like done since eight months nine months

870
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,480
My youngest son 10 years old first time I take him to my barber to get a haircut

871
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,040
And one of the girls at this place they give

872
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,040
Massages at the end when you get the haircut my oldest son says don't touch my back

873
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,200
Don't don't touch me. He would go like this. He's like no no dad. I don't tell her not to touch me, right?

874
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,520
But my 10 year old son it was five at the time

875
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,080
She's like, can you also massage me over here?

876
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,000
Oh, he likes to find the things in life to find her things in life, right?

877
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,040
My oldest son loves dogs. He loves animals my youngest son

878
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,760
Don't get on my bed get off my bed

879
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,280
My oldest son wants a dog right next to him the youngest son doesn't want any of the dogs next to him and his dad loves dogs

880
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,880
I love animals, right?

881
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,200
so I'm not I'm not you know

882
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,440
I think

883
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:37,440
Joe specializes in doing the heart if there's anybody that specializes in doing the heart is joe. You kid me like joe is a

884
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,240
enamored by doing the heart

885
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:45,360
But also joe's learned to be so self-aware of himself to know what he likes

886
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,520
I said joe, what do you think about sports? Is uh, I know nothing about sports. I don't watch sports

887
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,520
The only thing I watch is ufc

888
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,760
Joe now that you're getting all these eyeballs. What's your vision? What if we can do this pat?

889
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:01,120
The only thing I want to do is I just want to podcast. Yeah, I want to go hunt. I want to be my family

890
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,920
I want to do ufc. This is all I want to do the level of clarity. He has of where he's at

891
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,880
Props to him now Dana white

892
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,800
slightly different

893
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,080
Dana's not worth a few hundred say he's worth a half a billion dollars today

894
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,240
Why is he still driving?

895
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,720
Why is he still pushing? Why is he still competing? Why is he still wanting to be number one?

896
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,080
Who's his enemy?

897
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:27,040
He drives around in nice cars likes to go to the casino likes to be around with people having fun late night

898
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,760
Two different dynamics two different personalities. Look at the organization they built with you

899
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,640
I mean

900
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:37,200
Thinking of someone who chooses their enemies tactically Dana is not someone who's shy of a fight

901
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:41,200
He loves it, you know, if you were to think of a c-suite level fighter

902
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:46,000
Dana white is is pretty well and bring the crop. Yeah, you've you've spent a good bit of time sort of

903
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,920
Orbiting that that whole crew of people. What have you learned from your?

904
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,400
Insights about the UFC and sort of what that says about Dana. Oh

905
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,000
listen

906
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,560
what I'm about to say about Dana is

907
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,680
Some people are not gonna like it, but I'm gonna say it anyways

908
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:11,360
UFC is what UFC is because of Dana white you can sit there and talk about all these fighters and

909
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,040
Yeah, but you know if it wasn't for this guy if it wasn't for that guy if it wasn't for what this person did and that

910
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,400
Totally get it. Listen different players come and go right totally understand

911
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:28,880
Dana has made it about the sport. He never made it about the fight. He never made it about one fighter

912
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,040
He is very

913
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,240
Quick to call out anybody. It doesn't matter if it's the number one guy in the league

914
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,560
He'll call him out. John Jones. He'll call out Connor if he screws up, but he'll back him up

915
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:42,320
To the highest level. He'll say that was some stupid shit. He did

916
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,760
He'll sit there and straight up tell you what he likes what he doesn't like

917
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:52,000
But everybody learned during covet. He was the number one commissioner in all of sports

918
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,640
Every commissioner in america caved

919
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,560
mba caved

920
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,560
nfl caved mlb caved

921
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:07,280
Every commissioner caved except for one guy who had brass balls called dano white who said I don't give a shit

922
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,480
We're going to find a place to do the fight. So during covet. You know, it's the only sport the world watched

923
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:16,960
We watched ufc. No one's watching the freaking football game with no fans out there and card boards

924
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,120
What am I going to do with card boards? Oh, no, we're gonna watch

925
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,000
Hey, you can buy this seat for your face to be on the you know

926
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,680
Basketball game who gives a shit. It was the most boring finals lakers one ever

927
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,920
They shouldn't even deserve to have won that finals. There was no audience. Nobody boon against you

928
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,840
But everybody realized here's dano as a commissioner. Then it's everybody else. You're not at his level

929
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:41,280
He's a wartime leader as well as a peacetime leader. He's learned how to balance both

930
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,480
prestige moving together

931
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,840
He said something in an interview says listen, man, maybe it's just the fact that I'm getting old

932
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,680
And I'm getting soft, but I have a hard time seeing what's going on with some of these guys and

933
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,680
You know

934
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,440
In the way his personal life when he went through that crisis and the way he put it

935
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,080
He says you want me to be embarrassed? How much more embarrassed you want me to be?

936
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,680
You know how embarrassing it is to talk to my wife and my kids. You know how embarrassing that is

937
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,720
This is nothing compared to embarrassing the two have to face my kids

938
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,920
You respect that you love that there's a degree of clarity

939
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,160
especially to dano

940
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,280
that is

941
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,320
very rare

942
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,200
and

943
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:19,360
I think that one of the things that ufc has done is make boxing particularly

944
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:26,000
Feel so antiquated and pedestrian and the fact that ksi almost speed tommy fury. You know how bad that would have been for boxing

945
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,160
That's not good. That's not good, but he ksi does not represent ufc either

946
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:37,200
He doesn't but what would have happened if a youtuber would have beaten a professional boxer with the last name of fury

947
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,920
It's humiliating correct and many people would have said he could have won on the points

948
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:49,280
But what was it that you said you made some comparison about jockeys and horses to do with dano white?

949
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:58,000
Yes, I made the analysis with ilan musk where you either bet on the oh the same goes with dano white as well

950
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,640
Yeah, yeah, so you got the jockey and the horse. Okay

951
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:08,240
You got dano white is the jockey the horses ufc ilan musk is a jockey

952
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:17,200
Tesla is the horse. Okay, so if tomorrow ilan musk resigned from tesla to only do twitter

953
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,600
What happens to tesla?

954
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:24,560
It's going to be disturbing for a lot of investors because a lot of people bought tesla because it's ilan musk

955
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,960
A lot of people are selling tesla

956
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,000
Tesla and getting rid of their cars like aoc

957
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:35,840
It's ilan musk ever since yeah about twitter double-edged sword. Yeah, it's a double-edged sword

958
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:42,000
But you know to me in a perfect world is if you can have both I think ufc is a great product

959
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,640
Phenomenal product addicting product. Okay viral product

960
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:52,000
But dano white is an incredible jockey. Do you remember someone brought up?

961
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,440
I think it was israel adesanya had been using the n word

962
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,680
And it's at the press conference. I mean it must be fun for the press

963
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:04,160
You know to sit down and dano sits down. He goes. All right guys. What's going on the gate tonight was

964
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,520
We broke this he would have the fight of the night and then he just looks up and someone asks him a question

965
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,720
And he just says what he thinks you know, he doesn't say something that the media team has prepped him on

966
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,800
Although i'm sure he's got training and he understands the boundaries, but nothing feels

967
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,080
prescribed

968
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,920
manufactured

969
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,360
Conceited

970
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,560
Nothing

971
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,760
Contrived nothing feels like that. It just feels like this is what the guy thinks

972
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,680
Someone I saw this on the internet. Someone had talked about

973
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:39,680
Many organizations and youtubers at the moment are trying to speed run authenticity

974
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:48,080
Right. They're trying to growth hack relatability. How can I make myself seem more authentic and relatable than I actually am

975
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,520
And obviously it's kind of a self-defeating prophecy

976
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,800
Which is that the only way to be authentic is to be authentic

977
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,520
And there's a degree of trust, you know, I mean dana dude the start of this year was rough for him that

978
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:04,880
Him and his mrs. Got into a scuffle and it got videoed and it was maybe like new year's eve or something like oh

979
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:09,520
January 1st. Guess I was starting 2023 the worst way possible and

980
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,240
He comes out and you have faith that you go

981
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,320
Yeah, this guy

982
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,920
Meant what he said

983
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,840
There's I don't think that there's any demons looking in the closet because I may

984
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:25,040
Regret saying that at some point in future, but I don't think that I'm going to need to because I just have faith that

985
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:31,840
I'm not a dana white. I don't have stock in dana white. I just I'm a good judge of character and I see in him someone

986
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:37,680
That seems to tell the truth more often than not and seems to be very open and honest and own his mistakes

987
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,720
And people love that people really really like that

988
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,720
So, yeah, it makes him incredibly likable

989
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,720
Authenticity at the highest level that brand is a very

990
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,520
authentic brand

991
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:53,040
He said is uh, you know his enemies. He's had the people that have

992
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,520
challenged him and given him a hard time, but

993
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,400
Dana in a in a past life could have been a gangster

994
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,440
Maybe he was but he could have been a gangster. He could have ran a

995
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:06,880
Family that's how Dana's he could have been he Dana is almost not a

996
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,440
mob boss

997
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,320
You know of a Gambino family or Genovese or colombo

998
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,960
Dana's more the guy that ran the commission like a Luciano. That's Dana

999
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,680
And to be that guy

1000
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:25,120
There is no book you can read to be that you can read 40 lots of power 100 times you can't be that guy

1001
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:29,200
You either are that guy. You're not that guy big boss energy Dana is that guy Dana's that guy

1002
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:34,880
One of your quotes is when you're winning you're not as good as you think you are

1003
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,120
When you're losing you're not as bad as you think you are. What's that mean to you?

1004
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:43,840
Both of them lie, you know, both of them is exaggerated, you know, both of them

1005
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,720
are

1006
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:51,280
When you when you're winning everybody's telling you how amazing you are. Oh my god, let me tell you do you

1007
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,600
You know what you're the best

1008
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,600
You're amazing

1009
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,320
You know, you're just better than that guy and you're better than this guy

1010
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,840
And it always takes me back to that quote of Marcus Aurelius who had a slave

1011
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:08,720
That would sit behind them and always whisper to him. Hey, you're just a man

1012
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,080
You're just a man. You're just a man. That's right 40 laws of power, right?

1013
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,160
You're just a man. You're just a man. You're just a man

1014
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,440
And then he would get up and he became the best emperor what 62 ad to 69 whatever the time is

1015
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,160
And he becomes who he becomes

1016
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:30,400
And we read about him now, you know, you pick up the book meditations. You're like, this is like mandatory reading for anybody

1017
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,720
What is this all about? Right?

1018
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,560
You know a simple book

1019
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,920
Not that big you can read it in one hour. No, it's not it's not

1020
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,560
And you're going through it saying what was this about then you google what did he mean by this?

1021
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,960
Wow, I don't think about it that way. So and then when you're losing

1022
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:51,360
Everybody tells you I told you shouldn't have done that. I knew you weren't gonna make it

1023
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,880
Yeah, I told you it wasn't for you. You weren't that guy and you believe that as well

1024
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,200
So both of them are are lying for me politically

1025
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,120
Politically, I'm a capitalist hardcore capitalist. I fully am a capitalist to the core

1026
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:13,680
I think the free market will create solutions to problems. I think the free market is going to filter out

1027
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,400
all the fakers in

1028
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,960
pharma in

1029
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,520
finance in podcasting in sports in real estate and insurance

1030
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:28,800
It takes two decades, but it'll filter people out. It's not it's got zero sympathy for you

1031
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:34,000
It doesn't care to be friend. You can give capitalism as many compliments as you want. He doesn't feel it. He has no emotions

1032
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:41,040
You can't flatter capitalism. All he's interested in is results. Are you good enough? Can you last can you recreate yourself? Great

1033
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,680
But when it comes on to politics, I want to hear both sides

1034
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,520
Okay, I'm a christian, but I held a podcast four weeks ago

1035
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:54,640
I brought two muslims and I brought two christians and I had them go at it for two hours discussion

1036
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,440
because my

1037
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:02,480
Conversation was more about okay if we agree on seven different things we disagree on seven different things

1038
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,720
But you agree on 23 different things. Can we figure out a way to make this work?

1039
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,640
Why do you feel the way you do?

1040
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,920
Why do you feel the way you do and they go back and forth and your sinners in okay?

1041
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,320
Interesting to date israel palestine with what's going on with hamas

1042
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,200
complicated lots of issues

1043
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,520
You know on one end the question is where pro israel

1044
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,080
Where folks are going back and forth

1045
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:30,560
You know, I'm a pro-israel guy. I'm from iran when I lived in iran for 10 years

1046
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:37,360
Iran was safer when reza pahlavi was there because they were strong and they had allies with everybody

1047
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,480
And israel was safe the middle east was safe you could go

1048
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,560
And say, you know what patrick next week, you know where i'm going. Where are you going?

1049
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,800
I'm going to tehran iran

1050
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:53,440
Because frank sinatra is performing there i'm gonna do a podcast with frank sinatra said you're doing a podcast with frank sinatra in tehran iran sick

1051
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,040
You would have been able to say that in 76 in 75

1052
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,680
So the middle east was fairly peaceful not perfect, but it was peaceful

1053
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,120
But at the same time it you know, you got to ask the question

1054
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,560
Had it israel with the best

1055
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:16,400
Intelligence masad not know that for one year hamas was training for this

1056
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:22,720
How did you not know that they went and built a city similar to the one that you haven't trained on how to break into homes and take hostages?

1057
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,520
You didn't know that you really didn't know that

1058
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,120
And intelligence gave you a report from here from egypt

1059
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,680
But you didn't know that it's a fair question to ask but when you ask that question guess what people say

1060
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:38,320
What kind of a question is that this is not the time to ask that question. Do you realize what they're doing to kids?

1061
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,240
I don't support it

1062
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:45,120
I'm not supporting any of that stuff. Then I got another question because palestinian said that's exactly right

1063
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:49,440
This was intentional by israel. They know what I asked palestinians and they also don't ask this question

1064
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,120
Here's a question

1065
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,120
If you're so peaceful

1066
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,680
Who knows more about palestinians?

1067
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,120
us

1068
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:03,120
Who live in america or uk or your neighbor if you live in a condo or if you live in a house

1069
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,640
And you've been living in this house for five years or 10 years

1070
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,360
You have a neighbor on this side. You have a neighbor on this side

1071
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,800
You know when they do barbecues, you know, how much they drink

1072
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:18,400
You know who in which in-laws comes in, you know the son when he sneaks in the girlfriend at one o'clock in the morning

1073
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:23,600
You know the daughter when she sneaks out and changes her skirt and gets into a car with that bad boy and goes out and does

1074
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,320
What she does and she comes back at four o'clock. You know your neighbors. You see all their mess. Okay

1075
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,240
If if palestine

1076
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,800
In gazes filled with so many peaceful people. Why is egypt not taking them?

1077
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,920
As refugees to go to egypt egypt knows a lot about you. Why is it only 800 people?

1078
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,680
Why are they not letting a million people come to you? So somebody may say

1079
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:52,720
What a shameful question for you to ask. How dare you ask the question? I think both questions need to be asked

1080
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:59,040
What you do with it is up to you. Okay, so for me this whole concept of when you're winning

1081
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,080
Don't believe the hype when you're losing. Don't believe the hype

1082
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:08,080
Whatever story even your own side is saying. Why don't you be skeptical a little bit and question it for yourself and see if you can

1083
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,920
entertain both ideas

1084
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:15,600
I want to find ways to entertain both ideas as much as possible because I find myself becoming sharper when I do

1085
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:18,400
That and I eliminate blind spots anytime

1086
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,520
100% one side have way too many blind spots. We'll get back to talking to patrick in one minute

1087
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,280
But first I need to tell you about fountain life. Here's a crazy statistic

1088
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,560
Nearly 70% of heart attacks occur without any

1089
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:37,040
Prior symptoms simply put the human body is really good at hiding disease and this is where fountain life comes in

1090
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:42,880
They provide top of the line health snapshots vetted therapeutics and a team of longevity physicians

1091
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:50,880
So that you can live a longer healthier and more vital life in seemingly healthy adults fountain life's initial results have shown

1092
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:58,080
2% have cancer 2 and a half percent have a potential ruptured aneurysm looming in their future and over

1093
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,160
14% have a critical life saving finding right now

1094
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:07,680
You can get the exact treatment that I got by going to the link in the description below or heading to fountain life

1095
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:14,720
Dot com slash modern wisdom using the form on that page to get $500 off their apex membership

1096
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,800
That's fountain life dot com

1097
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:23,280
Slash modern wisdom. Do you think that we're obliged to have a take on everything because I haven't

1098
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:29,280
Got involved in the israel palestine conflict and there's a lot of people that are very unhappy

1099
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:36,480
The silence is violence crowd your silence is deafening. Why haven't you come out in support or against this group or that group?

1100
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,440
Is it an obligation for us all to have a take on everything?

1101
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:44,880
If if the background has to do anything with you, I think you are obligated to talk about it

1102
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:49,360
Meaning if you're a jew, I think you have to if you're palestinian you have to

1103
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:55,360
If you're a muslim, I think you have to because it's your community. It's your pride. It's your background

1104
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:00,960
If you're a political show and you've spoken about ukraine and russia

1105
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,680
And you've touched that topic. Why are you not touching this topic now?

1106
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,720
I don't know if you have no no no no to all of the above then guess what that means then you're consistent

1107
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:15,200
So no you don't have to if you've been consistent with all of it. You don't have to talk about it

1108
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:19,760
That's not what the show is about you could simply say you want to hear that show go to ben Shapiro

1109
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:25,600
Well, what people are saying they're not saying why haven't you commented specifically what your position is what they want

1110
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:33,120
What they're saying is why haven't you said the thing that supports the stance that I want you to take for each of them

1111
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,240
No, why haven't I come in and done edit at all?

1112
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,280
I mean listen

1113
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,520
There there's a lot of events in the world that if you and I have to comment on all of them

1114
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:45,760
We don't have a life you would have to do 12 hour podcasts to cover everything on a daily basis. No

1115
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,440
But this is a

1116
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:54,720
Once in 50 years type of crisis that could lead to a world war three numbers came yesterday

1117
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,880
Were ray dalio, I don't know if you've sat down with ray dalio. Okay, so you know who ray dalio is

1118
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,280
He's a 20 billion dollar man built an incredible company

1119
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,080
I had him on as well ray dalio yesterday said

1120
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:11,040
The chance of world war three is officially at 50% and jayme diamond yesterday said

1121
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,960
These are the most dangerous times we're living in decades

1122
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,680
Okay, so one may say

1123
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,400
Well, you get tens of millions of eyeballs

1124
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,120
You're no longer somebody that gets

1125
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:29,280
Back in the days your first show when you did were 220 people watching a mom and dad didn't watch it

1126
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,640
Your siblings didn't watch your best friends didn't watch it. No now you're getting

1127
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,720
Well, that's the interesting question, right?

1128
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:40,800
Whether somebody with a sufficiently large platform is obligated to comment on things simply because they have a large platform

1129
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,000
And you ask why whether I haven't why I haven't if I haven't

1130
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:49,760
I found out about the incidents that were going on in the middle east on twitter

1131
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:57,840
Two days after they happened and I wondered why hammers was trending and I thought what the fuck's hammers. Oh, fuck. That's Hamas

1132
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:01,280
That was two days after everything had happened by this time

1133
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,360
I'd already had texts from people saying dude like

1134
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,240
Are you gonna get you're gonna do an episode on this and I was like

1135
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,600
bro

1136
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:13,040
The requisite amount of understanding for me to be able to add an educated opinion to this topic

1137
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,200
Is not one that I have time to do. I mentioned to you earlier on we've been traveling. We were in la

1138
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:21,920
We were there for two days all I did all I've done for the last week is travel

1139
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:27,520
Sleep research and record and I've researched very specific guests. I haven't been researching stuff about the middle east, right?

1140
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,240
So that's all I've had time to do

1141
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:37,360
Is it not the precise problem that people who do not know what they're talking about have given

1142
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:44,640
Cod psychology insights way outside of their domain of expertise and just added to the noise rather than adding to the signal

1143
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,800
And yet there is a group of people on the internet that would say no

1144
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,400
But this is so important to me that it's something that should move

1145
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:57,520
Aside the other things that you're doing in life. And I think a final element of this is

1146
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,320
people who are chronically online

1147
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,760
Cannot understand what it's like to not be chronically online

1148
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,880
I am chronically online for periods

1149
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:12,880
And then I am chronically traveling around and researching and recording and going from hotel to hotel coming out to florida

1150
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,520
This is one of those periods during which

1151
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,400
There's a lot of reading that needs to be done

1152
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:22,960
To make a comment to contribute to something that lots of people who are better educated than me can do

1153
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,200
It's the same reason I didn't comment on covid

1154
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,120
Covid was something that was happening. We did a a couple of

1155
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,640
Episodes explaining how we felt people could better work from home some mental health tools that we thought that they could use

1156
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:40,240
Some strategies that they could do to improve their time blocking and some stuff like that

1157
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:43,200
Here's how we would design your homework station. I'm like

1158
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:48,080
If you want me to comment and just throw horseshit at the wind

1159
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,480
I can do it, but I don't think that it's going to benefit anything. So yeah, there's this

1160
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,120
compulsion

1161
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,120
this obligation I think that uh

1162
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,840
certain groups on the internet feel

1163
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:06,560
Anybody that comments on things should get themselves involved with and uh, it's just are you surprised?

1164
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,640
No, no at all because what they want, but again, they don't want you to comment

1165
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:16,320
They want you to support their side. No, that's a different story that that that's a different story. There's a difference between

1166
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,360
commenting and supporting right

1167
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:23,360
I'm not if I comment i'm giving you my thoughts

1168
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,160
and i'm gonna share with you my

1169
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,480
uh, uh

1170
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,480
You know opinion

1171
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:34,800
Thoughts on my life experience on what I think is going on and then from there

1172
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,960
Agree or disagree for the people who are asking you to contribute

1173
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,960
if your thoughts and your life experience led you to

1174
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:44,240
Uh

1175
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:48,640
Implicate one side rather than the other sound like you were being more generous to one side rather than the other

1176
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,160
They would very quickly say I wanted you to comment, but I didn't want you to say that

1177
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,760
They would very quickly have an issue. Is that your brand though? Is your brand?

1178
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,080
Uh, uh of 700 episodes 2500 clips

1179
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:06,320
You know is your brand given opinion on current events? Have you done that in the past?

1180
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,960
Because here's what happens. So

1181
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:16,000
In the market, you know how in hollywood. They say this guy's a triple threat. What's a triple threat act sing dance

1182
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:22,880
Okay, in podcasting. There's also triple threats. Okay. What's a triple threat a great interviewer?

1183
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,840
Which you are but that's one of three

1184
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,800
two is

1185
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,800
perspective and opinion

1186
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:34,880
Which joe rogan is people want to hear what joe has to say about this

1187
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,680
And in three is entertain

1188
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:42,640
Can you entertain me while you're giving me your perspective or asking questions where i'm kind of like

1189
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,240
Man, I was funny as hell. Yeah. So joe the reason why joe is number one is because

1190
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,560
joe's

1191
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,560
great host

1192
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,600
We want to hear his perspective agree or disagree. He has the

1193
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:02,400
He has the conviction and the confidence to give a side and be willing to change. Hey one minute. You're voting for bernie sanders

1194
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:07,200
Four years later. You're saying to save america. You got to vote for trump and republican. What?

1195
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,920
What are you talking about? Right?

1196
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,040
So then three is he entertains you he makes you laugh

1197
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,560
Your brand

1198
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,480
You have to take the risk whether you want to go to two

1199
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:25,120
I don't think you need to comment on absolutely everything if joe was to be asked

1200
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,680
What do you think of aron roger's most recent achilles rupture?

1201
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,160
As you said earlier on that's not a but there's a different story with that

1202
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:37,760
You asked about consistency earlier on ukraine russia didn't comment on covet didn't comment on and that's your brand then

1203
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,880
But but by the way, what you just said is

1204
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:47,120
Your perspective absolutely, but it's a meta perspective on what's going on. You're not going to please everybody though

1205
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:50,320
Look, i'm armenian and assyrian. Okay, so now i was born in iran. So here's where i'm screwed

1206
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,360
i'm a half armenian half assyrian born in iran

1207
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,840
And i'm an american, okay

1208
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:00,640
So for the emulsmen of the apocalypse. Oh my god. So whenever something happens with armenian genocide

1209
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,920
I have to within a second comment on it. Okay

1210
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:07,920
And I do but now within a second because I don't have intel

1211
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:11,280
So when you're talking about your days what it looks like research all that stuff

1212
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,280
You're telling the truth

1213
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,880
But i'm running nine companies and I got a wife and I got four kids and i'm

1214
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:23,280
Transitioning with another company and i'm doing research on a podcast and i'm doing the interviews and i'm running a tech startup

1215
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,480
And i'm running a consulting firm with clients that are traveling worldwide to come to us

1216
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,000
And i'm doing our our best to kind of see what's going on with stories

1217
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,800
Yeah, there's going to be days you just don't have time and the audience

1218
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,480
Can't understand and cannot understand it right? That's a decision they got to make

1219
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:41,040
Uh, so assyrians. Hey, did you see what happened at that theater?

1220
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,480
What are you going to comment at this wedding that just took place and a hundred people were dead

1221
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:49,120
And a place caught on fire and these people. Okay, great. Let me get some intel and then i'll comment on it

1222
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:55,920
And then I did you know or iran or you know, but but the natural part where I would take it as a

1223
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,720
compliment is the audience

1224
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,080
is

1225
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,600
leaning on

1226
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,760
You to see how you would assess this issue and they trust the way you reason

1227
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:09,920
And nowadays there's not enough people who are able to reason

1228
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,840
To give a different perspective because they simply don't trust mainstream media

1229
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,920
But then the next step is do you want to take the risk of going in that side?

1230
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:24,800
If your brand is not on covet not on uh, ukraine not on this then you're staying consistent. I think largely the main

1231
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,760
Lesson I learned I learned this from douglas murray is that there are a lot of people in the online space

1232
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:33,760
Who do not have expertise within a particular domain and have it in another one

1233
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:40,560
They have expertise within psychology or climate change or whatever it might be and then they start thinking to themselves. Well

1234
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,120
Why

1235
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,720
Why shouldn't my thoughts on the ukraine be important to people?

1236
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:53,600
What everybody thinks that my insights about climate change are absolutely wonderful and they start to get out over the skis

1237
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:57,680
Outside of their domain of competence. If you want to talk about my domains of competence

1238
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,160
I'll comment on it

1239
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,160
For me, there are people out there who are

1240
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:07,920
Capable prepared to do the work have the time and have the expertise. I don't think that the internet needs more noise

1241
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:12,000
I think it needs more signal and I would be contributing nothing short of noise if I did that

1242
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:19,520
I'm also just not passionate about learning about this topic and I understand that in order for me to give the

1243
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:27,200
For me to meet the bar of evidence and insight that I would want to to feel proud about my opinion

1244
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:32,080
I need to be passionate about it. Right. I need to be compelled to learn about passion about life

1245
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,920
Of course I am

1246
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,040
Would you like to live 200 years old? Yes. Okay

1247
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,280
So do many of your listeners because the feedback you give

1248
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:45,120
Has to do with living a great life because people are watching the life you're living

1249
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,040
The only thing I would encourage you to consider from the audience side

1250
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,680
Is this is a different crisis

1251
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,840
This crisis

1252
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:59,840
If reasonable people like you can find a way to lower the overreaction that people are having

1253
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:05,120
With everything that's out there. I would say you would actually contribute to lowering the

1254
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,760
overreaction community

1255
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:08,640
so

1256
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:13,680
I'm I'm simply complimenting you to consider the fact that people are looking to see

1257
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:20,320
How a reasonable person like you that can give a logical perspective because that's what's missing today

1258
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,000
and

1259
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,760
When a Ray Dalio

1260
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,320
When a Jamie Dimon when many of these guys are saying 50 percent

1261
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:33,040
And you with your millions of people who listen to you can and it's not a

1262
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:38,720
Niche audience where it's in one country or two countries your audience is worldwide 100 plus countries. You got people listening to you

1263
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,920
I think maybe from that level the

1264
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,920
Feedback from the audience could be this is not a regular issue

1265
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:50,160
We'd like to hear your thoughts and then whether you choose to do it or not. It's your prerogative and we move on

1266
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,640
Yeah, you've got uh

1267
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:55,920
You mentioned there about this sort of loss of faith in our institutions

1268
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:00,080
Right the previous gatekeepers the people that we would have relied on to

1269
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,720
Tell us what what in the world?

1270
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:07,600
What do you think about this rising skepticism?

1271
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:11,440
Uh, there is also a degree of conspiratorial thinking

1272
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:15,440
heterodox cynicism around what we're being told

1273
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:21,120
Is this leaving a vacuum where people's uncertainty is making their lives worse?

1274
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:27,520
What is going to happen from a a sense making because how do people make sense of the world when we can't trust the

1275
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,680
information

1276
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,440
communicators

1277
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:37,920
Well, that's the that's why they want to hear from you. So so what you're saying is is validating their point. So in america today

1278
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:44,800
We are at the lowest levels. We've ever been for americans trusting mainstream media and trusting the government

1279
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:49,680
Not one or the others the lowest in both. We don't trust the government. We don't trust mainstream media

1280
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:56,000
The last time the the people trusted mainstream media and the government the highest was right before kennedy died after that

1281
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,320
That was at 72 percent. It's gone from 72 65 60

1282
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:04,560
Down to today 27 percent people simply don't trust

1283
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:10,320
The mainstream media to get feedback on what's really taking place. There's a reason why rogan

1284
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:16,560
Gets more eyeballs on his show than all these guys combined and people are watching to see what he has to say

1285
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:21,680
There's a reason why shepiro gets the eyeballs. He gets there's a reason why you get the eyeballs

1286
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,680
There's a reason why all these other guys get the eyeballs

1287
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:27,760
Is because they want to hear a different perspective, you know, we're going back to

1288
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:33,280
The the the story where you know in this quote's been criticized many times. It's not really true

1289
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,800
You know amateurs build

1290
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:39,360
You know professionals build the titanic amateurs build the arc, you know, this whole story that they go back and forth

1291
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:43,040
professionals run mainstream media amateurs run podcasting

1292
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:49,680
But the world is trusting amateurs running podcasting more than the people that build the titanic

1293
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,800
because a lot of people think mainstream media is about to

1294
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:57,120
Sink like the titanic dick now whether it did or not who knows but

1295
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:01,680
People want to talk to somebody just a regular guy says, you know, what's your story? What do you think about this?

1296
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:05,840
What are your thoughts on this? Do you really agree? Do I does anybody else feel I kind of feel that way as well?

1297
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:08,960
I'm a little bit skeptical. I'm a little bit worried about this. What's going on?

1298
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,920
Is it really as big as they make it out to be should I trust these guys?

1299
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,360
So I'm not surprised this is taking place. By the way, you know, what's the

1300
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:20,640
Only thing that's keeping mainstream media in business. It's only a couple things that keep in mainstream medium business

1301
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,600
number one is

1302
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,520
75 year olds

1303
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:30,960
70 75 year olds are keeping mainstream media in business. Okay, so that's another 10 to 15 years

1304
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:37,440
Before that generation is no longer here. That audience is gone. Number two is big pharma if

1305
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:44,560
Two countries in the world that allow big pharma companies to advertise it's us and new zealand every other country in the world

1306
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,160
You cannot advertise

1307
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:49,760
The only two countries in the world where pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer

1308
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,720
That can advertise is us and new zealand everywhere else. There is no commercials on tv

1309
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,960
Do you realize what would happen if a president?

1310
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:07,280
Did an executive order got congress everybody in it to say moving forward big pharma can no longer advertise on mainstream media

1311
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,440
You know what happens the next day

1312
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,840
Every one of them goes out of business

1313
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:18,560
And all these talented guys at espn or at cnn or fox or abc that are getting the 5 10 15 20 million dollar contract

1314
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:20,880
gone

1315
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,560
80 percent of revenue is gone

1316
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,240
And a lot of these guys now have to go and try to make it in the world that you're making it

1317
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:29,600
And this is what you're doing is hard. There's not a teleprompter behind me

1318
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:35,680
There's nobody whispering in your ears what to say follow up with this question. This is all you doing it, right to them

1319
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:41,680
Hey, ask him this follow up with this. We just found data 63 percent. He's lying follow up with this

1320
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:46,240
Did you watch any of the late night hosts when they tried to do a podcast between them? Yes

1321
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:53,840
What did you think from a professional's perspective a amateur professional's perspective? There's a reason why they can't do anything without writers

1322
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:59,040
You know, I mean don't get me wrong to me fallon is a very talented guy a very talented guy

1323
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:04,960
And you're not going to get to that job without having talent these guys got a lot of talent

1324
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:09,200
They're workers, but the moment writers are done. You mean to tell me for may 12th

1325
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:14,240
You guys can't do an episode until what october which they just started with two weeks ago

1326
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:19,360
You realize writers control this world now the writers are worried that chat gbt can write the

1327
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,880
Jokes of what's going on and what if a i can pop out these, you know

1328
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:28,480
Jokes and what could take place no this game is a very very hard game. This is not an easy game

1329
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,120
Think about what spot if I did

1330
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:36,080
What other president in the last 20 years has been as popular as obama

1331
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:42,960
And let me get this straight obama and another guy named bruce springsteen start a podcast and spot if I drop some what?

1332
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Who else has been more popular in the last 20 years on television than kim kardash in with 300 million followers on instagram

1333
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:56,640
Spotify signs a podcast with her then they drop her what?

1334
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:03,680
Who else has been more on tv and every magazine newspaper than harry and megan

1335
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:07,440
But spot if I drop their podcast and hasn't

1336
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Fully is like we're not renewing the contract and then they give rogan a few hundred wait what?

1337
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:19,200
So let me get this straight just being famous doesn't help to have a podcast. No wow

1338
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,640
I thought it was just about fame. No, this is hard. This is an art. This is very difficult to do

1339
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:28,000
It's not easy to do so if mainstream media

1340
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,480
Sinks like the titanic

1341
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:36,880
90% of that talent is going to disappear and they're not going to know what to do 90% of them

1342
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:41,440
It's not an easy game. There's does this mean or does this contribute to?

1343
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,440
Complicity or

1344
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:46,880
those

1345
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,320
Commentators and all of the other people whose wages ultimately are paid for by

1346
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,360
those adverts

1347
01:33:53,360 --> 01:34:00,400
Does this does this create a perverse incentive for them in what way that they may be

1348
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:06,800
Prepared to compromise something they truly think to not jeopardize the people that ultimately pay their wages

1349
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:11,120
That there is a risk to them saying something out of turn which may

1350
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,840
I mean are you really asking that question or you know the answer to that question? You already know the answer

1351
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:22,000
You're a smart guy. Yeah. No, of course they they they have to they don't have a choice to take that position, right?

1352
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:27,440
I'll give you an idea. Chris Cuomo was on cnn for god knows how many years and he was a number one guy for two or three years

1353
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:30,160
What does cnn do to chris?

1354
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:31,440
fired

1355
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,440
his brother andrew Cuomo governor

1356
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,120
fired

1357
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:38,640
And then he's got a hundred twenty five million dollar pending lawsuit against cnn

1358
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:43,520
and now cnn folks can't talk to chris. I had him on the podcast and

1359
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:47,200
For the longest time Cuomo was hated by a lot of people on the right

1360
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:50,080
Absolutely hated because of the stuff you would say where is jesus?

1361
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:54,720
Jesus going to come and save you with covet. What's jesus going to do for you and all this stuff you would say, right?

1362
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:56,720
well

1363
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,560
He came on a podcast

1364
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:05,360
And i'm with one of my partners in dalas. He's a billionaire himself in the insurance, but he's the number one power player in insurance

1365
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:11,360
We're at his uh, uh office corner office on the top one the sickest office you'll see in your life like 60 at floor

1366
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,360
He's overlooking all of dalas

1367
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,600
brine and he says

1368
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:19,600
You know, it's kind of weird watching Cuomo on your podcast. I said why?

1369
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,320
He says he sounded different

1370
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:27,280
You know those moments where I kind of liked him when I was watching this and this is not a guy

1371
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,760
I can say something like that with you know how many people said that

1372
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:37,680
What happened to him? He's now a free agent. He's got a shirt. He sells that's called free agent. He's got a podcast that says, you know

1373
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:40,080
You know

1374
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:44,640
With something Cuomo project that he's got a podcast and how does he dress like you?

1375
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,040
we're with him a couple weeks ago in uh, what do you call it in um

1376
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:53,120
sag harbor in uh, up in uh

1377
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,480
That entire area whatever that area is I forget the name

1378
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,520
uh, sagaponic sag harbor all that stuff

1379
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:04,640
And we'll go to his house. My kids are running on the back. He said pat somebody wants to talk to you

1380
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:08,800
I said, who's that facetime? It was like this like, oh shit

1381
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,840
What's up robert downey jr. How you doing?

1382
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,560
So i'm having a conversation with him

1383
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:20,000
But forget about talking to robert downey jr. I wanted to see my kids reaction, especially my two boys

1384
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,320
Because my boys when he died

1385
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,200
My kids were devastated

1386
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:31,120
When he dies iron man dies in you know in the do you know what today is in the marvel cinematic universe?

1387
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:34,000
Today is the canonical death day

1388
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:41,040
Of tony stark when he clicks his fingers today is the day the date get out of here today is the date

1389
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,320
I did not know that

1390
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:45,120
What is the chance of me bringing up the sword and I don't even know that story

1391
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:50,000
So I said dylan tico come here. So daddy will run around with the dogs. I said trust me

1392
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,080
Come here

1393
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,640
And chris turns the camera around he goes like this

1394
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:56,720
My son goes

1395
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,000
Oh my god

1396
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,720
Zion man, I know you and then the other son tico his reaction dylan's reaction

1397
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:06,880
You know, you love robert downey's one of those guys that you absolutely love when you go back to his journey

1398
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:10,080
I was talking about the movie that my dad and I watched 30 years ago only you

1399
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:16,000
And the only movie I've ever watched four hours two hours and two back to back in a row was judge

1400
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:20,480
This by robert downey jr. What's the moral of the story the moment chris coma was free

1401
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,560
And he didn't give a shit

1402
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:27,120
He just kind of told you what he was kind of going through

1403
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:33,040
Would you like it or not? You may not agree with everything, but he's finally free a lot of these guys working on mainstream media

1404
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,600
They're not free. I mean now see took his transition

1405
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,240
And guess what he's killing it. Okay

1406
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:41,280
Love them or hate them when tucker puts on a show

1407
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:46,560
Everybody's watching what this guy's got to say. So I found out from the guys that

1408
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:52,560
Light and tech all of this stuff that we're doing here who understand very very very closely what's going on

1409
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:57,520
Bennett was it anamorphic lenses? Is that what they shot took his first thing in his garage with?

1410
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:05,280
Yeah, so anamorphic lenses a very particular type of lens very particular type of shooting very

1411
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:09,360
Uh short wide so it has the

1412
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:15,680
Image of maybe it was his garage or something like that or a living room with the background behind him make no mistake

1413
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:17,200
that is

1414
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,720
lit and shot

1415
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:19,680
in

1416
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:26,160
Cinema quality right with the facade of it being a sort of low budget thing, right?

1417
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:32,240
So it's this beautiful on an iphone. Yeah, precisely. It's this beautiful blending of both and uh

1418
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:37,040
That's exciting. I think it's exciting to see what these guys do and also, you know, I love this about

1419
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,680
Given that we spend so much time talking and and people have this

1420
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:48,160
Uh concern about whether or not someone's gaming the system. Are they trying to growth hack relatability? Right or authenticity?

1421
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:54,480
Seeing I would be lying if I said that I didn't take an amount of pleasure to see late night hosts

1422
01:38:54,480 --> 01:39:00,960
that have got massive platforms struggle to hold a conversation together for an hour over zoom because

1423
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:08,480
That is ultimately the battle place of ideas, right? It's not how well can you read a script from a teleprompter?

1424
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:13,120
I mean, there is skill absolutely skill in being able to do that and I couldn't I couldn't do the writing

1425
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:16,320
I couldn't do the performance. I couldn't do the bits and the blah blah the music

1426
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,960
but

1427
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:25,280
Largely you are a marionette, right? That's being ventriloquized by a handful of writers and and execs

1428
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,400
Ultimately seeing what you can do

1429
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:34,720
When the gloves are off is more interesting to me. This is very hard. This is this is very hard because

1430
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,440
How long is your average podcast?

1431
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,400
Hour and a half

1432
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,200
Okay

1433
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:46,160
So an hour and a half of keeping people's interests with no breaks and nobody talking to you and touching up the makeup to them

1434
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:53,040
What are you talking about? That is absolutely insane to do something like that. No

1435
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:58,000
This is very hard and the market is proven that this isn't for everybody

1436
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:04,160
The market is proven. You cannot keep my attention for that long. This is very very difficult when when people start to say

1437
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:06,160
and I remember I hired a

1438
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,520
marketing expert

1439
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:12,800
You know 13 years ago 14 years ago. He came in and said well studies. I've shown you're making one of the mistakes

1440
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,520
You're making on youtube your videos are about 12 minutes long

1441
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,280
And the only videos that do well is 12 minutes after 12 minutes that I said nah, man

1442
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:22,880
I'm doing 42 minutes 28 minutes hour and 20 minutes. That's a mistake

1443
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:26,400
Number one thing we have to do is no video can go past 13 minutes

1444
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:32,880
Like dude, okay, maybe this guy's the expert. He sold this company for a couple million. You know what happened the day we fired him

1445
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:37,840
60 days later our first video goes viral and gets 40 million views today

1446
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:42,640
It's got a half a billion views. Okay for the life of an entrepreneur in 90 second takes off, right?

1447
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:48,400
And we start making other clips and other videos and other stuff and ec joe takes it to a whole different level

1448
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:53,360
Three hours and you got lex freedman takes it to a different level four hours three hours and 48 minutes

1449
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:56,240
You know, yeah, what lex does he did seven hours with balaji

1450
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:00,160
Glutton for punishment

1451
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,840
Yeah, you um you tweeted something that I thought was quite interesting

1452
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:10,240
You said why do so many people who come to the america from other countries with little to no money at all?

1453
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:15,200
within 10 years outpace the average person who was born here

1454
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:24,320
What is going on where americans who have all of the i'm an immigrant to this country, right?

1455
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:30,560
Many people who are given from the very beginning all of the benefits of being from this country

1456
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,640
Why is it that they are outpaced by people who weren't born here?

1457
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,520
so

1458
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,040
Six seven months ago

1459
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:43,360
I'm sitting with my state planner and one of the fears I have for the last 10 years is

1460
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:46,720
What i'm going to do with my kids with the wealth with money?

1461
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:49,520
Am I raising them in a way that they're not going to turn out being the

1462
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:56,080
You know the snobby arrogant kid that you know the spoon. Oh man, I cannot say I never liked those kids in school

1463
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:58,560
Those are the kids I got into fights, but I never liked those kids

1464
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:03,360
So I don't want to raise those types of kids and then you go and read these books about which families

1465
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:08,800
Generationally created a wealth that state like Vanderbilt raised a bunch of snobs

1466
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:13,920
So Vanderbilt's money only lasted one generation generation later. There's no money left

1467
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:17,440
So when you read the story about that anderson cooper's a Vanderbilt

1468
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:21,040
But his mother said even though we were Vanderbilt don't expect any kind of trust fund baby

1469
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,760
You ain't got no money here. Nothing's coming over till you got to make your money

1470
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:29,680
You know and but you look at the medici family and what they did five six seven generation

1471
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,560
What did they do differently? You look at Rockefeller still has the money

1472
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:36,400
You look at some of these other families that kept the money within the family

1473
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:40,800
What did they do? What did they structure and there's a state plan and we can go do, you know

1474
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:47,680
10 15 20 50 thousand dollars then there's hot guys. You can hire. That's a hundred thousand quarter million a million dollars

1475
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:52,400
But those are state planners when you hire, you know what they do they interview your kids

1476
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:56,000
so they go sit down with your kids and

1477
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:00,960
After they talk to you and they'll say how do you want to set the stuff for the money with your kids?

1478
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:04,720
Who gets money? What do they need to do? What's the criteria or your gift to get this?

1479
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:08,640
What kind of cars do you now want them to buy to waste the money? Who do you want it to work for?

1480
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:11,600
What happens with this business? Can they lose all the money? Are you given equally?

1481
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Here's what this family and they give you all these suggestions on how to properly set it up

1482
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:20,080
Once you and your wife agree on what you want to do with that wealth

1483
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:23,680
These guys have meetings with all your kids

1484
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,160
without you there

1485
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:30,880
And they'll record it so you can see how the meeting went went but they're setting it up with them

1486
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,880
So they'll say okay kids. This is uh

1487
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:36,080
On behalf of your parents, here's a few things you need to know

1488
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:37,920
number one

1489
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:42,000
Um, the good news is your parents are very prepared on what they've done with you

1490
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,960
And here's what you can get your parents have worked very hard

1491
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:49,280
And they have made a lot of money and if you do it, right? Some of that can be passed over to you

1492
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:52,720
But if you don't you're not going to get it either. Let me go through some of these criteria

1493
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:58,320
These three things you do you're not going to get anything these two things you do

1494
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,720
If you do this, here's what's going to happen. This is what they want to see use the money with

1495
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,880
And then they kind of break it down to them

1496
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:05,520
now

1497
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,520
You know how many families actually do that

1498
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:11,920
Very few those conversations most people don't have most people are so much about go go go go go go go go

1499
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:17,520
And then you die unexpectedly. Oh, we didn't set up the state planning let alone the detail the state planning. No

1500
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,400
Okay, now your kids are spoiled right and doing what they're doing. I've had this conversation with a number of friends

1501
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:26,720
Ben Francis who is the CEO of gymshark his net worth is triple drakes

1502
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:31,840
Um, he's the start of a guy by the way. He's a serious. I had him on the podcast a couple years ago start serious dude

1503
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:35,360
Yeah, uh, I was talking to him and I think that it's the same with you

1504
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:42,000
One of the things that you value the most in your upbringing have been the hard times the spit and sawdust

1505
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:45,440
Lessons and rules the hard school of hard knocks, right?

1506
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:50,000
That's given you the work rate that has permitted you to be able to achieve the success that you have and

1507
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:56,960
Reverse locally reverse entropy, right? So you've been able to wrangle your reality in a way that you want it to

1508
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,600
Mm-hmm. And yet

1509
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:04,000
You have worked so hard to be able to give your kids

1510
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:10,640
Opportunities that you never had. Mm-hmm. And yet, you know that they need to go through the hardships

1511
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:15,440
And that those are where the lessons are learned that are going to bear them. This to me seems like a very

1512
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:21,680
Uh, interesting tension, right? I want to give my kids opportunities that I've worked so hard for if I don't

1513
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:26,560
What the fuck was the point in you working so hard, right? And yet they need to go through the difficulty

1514
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:31,680
They need to do how have you found this tension between the two?

1515
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:32,960
Well, that's a great question

1516
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:35,760
But I want to finalize by making a point when you ask the question about

1517
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:40,400
Why is it that so many people come to america within 10 years to have more money than the people that were born in america?

1518
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,720
because

1519
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,720
unfortunately

1520
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:49,680
The way we've ran america if the american-born kids

1521
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:53,200
Are kids of these families?

1522
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,920
They're the kids of the families that spoiled

1523
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,560
them in america

1524
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:03,200
There's no more earning things in america. It's just handed out to them. We're printing money left and right

1525
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:08,160
We're giving away income to people left and right. We're making life easier

1526
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:15,680
We're incentivizing the wrong things. Do you know in 1940 in america what percentage of kids were born to single mothers in 1940?

1527
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:17,680
in america

1528
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:22,320
What percentage of kids were born to a single mother who's not married with no father in the household?

1529
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:27,200
4% is the number. Did you know the number or no? It's 4%. You know what that number is today?

1530
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,040
Over 50

1531
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:32,000
It's over 40 shy of 50 percent. You're right there at the number

1532
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:37,120
You mean to tell me we went from 1944 percent to today. So what happened there?

1533
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:38,720
first of all

1534
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,320
policies by fdr

1535
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:46,880
Social security and incentives of taking care of single mothers then linden johnson in 1965 took it to a whole different level

1536
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:51,440
Mothers are sitting there saying the more kids I have the more entitled programs. I get great. Why would I get married?

1537
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,760
If I get married, I lose those benefits

1538
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:56,320
The incentive programs america set up

1539
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:02,400
Totally screwed everything up. It incentivized the bad behaviors like telling a kid

1540
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:09,280
Can you imagine if you're in estate planning you say for every kid you have not married? I'll pay you 700 dollars

1541
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,920
Whose fault is that parents fault?

1542
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:15,520
Bad policies have consequences. Yeah, you create a bad policies

1543
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,480
What person in the right state of mind?

1544
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:22,560
When they have their wealth america's a family. It's a corporation

1545
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:28,400
What person in the right mind would incentivize what parents would incentivize kids to say i'm gonna have more kids

1546
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:31,920
And i'm gonna give you money out of the living trust nobody in the right mind would do that

1547
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,880
But america did so what happened to us now we got all this crime

1548
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:39,280
Now we're paying the price for it because all these years there's no father in there to

1549
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:42,800
Put him in their place to challenge him to straighten them up. That's not in place

1550
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:46,160
You know, so that is a missing piece that these kids

1551
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:48,400
Don't have in america

1552
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:54,240
So to me if we looked at america as a family as a corporation estate planning matters

1553
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:58,400
You know living trust matters the right policies matters

1554
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:03,920
Listen, I even think to the point where you know how in america voting starts at 18 years old

1555
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,920
I would much rather this was a very

1556
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:12,880
Strange policy i'm gonna share with you when I posted this on on youtube a lot of people very upset with me

1557
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:15,280
I would much rather

1558
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:18,080
Have somebody who's 14 and a half years old

1559
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:20,720
Who's had a job?

1560
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:23,840
And paid a thousand dollars in taxes vote

1561
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:28,480
Then a 28 year old kid who's never had a job

1562
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:32,560
Never paid taxes. I don't want that guy to vote. Why?

1563
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:39,200
Because he contributed to society the 14 and a half year old kid the 15 year old kid contributed to society

1564
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:42,720
And realized how hard it is to pay the taxes into

1565
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:46,400
Whatever they're spending money on you want to spend a hundred billion dollars to

1566
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:49,200
Ukraine we could have built 20 walls

1567
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:54,400
We could have built 20 walls with that money that was sent you're not saying ukraine. I'm saying this so you're safe

1568
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,720
Don't worry. They're not they're not gonna come after you. They're gonna come after me

1569
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:01,760
So all of these things that you look at we're going away from earning

1570
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,400
When a immigrant comes here

1571
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:08,480
All they're looking at saying wait a minute. I can go work this and do this and do this and do this and i'm gonna earn this

1572
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,680
Yes, i'm going i'm going town all day. I'm good with this

1573
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:17,040
Many americans don't have that mindset because bad policies have consequences that we're suffering

1574
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:21,200
Uh, uh the negative impact of that but you ask the follow-up question

1575
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,720
Right with kids and your question is how to balance it with

1576
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:28,800
Challenge in them yet still having the opportunity. What was the question you were asking?

1577
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:33,440
Yeah, the tension between you affording your kids the benefits that all of your hard workers

1578
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:38,640
Allow them to do and some greetings. I'm very greedy and here's what i mean by i'm very greedy

1579
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:41,360
I want my kids

1580
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:43,360
As close to me for the rest of my life

1581
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:45,680
We have a family that lives in our community

1582
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,520
Uh message just bought a house right next to our house and he just moved into the community

1583
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:52,480
He caused a lot of mayhem. It's all over the place cops are coming in every week

1584
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:55,920
We have you know, what do you call it paparazzi craziness that's going on

1585
01:49:56,080 --> 01:50:01,600
But one of the families that lives in our community they they run a medical company with six seven thousand employees

1586
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:05,360
So the the founders the mom and dad their house is here

1587
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:08,240
Right next door to the house

1588
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:13,680
They have two sons the other son lives here. Who's the chief marketing officer? They're all the son's house is here

1589
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:16,560
Each son has four kids

1590
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,960
Each son has four kids

1591
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:25,200
Both sons are doctors both sons married someone who's a doctor and they each have four kids

1592
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:29,040
They have a structure on what they do monday nights every tuesday night

1593
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:34,320
They have dinner together and they talk about god everyone's there's a system to everything they do

1594
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:38,400
He'll call me and say hey, we went fishing this morning. I got a bunch of fish. Can I drop it off to you?

1595
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:44,560
I am enamored by how those parents created that kind of a structure where their kids are respectful

1596
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:49,840
Their grandkids are respectful go on a halloween. We're walking in halloween doing trick or treating and

1597
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,400
The

1598
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:58,160
Son comes by 17 year old son comes by and he says yeah, he doesn't have his iphone with him

1599
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:01,760
I said, how does he know it not have it not have his iphone with him? He says in our family standard

1600
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:05,040
It's very easy. You want your phone you got to have straight a's he's got to be

1601
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:10,800
I said, well, let me get to straight your 17 year old son doesn't have a phone because he doesn't have one

1602
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,200
Because he has one because yeah, it's our standard

1603
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:16,800
I said, what are you talking about? This is very simple. You just got to make sure you got straight a's

1604
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:19,120
You'll get a phone you get the car you get this

1605
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:25,280
Now somebody's going to listen to this and say what what a freaking extreme set of standards. That's tyranny. That's tyranny

1606
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:31,760
That's exactly the type of kids that end up becoming da da da. No problem. It's called standards and expectations

1607
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:34,720
And for a family who has the ability

1608
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:38,480
To use money and waste it and do whatever they want to keep that kind of standards

1609
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:42,080
I respect that even more and guess what the son loves his father

1610
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:45,440
Loves his mother loves their grandparents respectful kids

1611
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,840
So it's it's not easy to do

1612
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:50,960
But if it matters to you eventually in my life when I say I'm greedy

1613
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:55,680
I would love to create a proposition for my kids. We're 20 years from now. They want to run one of the companies

1614
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:56,720
I want to be within the company

1615
01:51:56,720 --> 01:52:01,040
They want to work with one of the companies and I like them to live close to me. Will it happen

1616
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:06,480
It's going to take us 30 years to find out because dude pan generational housing. I'm seeing it in austin, right?

1617
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:12,160
Commune or ranch where someone's buying up a ton of land and then there's another one of those puppies down there

1618
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:16,320
If you want to they're buying up a ton of land and we're going to not just have us

1619
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,320
We're going to have somebody else come and live with us as well

1620
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:22,480
We're going to have grandma and grandpa and they're going to be that this is the way that it was

1621
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:25,600
This is the way that it was and here's another thing to consider, right?

1622
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:31,280
Would you rather have drinking too? Going to do anything to me or no, what's you're going to survive?

1623
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:34,320
You're going to be dialed in you're going to survive. I promise

1624
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,520
Whatever whatever the internet throws at you. You'll survive. So

1625
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:40,480
What is the uh

1626
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:45,840
Yeah, so we've got that's citrus that one's orange one sunrise. Okay, yeah wild citrus so

1627
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:50,400
One of the interesting questions that you have here would be

1628
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:57,760
Would you rather have a parent who pities you more than they believe in you?

1629
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:03,440
You didn't do well. It's okay. That teacher doesn't understand

1630
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:07,280
Let me pat you on the back come here little timmy will take you for ice cream

1631
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,440
Or would you rather have a parent who says

1632
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,640
I believe in you more than more than I pity you

1633
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:18,160
I mean look, I'll tell you my dad very annoying man. Okay

1634
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,320
because

1635
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,960
Never sympathized never felt sorry for anything

1636
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:27,200
Never it was always stands on expectation, but he always loved me

1637
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:30,720
So when I was six years old and my teacher asked me what do you want to be when you grow up?

1638
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:34,080
I said I want to be a father. Why I said because I want to be like my dad

1639
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:39,040
I had a very good dad. My dad's still with us. He was in a hospital this week, but he's out. He's doing good. He's at the house

1640
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:43,520
Kids love him. Everybody loves him. My kids all have a relationship with him. He's 81 years old

1641
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:48,880
It took a lot to please my dad my dad wasn't impressed by anything

1642
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:51,280
He wouldn't be there and say, oh my gosh

1643
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:55,520
And by the way, he's a middle eastern father, which means I've never played catch with the guy

1644
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:01,600
We've never thrown the football. We never played anything. No sport. Why why he just he was a worker since eighth grade

1645
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:06,640
He dropped out in iran and started working to take care of his mom and dad. Their family was very very close

1646
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:12,400
You know, but again, remember how earlier on when we're talking about, you know, choosing your enemies wisely

1647
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:16,560
We talked about how the the top performers have

1648
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:18,320
a

1649
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:24,080
Person that gave him unconditional love and one that brought a lot of pain and then they chose their enemies wisely

1650
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:26,960
I think

1651
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:29,760
The role of a person that is gentle

1652
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:35,280
And another one that nothing's ever good enough is a great combination

1653
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:40,960
I think if both parents are gentle, that's a problem and I also think if both

1654
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:47,200
Parents are nothing's ever good enough is also a problem. Yeah, I think you need a little bit

1655
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:50,080
There's a reason why the creator god

1656
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,720
Created the dynamics that he created

1657
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:57,280
You know, I have a one of our guys we're spending our photographers with us

1658
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:00,560
And he's holding his daughter while we're doing a photo shoot this Saturday

1659
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:03,280
And she keeps asking for mom

1660
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:06,880
She keeps asking I said she's she daddy's girl. Oh, it's just now. It's all mommy

1661
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:10,000
I said, when does she want you whenever she's scared? She comes to me

1662
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:15,600
So the kid runs to daddy when she's scared but goes to mommy when she's hurt

1663
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:20,640
That's your interesting dynamic. How it is she feels safer

1664
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:23,920
By dad when there's a risk

1665
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:29,920
But feel safer by mom when she's hurt because she's gonna be pampered and taking care of it. Yeah

1666
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:35,360
I think that's very healthy combination. There was a quarterback bread far many years ago

1667
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:39,840
I don't know if you know, bear bread far. He's a famous texture. That's an inside joke if you know who he is but

1668
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:44,560
He has his quarterback

1669
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:46,560
He has his coach so tough on him

1670
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:51,440
So tough on him. Nothing was ever good with this quarterback kicking his ass

1671
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,400
Talking shit to him in the sideline. How could you throw that interception? What the fuck was that all about?

1672
01:55:56,400 --> 01:56:00,320
What was that all about and he's afraid of the coach and he's always escaping the coach

1673
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:04,240
But there was a guy that was I think his name was mariochi stave mariochi

1674
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:08,480
And he would always put his arm around and listen. He believes in you. Why don't you prove him right?

1675
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:12,640
Deep down inside. He believes in you go through the past that you know, he knows he can throw

1676
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:15,920
Show him exactly what we got. Let's go win this game for him. Let's go

1677
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:22,800
So that dynamic worked incredibly well for bread far as well as many other players out there

1678
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:24,560
So I think

1679
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:28,000
You know one without the other is a problem if you got both. It's a great combination

1680
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:30,960
Yeah, there's a lot of problems with

1681
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:32,960
fatherlessness in homes

1682
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:36,400
Melissa carney just wrote a new book called the two parent advantage

1683
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:42,960
Two parent privilege. Sorry and uh, dude, it's terrifying just the raw data the raw outcomes that you get

1684
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:47,920
Your mom and dad stay together. Yes. Okay. Uh, we till today. Yep only child

1685
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:52,400
So only child only child. Do you have the only child uh syndrome? Yes. What do you mean?

1686
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:54,960
The guy that's the center of all of these lights and stuff

1687
01:56:56,320 --> 01:57:00,800
In some regards, okay in some regards. Yes, but I think I had quite a stern upbringing

1688
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:07,440
I was held to incredibly high standards. Uh, it was very non-rebellious as a kid. Um, non-rebellious very non-rebellious

1689
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:11,440
Very very non-rebellious. Um, you know, wasn't going out wasn't sneaking out

1690
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:14,640
I don't think I ever got grounded once the god play role or no

1691
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:19,680
Standards and expectation was a tough standard high very high. What did your mom and dad do?

1692
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:26,880
Dad is an engineer mom stopped working for probably 10 to 12 years to raise me while dad was out working

1693
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:30,640
Uh, but this isn't you know, dad was on the working class of most working class

1694
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:36,160
We live in a a city in the uk that was famous only for having the highest teen pregnancy rating in the uk

1695
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:40,880
And then it lost that so it didn't even have that as a as a title anymore at least you could brag about it

1696
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:44,240
Now we got nothing to talk about. Yeah, we haven't even got that. Yeah, uh, so

1697
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:47,920
But it was it was very formative and you know, I'm just thinking more and more

1698
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:51,760
About this tension between success making people soft

1699
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:57,040
Uh, I spoke to David Goggins about it on the podcast, you know, he's this guy who can command

1700
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:04,000
Millions of dollars for speaking gigs and he's choosing to go smoke jumping. Have you seen this thing that he's doing?

1701
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:09,120
So smoke jumping is when there's a wildfire in the middle of nowhere and they need to air drop in

1702
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:13,040
The firefighters so they parachute in with a

1703
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:19,360
Pack around their waist with all their stuff on and they also put water huge

1704
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:25,840
Water bucket things that they'll attach their hoses to separately parachute them in and they just live in the fire

1705
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:29,200
Until they put it out. Sometimes they're out there for a week pretty sure he makes

1706
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:31,920
It's either seven or twelve dollars an hour

1707
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:36,720
That he makes for doing this smoke jumping as it's called. It's in canada for the most part

1708
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:41,600
Instead of going and doing this speaking to it and I asked him about success making you soft

1709
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:46,640
He says I see it way too much and that's why I don't like it. I'm not about the flash

1710
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:48,800
I'm not about any of that when the best books in business

1711
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:54,240
Was written by a legend see legendary ceo in silicon valley

1712
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:58,080
Who ran intel? I think he's the only guy that for a decade straight

1713
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:03,840
He grew the company a hundred percent every year unheard of what this guy did and the growth hungarian guy

1714
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:07,520
Okay, you know what the book's title is only the paranoid survive

1715
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:13,840
Only the paranoid say that before so I had a question to you around only the paranoid survive

1716
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:17,280
I don't disagree

1717
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:22,400
That paranoia is an unbelievable competitive advantage. It's a very useful performance enhancer, right?

1718
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:27,280
You are paying more attention. You are more detail oriented. You're more fearful

1719
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:29,600
all the rest of it

1720
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:34,080
Ultimately, is it worth it? Do you think is paranoia worth it as a life strategy?

1721
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:38,880
It the you are protected by those who take that seriously

1722
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:44,000
Okay, you know burden is not something that's a sexy sell

1723
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:48,480
You know, there's a lot of things that you and I can sell that's very sexy

1724
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:55,520
Okay, work from home very sexy yet the loneliness epidemic in america right now is record breaking numbers

1725
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:57,520
we've never seen before right on

1726
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:04,560
What people are doing how lonely they are numbers on depression is off the charts right now compared to what it was just 10 years ago

1727
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:06,240
So

1728
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:12,160
Yeah, you can sell work from home. You can sell three and a half day work week. You can sell

1729
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,800
Laptop entrepreneur. You can sell

1730
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:18,240
These are all sexy things to sell right you can sell

1731
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:22,240
Set up a funnel and make 20 grand a month and don't have to do anything

1732
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:26,560
These are all very interesting easy things to sell try selling burden

1733
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:29,040
go ahead and sell burden

1734
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:37,120
Oh, dude of the incredible honor of having burden of the responsibility of a nation or a state or a military or freedom

1735
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:38,320
I thought was a

1736
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:43,280
Try selling it. It's no, but it's not an easy sale. It's a hard sale. Responsibility isn't sexy

1737
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:48,160
So why are so many great leaders turned on by that burden?

1738
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:51,040
Why because someone's got to do it

1739
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:53,120
So it all depends, you know

1740
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:55,600
In the in the book your next five moves I talk about how

1741
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:58,480
The most important question you got to answer in life is

1742
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:00,480
Who do you want to be?

1743
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:03,840
What type of life do you want to live? That's simple. Okay, so what does this mean?

1744
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:07,120
Do you want to be a founder? Yeah, you sure?

1745
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:09,680
Yeah

1746
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:13,520
Positive I think so it's kind of cool right want to be a founder entrepreneur

1747
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,800
You sure you want to be a founder? You sure you want to be the number one guy?

1748
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:19,840
Tom Ellsworth who is my business partner said one the best things to me

1749
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:21,920
this guy was at

1750
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:26,800
Talk about the legendary interview of all time. It's the last interview of steve jobs and bill gates in silicon valley

1751
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:28,240
Okay, wherever it was

1752
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:32,800
300 people were invited at this meeting tom was one of them said recorded. It's record. You got to see it

1753
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:37,520
By the way sick. It's the red chair when you see the red chair. You're watching the right one steve jobs is super skinny

1754
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:41,280
Tom Ellsworth tells me says pat it took me 50 years to realize

1755
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:44,400
I don't make a lot of money when i'm the number one guy

1756
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:47,120
The most money I ever made

1757
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:49,120
Is when I was number two through number six

1758
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:52,400
Think about saying that

1759
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:56,720
I think about taking 52 years to realize 50 years to realize the most money you ever made

1760
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:59,680
Was when you were the number two guy or number six guy?

1761
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:02,240
Because there's burden with number one

1762
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:04,080
Number one has got to sell the dream

1763
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:05,840
Number one has got to sell the vision

1764
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:08,320
Number one has got to seem like even though we're about to go out of business

1765
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:12,320
They're at peace. They're calm. They carry the burden sleepless nights

1766
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:17,760
Your finances you can't reveal to people if you're about to run out of money. We're gonna make the expenses

1767
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:23,200
We're gonna make salaries. We're gonna pay payroll. That's the number one person who wants that burden. Nobody wants that burden

1768
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,120
So no if the idea is to sell that

1769
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:29,920
No, it is not an easy sale

1770
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:34,240
but if you want to know why you right now are here

1771
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:37,840
And we are able to do this podcast at a

1772
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:41,360
Pretty unstable time in the world today

1773
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,480
It's probably because around 500 people

1774
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:49,520
Have the burden of making sure nobody messes with you and I where we are right now

1775
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:51,920
And those 500 people have

1776
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:56,480
A thousand people underneath them or 500 people underneath them why you and I are able to sit here

1777
02:02:56,720 --> 02:03:01,760
So it's not the most sexy attractive thing like in in smithsonian. I don't know if you've been to the smithsonian in dc

1778
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:04,240
There's a part where you go and it shows

1779
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:08,720
You walk this way. It shows how lincoln aged over

1780
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:14,080
It's an incredible thing to see and there's a quote they buy by lincoln about burden

1781
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:18,480
Okay, the the being a president is the greatest burden

1782
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:22,400
A person can never have right some some quote like that. I'm paraphrasing

1783
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:25,600
So it's not for everybody and it's not a sale the person chooses to do it

1784
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:27,920
Obama before and after

1785
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:32,320
His eight years right. He still looks good though. Oh, he's still got he's still got swagger

1786
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:34,320
But I mean that was 20 years in eight years. That's right

1787
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:41,520
So this is something I wanted to talk about you have spent a lot of time reading about and researching and speaking to

1788
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:44,240
powerful people

1789
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:46,320
Who do you think really runs the world?

1790
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:50,560
You're gonna go there, huh with the question. Who do I think runs the world?

1791
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:52,640
Um

1792
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:56,000
So I used to ask the question I said who who's got the most power in america?

1793
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Is it congress is a president is it the CEOs of virtual governments?

1794
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
We're talking google twitter facebook

1795
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:06,240
You know those guys amazon, you know, or is it billionaires?

1796
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:12,080
Okay, you know the most richest man in the world. Who's got the most power and you'd be amazed how few people said president

1797
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:14,400
Does it come and go?

1798
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:18,000
You know the famous quote with putin that he says, you know

1799
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:21,920
American presidents you don't have to worry about it. They're gonna be there four to eight years

1800
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,800
Some suits are running, you know and run the country behind closed doors

1801
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:28,320
And he's got a very good point when he says something like that putin

1802
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:31,040
but to me

1803
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:33,040
There are a lot of

1804
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:40,800
Alliances being built so if you and I were to think about aspirational type of people, okay, you know how they say

1805
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:46,240
You know, well michael jackson eventually got to a point where he got so many different girls that he started trying with this

1806
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:50,320
And he started trying with this and a lot of these people in hollywood have so much sex with so many different people

1807
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:53,760
That they become creative and they do dumb things, right? Okay

1808
02:04:54,640 --> 02:04:56,880
Tiger woods the reason why he got these girls because what do you know?

1809
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:00,320
What it is to be the greatest golf golf in the world and everybody throws their panties at you

1810
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:01,920
You want to judge a guy like that?

1811
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:04,960
Why don't you go be the greatest golfer and see what it feels like to be one out of eight billion?

1812
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:08,400
You don't know what it's like. So they're kind of trying and experimenting with all this stuff, right?

1813
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:12,240
It's almost like i'm so much in a prison jail. Everybody's watching what i'm doing

1814
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:14,720
I'm going to break the rules a little bit to see what i'm capable of doing. Okay

1815
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:21,360
So so let's go process and dissect some of these guys that make all the money in the world. Okay, you become a billionaire

1816
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:29,760
And you're still dangerously ambitious not from a good place, but more selfish place

1817
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:34,880
Okay, you took over an industry now you're worth five billion dollars

1818
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:40,160
Now you were 10 if you're a billionaire, you're the best at what you do in your space for the most part or you help build

1819
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:43,200
The best in that space for the most part. Okay

1820
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
cool, so

1821
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:50,640
Maybe your marriage didn't work out. Maybe you're not the best father in the world

1822
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:53,920
And you're like, well

1823
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:57,440
I want more control. I want more power

1824
02:05:58,720 --> 02:05:59,920
I can't be a president

1825
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:02,240
I don't want to be a president because if I run for president

1826
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:05,920
They're gonna reveal the things that i've done in my life and god forbid if that gets all the light

1827
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I don't want that that's embarrassing

1828
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,880
But you know what i'm gonna do? What if I can take over the world?

1829
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:17,920
Are there other people like me that are driven by wanting to take over the world?

1830
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:22,880
What if we could make the world one place and we make all the decisions for everybody because

1831
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:25,840
I'm probably one the smartest people in the world

1832
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:29,520
I'm proud and you know that conversation is taking place again

1833
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:34,400
You really start having that godlike figure like I don't know if you're familiar with george soros

1834
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:40,480
You know in one of the interviews he gave to la times. He says I always fancied myself would be in a god

1835
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:43,200
I fancied myself would be in a god

1836
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:47,680
This is an la times interview 20 plus years ago if you type in george soros la times god

1837
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:52,320
It's the most disturbing interview to read about this guy a lot of people are very skeptical about him

1838
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:56,720
Right, he's like the boogie man of a number of conspiracies. How many how many people have you heard say?

1839
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:00,160
I always fancied myself with being a god

1840
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:02,400
he says but

1841
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:06,800
What's great about where i'm at right now is it's no longer a

1842
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:09,760
Dream it became a reality

1843
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:13,440
I have a friend who has spent a lot of time with

1844
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:18,400
Super super powerful people and he told me about a meeting that he had with one individual

1845
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:22,880
In particular who spoke about being an apex predator

1846
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:27,200
He said that apex predators don't care about prey and even though

1847
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,480
The prey that he was referring to was still his own species

1848
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:36,720
It was really haunting the story the way that that was told to me because you had someone who not only

1849
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:39,520
Had the motivation

1850
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:42,080
to be able to go and enact whatever

1851
02:07:43,040 --> 02:07:45,040
nefarious malicious plan

1852
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:49,680
But also had the actual resources to be able to go and do it right those two things together are

1853
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:54,080
They're scary and that was something that really opened my eyes

1854
02:07:54,160 --> 02:07:58,560
I'm very non conspiratorial in the way that I think I always lean toward

1855
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:02,080
You know do not attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity

1856
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:05,760
Do not attribute to coordination that which can be explained by coincidence

1857
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:07,680
Uh

1858
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:10,960
And yet the more that I read and the more that I learn about things

1859
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:14,320
The more there there seems to be there

1860
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:16,640
right

1861
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:19,760
Yeah, you know people are offended by different things

1862
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:30,000
Some people being offended in their deepest insecurities

1863
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:35,600
They're willing to use their ambitions to go to certain levels

1864
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:38,320
That at that point they're not

1865
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:44,240
Thinking about the consequences of ruining a lot of people's lives. That's not something they're thinking about at that level. So

1866
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:49,680
Hitler was offended when you read my comb for you study what Hitler did. He was simply offended

1867
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:55,440
Somebody offended him. So his entire life was about doing what he did just because he was offended

1868
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:59,600
Now most people who are offended they do what they forget about it

1869
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:03,840
And they move on some of these guys want control some of these guys

1870
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:09,520
Want to make decisions for you some of these guys on the money side at least they go and make money to get power

1871
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:14,400
Some people don't go make money to get power. Some people cloud swab. They're like no, I'm not going to go make money to get power

1872
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:19,280
I'm going to get power by creating laws and thinking. I know what's best for you

1873
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:23,120
So there's a lot of different people that you can put in these steps of organization

1874
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:25,120
You just have to think like if you were to think about

1875
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:30,880
The commission of the mop always go back to it. Lucky Luciano created a commission with the five families

1876
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:33,600
He was the one that ran the commission right up the five families. Okay

1877
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:39,680
When you think about what meetings in the world happens where all the powerful people show up you get the g20

1878
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:45,840
You got the un you got the world economy. You got davos. You got all these guys that come together

1879
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:48,080
You got nato

1880
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:49,440
you got

1881
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,440
So nato could be like well nato's

1882
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:56,640
Original when the 12 or 14 countries were part of nato. What was it really all about to fight ussr?

1883
02:09:56,880 --> 02:10:00,400
There is no ussr. Why are we still funding it? What's the outcome now?

1884
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:06,480
Are we still fighting communism? So what a lot of people might say is that those organizations are

1885
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:10,400
So obvious that they can't be the ones where the real shit's happening, right?

1886
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:15,520
That's just the smoke screen the real shit is the shit that's behind it and the shit that's behind that and so on and so forth

1887
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,640
In your opinion, do you think that nato wef

1888
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:22,240
who that's those people there's no

1889
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:30,480
Further upset of strings that are playing the ventriloquized game behind those ones. Do you think that that's where a lot of power actually lies?

1890
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:32,640
um

1891
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:37,120
I don't know what I will say listen to you is with the questions you're asking

1892
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:38,880
I think

1893
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:43,440
There's a reason why the audience wants to hear what you think about what's going on right now because you're asking some heavy questions

1894
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:46,880
Right now, which means you're curious and if i'm the audience

1895
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:52,640
I would like to know what you can come up with if you took a deeper dive and really wanted to get into these types of

1896
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:54,880
you know informations but

1897
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:56,880
you know

1898
02:10:58,080 --> 02:11:00,640
Think about what things people are most addicted to

1899
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:05,520
Okay, addictive personalities video games porn sex

1900
02:11:06,160 --> 02:11:07,280
cocaine

1901
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:08,880
ecstasy

1902
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:10,640
weed

1903
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:12,000
steroids

1904
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,440
party in

1905
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:15,440
all of that stuff

1906
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:17,440
But what's one of the most addicting things?

1907
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:21,600
That many of those guys can't get power

1908
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:24,240
Are you kidding me power is like

1909
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,240
power

1910
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:27,600
porn

1911
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:29,600
The porn of having a lot of power

1912
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:35,040
And getting the look and people that look at you that are afraid of you some people love that

1913
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:40,640
Some people love that you know the quote like if you really want to test someone's character given power. I mean some people

1914
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,480
really

1915
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:47,440
Love having power take a company and see some of the guys that they hired they hired a wrong person at the top

1916
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:49,840
The guy was all driven by power. What happens?

1917
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:56,720
Take a president that becomes a president and he realizes he can use the justice system against his opponent. What happens?

1918
02:11:57,280 --> 02:11:59,840
They got that power. It's a lot of power to give to somebody, right?

1919
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:02,080
um

1920
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:05,920
Yeah, so you know those people I believe are out there some of them are

1921
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:12,000
100 money people because money talks and you can have a lot of you need funds to do anything, right?

1922
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:14,240
You do it's it's going to be the money people

1923
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:15,840
um

1924
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:21,680
But there's also the other power players behind closed doors that you know in the in the movie money ball

1925
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:26,080
Uh, Jonah Hill plays that. I don't know if i'm saying his name correctly. He plays the role

1926
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:28,160
of the guy that

1927
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:29,760
Brad Pitt is sitting there saying

1928
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:32,800
Why is this gm of cleveland indians keeps looking at the guy?

1929
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:40,160
Doesn't gotten based who the hell are you right in john john maxwell or or

1930
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:43,440
Dale Carnegie wrote about this in a book saying the law of e.f. Hutton

1931
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:47,920
E.f. Hutton was in the room that every time the guy was making a decision

1932
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:49,920
He wouldn't make a decision until he asked about e.f. Hutton

1933
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:53,520
So here's what we're going to do. So what's your proposal? Okay, great

1934
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:56,320
Hey, e.f. Hutton, what do you think about it?

1935
02:12:56,560 --> 02:12:58,560
Okay, we're not going to be doing it great

1936
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:03,680
The world is filled with like henry kissinger. I don't know how much you know about henry kissinger

1937
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:06,320
That guy's an e.f. Hutton if there ever was one

1938
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:08,800
There's a lot of

1939
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:10,880
those guys

1940
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:12,320
that

1941
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:17,840
Are the brains behind the faces that we see and most of the times the best e.f. Hutton's

1942
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:20,400
No one ever finds out who they were

1943
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:23,600
No one ever finds out who those guys are

1944
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,400
one of the other tensions that I felt when

1945
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:29,520
Learning about you and also when watching your content

1946
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:32,320
You've spoken about this specifically to do with kobe

1947
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:37,840
But I think it also probably plays a role in almost everybody's life is this tension between self love and high standards

1948
02:13:38,240 --> 02:13:42,000
Right, it's the desire to maximize everything you can and to not leave

1949
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:48,720
More on the table than you need to and also the ability to enjoy the moment and to be able to actually take some some pleasure in that

1950
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:52,800
And there was a something that came up from a friend that I wrote about this week

1951
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:54,640
So I wanted to explain this to you

1952
02:13:54,640 --> 02:13:56,640
He did a psilocybin journey in

1953
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:03,280
Australia and a question came to him and the question was do people love you for who you are or for what you do

1954
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
This is uncomfortable to consider

1955
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:10,480
People loving us for who we are feels more real genuine caring empathetic and robust

1956
02:14:10,720 --> 02:14:13,520
It feels like we're less fickle and more difficult to lose

1957
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:17,600
On the other hand people loving us for what we do feels transactional and transient

1958
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:22,560
The love that we receive becomes contingent on what achievements and successes we can offer in return

1959
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:27,520
And the obvious fear is that if a point came where we no longer had anything to offer in return

1960
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Would our love be taken away?

1961
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,240
So here's an even more uncomfortable question

1962
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:35,840
Do you love you for who you are or for what you do?

1963
02:14:37,120 --> 02:14:38,640
This highlights our hypocrisy

1964
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:44,480
You see we want the world to love us for who we are a balanced caring view of our true value independent of our accomplishments

1965
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:48,960
Meanwhile, our own self-love is largely determined by what we do

1966
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:52,080
If we fall short even though we know we tried our best

1967
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:55,440
We still castigate ourselves for being insufficient, unworthy creatures

1968
02:14:55,840 --> 02:15:00,880
So we want the world to show up for us in a way that we are often not prepared to show up for ourselves

1969
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:04,080
You demand more than this demanded of yourself

1970
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,960
powerful

1971
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:12,880
Do you see that resonating this tension in high performers desire for more requirement for self-love?

1972
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:16,400
Yes, but for me

1973
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:19,120
There's a part of it. That's also honest

1974
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:24,240
Because again the relationship with between a man and a prostitute

1975
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,280
What is that relationship?

1976
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:29,280
Each side is getting something in return

1977
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:31,920
The prostitute is getting what?

1978
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:39,680
Money, what's the man getting pleasure? Okay, and they walk away. It's done. It's a very honest relationship, right?

1979
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:44,640
There's no depth in that relationship. It's straight up. It's honest done. We move on. Okay

1980
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:50,640
Working at a company

1981
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:53,120
Say you work with a company

1982
02:15:53,680 --> 02:15:58,800
And he helps the youtube channel go to the next level doing all the work behind closed doors all this stuff

1983
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:01,920
Would he do that job for free?

1984
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:07,040
Or would he do it because you're offering something back to them? How many of my employees would be with me?

1985
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:09,760
If it was working for free

1986
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:16,960
That non-profit would be kind of weird guys. What we're doing is very important, but I need you to work for free

1987
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:22,240
What do you mean? Are you gonna make money? I am but I want you to work for free. It's kind of weird, right?

1988
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:24,560
There needs to be an exchange again. It's honest

1989
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:27,360
exchange, okay

1990
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:29,600
Um

1991
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:34,560
If I go above and beyond everybody else and I work should I deserve the right to get paid more?

1992
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:39,920
Yes, okay. Is it beneficial for me to work with somebody like you?

1993
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:42,400
Of course, why because you're driven

1994
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:47,600
So should I hang on to your co-tail because if I go with you big things are gonna happen in my life? Absolutely

1995
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:54,720
Is that a selfish decision? Yes, but it's also a wise decision. Do you know that you know that do they know that they know that

1996
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:59,760
Do they also know that you have options because now you're at a point that a lot of people would love to be working for you

1997
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:02,400
Of course, they know that they're not dummies, right? They know that

1998
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:07,440
Okay, but you still choose to stay with them and they still choose to choose to stay with you

1999
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:12,800
Is there benefit of somebody hiring your person that's helping with your podcast and paying twice as you pay to go with them?

2000
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:14,720
there is

2001
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:16,720
If he chooses to take that

2002
02:17:16,880 --> 02:17:18,880
Just for the money. That's his loss

2003
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:23,840
If you're doing your part, he was never in it for believing in you. It was only about the money part

2004
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:31,440
So these are all and the reason why this is so interesting what what you're reading about self-love and all these other things

2005
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:36,800
Is when you look at some of the people that make it at the highest of the highest of the highest level

2006
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:40,000
They typically have been backstabbed so much

2007
02:17:40,560 --> 02:17:44,480
That in the back of their mind, sometimes they're just waiting to see who's going to backstab next

2008
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:49,600
So so the desire to have a straight up relationship is no longer the same. Okay

2009
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:52,720
There's a difference between you dating somebody who falls in love with you

2010
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:55,280
And you're making 22 bucks an hour working at ballies

2011
02:17:55,840 --> 02:18:00,240
And she loves you and she stays with you. There's a difference between you getting married when you're making

2012
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:02,640
$300,000 a year

2013
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:06,560
And then there's a difference between you making marrying somebody when you work half a billion dollars

2014
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:10,720
How do you know the girl that marries you at the end is worth? You know is with you because

2015
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:18,080
She loves you versus she loves what you offer them, right? And is that a sin? Yeah, is she making a mistake? You know

2016
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:22,320
I think in an ideal world

2017
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:29,040
I am very comfortable knowing that other people are also there in your life to get what they can out of you

2018
02:18:30,880 --> 02:18:32,880
I'm very comfortable with that

2019
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:35,040
Because there's a chapter in the book here

2020
02:18:35,600 --> 02:18:40,560
Where I talk about choosing running mates and I put a clear criteria on how to choose a running mate

2021
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:44,320
You know what they bring to the table their level of trust with you

2022
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:47,840
All these ways of scoring people in your life to see hey

2023
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:53,040
Is this a person because the whole concept would choose a new enemies wisely also need to choose your allies wisely

2024
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:58,080
So somebody like you you need true believers in your life. You can't have 50 true believers

2025
02:18:58,160 --> 02:19:01,680
That's just naive to think that you can't have 10 true believers

2026
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:07,520
Can you have two to five true believers? Yes. How how valuable is that a lot? So

2027
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:11,280
No, I uh, you know the more and more I moved up

2028
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:16,720
The more I realized almost everybody like and I'm talking 99 percent of people

2029
02:19:17,360 --> 02:19:21,520
Listen to the radio show wiifm. What's in it for me?

2030
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:23,120
and

2031
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:27,600
A part in this book that we dissected your question, which is fascinating question is

2032
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:31,840
In in the company. I've been running a sales organization for 20 something years

2033
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:36,880
And when I started the insurance company in online, we grew it from 66 agents today. We have 50 000 agents

2034
02:19:36,880 --> 02:19:39,380
We've licensed nationwide. We have a few hundred offices nationwide

2035
02:19:39,380 --> 02:19:41,380
but

2036
02:19:42,020 --> 02:19:43,620
my

2037
02:19:43,620 --> 02:19:47,860
Idea of looking at who's got the biggest upside to contribute to the company has also changed

2038
02:19:48,420 --> 02:19:50,420
It used to be men that guy so selfish

2039
02:19:51,620 --> 02:19:55,140
All that guy cares about money. I mean this guy's the nicest guy in the world

2040
02:19:55,860 --> 02:19:57,460
and then I realized

2041
02:19:57,460 --> 02:19:59,460
the nicest guy in the world

2042
02:19:59,780 --> 02:20:01,780
Who had no selfish desires

2043
02:20:02,420 --> 02:20:04,420
Was happy making five thousand dollars a month

2044
02:20:05,940 --> 02:20:08,500
And so then I created a scoring system

2045
02:20:09,380 --> 02:20:14,500
What percentage of you is selfish and selfless and what's the good balance?

2046
02:20:15,220 --> 02:20:17,220
If you're a hundred percent only you

2047
02:20:17,220 --> 02:20:22,660
And everybody else zero well, guess what you're still a bigger net positive to society than the person at the bottom

2048
02:20:22,660 --> 02:20:27,860
That's what zero percent selfish and a hundred percent selfless if a person is a hundred percent selfless

2049
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:31,780
They probably don't eat well. They probably out of shape. They're probably not healthy

2050
02:20:31,780 --> 02:20:34,420
They're probably gonna have to go to the hospital. It's gonna cost you money and taxes

2051
02:20:34,660 --> 02:20:38,020
They probably smell because they don't take a shower. They spend their money on everybody else

2052
02:20:38,660 --> 02:20:40,660
So then you'll see the profile

2053
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:45,700
Good people to give you counsel or around the 50 50 range. You can always trust them to give you counsel

2054
02:20:46,420 --> 02:20:50,660
Drivers of a company or somebody like you doing what they do 70 30 is a good split

2055
02:20:51,300 --> 02:20:53,700
Okay, 80 20 is a little bit problematic

2056
02:20:54,180 --> 02:21:00,340
Because 80 20 sometimes will compromise to beat everybody. So you want the 65 70 so so you're asking a technical question

2057
02:21:01,060 --> 02:21:02,500
and

2058
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:04,500
I've just come to a conclusion

2059
02:21:04,500 --> 02:21:05,540
that

2060
02:21:05,540 --> 02:21:06,580
you know

2061
02:21:06,580 --> 02:21:10,500
Both parties if they want to selfishly be pleased

2062
02:21:11,380 --> 02:21:13,380
if we can please each other

2063
02:21:14,020 --> 02:21:19,460
And one of us takes the lead and we're getting mutual love and benefits out of the relationship

2064
02:21:20,900 --> 02:21:24,980
You're in a good situation every once in a while you'll find somebody that's going to be a writer that they're going to say chris

2065
02:21:26,020 --> 02:21:30,340
Dude, no matter what you do and with you till the day you die and you think they're telling the truth

2066
02:21:31,540 --> 02:21:33,540
A year goes by they're still there even more

2067
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:37,300
Five years go by they got married like one wing and money gets married and ask you it's going to change

2068
02:21:37,380 --> 02:21:41,540
Still there 10 years later still there you're like this guy's really a true believer. Wow

2069
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:44,820
But it's not going to be that many people. That's a very short list of people

2070
02:21:45,940 --> 02:21:51,380
Patrick bet David ladies and gentlemen Patrick. I appreciate the hell out of you. I appreciate how much you pay attention

2071
02:21:52,020 --> 02:21:56,580
Very detail oriented and I love that. I really really do. Uh, thank you for today, man

I've been a long time coming. So where should people go?

2073
02:21:58,580 --> 02:22:00,180
They want to keep up to date with everything you're doing

2074
02:22:00,260 --> 02:22:04,260
Ah, I mean you can go to amazon and search choose your enemies wisely
