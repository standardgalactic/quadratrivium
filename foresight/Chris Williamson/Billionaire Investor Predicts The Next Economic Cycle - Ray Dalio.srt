1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
We're on the brink of war with China for various reasons.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,800
I hope we make it to 2050.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,120
The demographics is as I describe it.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,320
And by the way, them losing doesn't make us winning.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,800
So I think you're in the part of the cycle

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,880
where you've had the tightening

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,760
and the dominoes are beginning to fall.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,640
And I think that that's going to produce more problems.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,800
The most important thing is to have

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,320
this basic, well-diversified portfolio as important.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,000
Two years ago, you made some predictions

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,280
about the future for America and the global economy.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,040
How accurate do you think you've been?

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,280
Uncomfortably accurate, given the whole picture.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,400
It's like watching the movie over and over again.

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,560
Maybe I should explain.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,200
For about 55 years, I've been a global macro investor

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,040
and I learned that many of the things that surprised me

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,520
never happened in my lifetime before.

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,640
So when I would see certain things happen that were like that,

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,280
I would go back in history and study prior periods.

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,320
And studying, for example, the Great Depression

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,840
allowed us to anticipate the financial crisis in 2008.

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,880
Anyway, there are three big things that I observed happening

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,560
that didn't happen in our lifetimes,

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,320
but happened during the 1930 to 45 period.

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,560
And they are the creation of enormous amounts of debt

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,800
and the printing of money to pay for those debts

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,680
and it having its economic effects on inflation and growth.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
The second is internal conflicts

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,400
over the largest wealth gaps we had since then, values gaps.

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,320
And the rise of populism of the right and the left,

33
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,200
those conflicts, again, largest since that 1930 to 45 period.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,720
And then the rise of a great power,

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,680
producing a great powers conflict internationally

36
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,280
with the rise of China as a great power,

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,200
challenging the United States and with Russia.

38
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,440
So the great power conflict, that also is the most

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,960
that that's happened since the Great Depression.

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,280
So because those three things are happening now,

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,040
and I didn't study them, I went back and I needed to study

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,800
the cycles, what's happened over longer periods of time.

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,040
So I studied the last 500 years because these big cycles

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,800
take about 75 years and give or take about 50.

45
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,000
And like the rise and decline of the British Empire,

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,280
the rise and decline of the debt.

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,920
And that dynamic I shared in the book, and I also shared it

48
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,520
in an animated video, which is called The Changing World Order.

49
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,600
And that creates a path.

50
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,880
Now, it's not just because they repeat in this way,

51
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,240
but one can see the cause-effect relationships

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,080
that are happening.

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,400
And so that has pretty much transpired according to script.

54
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,680
We can get into those pieces, but I'd say those are the three main ones.

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,880
There were two others that had big effect

56
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,400
that I paid more attention to that I'll mention.

57
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,000
One was acts of nature in the form of droughts, floods and pandemics.

58
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,840
They were very disruptive when they happened, killed more people

59
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,960
and toppled more empires or waters than others.

60
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,400
And then also, of course, over a period of time,

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,280
there's learning and producing new technologies

62
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,440
that raises living standards.

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,880
You know, it's raised per capita income life expectancy and so on.

64
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,760
And so, but those five factors transpire in ways that we've seen before

65
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,600
to create this big cycle.

66
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,840
And if we can look at the cause-effect relationships,

67
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,280
that's what I want to pass along.

68
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,960
Because I'm 74 years old and I'm in a phase in my life

69
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,520
that I want to pass along the things that are of value.

70
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,120
And I think this is an important thing.

71
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,760
But yes, it's transpiring according to script.

72
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,960
Cassandra, yet again, unfortunately.

73
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,040
What do you think is the likelihood of the meltdown of the dollar?

74
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Is America going to be wiped out at some point soon?

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,480
I don't want, histrionics, you know, just, I don't want to overdo it.

76
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,800
And I also don't want to just jump to conclusions.

77
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,680
My goal here is to show people how the machine works,

78
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
the cause-effect relationship.

79
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,480
So I'm going to answer your question by explaining certain things.

80
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:22,560
The dollar is held by countries in the form of debt.

81
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,880
In other words, when you say, I'm holding the dollar,

82
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,920
you're holding a debt instrument.

83
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,960
And when we have a problem with the debt instrument,

84
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,040
a few problems with it holding the debt instruments.

85
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,800
And those problems are that, first of all,

86
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,880
as a result of what the United States was in the world,

87
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,920
the largest trading country, the dominant empire, and so on,

88
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:59,840
there's been a huge accumulation of dollar denominated debt and dollars, therefore.

89
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,640
And there's also been a lot of deficits that had to be funded,

90
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,480
which happens by selling dollar denominated debt,

91
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,080
which a lot of foreigners and banks and others bought.

92
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,000
And so they have a lot of dollar denominated debt.

93
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,640
Now, if you're a creditor, meaning an owner of dollar denominated debt,

94
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,720
you need to have an interest rate that is high enough to more than compensate you for inflation.

95
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,720
And so the production now of a lot more debt and them having a lot of debt,

96
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,640
and then also sanctions internationally,

97
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,160
which means freezing dollar denominated debt,

98
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,960
all have created a reduction in the demand for dollar denominated debt.

99
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,440
There's also concerns in the world about some of the things that are going on in the United States,

100
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,960
and that's reduced that. As a result of that,

101
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,120
you're seeing more transactions take place in other currencies.

102
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:19,920
And if they take place in other currencies, then others want to save in those other currencies

103
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,800
because that's how they pay for it. So if you want to save in what you pay for,

104
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,600
you save more in it and less in dollars. And so that's the dynamic that is reducing

105
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:40,080
the demand for dollars and dollar debt at the same time as the supply of it keeps coming,

106
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,920
because we have large deficits. So the underlying value that those dollars

107
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,440
represent isn't increasing, but the number of dollars spread across that is.

108
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,600
Yeah, so that there's a supply-demand issue. That supply-demand issue, by the way,

109
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:05,040
also exists in European currencies. Okay, they have too much debt and they're financed the same way.

110
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,960
And Japanese currencies. And so what you're seeing is the movement,

111
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:20,560
all that weight of money and debt is causing prices to go up, inflation. And that's also

112
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:32,240
being worsened by the supply chain deteriorations that are due to the international conflict.

113
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:41,120
So for example, in the case of, let's say China and the United States and other countries,

114
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,400
as they prepare for the possibility of war, they want to be self-sufficient. And so

115
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:58,000
as a result, they work on being self-sufficient more than integrated and efficient. And so

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,400
that dynamic is playing an important role too. What do you think the next few years have got in

117
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:14,720
store for us? Well, I'm going to take all three of those influences and answer it because they're

118
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:24,320
all related. There's a business cycle or a short-term debt cycle, I call it,

119
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:32,480
that sort of recession to recession and the way it works is you have a recession in weak economy,

120
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:40,080
central banks stimulate credit growth, credit gives you buying power, you go out and buy,

121
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,520
the economy picks up, and then that continues until you start to have inflation. Then they

122
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,800
tighten monetary policy and then the economy weakens and it goes into the next recession.

123
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:03,120
Since 1945, when the new world order began, in other words, we had the currency and also the

124
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:10,240
American world order beginning in that, we've had 12 and a half of those cycles. They typically

125
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:19,120
last about seven years, give or take about three. And so we are now about halfway through this cycle

126
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:27,440
in which they did the stimulation, inflation rises, they tighten monetary policy,

127
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:34,880
and we're in the phase of the cycle where there is going to be then the cracks occurring and the

128
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:44,160
negative impact on economic activity and the like. And it's going to be more difficult than normal

129
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:52,640
because there's so much debt outstanding and what we just talked about. So that is likely

130
00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:02,000
to happen over, let's say, the next year and a half, which means that it will take us

131
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,160
in through the elections. And what we have is a situation where the second of those influences,

132
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:17,600
the internal conflict influence, is bad and you have a lot of populism. So populists are people

133
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:25,200
who will fight to win at all costs. They're not compromisers. I will fight and I will win for you

134
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:34,960
and the rules be damned, compromising be damned. And so you're going to have a political situation

135
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,080
in terms of that kind of environment. It's a bad time for that, but it'll end up

136
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:48,640
paying an impact on the nature of the elections, I think. And then you have the international

137
00:11:48,640 --> 00:12:02,080
conflict. We are much closer to a big conflict, a war of sorts, either a sanctions and economic war

138
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:09,760
or even possibly a military war with China. And because of the politics also, that that

139
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:17,040
will be pushing its limits too because there are the one thing that most Americans are united on

140
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:27,200
and both Democrats and Republicans are united on is anti-China. And as a result, and they all want

141
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:35,600
a strong man or woman, strong person on that. And so I think you're going to see pushing of the limits

142
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:44,720
there and that becomes a dangerous set of circumstances. So I think that if we take the next,

143
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,920
you know, let's call it one, two, three years, I think that those are going to be riskier years.

144
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,120
I spoke to an evolutionary psychologist and an evolutionary anthropologist a little while

145
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,320
ago on the show and they were teaching me about the values and the type of characteristics that

146
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,000
ancestral tribes would have preferred in leaders at different states. And in times of warfare,

147
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,320
more dominant leaders were the ones that were preferred. In times of peace, more prestigious

148
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,840
leaders were the ones that were preferred. Makes complete sense. If you are facing a scary tribe

149
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,400
from the other valley, you want someone that's going to stand firm and is going to not take any

150
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,040
shit and they're going to go for it. When times of peace, that person becomes a bit tyrannical.

151
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,920
It's a little bit too much energy when there's not anybody else to fight. And it's so funny how

152
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,720
you see this just same dynamic to me. It seems play out, no matter how big the populations get,

153
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:46,720
it's essentially the same physics. That's right. It's happened repeatedly. If you're in a war,

154
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:55,200
what you want is the commander and everybody to goddamn follow the instructions and just do what

155
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,640
you're told. And it's not like we're going to sit there and argue, debate, and so on. So what you

156
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:10,880
see is the breakdowns. And particularly, you see the breakdowns also when they're at odds.

157
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,280
There's a lot more to argue about. Like now, the populace of the left and the populace of the right.

158
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:26,320
And so in the 1930s, you saw four democracies become dictatorships. Choose to become dictatorships.

159
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:33,680
They had parliaments that chose to become dictatorships. Germany, Italy, Spain, and Japan

160
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:41,360
chose that because in order to fight, that's what you need. And your anthropologist friends are

161
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,280
right on that.

162
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,320
Yeah, they're consolidating power in an attempt to try and be able to enact more change more easily.

163
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,160
It's not, we haven't got time. We haven't got time to get this across the line diplomatically. We

164
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,200
haven't got time to get everybody on the same page. We'll have one person who knows what they're

165
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,400
doing and they'll push it forward. One thing that I...

166
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:07,760
And another thing that's common is the foreign enemy. When you have a situation where you have

167
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:17,680
internal dispute, it's very, very common to try to bring the country together, get support by the

168
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:27,040
leader by having the common enemy. And so we'll all rally around the leader and you could see...

169
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:38,160
It was like when 9-11 happened and the president, Bush gets a standing ovation and we're all behind

170
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,920
you in that fight. And so that's timeless and universal dynamic.

171
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,120
If you can't bond yourselves together over shared love of an in-group, shared hatred of an out-group

172
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:56,320
is a close enough proxy, I suppose, for that interim. Was there anything over the last two years

173
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,760
that you didn't anticipate or is there anything particularly unique about the situation that

174
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,720
we're in now? Every time people say it's going to be different this time. Is there anything that

175
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,160
could make things different this time or is there anything that you've been surprised by?

176
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:21,040
By and large, I haven't been surprised by... I mean, I didn't anticipate that we were going to have

177
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:32,320
the war with Russia, but I did anticipate that we were likely headed in a war-like environment.

178
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:42,160
It's very much fell with as expected there. The economic and the financial very much is the same.

179
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:52,960
So I'd have to, by and large, almost exactly, it's transpired the way described. And that's why,

180
00:16:52,960 --> 00:17:00,640
again, look, I did the video for free on YouTube, the changing world order.

181
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,640
What I'm trying to do is to just pass it along for people's consideration to understand the

182
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,920
cause-effect relationship that goes there. But yes, it's unfortunately going according to script.

183
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:23,920
That doesn't mean it's destined, but it's difficult to take off track. What do I mean by that?

184
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:36,560
Each stage is the logical consequence of the stage that proceeded it. So let's take the

185
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:47,840
existing situation. The United States has a lot of debt, and it has deficits. So it has to sell

186
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:55,920
debt. Now, if you say, and others are holding debt, and if you say, how do you get healthy,

187
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:09,040
you have to spend less than you earn to not borrow money and get financially strong.

188
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:16,160
That's difficult, and particularly when you have a lot of debt, because you have to take a portion

189
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:22,320
of your income and you have to pay the debt. And also you're living in spending more than

190
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,320
you're earning. And so how do you rectify that? What? Cut spending? I mean, it's very difficult

191
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:37,040
to cut spending. Or raise income? That's not easy. So cut spending? What do you cut? Okay.

192
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:45,440
So we're living in a world now where policymakers don't think, how much money do I have to spend,

193
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:56,480
and what should I prioritize it on? They think, how much money do I need to spend without regard

194
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:04,800
to how much they have, and then they go spend it, and then they have deficits that central banks

195
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,480
can print. It's just like the same as individuals. They have the deficit, but in their case,

196
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,120
they have the capacity to print the money to pay the deficit. So it's not easy to fix the financial

197
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:25,120
problem. The internal problem, you know what it's like. Can you get people to come together

198
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:33,040
to say there's a common problem? Let's have the left and the right and people. Very difficult.

199
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:42,080
People have big differences in values and conditions. And so it's very difficult to bring

200
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,560
them together to deal with the problems. And the same is true internationally, you know?

201
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:58,000
Easier said than done. So given that dynamic, there is then the stages. And so it's pretty clear

202
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:06,320
normally what comes next. Given all of these changes, what do you think people can do

203
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,720
to best prepare themselves financially for the next few years?

204
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:25,360
Well, I think that in saving, let's talk about that, there is, I think of savings in

205
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:34,640
tiers. The first tier is to secure your well-being, tone a portfolio of assets that are going to

206
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:42,000
secure your well-being. And then after you have that taken care of, then you can go to the next

207
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,720
level, take more risk and so on. That well-being, that purchasing power has to be viewed in terms of

208
00:20:50,720 --> 00:21:00,160
inflation-adjusted dollars. If you're holding a debt instrument and a cash-paying instrument,

209
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:08,080
and it gives you a 2% interest and you have a 5% or 6% inflation, you lose money at 3% a year.

210
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:15,680
So you have to look at that in real dollars. And you have to hold that portfolio in a way

211
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,200
that is balanced to any kind of economic environment. And then the way I do it, and I

212
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,920
remember I didn't have anything, and then I start to acquire money. And I start to think,

213
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:42,800
okay, how many weeks do I have, months do I have, or years that I'm financially safe?

214
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,400
And what do I hold it in? And then once you've got that taken care of, you can go beyond it.

215
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:58,480
And I wanted it in a very well-balanced portfolio, that type of portfolio that does

216
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,360
equally well, no matter what happens. I can explain that a little bit more if you want.

217
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:16,480
That'd be good. Okay. There are basically two big influences on markets,

218
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:31,040
the growth rate and the inflation rate. Like, if you know that growth is going to be

219
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,960
faster than expected, and inflation is going to be higher than expected,

220
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:48,720
you know that bonds are going to go down and vice versa. So the way I give that as an example,

221
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,360
so the way I look at it is there are those two big influences, and then they can,

222
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,520
four environments, and each one of them can go up or down. So there are four

223
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:10,160
quadrants that I think of, rising growth, falling growth, rising inflation, and falling inflation.

224
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:18,000
And I want to have a portfolio that will be 25% of my risk in each one of those,

225
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:26,080
so that I don't have any bias. And so I pick the assets that are going to do well in each of those

226
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:34,240
four quadrants, and I hold them in a balanced way. And I've tested that going back actually to 1900

227
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:43,680
and so on, and you'll actually increase your buying power. And so that's the kind of thing

228
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:50,560
that I think in the beginning. Then you have to also make provision for taxes to some extent.

229
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,360
So I say whatever that amount of money is, I want twice as that. So in case it goes in half,

230
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:05,200
and I want to build a portfolio that looks like that for, I don't know, X number of years,

231
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,040
that I have that, and that's the safe savings. And then when I go beyond that, then I'll take

232
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:18,960
more risk. But I think that being safe, particularly in this kind of an environment,

233
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,600
is important. And I would take a perspective of how to do that. That's like the one I'm just

234
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,880
describing. What would be an example of an investment for each of those four quadrants?

235
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,280
Well, I'm worried that we're going to take a long time to explain it. I've explained it

236
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:49,840
elsewhere. But let me give an example. I'll take it. If growth, so there's these four quadrants,

237
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:58,560
growth and inflation. If growth is less than expected, and inflation is less than expected,

238
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:07,440
you would like to own bonds. If it's higher than expected, you would not want to own bonds.

239
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:19,920
If inflation is higher than expected, you would want to own assets such as commodities and gold

240
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:34,560
and inflation index bonds. If growth is faster than expected, particularly if inflation is less

241
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:41,040
than expected, you'd want to own stocks. So you get the idea.

242
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,960
One of the things that you brought up earlier on was the changing internal structure. This is

243
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,640
driven by a number of factors, but one of them being increasing wealth inequality. At the moment,

244
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,640
it seems like there is a decline in praising work ethic, especially in the US. Do you think that

245
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:08,000
that is a symptom or a cause of what we're seeing at the moment? Well, I think the,

246
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:25,760
I'm referring to the wealth gap. I think that there's a lot of particularly unproductive people,

247
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:34,560
for various reasons. But I live in the state of Connecticut, and my wife tries to help

248
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:43,680
students in the poorest neighborhoods have the worst conditions. I'll give you this example.

249
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,960
The state of Connecticut is usually number one, two, or three in the richest state in the country,

250
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,840
but 22% out of the last survey, it's actually higher than this, 22% of the high school students

251
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:06,880
in Connecticut have either dropped out of high school or have absentee rates of greater than

252
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:16,480
25% in our failing classes. There's a great deal of poverty and the breakup of the families and

253
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:26,800
the guidance. There's a cycle that takes place. You're seeing the general competitive education

254
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:35,600
levels, the conditions. In Connecticut, so we operate philanthropically, and I'll give you

255
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:45,040
an example, there was COVID, and the kids have to get educated, and 60,000 kids didn't have

256
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:53,040
computers or connectivity, and no government was going to do anything about it. We had to buy

257
00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:01,200
60,000 computers to give it to kids in order for them to have education. Well, and there's hunger,

258
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:09,360
and there's poverty, and there's drugs. It's how the educational system is funded.

259
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:18,560
Education is a state issue by the Constitution, and then within a state, it's a tax,

260
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:25,680
typically within a state, it's a tax district issue. I live in Greenwich, Connecticut, which is

261
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:35,280
relatively, it's a rich town, and the public education gets about $24,000 per student. The last

262
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:42,560
number I looked, it's probably higher than that now, gets $24,000 a student up the road at Bridgeport,

263
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:49,760
Connecticut, 10 minutes up the road, they get $14,000 a student, because there's no tax base,

264
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,640
and they need more money because the expenses of raising a kid are, you also have to get them

265
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,200
the computer, you've got to get them the food, the clothes, all of those things, and they have

266
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:15,840
less food, less clothes, all those things. But in any case, what you can see is the

267
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:22,480
education test scores and measures of how we're doing in education relative to other countries

268
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:34,480
have declined. So part of it is education and circumstances, part of it is drugs, part of it

269
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,440
is, you know, there are lots of parts of it, and then there's a certain element of it, which

270
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:50,880
let's say because of COVID or other reasons, that people have moved around and say, you know,

271
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,880
I don't have to work as hard anymore. So, you know, just for example, the change in the attitudes

272
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:04,320
of restaurant workers, you know, okay, I can, I found another way to live and so on, and that's

273
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:15,520
playing a role. Of course, also, people as the baby boomers are older, you know, they drop out of

274
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,600
it, nor they want to retire earlier, and they do. So there are a number of factors that affect,

275
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:37,840
you know, this kind of set of circumstances. The wealth gap is very much due to a self-reinforcing

276
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:46,640
cycle in which if you earn a lot of money, you can't afford to take care of your kids' education,

277
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:54,800
you can raise them in a better way. If you don't earn a lot of money, you don't have that privilege.

278
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:07,360
So, you know, so all through history, during those such times, wealth gaps have increased.

279
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,680
So you look at the cycles, you have a new, you know, like a new world order,

280
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:21,600
like in the 1850s, you know, you have the Civil War, and then you have that, and then you have

281
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,320
new technologies in inventing, you have the Industrial Revolution take place,

282
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:35,120
and things go great, but what it does is it also increases the wealth gap. Some people make a

283
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:42,480
lot of money, others don't, and it also increases the level of indebtedness, and you make the turn

284
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:52,480
of the century, then you see big conflicts over wealth. You have the Panic of 1907, and so what

285
00:31:52,480 --> 00:32:00,800
you see is the Industrial Revolution turns into what's called the Gilded Age, in which there are

286
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:09,280
very rich, decadent, you know, while there's poverty and, you know, in the early turn of the

287
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:16,080
century, they're living, people are living very, very lavishly, very decadently at the same time

288
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:23,200
as their, you know, sweatshops and all of that, and then there's kind of a revolutionary reaction

289
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,440
to that. So these things happen over and over again, for the same reasons.

290
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,760
What would you tell young people then, at the moment? What advice would you give them?

291
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:48,800
Well, first of all, learn how, say a few things. First, know your nature. Everyone has a different

292
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:58,480
nature, a way, a pull, what's their pull, toward. I created a personality profile test called

293
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:05,200
Principles U. I put it online for free, and it tells you a lot about, you know, what your nature is,

294
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,400
and it also shows if you take the test and you put somebody else's in, they take the test,

295
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:17,680
it'll tell you about your relationship. So you want to know what your nature is, what your pull

296
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:25,360
is going for, and then you go through your journey of learning experiences that, you know,

297
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,840
has its ups and downs, and, you know, you learn, you have your, you know, your painful experiences,

298
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,920
but have a principle, pain plus reflection equals progress. You learn, you get that.

299
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:48,640
And then to have perspective, to understand that all of these things, events,

300
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:56,320
transpire, you know, know the whole cycle, see the whole thing, gain perspective, and understand where

301
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:03,200
you are in the cycle, understand where you are in the life cycle. There's a life cycle, you know,

302
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,720
from birth to death, and let's say it on average, it lasts about 80 years, and you know that at

303
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,360
different parts in that cycle, certain things are going to happen. You're going to, you know,

304
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:21,040
first third of it, you're going to be dependent on others and you're learning. Second third of it,

305
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,320
you're going to be independent of your parents and so on, and you're going to be,

306
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,240
others will become dependent on you and you're working to be successful. At the various ages,

307
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:38,400
you get married, you have kids, you, all of these cycles, there's a life cycle, that happens over

308
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:45,200
and over again, and then there are these other cycles, these cycles of, you know,

309
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:56,080
you know, let's call it almost from, from war to war, whether that's an internal war to change

310
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:01,600
as the internal order or an external war, it changes the external order. And there's a cycle

311
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:10,800
that has to do with a debt cycle and those others, and you have to know what those cycles are like

312
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,720
and kind of where you are in those cycles, and you navigate it well. I mean, the main thing,

313
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:22,160
you know, is being strong, smart, capable, and adaptable. But that's why I put out

314
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,800
these, you know, videos and books to try to help people understand that.

315
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,600
You mentioned one of the common life landmarks that people get to is having kids and getting married.

316
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,840
At the moment, especially in the West, but also even more so in Asia, birth rates are falling

317
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:48,160
through the floor. We've got 0.78, I think in South Korea, we've got just around about one

318
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,720
in Japan, China also looking really bad at the moment. What, how concerned are you about

319
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,480
current population decline and future demographics?

320
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:07,840
Well, it's a real burden. And also depending on where it is, it's a real burden,

321
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:16,720
because the young have to take care of the old. So let's say, for example, in China,

322
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:26,720
with the one child policy, a married couple has four old adults that they have to take care of.

323
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:35,920
There's not an adequate social program. And that takes time and money. And it makes it,

324
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:45,440
you know, a great burden makes productivity a problem. And so you see, you know, like you say,

325
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:54,480
you know, you see this, you know, that that is a, these are burdens, costs, because the,

326
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:03,520
those who need taking care of and are not earning money need, you know, those resources and it's,

327
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:14,480
and it's sapping. You know, one hopes that productivity increases faster than this burden.

328
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,560
And that, but then it requires you, you have to, if you raise that, you have to then divide the pie

329
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,240
well. So it's, you know, it's demographics is a burden.

330
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:35,280
You are maybe alluding there to stuff like AI, robot, robotized workforces assisting in terms

331
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:42,800
of getting more juice out of the smaller demographics that we do have. And the potential

332
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,880
gains of that accruing to a small number of people that own that organization, you need a

333
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,920
relatively small group to be able to, I don't know how many people are in the open AI company,

334
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,560
but something tells me it's a significantly smaller number than the amount of impact that

335
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,640
it's had and is probably going to have. Right. So that's exactly right. So if you,

336
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,720
if the society as a whole can do that, what it will do is it'll naturally make the people who

337
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:19,280
some people very rich and some people very poor, but it can raise productivity enough

338
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,120
that it can raise living standards. Let's just imagine robots always work there and you don't

339
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:31,920
have to have people in doing the jobs. Then what you can have, then what you have to deal with is

340
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:39,520
how do you redistribute the wealth and opportunity? Because as I say, it'll be concentrated in some

341
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:48,400
and others will lose jobs and there's more productivity for the whole, but you have a

342
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,040
distribution issue. Are you familiar with Nicholas Eberstadt? Do you know him? He wrote

343
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,320
Men Without Work? No. He came on the show last week. I think he'd be really interested. The

344
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:05,680
book's very, very short and he's discovered this odd cohort of men that are lurking inside of the

345
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,000
unemployment statistics. There's 7 million men age 22 to 55 in the US who aren't working and

346
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,680
aren't looking for work. Only 10% of that number of students from the remaining 6.7 million.

347
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:26,320
About 2000 hours is the average amount of time that they spend watching screens and 50% of that

348
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:32,640
time on average is spent whilst on either prescription medication or weed recreational drugs.

349
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:39,840
Two thirds of those men are living in homes that claim at least one disability benefit. Basically,

350
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:45,520
lurking inside of the low unemployment numbers is this cohort of prime working age men who don't

351
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:53,120
have a job and don't want a job either. One of the potential downstream implications for that

352
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:59,200
is what does this mean for universal basic income? That if these men are able to be supported by

353
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:05,680
social welfare, but they're not going out and enacting poetry, staring up at the stars,

354
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,360
speaking their truth forward and dealing with the existential pain of living in a good way,

355
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,040
this doesn't seem like they're flourishing particularly. Given the automation that's

356
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,760
potentially coming down the pike, I wonder what that means.

357
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:28,400
Well, I think you paint or he paints an accurate picture and obviously it's not good.

358
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:39,120
As my wife was describing when she was dealing with that population, now it's very common for

359
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:49,120
kids to come to school high and then they have... What ages? Oh, young ages, 10.

360
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,480
Wow, okay. Well, marijuana is readily available.

361
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,960
And so, yeah, we have a number of these issues.

362
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,640
We've brought China up a couple of times and I think based on what I know about your work,

363
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:17,600
the conflict between the USA and China as China, the ascending new power that may be overtaking

364
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:24,640
the USA. However, we do have this perhaps unprecedented demographic collapse that China's

365
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,880
facing. The best predictions that I've seen suggest that it's going to go from about 1.1 to

366
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:36,080
1.2 billion now to about 650 to 700 million by 2050. So, it's pretty much getting chopped in half.

367
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:44,400
Does that change the way that the world orders change moving forward?

368
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,600
I think the main thing with China right now is we're on the brink of war with China for various

369
00:41:53,600 --> 00:42:06,800
reasons, like I hope we make it to 2050. So, yeah, the demographics is as I described it.

370
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:15,680
And by the way, them losing doesn't make us winning just so we're... Look at that.

371
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:26,000
We hope everyone gets better. And the world economy, we hope everybody has a better way.

372
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:36,560
Everybody loses in wars. And so, that's their set of circumstances and it'll be what it'll be.

373
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,600
I think the most important thing is how do we deal with our circumstances? How do we become

374
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:51,040
strong and healthy, financially healthy, productivity healthy and so on. So, yeah,

375
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:59,680
we could talk about the demographic problem in China, which is just what we talked about before

376
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,240
in terms of just robotics and productivity and all that makeup for that, I don't know. But I really

377
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,600
think we're projecting too much on the outside world. Okay, what do we do with China?

378
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:20,800
What relevance? Well, we trade with China. We don't have to go to a military war with China.

379
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:34,480
Why would we? We shouldn't do that. And then if that's the case, what's the problem with them

380
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:43,520
growing? Okay, it's not very much... Okay, let them grow and invent and let us grow and invent

381
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:51,040
and share the inventions. That would be good. But the problems that we're facing are pretty much

382
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:58,480
our own problems, the things we're talking about and the breakdown of infrastructure and all of that.

383
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:07,280
So, really, I think we should focus on that and maybe their demographics as a big burden

384
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:14,480
or not. They have other big burdens too. We all do. But let's focus on how we can be as good as we

385
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:22,640
can be. Yeah, as opposed to presuming that this zero sum game is China finds life harder,

386
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:29,120
therefore America finds life easier. That doesn't work. Yeah, I understand. You might have seen

387
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:35,360
the Restrict Act, which was brought up recently. It's lining up a potential ban for different types

388
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:43,600
of online services. And it seems like one of the potential bases for banning TikTok from America,

389
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:52,640
which, again, to me, just further embeds this them and us, China is enemy. If we can remove

390
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,720
that influence from the West as much as possible, then we are going to end up in a better situation.

391
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,240
Well, that's the dynamic, yes.

392
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,520
What do you think about the Fed's messaging about this soft landing thing? Is that possible? Like,

393
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,560
historically, I don't think it's really happened. But do they have enough control over the economy

394
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:21,760
to be able to make this work? The big issue is that a lot of debt was created. A lot of it is

395
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:33,840
government debt, but it is also corporate to a lesser extent household debt. So if you look at

396
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:40,880
the Silicon Valley, Valley Bank issue, it's not so much their issue as much as a worldwide issue.

397
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:53,600
What happened is that what's a bank? A bank takes in deposits, and then it takes that money and it

398
00:45:53,600 --> 00:46:01,440
invests it in things. And so they bought a lot of government bonds that had a higher yield than

399
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:08,400
they were paying out in the deposits. There's a tightness of monetary policy, and those yields

400
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:16,720
went up and the bonds went down in value. And then the amount they have to pay out went up in value.

401
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:26,400
And so they went broke. And that is happening all over. That happens not only through banks.

402
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:33,760
Banks as a whole did a lot of that. But insurance companies and so on, all around the world,

403
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,240
same sort of thing happened in Europe. Same sort of thing happened with Japanese

404
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:49,440
companies even buying US dollar bonds a lot. And so if you were to mark those to market,

405
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:59,920
you would have a terrible calamity. But what's going to likely happen is they don't want any

406
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:07,440
more of those bonds. And we're going to have to sell more bonds because we're going to have a deficit.

407
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,520
So when you have a deficit, you have to pay for it through selling debt. And there's a lesser

408
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:23,840
demand for that debt. And I think that that creates a problem in which either interest rates

409
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,400
go up or the Federal Reserve's got to come in and print. And this is a problem that exists

410
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:36,080
also in Europe with the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, all of them. So that's where

411
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:45,360
we are. And it has knock on effects. It's like dominoes that fall. So it will produce less credit.

412
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:53,840
And as it produces less credit, less demand, less credit, that'll produce less spending.

413
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:59,360
It'll come in certain parts of the economy. For example, commercial real estate.

414
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:13,760
For example, venture capital and private equity. For example, low grade bonds where they have a

415
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:20,400
heavily indebted company and the interest rate goes up a lot and that causes problems. So I think

416
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:27,360
you're in the part of the cycle where you've had the tightening and then the dominoes are beginning

417
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:36,000
to fall. And I think that that's going to produce more problems. So I think when it comes down to

418
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,400
it, there's just too much debt and we're adding it to it too quickly. And so it's going to,

419
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,600
either that debt will be paid off with hard money, in which case there's not much printing

420
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:57,040
and so on, or it'll be paid off with printing a lot of money to make it easier to pay off.

421
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:03,520
I think in the end, it's always the case that they print a lot of money in and make it easier

422
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:09,440
to pay off, but you have the reduced value of money. So that's how it looks to me. You'll have

423
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:16,800
probably a stagflation environment. And because you have that dynamic going on at the same time

424
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,120
as you have supply chain disruptions because of the geopolitical,

425
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,400
I think it's going to be a difficult environment.

426
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:34,400
Let's say that we do hit quite an aggressive recession. What are some of the ways that people

427
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:40,480
could even look to benefit financially from that happening? Are there any things that individuals

428
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:50,720
can do? The most important thing, as I say, is to have this basic, well-diversified.

429
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:59,200
And there are some assets and think about a small percentage of your money,

430
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:09,040
even in asset like gold, and diversification for countries to just to create a diversified

431
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,840
portfolio is important. One of the things that did occur, you mentioned Silicon Valley Bank there,

432
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:21,040
there was a big bump in terms of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies around about that time.

433
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,320
And it seemed like one of the first periods where people genuinely saw crypto as a store of value,

434
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:33,120
as a way to just, I need to put my money somewhere that I feel is safe. And given the last 18 months

435
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:39,200
of what's happened with crypto, considering that as that's the place I'm going to store my assets

436
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:45,920
in order for it to be safe, I think said quite a lot about how people sort of perceived the

437
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,840
state of the dollar and the security of banks and stuff at the moment. What's the role of

438
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,840
Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in the current economy in your eyes?

439
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:08,960
I think cryptocurrency or Bitcoin doesn't move in a reliable way related to almost anything.

440
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:20,720
It moves up and down because of this mood and that mood. And unlike gold, let's say,

441
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,000
I would prefer gold and I would prefer crypto for various reasons. Crypto,

442
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:35,200
it's very easy to track the owners and transactions in it. It's not liked by the government.

443
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:47,840
It doesn't move in a way that's consistent with any of the environments. And it's a fairly small

444
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:58,080
asset class. We talk a lot more about it, but its size is about 30% of the size of Microsoft.

445
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:05,360
And Microsoft is one stock among many stocks. So it's given probably a lot more attention.

446
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:14,400
I don't know who knows. Maybe there's some element of it. I don't understand why people

447
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:22,800
are more inclined to go to Bitcoin than gold. If you look internationally,

448
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:32,000
gold is, for central banks, the third highest reserve asset. First is dollars, then euros,

449
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:40,800
then gold, then Japanese yen. And central bankers are buying gold and they're not buying bonds.

450
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:56,000
And it's timeless and universal. It's been there. So I'm not a big fan of it. As I said before,

451
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,320
having a little bit, I have a little bit of it. But if you have a little bit of it, you have to

452
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:09,680
think about those things. And like I said, you have to be prepared for it to fall a lot.

453
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:16,000
If it goes down 80% or something, but that limits the amount that you can have in it.

454
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,240
So I don't know. I don't think a lot of Bitcoin.

455
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:27,520
I think what's interesting there is holding crypto essentially has a cognitive load on you,

456
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,680
using it as somewhere that you're using for investment as a store of value to just put

457
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,120
assets that you've got. There is a price that you pay because of the volatility,

458
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,960
but the price that you pay is with your own sanity with regards to that,

459
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:51,840
which is something that I hadn't quite considered. There are less sanity sapping forms of investment.

460
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:59,200
Yeah, that's a good way to do it. I mean, I've seen so many people. I've seen people get very

461
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,280
rich and I've seen people get very broke with it. I have friends in both camps.

462
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:11,200
Yeah. So we've spoken about today this very quickly changing highly volatile environment that we're

463
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,400
in, whether that be socioculturally, politically, globally, locally, financially.

464
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:28,000
Where should people go in order to find some solace in this, given the fact that it is

465
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:41,120
difficult to exist in this world? Go to places or spend time where there's not as much of this

466
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:50,320
junk going on. I mean, first of all, I think recognize, let's go to some of the basics.

467
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:59,120
What do you really need? You need a bed to sleep in. You need food to eat.

468
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:10,000
Most depressions, most people remain employed. Most wars, most people don't get

469
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:24,720
die or get injured. So let's calm down and put all this in place. Let's be in places where there's

470
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:34,240
goodness and harmony and beauty. Maybe you spend more time in nature or you go out there and

471
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:47,040
meditate. Meditation has had a big effect on me. So don't get all stressed about it.

472
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:59,840
Navigate it well. Enjoy life, enjoy those things. I think that's most important.

473
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,920
What would you say to the people that say, how am I expected to enjoy life when there's

474
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,960
all of this chaos going on? There's so many bad news stories and headlines. What about the financial

475
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:19,600
collapse? Well, first of all, if it's really having that impact on you, don't get so hung up on the

476
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:27,360
financial stories. Don't watch the television or something. Go out for a nice walk in the nature,

477
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:35,520
all that story. You don't really need all that story. Now what's going to happen to you, like I

478
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:43,360
say? Don't get so hung up on expectations of having the most amount of money or whatever. Just

479
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:56,400
think about it. Like I say, will you lose where you live? What matters? Your friends, your family,

480
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:03,920
your, give a good bed to sleep in for adequate food, make out into nature.

481
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:13,440
My own view is sometimes the most luxurious thing I can do is take a tent and be out in a beautiful

482
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:27,520
spot. Avoid it. Don't get stressed out. Understand it. Be prepared.

483
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,120
Redefining success and what happiness means and what we should be aiming for in life,

484
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:39,520
I think is a very worthwhile pursuit. Right. I'll tell you,

485
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:52,720
this idea of success being measured in the amount of money and status you have is really screwed up.

486
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:02,320
Like if you think about money, and this is shown in Measures of Happiness,

487
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:10,640
past a basic amount of money so that you don't have the misery, there is no correlation between

488
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:15,520
the level of money you have and the level of happiness you have. Lots of studies show that.

489
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:23,360
And the highest correlation is do you have a community? That's the highest source of

490
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:30,880
happiness and also longevity. It has a big effect on longevity, stress.

491
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,120
More than smoking, more than stopping alcohol, more than going to the gym and exercising.

492
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:46,000
Right. And then you think what is money for? It has no intrinsic value. It only has a value of

493
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:56,240
what it buys. And so it has a limited marginal ability, benefit. You add more and more to it.

494
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:02,160
And like what are you going to do? Okay, so you're going to get a bigger house or a bigger car?

495
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:11,040
And what does that really mean incrementally relative to spending time with friends and

496
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:18,000
family and all of those things? Most of the good things in life are not expensive. Right.

497
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:28,160
Friends, family, nature, sex, anything. It's not going to get better with more money,

498
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:36,400
right, materially better. And so it seems to me that it then can become an obsession

499
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:45,760
and that's not healthy. So I think it's by and large you handle it well and it's

500
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,240
all going to be okay. It's all going to be okay.

501
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,000
Ray Dalio, ladies and gentlemen, if people want to keep up to date with the work that you're

502
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:05,920
doing, why should they go? My more lengthy writings are on LinkedIn, but I'm on all of the social

503
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:15,600
media. So in various ways and if I write something that's longer, it'll be linked to

504
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:22,320
LinkedIn. So all the major social media I'm on. Ray, I really appreciate you. Thank you for today.

505
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,360
Thank you for your time. What's happening, people? Thank you very much for tuning in. If you enjoyed
