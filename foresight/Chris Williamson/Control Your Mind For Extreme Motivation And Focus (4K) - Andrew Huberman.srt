1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
If we were to look at ourselves through the lens of an experiment like we would an animal experiment

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,380
We think that animal is sick if you saw an animal digging in the corner looking looking looking looking for a bone the dog

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:17,160
Is looking looking looking looking looking and you'd think that's really sad. That's us, right? That's us

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,160
I'm pointing it myself intentionally. That's us

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,840
Dr. Andrew Huberman welcome to the show great to be here. It's been a long time coming very long time coming

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,600
What do you mean when you say you cannot control the mind with the mind?

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,960
Yeah, that statement really emerges from the fact that if we are in a pretty relaxed state or

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,360
If we are happy

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,740
We generally feel like we can do what we want to do. We can maneuver through our environment

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,680
We can make choices that are reasonable

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,440
But oftentimes we're not in relaxed and happy states. That's just part of the human experience obviously and there's a

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Fundamental feature to the nervous system

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,320
Which is this thing they call the autonomic nervous system

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,720
Which is just fancy nerd speak for the components of your nervous system that raise your levels of alertness or bring them

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,960
Way down sometimes we hear fight or flight rest and digest, but this system governs all that but a lot more and

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,480
basically what happens is when we are at the extremes of

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,880
the autonomic what I call seesaw of

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:31,320
Very very alert to the point of being really stressed or panicked or concerned or if we are very close to sleep and we're drowsy and we're exhausted

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,920
at those

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,920
points along the

21
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
autonomic

22
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,000
Nervous system

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,520
Our thoughts become a bit like a runaway train, you know if you're very upset

24
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,160
It's hard to talk yourself out of it if you're stressed. It's hard to think yourself out of it

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,680
In fact, you can start doing all sorts of third-personing and

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,840
Rationalization you can call someone you can text somebody. It's very hard to get yourself out of those states with thinking alone

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,080
But the beauty of the autonomic nervous system is that it

28
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,920
Traverses the brain and the body and it connects to essentially all the organs of the body

29
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,760
And it's a two-way street such that certain behaviors

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Even certain patterns of breathing

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Etc allow us to

32
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,160
Shift where we are on the autonomic continuum

33
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,440
between very very alert and stressed and very calm and

34
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:35,800
thereby give our mind a shift also in terms of the kinds of thoughts that we can entertain the sorts of

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,520
Actions that we can engage in to make this concrete if you're very very stressed. We're very very upset

36
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,720
Two things happen one. It's very hard to take your focus off

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,480
Whatever it is that's upsetting you and if you don't know what's upsetting you knew pure anxiety, but you don't know why

38
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,280
It's very hard to take your mind off of the feelings of anxiety

39
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,840
In those states of mind

40
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,440
There's another component which is that for whatever reason and no one really understands why this is

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,600
It feels as if the state that you're in will go on forever

42
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,640
Now when we're in happy relaxed states rarely do we think gosh?

43
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,080
This is going to go on forever and yet when we are in these unfortunate states of mind

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,060
We get the idea somehow it was sort of hijacks our perception of time and we feel like this is never going to stop

45
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,920
If we turn to the body and certain behaviors

46
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Let me talk about what those are

47
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:34,200
We are able to move ourselves along the autonomic continuum and at that point when we've done that successfully

48
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,360
It's actually quite straightforward to do

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,800
We are able to think about things differently

50
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,120
We start to get a sense that the way we feel

51
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,480
might not be the way we're going to feel forever and

52
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,120
It's in those shifts that we start to realize ah

53
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,720
My mind actually is not my best friend at these extremes, but there's a lot more to it

54
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,560
You're only getting the tip of the iceberg in those states, so that's why I say if you can't control the mind with the mind

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,160
Look to the body to control the mind

56
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,880
How would that be adaptive?

57
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,840
How would it be adaptive for us to focus all of our attention on to the anxiety?

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,640
Is that something that you could see a useful? Absolutely, so let's take stress as an example

59
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,640
And this could be stress panic anxiety

60
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,360
You know each one of those has a definition in medical terms psychological terms, but to be fair

61
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,840
No one really knows how to draw the line in the brain between fear and stress and anxiety

62
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,920
But we can save with certainty that all of those states

63
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,920
involve high levels of alertness high levels of awareness sometimes for things in our environment and sometimes just for what's going on internally

64
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
When we are stressed anxious

65
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,120
Afraid waking up in the middle of the night doesn't matter what triggered it

66
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,520
There are a couple basic things that happen to all of us first of all our heart rate quickens. That's kind of an obvious one

67
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,760
Fuel from our muscles and our liver is shuttled to particular organs of the body and away from others

68
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,040
In particular fuel is shuttled towards the big muscles of the body to generate large movements

69
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:12,000
This is why we quake a bit when we're stressed the hands will shake it's preparing us for where you're prepared for movement

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,520
How does that prepare us for movement?

71
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,320
The shaking actually is the consequence of trying to not move when we are stressed

72
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,520
Basically, this is why taking a walk or a run you actually feel like you can kind of dispel the stress

73
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:29,000
You're not actually dispelling the stress. What's happened is it's like the ARP the RPM are getting cranked up. It's like idling it

74
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,640
Right, it's you know, you could sit there in a parked car and do that

75
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,640
But basically you take the thing out of park and it just wants to go and so a lot of the times when we're stressed

76
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,360
It's in conditions in which we're trying to remain still

77
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,000
Public speaking and a tough argument, you know at the doctor's office about to get an injection

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,120
You know, it depends on what stresses people obviously, but that readiness for action is a second component

79
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,520
It's a heart rate readiness for action by way of shuttling

80
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:01,120
glucose and other fuels to the muscles and then away from the reproductive organs from digestive organs, etc

81
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Because that is just not the right time for that

82
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:13,760
Another very very powerful feature of this response is that our our pupils of our eyes the dark parts of our eyes get big

83
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,640
Now you might think that that expands your visual field

84
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,240
But actually the way the optics of the eye work that narrows the aperture of your visual field

85
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,040
So when you are stressed, you literally are seeing things through a small aperture

86
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,800
so distraught view of the world as they say and

87
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,760
Under those conditions, you cannot see things in your periphery as well as you could prior to being stressed

88
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,400
but you become exquisitely good at

89
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,840
Measuring small detail changes in whatever it is that you happen to be looking at now

90
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,280
There's an internal process too, which is that the aperture on your thinking also becomes very very narrow

91
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,800
So that if for instance, well, I had this happen the other day. I I heard something very stressful

92
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
I couldn't think about anything else

93
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,280
Right and that might just seem logical like of course you can't think about anything else very stressful

94
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,360
You're concerned about this, but my mind wasn't thinking about this particular incident

95
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,600
It was thinking if this then this then if that then that and that then that and so you start, you know dropping into the future

96
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,440
You start dropping into the past like why did we do that?

97
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,440
Wow, you know and you start doing all that kind of cycling through things

98
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,400
And of course there are so many things that can help relax us meditation

99
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,040
Exercise a nice healthy meal social connection

100
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,920
but the fifth column of the stress response is that

101
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,120
Your aperture of vision your aperture of thinking gets very narrow

102
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,640
And it becomes harder and harder to do the very things that would keep you out of stress

103
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,880
And so this is kind of the the double-edged sword that is stress

104
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:52,360
And so all the more reason why in those moments if the stress is not desired because there are moments when stress is desired

105
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,240
You know you're navigating an emergency, etc

106
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,440
But if you don't want to be in that narrow aperture of thinking and vision, etc

107
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,360
Then you need to find some way to bring your level of autonomic arousal as it's called down

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,800
Slightly so that you can start thinking about other possibilities or you know, there are instances

109
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,560
I think everyone's been in this kind of situation where the thing that's stressing out is not going to get resolved today

110
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,240
And you just sleep and of course you know you need to sleep and then you can't sleep

111
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,640
And then of course that creates a compounding stress

112
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,080
And now you're stressed about not being able to sleep and then over the course of the next few days

113
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,680
You you know dissolve into a puddle of tears, but fortunately there are ways out of that kind of self-destruction

114
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,160
You've done a lot of work on fear that was one of the things that you mentioned before

115
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,520
Is there something that everybody is scared of because I've heard the

116
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,240
Story the wives tale babies are born with is it fears of heights and loud noises or something

117
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,640
Is there any truth in that there is there something everyone's scared of there is I think the one that

118
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:56,360
Everybody who has a healthy nervous system will react quite robustly to is if you start increasing the amount of carbon dioxide

119
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,240
That they're breathing and reduce the amount of oxygen that they're taking in that's terrifying

120
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Am I right in thinking there's a

121
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Experiment you can do where it's a single breath and that is pretty reliable at bringing on an anxiety attack

122
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,040
Yeah, if you have people, please don't do this because you need the right proper medical staff around

123
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,800
But they're they're great experiments of having people breathe carbon dioxide directly and it you basically panic

124
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,520
It's terrifying one big gulp of carbon dioxide will make make you very afraid

125
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,680
It turns out that there are a little group of neurons

126
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,280
Of course neurons are just nerve cells that low group of neurons in the brain stem that respond to levels of carbon dioxide in the blood

127
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,080
It turns out the reason we breathe is of course to bring in oxygen and then off low carbon dioxide

128
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,720
But we don't have neurons that stimulate breathing for oxygen

129
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,000
We have neurons that sense when carbon dioxide levels get too high

130
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,840
So if you hold your breath, huh, eventually carbon dioxide levels go up and then at the moment that they reach a certain threshold

131
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,640
These neurons fire and trigger the gas brief flex

132
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,800
Oh, so in that moment you bring in oxygen and then of course you offload some carbon dioxide

133
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,880
That's why it's so important to work on co2 tolerance right for breath work. Yeah, so free divers a sport

134
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,400
I actually don't recommend

135
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,640
Because there's only one way out of that sport as they say I have some friends who are free drivers

136
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,280
And and obviously you can do it safely with the right guide and training etc

137
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:27,120
But it is a very dangerous sport because for most people when carbon dioxide levels increase in the bloodstream and brain

138
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,480
triggers this gas brief flex what

139
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,360
Free divers train is carbon dioxide tolerance

140
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:39,600
So they do that a couple of different ways and again, please don't do this because you actually people have died doing this

141
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,800
Which is so one way is you can do what's called cyclic hyperventilation

142
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:50,800
Right you do that 25 times or so and you think oh you're bringing a lot of oxygen you are but you're also

143
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,560
Offloading a lot of carbon dioxide, especially if you use forceful exhales normally humans breathe through active inhales and passive exhales

144
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,240
You just cut they just sort of dump their air passively

145
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,000
But if you do the cyclic hyperventilation you're dumping a lot of carbon dioxide and then if you were to

146
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,760
Hold your breath what you would find is you could hold your breath for a lot longer

147
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,920
Why because your carbon dioxide levels are reduced so you don't have the same impulse to breathe now on land

148
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,560
That's a more or less safe thing to do provided that you can get a good gulp of air once the gas reflex hits

149
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,560
If you do that before going under water cyclic hyperventilation they call air packing and then you go under water

150
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,880
You're going to be able to excuse me cyclic hyperventilation to air pack and then go under water

151
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,680
but your

152
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,680
Carbon dioxide is then lower you're going to be able to stay under longer

153
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,960
But this is very dangerous because normally when that carbon dioxide threshold hits you would

154
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,240
Pop up to the surface you sort of panic and want to go to the top free divers learn to tolerate

155
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,160
High levels of carbon dioxide in their bloodstream and stay very very calm the way they die is very interesting

156
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,960
Because it speaks to the physiology the way they they die is they'll just be swimming

157
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,040
Feeling completely calm because they're very used to they've trained up the co2 tolerance carbon dioxide tolerance

158
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:16,720
And when they die they don't suddenly feel like oh my goodness. I'm running out of air. It's just lights go black

159
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,400
That's it. They're just black out and so they're alive and then they're gone

160
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,640
And so this is why they use spotters. They you know, they have a line etc

161
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
anytime you hear about somebody

162
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,880
Dying doing free diving. It's rarely because they weren't

163
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,720
Comfortable at a given depth or because it's not because they're gas reflexes kicked in

164
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,640
It's because their gas reflex has been so desensitized that it's after the point of which they die

165
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,600
precisely and this you know, it's sort of like when you hear that

166
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:51,040
Skilled parachuters die why well because they're so comfortable with so many jumps. They actually forget to pull there's sometimes

167
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,600
there are many instances in which they're they're

168
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,920
videoing

169
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,560
The first time jumpers right and they're getting the video for them and they themselves forget to pull because they're so

170
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,240
Jumping out of planes and so as people get more and more advanced in something

171
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,120
There's a there's a new risk that that surfaces because unless it's very reflexive and they built all all the protocols in

172
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,120
Oftentimes they can overlook the very thing that allowed them to become expert in the first place

173
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,880
Why do my palms get sweaty when I watch videos of people climbing up cranes and stuff like that?

174
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,520
You know the ones that I mean the guy's got a gopro is a dude called james kinkston from the uk. That's a psychopath

175
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
He goes up to the highest

176
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
towers of dubai

177
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,520
Legally in the middle of the night and then I watch it on a screen. It's only this big and

178
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,960
I get this visceral response. Yeah, well two things first of all I I can relate

179
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,760
You know, I saw the free solo movie with alex honnold and you know, he lives

180
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,680
And it's still scary to watch right you actually know the outcome at the beginning

181
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,880
they sort of make it clear that he manages to do this and

182
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,240
You're it's still terrifying and I think it's for the same reason that the old youtube videos are terrifying

183
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,440
Which is that we are so visual as animals

184
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
We are so visual. I mean

185
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,480
rodents even a lot of carnivore predators are extremely olfactory smell driven

186
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:19,120
Humans are incredibly visual. I mean more than 40 percent of the human brain has something to do with vision visual navigation eye movements

187
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,720
um

188
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,360
Visual perception color perception face perception

189
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,000
We have dedicated areas of the brain that are just for perceiving human faces and the micro expressions of human faces

190
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
So it's so highly evolved for us

191
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,200
When we see depth of field

192
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
That's not um

193
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,760
parallel to the ground

194
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
It is terrifying with good reason because

195
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,640
You know, what's the universal force that we all experience from the time we're born is gravity

196
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,800
The first thing you learn is that things fall down not up, right?

197
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,760
They you know, it's it's like the the fundamental rule that we come into the world with it's like

198
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,520
Day one

199
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
Even though the baby's got flopping around like a potato

200
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,440
But can't even hold its head up the eyes are often

201
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,760
You know the ocular muscles of the eyes are often not very good

202
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,280
So babies it'll kind of their eyes are rolling back in their head that generally corrects itself

203
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
over the next few weeks or so

204
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:16,080
But the feeling of gravity of them, you know, if they feel like they're being dropped even the tiniest bit, right?

205
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,320
They will go wide eyed. So there's a built-in vestibulo ocular reflex

206
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,200
So when you see depth of field in the direction of the gravitational pull

207
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,320
You actually get a little bit of activity

208
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,400
In your cerebellum, which literally means mini brain a little area of the brain in the back

209
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,360
That actually looks like a little mini brain if you were looking at the brain and that area of the brain is responsible

210
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,520
For all the reflexes associated with the falling reflex. It does a lot of other things too

211
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,400
So when you see that depth of field in the direction of gravity

212
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,880
You have a little micro activity in your brain that you might fall

213
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,680
And if you've ever been to a tall bridge or a dam and you go to the edge and you know people love to play with this

214
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,680
There's that also that tower in toronto. They have the big um, see his tower

215
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,760
Well, the big no the big um the big tower and I forget what it is. Maybe it's in calgary. Goodness Canadians are gonna hate me

216
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,320
Okay, I love Canadians, but for some reason I can't remember this

217
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,520
They have one of those glass floors there where you can walk and it's terrifying and you know, you're not going to fall through it

218
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,880
Right or they tell you and you're not going to fall through it, but it's terrifying

219
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,880
because your

220
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,920
Body and brain are preparing for this immense fall. So when you see this in video, it's the same thing

221
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,800
I always say a picture is worth a thousand words, but a video is worth 10 million pictures

222
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,040
I mean, this is the reason why we're so drawn to things like instagram scrolling. It's like text text video

223
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,560
You know or the the enormous popularity of tiktok

224
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,840
It's video now the enormous popularity of twitter still escapes me because that's a different different sort of cultural gravitational pull

225
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,360
But video and in particular action that gets us in a kind of a primitive mode

226
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
That is an extremely

227
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,560
Alluring visual image. What about emotional fears like a fear of failure or social disapproval or something

228
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,600
Do they work in a in a similar way or is there a different part of the brain that's using that? Yeah, great question

229
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,320
So um a few years ago a postdoc in my lab was now a staff scientist melise yeoman

230
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,560
Excuse me melise doctor melise yeoman's ball bunch has a long name

231
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,360
Excellent researcher studies fear

232
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,200
Did a very broad scale survey of the general public thousands and thousands of entries

233
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,280
Created this kind of

234
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,520
Cloud of bubbles the bigger the bubble the more the greater number of people that had that fear

235
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,920
You saw some we saw some interesting things. So heights certainly public speaking certainly

236
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
doctor's office and stringes certainly

237
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,280
public speaking fear is very common

238
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,680
Social isolation fear is very common, but we also saw some things like dogs

239
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,320
You know, there are a number of people who are afraid of dogs

240
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,160
Which is inconceivable to me because I love dogs exactly the same. Yeah, but people

241
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,160
You know people form these associations whether or not through experience or through indirect experience observing others

242
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,600
I think public speaking is one of the greatest fear of dying

243
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Yeah, I swear. I don't it's not funny, but

244
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,640
figure of speech I

245
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,600
Never think about dying and being afraid of dying. I think about all the scary things that could happen while i'm living

246
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
but there are many people who are just

247
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
intrinsically afraid of dying

248
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
And so that's that's a big one

249
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,520
For people that uh, don't swim fear of drowning for people that swim less. So

250
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,360
For people that have some sort of psychiatric disorder genuine psychiatric disorder

251
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,600
Like obsessive compulsive disorder, which is not just per obsessive compulsive personality, but obsessive compulsive disorder

252
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,800
Fear of the of being discovered in the shame that they have around their obsessions and compulsions. These are

253
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,800
True ocd is very common. Do they all live in the same place?

254
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,080
All of these different fears that all exist. Yeah, so I was rattling off and I didn't answer your question

255
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
To the the more important point. So forgive me

256
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,200
The short answer is they have a final common pathway

257
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,880
Which is increased autonomic arousal and that is funneled through a couple what we call limbic structures

258
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,280
Among others. So there's certainly involvement of the of the now famous amygdala

259
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,360
This which means almond is this almond shape structure on the two sides of the brain

260
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,800
There's also area the brain called the striatum analysis is also involved in fear and then the hypothalamus this small collection

261
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,280
Of neurons just above the roof of your mouth

262
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,760
Which is really to me one of the more fascinating areas of the brain harbors neurons

263
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,160
That create a body wide and brain wide response

264
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,840
To something that the higher order areas of the brain like the forebrain

265
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,760
See and perceive as dangerous as threatening. So the short answer is yes

266
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,480
It all funnels through hypothalamus amygdala striaterminalis and autonomic nervous system. That's a final common pathway

267
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,320
But in terms of the variety of different things that can stimulate fear and the ways that they can do that

268
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,320
That is highly contextual

269
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,000
So the forebrain this real estate in the brain right behind behind the forehead is incredible because it's sort of

270
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,000
Free real estate for you to customize for your life according to what happens to you early on

271
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,800
So for instance, you might not be at all afraid of heights

272
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
And you say well, why is that so?

273
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,840
Well, maybe when you were a kid you were one of those maniacs that like, you know doing within the states

274
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,240
We call them cherry drops the kids that could you know swing on their feet and then jump off the the bar and

275
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,400
Then other kids are timidly crawling to the top of the thing don't even want to go up the ladder to the slide

276
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:28,160
There's a ton of variation and that variation does not exist in the kind of deeper circuitry the final common path circuitry

277
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,120
It exists in the learning that we experienced early in life one bad fall

278
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,760
Can do it. I mean, I was bitten very badly by a german shepherd when I was a kid

279
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,520
Head I almost got my eye, but you know for whatever reason I've always liked dogs anyway

280
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,680
But there are other things that I've experienced that have left long term negative imprints

281
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:53,840
So I it's highly contextual and a lot of it has to do with what happens immediately after the bad experience

282
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,080
This is why nowadays there's a lot of legal use of the drug ketamine

283
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,520
After traumas, you know, this is all very dark stuff, unfortunately

284
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,360
But if you you know, you just imagine the family member that was just in a car crash and saw their

285
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,280
The driver their loved one impaled onto the steering column

286
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,280
I mean what could be more horrible than that nowadays if they come into the emergency room

287
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:20,560
They will often give them an injection of ketamine, which is the dissociative anesthetic to get them to dissociate from this extreme emotional state

288
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
So there are ways now to treat this

289
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,520
And ketamine is used clinically at later periods, too

290
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,720
didn't you you you did an experiment where you went

291
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,720
Diving with sharks and I think that there was a complication and you went back the next day to redo it

292
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,560
I'm going to guess that this is for the exact same reason to sort of conquer and

293
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,880
Integrate the experience. Yeah to make a long story short

294
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,280
We went two years in a row out to Guadalupe Island where there are a lot of great white sharks

295
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,240
Some of the more expert shark divers were cage eggs sitting they were leaving the cage the first year

296
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
I did not the second year

297
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,800
I decided I would but the day before I did

298
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,760
I went down into the cage just get comfortable again down there and I had an air failure

299
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,520
And the safety tanks were out also and obviously I experienced extreme carbon dioxide

300
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,440
Overload and panic. I didn't full-blown panic. I kept enough awareness that I was able to obviously I'm here

301
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,480
Um, I survived doing a share air protocol, etc. But it was a very bad situation

302
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,080
I don't like to say I nearly died because that's actually sort of letting the bug in my brain

303
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,800
I like to joke that the reaper came in and um, you know and offered me a fist bump and I offered him a different gesture instead

304
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,360
so I survived

305
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,480
But the next day I woke up very very distraught because I had this bug in this loop in my brain

306
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,480
I you know this notion I came so close to to the end and so I did go back down and I did cage exit

307
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
and I don't say that to

308
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
Suggest that it was the smartest decision

309
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
Obviously you're safer on the boat or on land

310
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,720
I don't say it to sound, you know, again tough or anything. I did it deliberately because I did not want to return

311
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
home with this

312
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:09,680
Loop of fear and so I went back into the traumatic circumstance and obviously made it out and if you look at all the successful treatments

313
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,240
for trauma they all involve

314
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
getting close to the

315
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
trauma inducing mindset

316
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,360
exposure therapy gradual and assisted by a clinician, but rarely if ever

317
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Are people with serious trauma encouraged to get as far away from the feeling of at least not in the clinical setting

318
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,960
This has a lot of implications for things like trigger warnings

319
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,920
Colleagues of mine in psychiatry. I've asked them directly. What do you think of trigger warnings? And they said, you know

320
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,040
I mean, there's some logic to it on the on the surface, but if you really

321
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
think about true trauma

322
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
And we can define trauma

323
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,000
Dr. Paul Conti was on my podcast his amazing trauma psychiatrists. He said trauma is an experience

324
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,120
It's not just a bad experience trauma is an experience that changes your nervous system such that it behaves differently in the future

325
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,440
That in a way that's maladaptive for you. So if you look at all the trauma treatments, they're all about learning to talk about the trauma

326
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,680
Even experiencing some of the same feelings. So things like trigger warnings and all these things that buffer us against

327
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
Feeling our true feelings

328
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,840
Do nothing but prolong the trauma and prolong and exacerbate fear

329
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,160
You had David Goggins in the lab to study him for fear. What did you learn from looking at that guy?

330
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,360
David's David's great. I always chuckle with David because you know, the one thing about David is what you see on social media

331
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,720
Is actually what you get when you interact with David

332
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,440
We worked long hours one day and I was everyone was ready to tap out. This is a bunch of people in

333
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,920
Silicon Valley for a day, you know doing some workshop type thing and he just he was changing into his running shorts

334
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,240
Midway he was going to run to the airport and he ran to the airport as far as I know to get his flight

335
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
I believe so, you know

336
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,880
But there was this moment of should we continue? Should we take a break and he was like, no, let's keep going keep going

337
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,720
Everything you see and read and hear about David is exactly how he shows up. It's really wonderful

338
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,160
He came to the lab and he did, you know, we have a virtual version of the shark thing

339
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,280
Um, which of course is not the same. It's the real experience, but for people who are afraid of sharks

340
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,160
It's quite scary for them and allows us to study fear

341
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,200
David was he's very afraid of sharks, which was sort of

342
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,120
amusing to me given that

343
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,280
As a seal he had to spend a lot of time in water

344
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:28,080
But uh, he was first one in wanted to do the vr talked about how he didn't like it. But um, but that's why he did it

345
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,080
You know constant

346
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,280
Testing himself. In fact, I think even though David's quite successful

347
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,080
I think and has many many options of how to spend his time

348
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,600
I believe this is correct that I think right now. He's doing fire jumping

349
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,640
He's fighting fires in the wilderness by ziplining in or fast lining in or jumping out of planes

350
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,960
So he's constantly pushing that

351
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,320
That friction lever to create

352
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,320
Or build or further build this thing about leaning into friction

353
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
And this is a term that isn't really scientific

354
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,080
But that I decided to coin because this idea of limbic friction

355
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,880
That when we're very tired and we need to be in action or when we're very stressed and we need to

356
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,000
Perform in a more calm and controlled way

357
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,000
There's friction on both sides getting out of bed when we're exhausted hard

358
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,160
Very hard often

359
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,840
Leaning into action in a calm and deliberate way when we're freaking out

360
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,040
Like going to give a public lecture if one has fear of public speaking

361
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,560
Also hard so this limbic friction and david just seems to seek

362
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,440
What I call limbic friction in every domain of life

363
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,160
Is that like exposure therapy for limbic friction then?

364
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,520
Essentially, yeah

365
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,320
I mean what you're training and improving when you're getting better at dealing with stress

366
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:45,200
Is this ability to tolerate high amounts of adrenaline in your body and to think clearly and function well

367
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,720
I mean adrenaline is epinephrine and just a little bit of physiology

368
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,680
It's released from the adrenals obviously above the kidneys that gets your body organs

369
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Amped up and energized

370
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,120
It can't cross the so-called blood brain barrier

371
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,240
You have a high restriction fence that we call the blood brain barrier around the brain

372
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
Keep bad molecules out

373
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,120
Adrenaline therefore is released also within the brain from a little cluster of neurons called locus ceruleus. The name doesn't matter

374
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
So when you are stressed

375
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,440
Your brain and your body both wake up and that adrenaline

376
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,800
Hijack certain systems narrows your visual focus, etc. Etc. If you look at almost all stress inoculation

377
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,800
protocols

378
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Cold water ice bath cold shower

379
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,440
cyclic hyperventilation

380
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
Those all do the same thing

381
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,600
They generate a lot of adrenaline release in the brain and a lot of adrenaline release in the body

382
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,640
But it's different if those if the adrenaline in the brain and body is evoked by you that you did it

383
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,400
Because under conditions under which you did the ice bath deliberately and now you're wide awake and really really alert

384
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,560
There's this feeling that you have options

385
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,280
It wasn't done to you, but you can train up an ability to for instance think

386
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
Clearly and calmly

387
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,520
Maybe even do some simple math problems in your head or maybe try and relax while there's all this adrenaline

388
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,960
In your system and that carries over so that when you you know, we've all done it

389
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,440
You're driving along the person in front of you stop short

390
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,720
And you're almost in the accident, right? There's that moment where you could panic or that moment where you could

391
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,480
You know road rage or that moment where you could freak out

392
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:29,520
But if you are familiar with the feeling of adrenaline in your brain and body you navigate that in a in a calmer way

393
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,760
How well because adrenaline is generic. There's no adrenaline for the car crash adrenaline for the heights adrenaline for the

394
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,440
The uh the relationship situation. It's all the same so we can get better

395
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,040
We can raise our stress threshold as I like to refer to it and that can be done through cold water

396
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Or cyclic hyperventilation

397
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,680
Ideally not at the same time, but cold water

398
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:59,040
You know is a universal stimulus for creating adrenaline release and there's a big range of cold not infinite but a big range of cold

399
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,840
In which you can generate

400
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,560
Adrenaline without harming your tissue whereas with heat you get into a very hot environment or very low oxygen environment

401
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,000
You'll also get a lot of adrenaline, but you can also suffocate and burn yourself

402
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,960
So this is why cold is used in navy seal screening and training

403
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,800
And this is why I think so many people really like the ice bath and cold showers

404
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,520
It has a bunch of other positive effects, but it is a great trigger for adrenaline

405
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,040
speaking about relationships one of the most

406
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,800
Uh common traumas probably that people are going to go through is heartbreak, right?

407
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,600
You're going to be in a relationship that you imagine is going to continue forever. Maybe when you're 18 or sometimes when you're 48

408
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,640
And then it's going to stop. Have you thought about the neuroscience of what's happening during heartbreak?

409
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,240
Now we did so i've done episodes of our podcast on

410
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
love attachment and relationships

411
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,840
Which is a fascinating literature mostly from psychology, but also by biological literature

412
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:05,600
And that's mostly about people's orientation toward attachment. So they're just very quickly

413
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:12,880
There's the so-called secure attached style. This typically emerges in childhood when there's a very predictable care

414
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,440
caregiver carry

415
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,560
A relationship between child and most often mother, but it can be father to or other caregiver

416
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,840
Just so happens that the classic experiments were done on mothers because this was in the 1970s and there weren't as many

417
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,840
Reverse role really, you know homes, etc. There were some but not as many as there are now. So

418
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,920
That's one style of attachment the parent leaves the child gets a little distraught

419
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:42,400
But then can distract itself doing other things or just simply do other things because they have a high degree of intrinsic knowledge

420
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
Not the thought but intrinsic

421
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,280
Calm the autonomic nervous system doesn't feel any need to ramp up because the mom returns

422
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,800
Then there's the so-called insecure attachment styles and there are a bunch of different ones

423
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,840
But those are the ones where it's really stressful when the parent leaves. It's not clear. They're going to come back

424
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,480
And when they come back, it's not clear that there's they're going to reestablish the bond the child will feel

425
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,720
Supported, etc

426
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,280
Here's what's fascinating those same neural circuits

427
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,040
Are repurposed for romantic attachment in adult life the same circuits, which shouldn't surprise us

428
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,280
I mean, why would the brain throw away valuable circuitry?

429
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,960
But this whole Freudian notion that you know childhood attachment styles map onto adult attachment styles

430
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,520
That's real. That's physiological

431
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,680
Now one important point

432
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,400
It's not one for one in the sense that let's say you had a secure attachment to your father

433
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,640
Let's say it's a young a young girl and as a baby and a young child

434
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,840
She had a secure attachment to her father and an insecure attachment to her mother

435
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,080
In adulthood and let's say she's heterosexual. So in adulthood she prefers men as romantic partners

436
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,920
This girl grows up and you might say well, she had a good relationship to her dad

437
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,640
So she's going to have a good secure attachment style in her adult heterosexual relationships

438
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,960
Often it's not the case

439
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,120
They will transplant or superimpose the insecure attachment style to the to the mother on to male

440
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,000
relationships

441
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,720
But have great relationships to female friends, for instance

442
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,320
So we have to be a little careful to not map one for one. That's important

443
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,400
So all of that is in us

444
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,800
And then you were talking about breakups and we did an episode on grief

445
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,080
And the way that grief works in the brain and nervous system is that there are three

446
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,720
Sort of factors that are mapped in our consciousness and our subconscious

447
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,120
And these are space

448
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,360
Time and this notion of closeness, which is attachment space and time is very simple

449
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,360
It's where is the person that I love and when will I see them next?

450
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,160
Right?

451
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,800
I mean if you have a relative that lives overseas and you know, they're alive

452
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,800
You're not going to grieve them. You might really miss them

453
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,760
But you're not going to grieve them the same way you would if suddenly you get the note

454
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,560
Unfortunately that they passed away

455
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:48,320
And then attachment is how close you are to them like how critically you rely on them for

456
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,280
Internal control and support and that doesn't mean they have to be an immediate caregiver

457
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,200
It could just be like a really good friend. You call them mates over in the UK

458
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,000
Right? Like a really good friend that just your knowledge of him

459
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,880
Just makes you feel good. You feel better in the world

460
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,720
You know as a guy who mostly grew up with kind of a big pack of male friends

461
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,760
I mean I feel strongest and happiest and most secure in life when I see something about one of my friends doing well in life

462
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,800
It just makes me feel good if one of them dies and unfortunately I'm getting to the age where a number of them have died

463
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
then

464
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,680
You feel like all of a sudden like goodness like there's a loss internally, right?

465
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,000
Okay, that's all sort of obvious

466
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,200
But what's interesting is that the grief process itself

467
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,680
Is about restructuring this map this map think of it like a tripod. It's got three pieces space time and closeness

468
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
When someone dies

469
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,560
It's very confusing for the brain because where are they in space? Well, the body is put someplace. Maybe it's cremated. Maybe it's not

470
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,120
We have notions of a spirit and that depends on one's orientation a soul or a spirit

471
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,560
Okay, or if you don't then you don't then where do they go, right? And then time when will you see them again?

472
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,440
There's the never you'll never see them again

473
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,600
And the closeness component remains and so there's an untethering of this map and so there's been brain imaging studies

474
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,240
um beautiful work by

475
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Mary Frances O'Connor University of Arizona

476
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,800
showing that if you look in the brain and people that are in grief from loss of a really strong attachment the state

477
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,120
Of brain and body that gets flipped on is a motivational state

478
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,040
it's

479
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,840
Exactly the same circuitry in the brain that one sees active if someone very hungry

480
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:34,000
Is put just outside the wall of some delicious food or if an animal that really wants to mate

481
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,360
I guess mate with animals you call it copulate

482
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:43,360
They really want to copulate with another animal is put just beyond the wall of that animal, but they can smell them

483
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
I mean these are highly motivated

484
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:52,560
Desiring states so grief is a motivated state to to bridge the distance in time and space and yet it's impossible

485
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,720
And so the process of grief is a gradual waning of that motivation

486
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,880
And a gradual shift of the memory of the person into some

487
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,360
Concept whether or not it's a soul whether or not it's just the past whether or not it's their energy

488
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,200
You know again, it depends on what the forebrain of that particular person believes

489
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:15,920
Shifts that concept of that person into a place where the brain is comfortable. There's no more autonomic arousal

490
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,280
There's no motivation

491
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,280
And we've all experienced this if you've had a loss

492
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,760
And I've had a loss for instance where my graduate advisor died and I adored her

493
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,080
And every once in a while her daughter will call me

494
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,160
From her cell phone and she kept the same number on that phone and the name and every once in a while a ring

495
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,560
Barber Chapman and I'll reach for the phone and then there's this moment when I'm like, oh goodness

496
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,440
So anyway, I'm going on and on just to color this with example, but

497
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,920
When there's a breakup

498
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,280
It's exceedingly hard, especially if the person is young, you know, if you look at suicides after breakups

499
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,320
Those are far more common in younger people than they are in older people

500
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,600
Why because the relationship represents the whole future

501
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,720
They have no concept that they're they know there are other people, but it sort of feels like the whole world is shutting down

502
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,800
so

503
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,160
in

504
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,320
Breakups what's happened is the person is no longer available in time and space

505
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,920
This is why when someone breaks up you literally have to let them go, right?

506
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,120
You know constant pursuing of them is the out of context is not healthy. They have a name for that. It's called a stalker

507
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,680
Don't do it

508
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
But it's almost as if you have to

509
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,000
The brain has to think that the person is gone in time and space

510
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,880
And this has become much harder with social media, right?

511
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,560
Because people can check up on people they can hear from people in the old days like when I was growing up

512
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,720
You just like took the phone off the hook or you you diverted your attention

513
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,840
Now we are constantly renewing that the person is still there

514
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,840
And so love and the loss of love and the death grief are

515
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,040
Virtually identical. It's that motivational stain. This is why it's so hard to not reach out to somebody that you really

516
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,800
miss and want back

517
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
I saw a study last week that

518
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,360
Had researchers asking participants to rate emotional and physical pain of a breakup

519
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,120
They found that women tend to be more negatively affected by breakups

520
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,480
Reporting high levels of both physical and emotional pain

521
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,240
But while breakups hit women the hardest they tended to recover more fully

522
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,680
Men on the other hand rarely fully recovered. I thought that was very interesting. I wasn't too sure what that meant

523
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,320
Yeah, it's interesting. Um, it also rings true with my my experience and my observations

524
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,880
It I think I mean this could relate to a number of things and here I'm painting with a broad brush, right?

525
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,680
But um, you know, how comfortable one is

526
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,320
Feeling their feelings is male or female is going to strongly dictate how quickly one moves through grief

527
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
This is the same thing as trauma

528
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,800
The more willing someone is to feel the full depth and intensity of the feelings that they associate with that trauma

529
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,120
The more quickly they're going to move through

530
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,800
The trauma, uh, again, I'm lifting from paul conti's words. So these aren't mine

531
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,080
But you know people use a number of strategies. They use distraction

532
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,840
They use states like they sublimate to things like anger

533
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,040
um

534
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,200
And avoidance of various kinds in order to not feel the traumatic feelings or not feel the breakup people, you know

535
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,600
Try and self-soothe the alcohol or try and self-soothe with multiple new partners or whatever it happens to be doesn't work

536
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,280
Just extends it because this map of space time and closeness needs to be fractured

537
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,440
And the only way to do that is for the brain to have to confront the reality

538
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,120
Which is that

539
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,800
Whether by death or by by breakup, they are no longer available. It's like the food on the other side of that wall

540
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
Is gone. It's just not there anymore

541
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,960
Or that the food that was accessible now there's a wall in between and you will not get through it

542
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,000
And you know, you can see this actually in animal studies that are kind of

543
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,200
Hard, they're actually very hard to watch you'll see the animal perseverate

544
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,480
Literally damage its own body trying to get through a barrier to something

545
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,440
It's highly motivated to see people do that post breakup. They usually do that by talking to everybody about the breakup

546
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,400
Um, which is its own form of perseverating on the motivation. What did I do?

547
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,960
What did I do wrong this and that and some of that analysis is healthy some of it's not now why

548
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,360
would one group

549
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,720
be

550
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,920
More of let's just say effective at dealing with breakups

551
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:08,640
It's probably the ability to really feel the full intensity of how sad it is and be able to confront that and here

552
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,560
I'm you know, I'm a male. I've only ever lived in a male body. So all I can tell you is that I think from a very early age

553
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,680
Um, there's a an ability that at least I'm sure it transcends to women too

554
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,680
Or extends to women too, but learning to pack down feelings, right?

555
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,520
And so when are we really talking about when we're talking about pack down feelings? I'm not a psychologist

556
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,440
But what we learn is top down control for brain to autonomic control

557
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,240
It's the same thing like I don't want to jump off the high dive or I don't want to do this public speaking

558
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,800
But I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of like I'm just gonna force myself. I'm gonna David Goggins it, right

559
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,920
grief is a is an autonomic state

560
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,960
Uh, we say it has valence has negative valence

561
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
But it's high levels of autonomic arousal

562
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:55,120
With a negative connotation because you can be high levels of autonomic arousal with happiness, right?

563
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,320
You can be very alert and aroused and happy very alert and arous and sad

564
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
It's very alert and arous and sad

565
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,480
and yet

566
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,320
We learn how to tamp that down. What is tamping down? It's

567
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,120
reducing our heart rate. It's

568
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,640
Going to work each day being a functional human being, you know, there's a lot of that

569
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,560
rather than

570
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,600
Allowing ourselves to you know sob uncontrollably into a pillow

571
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,200
Some people are better at this. I mean the late steve jobs was a big proponent of scream therapies

572
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,040
He used to go up into the hills behind stanford. He actually owns up still owns a property back there. He was really into

573
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,880
You know catharsis cathartic release of internal state that he felt would allow him to like return as a happier nicer person

574
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,000
He was also kind of well known for screaming at people in the office. So he obviously had a lot pent up inside

575
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
um, so I think

576
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,640
The better that we can lean into

577
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,360
The emotional states that we fear the most but in a controlled

578
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,960
Way where we're not harming ourselves or other people the better

579
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,480
The more that we try and avoid that and we try and sublimate or just you know, and I've done this

580
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,520
So I'm speaking from experience

581
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:01,920
You know

582
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,320
I would use the anger or the sadness from an experience to just work 10 10 times longer 10 times harder

583
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,000
To just get that much more focused

584
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,600
You're taking that autonomic arousal that narrow aperture and that energy and you're putting it onto something that moves your life forward

585
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,720
So in some cases that's good because you still need to function

586
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,960
And give but it can give you the

587
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:27,520
Here I'll just say it gave me the illusion that I was working through something because you get all the accoutrements and rewards of hard

588
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,240
Work

589
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,120
But what you don't do is remap that spacetime

590
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,320
closeness map and then you find I guarantee

591
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,880
You find yourself five or ten years later

592
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,520
Wondering why you're so exhausted or why certain things in life aren't going well

593
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,480
And it's because when they say you haven't dealt with the loss

594
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,520
You never actually allowed yourself to feel the feelings

595
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,680
But once you do

596
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,360
It's like a valve. It releases you hear musicians say that the most recent album was shit

597
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,240
Because I didn't have any heartbreak to work through right and it is strange how people

598
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,720
It's a difficult thing to pass because a little bit of it is kind of like alchemy right a little bit of it

599
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,520
Is kind of like turning something that's terrible into something that's useful and beautiful. It's fuel

600
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,440
but

601
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,520
You're right. It is a it's a

602
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,320
Hiding away from what it is that you actually need to do from the work that you need to do

603
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
And in a world which is a meritocracy

604
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,760
Where people want success and status and accolade and fame and you go well

605
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,960
enemies and

606
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
revenge and bitterness

607
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,960
resentment

608
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,360
Pretty good motivators. Maybe I could use some of that

609
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,720
Maybe I should go out of my way to try and put myself into positions where this motivates me and working out

610
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,000
Where that falls on the ledger is is a difficult one

611
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,160
It is and I think it depends on life stage and it depends on how one is going to work it out

612
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,560
I mean the the narrative around the shark dive

613
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,320
I mean even as I say it now

614
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,280
So that was 2017 was the second dive when I think about all that

615
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,640
I think like that was crazy

616
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,160
I was out there studying fear and I almost was the professor who died studying fear

617
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,320
It would have been a terrible end to the story. Um, what was I doing? Don't do this don't do this

618
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,120
But you know, there are times in our life where we feel compelled to take on certain challenges for whatever reason

619
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,520
There's a phrase it doesn't exist in the scientific literature, but it captures two

620
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,280
Um components of physiology that are absolutely factual earlier. We talked about limbic friction

621
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,880
As it relates to creative process and sublimation of anger and sadness and creating things from bad

622
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
Events books music, etc

623
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,200
Um the the words that come to mind are limbic resonance the human beings

624
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,440
Resonate with these extreme states, you know, there aren't many great albums written about

625
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,840
A good day walking on a sunday in the park like it's kind of boring

626
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,120
I mean, there's the the beautiful painting sunday in the park with george, but I'll be honest

627
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,400
It's beautiful, but it's also kind of boring you can look at the details of it for a while

628
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,360
People like intensity the scream is it, you know, people look at that for a long time and speaks to the psychosis of the artist, etc

629
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,800
You know, people don't generally bond through passive relaxed states

630
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,080
Unless they've also been through a lot together, right? I mean you even think about uh, the

631
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,920
We could talk about this separately if you want

632
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,720
But all of us are here because of the autonomic seesawing that is the reproductive act

633
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,640
It goes from highly around how you refer to it in your lab. You know scientists autonomic seesawing

634
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,120
It is it's very interesting that the arousal process is one of increase in autonomic arousal

635
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,840
In order to get true arousal, but then not so much that it inhibits arousal

636
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:38,800
Then mating behavior and then the the orgasm response in males and females is highly what we call sympathetic not emotionally some

637
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,560
It can be I suppose emotionally sympathetic, but from a pure physiology standpoint

638
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,240
It's a activation hyper activation of the stress system

639
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
Even though it has positive valence

640
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,360
And then there's a very quick rebound to the so-called parasympathetic

641
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:59,680
Arm of the autonomic nervous system this deep relaxation, which we don't really know why I wasn't consulted the design phase

642
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,840
but we think that that postcoital bliss and is and the

643
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,600
Kind of relaxing the desire to not run around a bunch more for most people was to exchange

644
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,400
odorant molecules to increase pair bonding

645
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,040
And even if people aren't trying to pair bond because people don't always just mate to reproduce

646
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,920
but that uh

647
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,000
Some of the molecules that are released in each of the two individuals oxytocin being the main one

648
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,880
Give people a sense of kind of postcoital bliss and and it's a very calm one

649
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,960
That creates opportunity for bonding and discussion that is all like pillow talk

650
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,040
There are other forms of pillow talk postnut clarity

651
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,240
Andrew

652
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,600
But for women it might be something different right of course a different different name

653
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,600
I only speak in the language of physiology, but for both men and women this happens

654
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,000
It creates this little orb of closeness that is both

655
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,880
physiological and but neurochemical too

656
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,960
So what we can say for sure is that whether or not it was in vivo or in a dish

657
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,280
We are all here because two parents

658
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:01,440
Right a male and a female unless you're a condor where two females can produce a baby

659
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,560
This has now been shown right but as far as we know

660
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,760
Where a male and a female reproduce because they each went through this arc of arousal

661
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:16,400
Not too high arousal extreme stress relaxation that happened separately or together because in vitro it could be

662
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:23,360
Fertilization to be separate so the test of whether or not we get to reproduce is actually the ability to to

663
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,800
Assuming that people are doing this together and not through in vitro fertilization

664
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,800
Is a test of whether or not people can coordinate their autonomic nervous systems now there are ways around that and to override it

665
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,160
But by and large

666
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,240
That's the way humans evolved and the way all other animals evolved

667
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,880
Now limbic resonance

668
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,920
Is a good way I think to describe that process

669
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
But that carries over to other things too an album about an extreme loss a song or a poem about extreme loss

670
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:58,000
Brings the reader the listener into a limbic state that's very similar or approximates what

671
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,400
The creator

672
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,880
Experienced right the person created that art or that

673
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,360
Poetry and in the same way if something is about a lot of anger, you know

674
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:13,040
If you like loud fast music or something like that it's an extreme state. It has a gravitational pull to it

675
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,560
There's again. I'm using this language limbic resonance

676
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:23,840
Rarely if ever do human beings bond through nothing they bond through shared experience and you think of what makes people feel close

677
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,840
Well, there are a couple things and this has everything to do with time perception

678
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,960
typically when there's a high degree of limbic resonance it means that

679
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,880
The molecule's dopamine was increased substantially over baseline at some point

680
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,840
Dopamine is almost always discussed in terms of pleasure, but it's the molecule of motivation drive

681
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,840
And to some extent reward it tends to narrow our visual focus and believe it or not dopamine is the molecule from which

682
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,160
Adrenaline is manufactured

683
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,600
Biochemically you get adrenaline from dopamine

684
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,280
So these two act as close cousins to put us into these states of motivation and have energy to pursue things

685
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,040
When dopamine

686
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,040
Is very present in our system

687
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,960
Or if you're in the company of someone else and there's a lot of dopamine two things happen

688
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,240
First of all, you're very motivated narrowing a focus. That's one

689
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,400
The other is that the way that you perceive time is quite a bit different

690
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,320
For instance, if you ever had an amazingly exciting day

691
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,600
Just tons of things. Maybe you meet someone new. You're having the best time

692
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:29,280
I mean just think falling in love and the most incredible date that you can imagine how it begins and how it ends

693
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,880
It just feels incredible. It all feels like it went by very very fast

694
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,600
And yet when you look back on that day, it seems like so much happened

695
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Now think about a opposite situation

696
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,200
You go to the doctor's office and you're sitting in the doctor's

697
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:49,600
Lobby and you're waiting and you're waiting and there's no phone reception. So you can't scroll instagram. You're waiting and you're waiting

698
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,320
It's incredibly boring. It's a very low dopamine state

699
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,960
It feels like it goes on forever

700
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,920
And yet when you look back nothing really happened

701
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:03,120
So dopamine changes our perception of time and in terms of developing human bonds

702
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,800
This has been well established that if two people for instance go three different places in a given day

703
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,480
They tend to feel like they know each other far better than if they stayed in one place even for a longer period of time

704
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:20,080
Did you know that pickup artists were weaponizing this about 15 years ago? No, it doesn't surprise me

705
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,280
But i'm sorry to hear it

706
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,640
It was common held wisdom in the pickup artist community that you were supposed to have a three location date

707
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,640
To manipulate precisely this to make the girl feel like you had progressed further down the

708
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,520
Maturation process of of spending time together. Surely there have to be female pickup artists, too

709
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,800
Uh, yeah, I feel like their job's probably easier

710
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,920
I can't comment

711
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,040
I don't know. I've never been one going back to dopamine

712
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:52,240
How just how triggering are our phones when it comes to dopamine? Okay, great question

713
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,960
We often hear that

714
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,400
You know the social media getting dopamine hit after dopamine hit

715
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,360
When we first get on social media after

716
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:07,520
For the first time or after a long period of time the amount of dopamine that's released we think is quite substantial

717
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:13,920
It's novel. Remember dopamine is about novelty surprise and the sense that we are on some exciting track

718
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:19,520
That's what dopamine is really about it puts us into states of readiness anticipation looking seeking, etc

719
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,560
Almost always for things outside the confines of our skin

720
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,320
Just to contrast it maybe for a bit more of a future discussion

721
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,720
Serotonin does the opposite when there's a lot of serotonin in our brain and body

722
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,520
Typically it makes us feel satisfied sated and more quiescent comfortable with what we have in our own

723
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:41,520
Immediate sphere and within us right the comfort of a good meal the food you have dopamine is about go go go

724
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,560
If you look at somebody who's high on cocaine or methamphetamine

725
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,000
It's all about pursuit because that's a very dopaminergic drug

726
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,600
You look at somebody who's taking a drug and i'm not suggesting people do this

727
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:57,120
But it really ramps up serotonin. Let's say a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor prosaxol off, etc

728
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,800
The side effects of those drugs if the dosages are too high lack of appetite lack of libido

729
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:09,200
Kind of meh about life, you know, then so they'll adjust the dose down. That's because those are serotonergic drugs

730
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,960
so

731
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,960
in in general

732
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,040
When we are in pursuit of things dopamine is is quite high

733
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,720
so

734
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,600
Now you have to remind me your question because i've set up the dopamine serotonin

735
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,160
cell phones. Ah cell phones. Yes

736
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,720
forgive me, so

737
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,960
The thing about cell phones is when you first get on there

738
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,600
And you have let's say your no wi-fi on the flight or something and you land

739
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,080
It can actually be quite stimulating you get a lot of dopamine. Oh, there's this. Oh, there's that

740
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,000
But very quickly when you're scrolling on social media

741
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,600
You're no longer getting the novelty, but you're continuing to do it

742
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,760
You almost don't know why you're doing it at that point

743
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,000
It shifts over to something that's a bit more like an obsessive compulsive behavior

744
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,520
Where that we can define an obsessive compulsive behavior where the obsession leads to a compulsion

745
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,760
So the obsession is a thought the compulsion is a behavior

746
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,720
But the acting out of the compulsion merely serves to increase the obsession

747
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:10,320
Right, this is very different than being obsessed with food or obsessed with cleanliness. There's no payoff, right?

748
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:15,440
Exactly. There's no anxiety relief by carrying out the compulsion with OCD behaviors

749
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:22,320
Like scrolling social media the dopamine quickly wanes and then you find that you're just sort and we've all been there

750
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,600
You're scrolling like why am I doing this? This isn't that interesting that is this isn't that interesting now

751
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,440
The algorithms for social media are very clever and I don't want to demonize it

752
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,760
I you know provide a lot of a lot my life has spent on you know in social media now, but

753
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:42,080
In the algorithms that they've incorporated function on the the most powerful

754
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:47,920
way to keep people doing a behavior or an animal for that matter is intermittent

755
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,640
Random reward a random intermittent reward that you don't know when you're going to hit the jackpot

756
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,760
So you're scrolling you're scrolling and then you see something typically it's very high what you know in nerd speak

757
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,200
We'd say signal to noise

758
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:04,640
So if you're reading some interesting things this came out in the news this came out and then it's all of a sudden a riot

759
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,600
or a person that is jump is based jumping off a building or

760
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,240
You know for people that are are scrolling looking at bodies or something like that

761
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,200
Live bodies that hopefully people aren't looking at dead bodies

762
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,960
But look if something's very tragic then that has this gravitational pull

763
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,840
And then you what happens is you start getting

764
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,560
The system working for that next dopamine hit that you don't know when it's going to come

765
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,840
It's just like gambling

766
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:36,240
So I look at social media as initially being very dopaminergic driving rewards surprise and excitement

767
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,040
But very quickly transitioning to something more like ocd

768
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,920
And the kinds of behaviors where it looks if you if we were to look at ourselves

769
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,120
Through the lens of an experiment like we would an animal experiment

770
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:53,840
We think that animal is sick if you saw an animal digging in the corner looking looking looking looking for a bone the dog

771
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,440
Is looking looking looking looking looking looking looking looking you'd think that's really sad. That's us

772
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:05,600
Right, that's us. I'm pointing at myself intentionally. That's us. So we have to learn to self-regulate the amount of time

773
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,200
but

774
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,760
That doesn't have to be a process of you know scruffing ourselves and saying don't do it

775
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:17,440
Don't do it think about it in terms of the positive the more time away from something the more positively reinforcing

776
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:22,000
It will be when you return and that just to sort of superimpose this onto the relationship conversation

777
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,240
you know

778
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,520
Many of us are fortunate to have partners that we love spending a lot of time with

779
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,800
It's also good to miss that person every once in a while now

780
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,160
That might be an hour for some people apart of no communication

781
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,800
It might be a week everyone varies on this on the spectrum

782
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,760
But the idea of missing someone is that positive anticipation that kind of pain, right?

783
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,680
It's a motivational state and then when you see them, it's all the richer so you can

784
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:52,560
Imagine that the dopamine circuits can be used to more successfully navigate a number of different things

785
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:58,640
And you know a lot of couples completely quash the excitement and the pleasure of being together not just physical pleasure

786
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,440
But just pleasure of being together because they just

787
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,080
Spend too much damn time too much familiarity or they're texting all the time, right?

788
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,880
or the you know and and this whole thing around texting has become a really interesting test of

789
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,720
Dopamine expectation

790
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:20,000
There's a thing called dopamine reward prediction error if you think the reward is coming and it doesn't you drop below baseline levels of dopamine

791
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,800
That's why you should never tell someone that this restaurant is going to be the best restaurant

792
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,160
You've ever been to in your life. Exactly. I made the mistake of telling my girlfriend on the way here

793
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,000
I wanted her to read this book. I'm like this is an amazing book. You should read it and I caught myself and I thought

794
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,400
Damn it. I'm actually detracting from how

795
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,520
Good she's going to experience the book

796
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:40,720
Tell her it was terrible. Oh, yeah, it's really good though. This is the problem. It's hard to do

797
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,400
so

798
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,400
I think the key is to

799
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,920
To leverage dopamine reward prediction error in the best way

800
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,400
It's the surprise that you know, if you take kids driving home from school and suddenly you pull into the ice cream shop

801
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,480
They're going to be so ecstatic

802
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,800
But if you tell them you're going to go to the ice cream shop and it's closed

803
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,880
Huge drop below baseline

804
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,080
Does that mean if you tell them that you're going to the ice cream shop and it's open?

805
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,000
That's less than not telling them you're going to the ice cream shop and it's surprised. Correct

806
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,080
It's it's they literally tear out into

807
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,600
Maximum surprise is the maximum dopamine release then successful completion of the mission

808
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,320
As it were is the next and then

809
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,160
Unsuccessful is there not an argument to be made that you would be able to

810
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,720
Drag out the amount of time that dopamine is released for because of the anticipation

811
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,600
Yeah, so well and people do this in relationship quite a lot right anticipation is the kind of ultimate fuel

812
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,880
Of the courting dance, right? I mean this is also but one has to be very careful

813
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,200
Because whether or not it's from the male side or the female side or whatever variation thereof

814
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:49,520
That there's a you only get so many reward prediction errors before people start to

815
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,320
predict or associate

816
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:57,440
Low dopamine with somebody or some experience in other words if you you know, I'll use an example

817
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,720
Not for my own life

818
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,080
But if you say, you know, we're going to Costa Rica on vacation

819
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:06,320
And then you say listen, I have to work and they might understand but that's a letdown

820
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,080
It's a dopamine reward prediction error in the direction of lower dopamine

821
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,360
They might recover from it. They might not but most people recover from it

822
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,560
If you do that two or three times what ends up happening

823
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,680
You can model this beautifully and they've seen this experimentally in animals and humans then you say, okay

824
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,200
We're really going to Costa Rica this time and you think well

825
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,240
The surprise is going to be that you actually go the amount of dopamine

826
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:34,240
That's released for positive for successful completion of the initial goal is far lower than it ever would have been

827
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,560
So you can only cry. Well, I suppose that's not the right way to put it. You can only

828
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:44,160
um, create positive anticipation so many times and then create a letdown before

829
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,960
Completion that the prom delivery of the promise has very little impact

830
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,480
And so you have to be very careful with one's words better to say nothing

831
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,840
Then to let somebody down

832
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:01,040
For sure in the context of human relationship and you know, this plays out in some um less perhaps

833
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:07,600
amusing ways where you know, you look at people who are successful in life and you always hear success build success

834
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,280
And it's absolutely true like when students come to my lab and they do a phd thesis

835
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,480
It's very important for me to get them on to a research track quickly that they're going to experience some success

836
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,480
Because if they spend

837
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,320
Four years and then it fails

838
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:27,040
That's the devastating and then they have to start over again. Same thing with kids. I mean getting some success early on

839
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:32,560
Even if it's low bar success really does build up one's positive anticipation

840
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,320
An ability to perform well in the future because dopamine gives energy

841
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,640
Remember, it's the precursor to adrenaline and the sense that the world is predictable

842
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,440
Now this can go a wrong way too

843
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,640
And I see this a lot with the idea that everyone gets a blue ribbon. This is terrible too because

844
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,240
If everyone is rewarded every child is rewarded regardless of how well they performed

845
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:58,720
If they're all rewarded to the same level you actually flatten the dopamine curve

846
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,000
And so in that sense, yes, everyone might feel

847
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:09,280
You know celebrated but you actually are lowering motivation for the given activity

848
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,200
This has a whole

849
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,680
landscape of research in back of it relate to intrinsic versus extrinsic reward

850
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,640
The strongest motivation is always going to be intrinsic motivation

851
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:24,320
If you reward kids or adults for something too many times even if they like that activity they

852
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,520
The propensity to do that activity will be reduced

853
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,360
But if you reward without effort or without success

854
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:37,600
That is devastating for a nervous system. In fact, I've gone on record and I'll say it again and again and again, which is that

855
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,560
dopamine that

856
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,880
Arrives without prior effort

857
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,800
destroys people

858
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,480
this is

859
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:53,040
This is drugs. This is uh, you know, this is things like a cocaine and amphetamine. It's high levels of dopamine with no effort

860
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,720
Okay, they had to buy it. They had to find it. They did whatever it but that's no

861
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,000
There's no physical effort or mental effort involved in getting the dopamine peak

862
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,960
This is why hard work followed by reward great working hard on a relationship and then it gets better

863
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,040
There's a breakthrough whatever it is

864
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,280
That is powerfully positive

865
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,600
Dopamine that just arrives because you say, oh, you're here. So you get reward

866
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,800
Terrible and this is why rewarding every little positive thing that a child does with

867
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,680
You know their favorite thing eventually diminishes the value of that thing and diminishes their

868
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,160
ability to get motivated on their own

869
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:30,560
So a very very powerful system one has to be very very careful how one leverages it

870
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,920
What are your thoughts on dopamine detoxing? Is that legit? Does it work? Well up until about six months ago

871
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:41,120
I would have said no, um, but my colleague Anna Lemke was on the show. Oh, fantastic

872
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:46,480
Um, I have such admiration and respect. She's great. Yeah. Yeah. I just a brief anecdote

873
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,840
I was I directed neuroanatomy course for the medical students at stanford

874
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:55,120
I should have known who Anna was and then one day she came in to give a lecture on dopamine and addiction and my first thought was

875
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,320
Oh my goodness, you know have to get her on the podcast and have to I want her

876
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:05,040
Talking to the world because it's such powerful knowledge. So if people haven't heard that episode already go listen to chris talking to Dr.

877
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,160
Anna Lemke, I'm gonna listen to it

878
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,000
I've listened to all her podcasts that I was aware of but again, we were talking about it's hard

879
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,800
Sometimes hard to find podcasts. So I'm gonna listen to that

880
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,200
Um, cannot listen to her enough times

881
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,840
you know the

882
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,440
the dopamine

883
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,280
You asked earlier about the arc of dopamine and how long it lasts that the

884
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:29,120
One of the key takeaways from that book dopamine nation that I've incorporated in my own life

885
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:34,080
Is that there are certain activities like cold water that create long lasting arcs of dopamine

886
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:38,080
Those can be very useful for putting us into long lasting motivational states

887
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:43,280
So, um, these are not big peaks and troughs. These are the pain of the cold water

888
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,400
Followed by this long long arc of dopamine

889
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,800
Wonderful. It's kind of an antidepressant positive motivator natural stimulus

890
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,920
I always say if you don't have access to a nice bath cold showers

891
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,240
Yes, we'll work if you have a shower that doesn't get cold enough. Keep in mind that the original study showing this dopamine increase

892
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:07,760
Had people get into 60 degree water, which is not that cold 60 degree fahrenheit for 45 minutes to an hour

893
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,200
So your water bill might go up

894
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,720
But you could just draw a kind of cool bath and get in that up to the neck

895
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,360
So because I realized there are sometimes some cost barriers to people. They not everyone has a nice bath

896
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,200
no

897
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,880
Dopamine detoxing. Yeah, so dopamine detoxing is something that

898
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:29,360
Apparently today my uh short term working memory is off. I I swear I can't get that in you. I can't think of any

899
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,760
I'm caffeinated. I can't think of any, um

900
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:35,040
pharmacologic reason for it, but uh, no excuses

901
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,560
um

902
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:39,920
So dopamine detox I would have thought was not something real

903
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,560
It seemed kind of silly to me actually

904
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,440
And I'll tell you why it seems silly and why it still seems silly, but why it may have some utility but then ana

905
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:53,600
Dr. Anna Lemke told me that it actually can be quite useful to take some time and space away from

906
01:02:54,240 --> 01:03:00,400
Social media certainly from any addictive drugs. That's the treatment for addiction and restore those dopamine levels to baseline

907
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:06,000
Now the way that dopamine detoxing was initially described in the bay area where seemed a lot of tech

908
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,320
Types we're talking about it

909
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:12,560
Was in terms of I heard something like oh people aren't even looking at other people's faces

910
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,280
You know, they're really kind of living this like monkish lifestyle and like no food of that

911
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:22,160
They really enjoy no anything that to me seems kind of crazy and kind of extreme

912
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:27,760
I mean, I can understand not ingesting a lot of highly palatable foods, you know eating somewhat blander foods

913
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:34,960
I can understand not um, certainly not doing any prescription drugs or taking some time off from caffeine caffeine increases dopamine receptors

914
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,120
Which makes the

915
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:41,360
The dopamine that's available more powerful at evoking the dopamine response

916
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,320
I can understand avoiding certain substances and behaviors

917
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,520
But the idea that you weren't going to look people in the eye because there's gonna be too much dopamine

918
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:53,600
I mean, I guess it depends on who you're looking in the eye and how much their look

919
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,760
positively arouses you but the fact of the matter is that that's not

920
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,440
That's not a very rational way to think about dopamine detox

921
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,840
But staying out of you know, high intensity

922
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,560
Highly rewarding activities

923
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:11,760
I think could be useful in terms of reestablishing that dopamine balance and everything we know from ana's work is that

924
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:20,480
Dopamine, you know, if you drive those dopaminergic states too long addictive drugs, etc. People can do this with sex food drugs gambling

925
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,680
social media all sorts of things

926
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,440
Um pornography

927
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,480
You know what ends up happening is the amount of dopamine that's released over time goes down and down and down and down

928
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,440
And pretty much is traversing into the territory of pain and then people again are back to this thing where you know

929
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,440
They're scrolling internet porn

930
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:43,680
8 9 10 times or hours a day and then they're wondering like why this isn't effective for them anymore whereas it was before

931
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:50,880
And there's an additional issue with pornography, which is not often discussed, which is that remember guys in particular

932
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,960
The brain is a learning prediction machine and if

933
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,080
I'm not trying to say that all pornography is bad

934
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,040
But there are good data to support the idea that

935
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:05,120
If your brain learns to be aroused by watching other people

936
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,040
Have sex

937
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:12,640
It is not necessarily going to carry over to the ability to get aroused when you're one on one with somebody else

938
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:18,000
Right the especially young kids who are consuming a lot of pornography. The brain is learning

939
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,720
sexual arousal to

940
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,920
Other people having so you're going to program yourself into being a voyeur

941
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:31,120
Yeah, or just create challenges in in sexual interactions with you know with with peer with a

942
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,800
With a real partner

943
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:39,520
Mary Harrington has the three laws of porno dynamics and the second law of porno dynamics is the law of fap entropy

944
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,080
And it says that whatever you start out wanking to will get progressively more intense over time

945
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:49,360
And I think that this is sort of speaking to that ever ever sort of escalating amount of

946
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,440
The wildness that you need to watch in order to get an ever decreasing

947
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:59,680
Stimulus that comes back. Yeah, and you know here. I'm I'm approaching this only through the lens of biology, right?

948
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,800
I'm not a you know, I'm not a psychologist, and I'm certainly not

949
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,200
Um political in it in any way at least not I have ideas about politics

950
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,640
But I just don't discuss them publicly, but the but the idea here is that you know, I'm not saying

951
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,360
Pornography as a stimulus is bad or good. What I'm saying is it

952
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,320
In its availability and its

953
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:28,960
Extreme forms. It's a very potent stimulus and very potent stimuli of any kind extremely palatable food

954
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,360
extreme pornography

955
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:36,640
Extreme experiences like bungee core jumping those set a threshold for dopamine release and

956
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,880
Anna will tell you that and I'm sure she did that the higher the dopamine peak the bigger the drop afterwards

957
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,920
And it's not that you drop to baseline you drop below baseline

958
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:52,160
So again, it's not these things aren't good or bad. They just have to be controlled in a way because

959
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,480
When people are pursuing dopamine peaks over and over and over

960
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,840
And they aren't getting them typically it's because they've been pursuing that activity

961
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,480
Far too often and you're saying perhaps take a break from that and there may be

962
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,240
An ability for yourself your system to reset, right? Yeah

963
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,200
Yeah, I mean in theory all the things that we're talking about with pornography

964
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,840
Could be superimposed onto food or could be superimposed onto real sex, right?

965
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,120
That one also has to be cautious there, right?

966
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,480
but

967
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:28,800
The cycling back and forth between dopamine and low dopamine states dopamine fasting as it were but maybe just

968
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,920
Low dopamine states. These are natural rhythms

969
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,720
That existed in the nervous system. We had to remember what the dopaminergic system is there for

970
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:40,880
I'll say it again. I wasn't consulted the design phase, but we know as a as a

971
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:47,360
Generic form of motivation and pursuit you can imagine the human or the animal that's hungry or thirsty

972
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,360
It needs energy to go pursue the thing. So the idea that you have to eat in order to get energy

973
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:56,480
That's true, but you need energy in order to get the thing to eat. So our nervous system has energy also

974
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,560
That's dopamine and epinephrine

975
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,000
Yes, we use glucose and glycogen etc when we're pursuing things

976
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:07,360
But the idea here is you're pursuing something and then either by smell or by sight

977
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,280
You think you're on the right track. So you go down that track and then ah, there it is

978
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:15,520
You know, you get some berries or you get, you know, let's get prehistoric about this or you get to kill

979
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:20,480
The prey and eat it and then it gives you energy to continue this pursuit or to reproduce

980
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,080
I mean, there's a reason why humans and other animals seek out reproduction is that every

981
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,600
Every species but certainly humans have two innate

982
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:34,960
Desires built into them whether or not they decide to actualize this or not is the desire to protect young and make more of its own species

983
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:41,120
Every successful species does that even if people don't have children in general people care about

984
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:45,920
Children that because they of what they represent very few people dislike children

985
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,240
I mean, there are a few mutants out there that dislike children

986
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,320
But you always worry about those kinds of people

987
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,400
Yeah, you were talking earlier on about the fact that dopamine can be released

988
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:00,240
When you set yourself a little goal and then achieve it and one of the ways that you encourage your grad students is to

989
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,680
Give them a little bit of reward earlier on so that it keeps them motivated

990
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,840
Is this the same mentality that works during an endurance event?

991
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,360
When you want to say i'm just going to get myself to the next lamppost

992
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,080
I've just got to get myself to that hill over there. Is that the same dynamic?

993
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,400
Yeah, um, we can call it milestoneing

994
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:21,200
You just set some milestone and the key thing here is that and this is the beauty of the dopamine system

995
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,440
Just like the stress system is generic the fear system is generic

996
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,520
It's designed for a bunch of different scenarios

997
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,120
The motivation system is also generic it can be

998
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,560
to

999
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:38,880
Achieve the next lamppost as a milestone or it can be five miles is the next milestone you get to control that

1000
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:41,440
And it so it's completely arbitrary, right?

1001
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:46,560
I mean in that one of the most brilliant things that was ever said to me by an extremely skilled psychoanalyst

1002
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:53,600
Is so simple and yet I do think it's the most fundamental thing to understanding oneself is that it's all internal

1003
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:58,960
Right if you finish a marathon in first place, no one comes along and drips dopamine in your ear

1004
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:04,400
You self generate that it's all internal. It's all about your internal representation

1005
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,440
Now that doesn't mean that there aren't good and bad events in life, but

1006
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:11,520
The fact of the matter is that if you set the next milestone as

1007
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,480
Just outside the distance of what you're comfortable with and you make it there

1008
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,000
If you allow yourself a moment to register that win

1009
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:27,280
You get energy to do to then set the next milestone and achieve it that energy is dopamine

1010
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:34,480
converted into epinephrine into adrenaline and this is why you hear these incredible heroic stories like I mean

1011
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,320
I think the movie sorry

1012
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:42,000
I hate to say but the movie was less good than the book but like loan survivor the marcus latrell story and the

1013
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:48,240
Actually, I think today or yesterday might be the anniversary of operation red wings. So all those guys sadly died except

1014
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,160
marcus

1015
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:54,880
And you know he in the movie he's it's like fast forward to where he I don't want to give it away

1016
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,200
But where he basically is the loan survivor, but

1017
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:04,000
In the book it's crazy. I mean the guy dragged himself on elbows and knees for miles and miles and miles, right?

1018
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:10,560
You know that that kind of ability where you hear about people walking on stubs to you know, these incredible feats of human

1019
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,720
Endurance and willingness to persist

1020
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,600
those

1021
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:23,600
People were able to do that not because of glycogen or they drank their goo or whatever the triathletes are always using

1022
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,120
it's because of

1023
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,640
nervous system

1024
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:34,320
Energy the ability to continue to manufacture adrenaline and keep going and the and the extent to which that can continue is

1025
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:39,920
No one will ever know I do believe that humans have a tremendous capacity to endure and persist

1026
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:46,480
But that few human beings actually know how to tap into that system except under conditions of extreme survival

1027
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,320
and you also hear from

1028
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,920
really good physicians

1029
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,320
Ones that aren't into woo biology or woo psychology at all that to some extent

1030
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,000
Yes, there are people that unfortunately die in their battle against cancer

1031
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:04,240
No matter what but that the the desire to continue living is a powerful force in of itself

1032
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,400
There may be spiritual components. There may be that's not the business. I'm in

1033
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,120
You know so and how I don't know the experiment I would do to test it

1034
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:16,880
but almost certainly setting of milestones and the ability to generate dopamine and

1035
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,840
Adrenaline is what allows people to persist and live longer. There's no question about that

1036
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:25,680
One of the best books that I've read this year is the expectation effect by david robson

1037
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,280
So he is a science writer from the uk and he looked at

1038
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,520
A whole bunch of studies the placebo effect which everybody's familiar with right?

1039
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:42,320
There is a particular expectation that an outcome is going to come from some sort of medication and lo and behold that outcome manifests

1040
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:47,520
He found this across pretty much every area of anything that you care to care about

1041
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,280
So my two favorite studies from this it was so so interesting

1042
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:58,080
He realized that gluten intolerance self-report gluten intolerance has increased from 3 to 30 percent in 10 years

1043
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:03,840
This is the why there's so many gluten-free options on the menu principally. They've got 30 of the population to serve

1044
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,800
Yeah, so people need it and he was wondering. Well, what is it?

1045
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:12,400
Human biology hasn't changed that much. Is it maybe that the foods have changed and people are responding to that?

1046
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,280
Or is it maybe some sort of expectation because

1047
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:21,200
The type of news stories that are hearing about gluten and about how bad it is for us and inflammation and all this sort of stuff

1048
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,800
Maybe it's that and people are expecting it. So they brought people into a lab

1049
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,920
They sit them down these people do and do not have

1050
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,880
self-reported gluten intolerances

1051
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,200
And they give everybody the same meal

1052
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,440
They tell everybody in the room that it's got gluten in it. It's got no gluten in it

1053
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,360
after a while

1054
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,640
people who

1055
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,320
Don't have a gluten intolerance biologically who haven't eaten gluten

1056
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:51,040
Have diarrhea. They have hives. They're breaking out in inflammation. They're having to run at the bathroom. Okay. Well, that's kind of interesting

1057
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,240
They did another another story that he spoke about

1058
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:00,880
VO2 max tests that they were looking at apparently there's a particular genetic mutation that allows people to blow off

1059
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,600
CO2 and upregulate oxygen in a better way

1060
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,960
They brought people in even numbers of people that didn't did not have this genetic trait

1061
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:14,560
Split them into two random groups. So there was a mix of both do and do not have the trait in each

1062
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:19,440
First group was told you've got the right genetic trait. You should be really really good at this second group was told

1063
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,240
Sorry, you don't have it. You shouldn't be too good

1064
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:28,080
No surprise perhaps at the group that was told that they did they ended up performing better

1065
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:32,320
But when they actually looked at what was happening in the physiology of these people

1066
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,040
They found that the people who didn't have the genetic mutation but were told that they did

1067
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:42,480
Had a lower overall lactate threshold. They had a lower overall heart rate

1068
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:45,760
They were blowing off CO2 more effectively and upregulating oxygen

1069
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,440
Better than the people who did have the genetic mutation

1070
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:55,120
But were told that they didn't so he coined this term that said your expectations are even more powerful than your genes

1071
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,280
I love that. I'm going to read the book

1072
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,360
I that's a remarkable example

1073
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:05,280
And I think that you know a lot these days is being made of epigenetic effects and things but this is almost in the different direction

1074
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,480
This is a

1075
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,480
psychophysiological

1076
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,680
response

1077
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:15,680
I find this kind of thing to be honest among the more fascinating and interesting aspects of neuroscience

1078
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,240
If not the most interesting lately

1079
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,280
Those examples are tremendous

1080
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:25,040
So I can't counter those at all with anything more spectacular

1081
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:31,200
But that the work of dr. Aliyah crumb at stanford. She runs the stanford mind body lab and she's done

1082
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,920
simple experiments, but they're really elegant

1083
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,640
Instructing people one group all about the terrible effects of stress

1084
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,640
Destroys your immune system, etc. etc other people telling them also true things

1085
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,320
But all the positive effects of stress it sharpens your ability of function

1086
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,480
You can remember things better, etc. etc. You see exactly what

1087
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,240
You are told basically now you can't lie to people

1088
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,800
You can't tell them things that aren't true

1089
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:04,320
It's just about the subset of information that you get dictates the response you get and perhaps the most traumatic

1090
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,800
Was they gave two different groups of people

1091
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,800
And then they actually each got the opposite condition to a milkshake

1092
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,920
One group is told this milkshake is very high calorie

1093
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,400
It contains a lot of fat and sugar, etc

1094
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,400
Another group is told

1095
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:22,320
The milkshake they're getting is very low calorie. It's very nutrient sparse, etc

1096
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,960
Then they measure hunger so how long it takes for them to get hungry again after ingesting it

1097
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,800
They also look at insulin

1098
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,480
And they also look at ghrelin this hormone that is secreted

1099
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:37,280
Um as you get essentially makes you hungry. It's associated with hunger. There are other things too, but

1100
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,640
You see exactly what you would expect which is that people that get the nutrient dense milkshake

1101
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,200
Are satisfied for longer their ghrelin is suppressed and their insulin is higher

1102
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:52,080
You see the opposite in the group that had the the so-called low calorie shake turns out. It's the exact same milkshake

1103
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,920
This is remarkable right because this is not simply the placebo effect

1104
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:04,080
I think it's the placebo effect plus the expectation effect plus a real physiological effect because that's what you describe as well

1105
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:09,200
And the way that ali dr. Ali chrome she she goes by

1106
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,480
The way she describes it is that any

1107
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,200
event

1108
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,200
Causes a real physiological response

1109
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:24,080
But that real physiological response is braided in with our expectation and our understanding of what the response ought to be

1110
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,280
To create the actual response. So it's sort of real plus perceived equals

1111
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Actual reality. Yes, exactly. And so, um, I love this kind of thing as you can tell

1112
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:38,080
I'm eating up the example that uh that you gave I think it's spectacular because

1113
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,680
What it means is that no, we can't lie to ourselves

1114
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,560
We can't tell ourselves that you know, drinking water is going to sustain us just as food would for

1115
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,880
For five days. We're not going to be hungry

1116
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:53,440
But to some extent if one understands that well, you can survive a long time on just water

1117
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:58,240
And you don't need to eat then you might experience less hunger. That's the way the nervous system works

1118
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:03,040
Well, you can definitely survive longer on just water if you believe that you can survive longer on just water

1119
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:08,000
There is no reason not to believe this. So I was really really averse to the whole

1120
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:13,760
Ronda burn the secret who sending out messages to the universe and david

1121
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:22,000
Uh positions himself very anti that as well in the book. Um, but you can't deny the fact that the positive thinking has a real

1122
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:28,320
physiological impact on what you do. He was talking about um, they did a study with

1123
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,800
older people

1124
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:36,240
That were past retirement and they asked them to use what what sort of words do you associate with getting older?

1125
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:40,160
And they split these people into two different groups and the sort of words that people used

1126
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:48,000
Perfectly mapped on to how long they were going to live. So the people that use the sort of words alone frail fragile injury death

1127
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,520
They were the ones that lived the shortest the people that said

1128
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,200
um

1129
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,200
happiness freedom liberty

1130
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,040
connection

1131
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:04,800
Maturity those sorts of words were the ones that lived the longest so your expectations can literally impact your longevity

1132
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:11,280
There's I I'm yet to read the book in detail, but I've talked to a guy named ethan cross. He wrote a book called chatter on the show

1133
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:18,080
Oh fantastic. Okay. I think that internal chatter world is a very interesting one that neuroscience will eventually have something to to say

1134
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,320
Uh about I think the most powerful mindset

1135
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,480
Uh, at least to me is one that again, I learned from ali crumb

1136
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,360
This is a mindset that in her

1137
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,640
Pure reviewed studies of different populations. It's clear exists

1138
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,120
Um universally and people in the SEAL teams

1139
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,680
but um less so

1140
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,880
Or is perhaps even absent from the general population sadly

1141
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,720
The idea that stress grows you

1142
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,440
That challenge grows you, but isn't the only way that you can grow

1143
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:55,600
I think is a very powerful mindset. So what do you mean by that? So they she what they did is she surveyed a bunch of different

1144
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:59,600
People with different professions and asked, you know, what's your view of stress? Do you think it grows you?

1145
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,200
It diminishes your ability, etc

1146
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,560
So this isn't giving people information

1147
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:08,720
This is asking them for information and the only group that said stress grows you the more challenge the better you get

1148
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,720
Etc the more stress you experience the more likely you are to to succeed

1149
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:18,000
Was the this group from the SEAL teams? I don't know if they were new recruits or if they had been in a long time

1150
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,080
But that was the the group

1151
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:25,680
I would add to that that yes, if you adopt the mindset that stress grows you you're going to be much better off

1152
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:31,680
But also that stress is not the only way to grow in life, right? There's this idea, you know, we have this

1153
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:36,720
And again, there's sort of a gravitational pull of this. I like stress grows. Yes, you know

1154
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:41,440
Forward center of mass or you know, always be in friction limbic friction limbic friction

1155
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,720
How about a more

1156
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,200
expansive or nuanced version of that might be

1157
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:52,480
Stress grows you so if you're under stress you're back on your heels from something you think, okay

1158
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:57,520
How can I get flat-footed or even forward center of mass you tell yourself stress grows me stress grows me stress grows me

1159
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:03,440
But that doesn't mean stress is the only thing that will grow you right learning to cycle between periods of hard work and deep

1160
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,920
What I call non-destructive

1161
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:11,760
Uh deliberate reset, right? Um, that's what really works over time. I can attest to that

1162
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:16,720
You know people who just really go out and tie one on in order to to recover

1163
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:21,840
You can only get away with that for a few years before your body and mind start to give out, right?

1164
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,360
so fine non-destructive ways to reset and

1165
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,840
Also adopt the mindset that stress grows you and adopt the mindset that

1166
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:35,920
You know, there are other ways to grow that don't involve stress and I think you're set up to have a pretty fantastic life

1167
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,680
That's my you know, simple view of of the way these things work

1168
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,880
Speaking of endurance and suffering

1169
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,480
What have you learned from lex Friedman since you've been friends with him?

1170
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:51,040
The guy works a lot. You can text him or call him at pretty much any hour except

1171
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,360
Um, the early morning hours that he happens to be in because he's likely to be asleep

1172
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:58,560
You know lex is a really interesting one. Um

1173
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,880
because

1174
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,880
You know like a lot of scientists and engineers

1175
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,320
Yet he has that ability to really drop into the trench which is

1176
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,840
Certainly not unique to scientists and engineers, but is really helpful

1177
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:16,640
I think you lex comes at things from a from at once a very engineering physics perspective

1178
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,280
Which you know, obviously computer science robots and all AI and all that he loves that stuff

1179
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:25,120
But you know, there's a phrase that he's used over and over again in our conversations

1180
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,640
And he's talked about this publicly and I've started to pay a bit more attention to

1181
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:33,760
Because he says it so many times which is you know approach life with love in your heart

1182
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:37,520
You know, which is weird, right? You think about an engineer who's thinking like this goes there

1183
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:41,600
And this is what it's going to predict the best outcome and then you think like approach things with love in your heart

1184
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,680
And I think he's right because and I think that is very powerful because

1185
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,480
There are so many pitfalls

1186
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,360
And by pitfalls what I mean are energy sinks

1187
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,120
That you know across the day from the time you wake up until you go to sleep at night

1188
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:59,520
There's so many places for you to put your energy can go into online battles. It can go into

1189
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:04,560
Uh, you know texting five different people. It can be investing in one person

1190
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:09,680
It can be there's so many things and so much of success in any domain is about

1191
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:13,280
Yes, maintaining focus. We hear about that a lot focus focus focus

1192
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:19,280
But what is focus focus is really about not allowing energy to dissipate into these kind of meaningless trails

1193
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:27,280
So I think about lex and I as I do for all people. I think, you know, what animal does he best represent or what animal best represents him

1194
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,920
I think of all people like this. I have this kind of weird

1195
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:33,600
Process where after I spend some time with somebody it just pops to mind

1196
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,680
Like I can't tell you what animal comes to mind yet. You might see that after the ice bath later on

1197
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,160
We'll see how long it's you might be you might be a polar bear. Um, super comfortable in the water

1198
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,440
Um the cold water, but I think that you know at some point

1199
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:51,520
I realized that that lexes gets very fixated on things very very fixated

1200
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,840
But he also knows how to disengage

1201
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:59,600
And he really avoids energy sinks through this and losses through this kind of love

1202
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,080
Thing that he's really into

1203
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:08,480
Because anger is very energetically demanding. It's great fuel, but it's not efficient fuel overall

1204
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,240
Right, it's it's like having a gas tank full of fuel, but there are a lot of leaks in it

1205
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:16,480
Whereas I do think that doing things out of genuine desire. There's a calm

1206
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:21,440
Sort of energized balance that comes with that and you feel like you can go forever

1207
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:24,400
So this is starting to sound a little bit. Woo. It sounds like, oh, you know

1208
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,080
The heart is more powerful than the adrenals and like they're both powerful

1209
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:31,520
The adrenals can keep you alive and enduring for a long long time

1210
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:36,640
But if you do things out of anger and friction for too long your immune system will crash. We know this

1211
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,440
but it is

1212
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:44,320
Essentially infinite how much energy you can derive out of genuine desire

1213
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,680
To engage with something or somebody what animal is he then?

1214
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:52,160
You know lex. Well, his hair makes me think he's some spiky thing

1215
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:57,440
He's sort of like he's some he sort of has the like the persistence of the porcupine

1216
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:02,400
But he has he's definitely has I think he as much as I don't want to admit it because I wish it were me

1217
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:08,880
Not him, but I think the animal that best captures lex because he's also a bit of a loner is the wolverine

1218
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:13,360
I've spent a lot of time thinking about actual wolverines. Not the Hugh Jackman version of wolverines

1219
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:19,680
But the actual wolverines they're very solo animals unless they pair up to mate. They're incredibly strong

1220
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,760
He is freakishly strong

1221
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,680
I've done jujitsu with him. I'm not good at jujitsu. He is he's a black belt jujitsu

1222
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,280
But he is freakishly strong. So if I had to pick an animal I'd say probably

1223
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,360
Um the wolverine. What's interesting about him. I went to

1224
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,160
Thanksgiving with him last year, which was my first time of enjoying that holiday here, which is a fantastic holiday

1225
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:42,080
I actually think we don't have something in the uk where people sit back and do that

1226
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:47,440
Gratitude reflection period except for Christmas, you know people do that end of your review

1227
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:50,400
But I really think and especially the time of your it's in it's perfect. So

1228
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,520
we were talking and

1229
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,840
He was talking about the fact that

1230
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,800
He was working hard

1231
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:02,960
But he feels this gap between where he is and where he could be which I sounds like less sense is a common

1232
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,520
pattern. Yeah, and

1233
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:10,560
He was saying that a lot of the friends that he speaks to will say, you know, you're doing well. You're working hard

1234
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,400
and

1235
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:16,880
He looked me in the eyes and he's like, I don't want them to say that I want them to tell me to suck it up

1236
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:21,840
I want them to tell me that I need to stop being such a pussy and keep going as I it takes an

1237
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:26,000
Unbelievably singular person to work as hard as he does. I don't think that the internet

1238
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,520
Whatever people know about how hard he works

1239
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:34,560
Is only a small sliver of just how obsessive and committed he is

1240
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,640
And for him to say that he wants to be around more people that push him in that way

1241
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,880
It made me realize that

1242
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,640
perhaps

1243
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:46,080
I could be offering more to my friends as well that

1244
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,560
offering them just sort of

1245
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,320
support

1246
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,840
in the form of

1247
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:57,600
acceptance and and presence and I'm hearing you and dude, you're doing great or whatever reassurance in that way

1248
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,320
Maybe isn't always the best way to go about things. So yeah, that was it's just something that stuck in my mind

1249
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,880
It's something it's a little model that I've kept with me where I'm thinking look

1250
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,200
Does my friend need me to tell him that he's doing good?

1251
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:11,360
Or does he need me to tell him to suck it up and get his nose down because I know that you can do it

1252
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,440
Sounds very much like lex I'm learning about your your internal workings a bit too

1253
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:19,680
There are three kinds of reward two of them are often discussed one is rarely discussed

1254
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:24,160
And but is pretty powerful and I think it's useful to think about toggling between these different rewards

1255
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,880
Whether or not for ourselves or whether or not in trying to

1256
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,520
stimulate and motivate other people

1257
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,800
One of course is reward. You did great

1258
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,240
Congratulations. That was awesome. Love that podcast

1259
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:42,160
Great that you got an a plus on your report card or b plus because last year you got a c whatever it is reward

1260
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,640
Then there's punishment, right?

1261
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,360
This is obvious you screwed up like

1262
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:53,760
You take something away or you take the anticipation of reward away, whatever it is you screwed up

1263
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:58,160
You're punished you're grounded, etc. You're not watching tv for a month or whatever it is no screens for a month

1264
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:03,040
Then there's the third kind of reward, which is the reward that you hang out in front of somebody

1265
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,480
At a distance like a carrot on a stick out in front of them

1266
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:13,440
Which is not reward for what they've accomplished, but reward that they can anticipate if they accomplish something

1267
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,440
I think this could be

1268
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:20,560
Very effective in the context that we're talking about it, which is how would I do this with lax?

1269
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:24,080
I'd say, you know, I really loved this particular interview

1270
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:31,040
If only the next time you have that person on you also asked them this, right? That's not a punishment

1271
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:35,920
You're not saying it sucked because it didn't include this. You're not saying it wasn't great. You're saying

1272
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,720
If next time you were to do that

1273
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,880
I think it would be even better

1274
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:46,480
So you're hanging a potential reward out in front and I think that can be a very powerful motivator

1275
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,160
So you can you know, we could build up a number of different examples around this

1276
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:56,000
But this is not often talked about in sort of reward punishment schedules and motivation

1277
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,560
We always think reward and punishment, but we think immediate reward immediate punishment

1278
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,120
Now in terms of building habits

1279
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:08,240
And goal setting and goal seeking we know that visualizing failure is

1280
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:16,480
For better or for worse is a far better motivator than visualizing success if you want to get people motivated to start

1281
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:21,040
All right to start now getting people to continue

1282
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,360
Involves regular rewards for reaching milestones. However, and I should have said this earlier

1283
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:32,080
I want to make sure that we do emphasize that the best schedule really is random intermittent reinforcement

1284
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:37,520
So if you're setting milestones on this run or in your intellectual pursuits or business pursuits or relationship pursuits

1285
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:43,280
If you set a milestone and you get there you do want to have a little bit of an internal celebration

1286
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:47,600
Remember it's all internal so internal celebration not extrinsic celebration

1287
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,000
And reward

1288
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,200
But every once in a while it's good to just not reward yourself

1289
01:29:53,600 --> 01:30:00,240
Now at what ratio should you do that? Well, the the computer modeling data say that the optimal ratio of success

1290
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,640
successful trials and

1291
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:07,760
Unsuccessful trials for learning and motivation is going to be about 85 of the time to reward yourself

1292
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:11,600
And about 15 of the time to not reward yourself

1293
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:15,280
So random intermittent lack of reward is another way to think about it

1294
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,240
And I talked about this with jocco a little bit and he thought oh, yeah

1295
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:23,040
Probably what we should do is have workouts where it's a big fishbowl full of ping pong balls

1296
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,680
And about 15 of them are marked with reward

1297
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,720
But the other ones is you do something and you get to go take a ping pong ball out

1298
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:31,280
And if you take that out then you get some reward

1299
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:37,120
If it's marked and if it's not then you don't and rather than every time you accomplish something

1300
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:40,960
You go reward yourself. So here we're talking we're getting kind of into the weeds of reward schedules

1301
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,960
But I think if you really want to support a friend

1302
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,960
Punishment you should use very judiciously

1303
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,320
Although if they really screw up a good friend as they say we'll put

1304
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,240
The friendship ahead of the friend or the friend ahead of the friendship. Excuse me

1305
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,200
The friend ahead like you're going to tell them what they really need to hear

1306
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,320
Even if it compromises the friendship if you really believe they need to hear that

1307
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:02,720
Other times reward like that was awesome. Congratulations. And then

1308
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,680
Occasionally if it's warranted

1309
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,400
That was great ish

1310
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:12,880
But it would be so much better if the next time you did this or that was great

1311
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,560
But you know, honestly, I think it was a mixture of good and not so good

1312
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:21,920
So I think those are three powerful ways to reward and they can be mixed up and toggled back and forth

1313
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:27,440
According to whatever schedule allows that person to continue. What is your morning routine look like at the moment?

1314
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,240
morning routine is

1315
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:31,520
wake up

1316
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,360
if I

1317
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,560
Run about what time?

1318
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:40,640
I'm waking up these days around 6 a.m. 6 30 a.m. I'm trying to go to sleep by about 10 30 p.m

1319
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,960
Sometimes it's 11. Sometimes it's 10

1320
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,320
I wake up

1321
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:51,200
And I have to be careful here because that whenever I've described my routine in a little bit of detail people always say

1322
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,200
I can't believe you don't go to the bathroom. That's like well

1323
01:31:54,240 --> 01:32:00,480
So I want to my pants exactly right foot left foot. So I want to be clear. I take care of my basic functions

1324
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,160
But when I wake up I make a beeline for sunlight

1325
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:08,160
So I'm going to get sunlight in my eyes for the you know

1326
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:11,600
I'll probably go into the grave saying this so forgive me if people have heard me say this before but

1327
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,640
The single best thing you can do for your sleep your energy your mood your wakefulness your metabolism

1328
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:23,760
Is to get natural light in your eyes early in the day. Don't wear sunglasses to do it takes about 10 minutes or so

1329
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,920
Um, if you live in a cloudy area if you're in the uk in the winter

1330
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:32,480
Yes, or the summer or the summer. Maybe you resort to some artificial light as a replacement, but

1331
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,200
As much as one can get bright

1332
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:38,320
natural and if not natural artificial light in your eyes early in the day

1333
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,880
without sunglasses

1334
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,640
contacts and

1335
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:46,560
Eyeglasses are fine. Don't try and do it through a window or windshield. It's going to take far too long

1336
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,120
This sets in motion a huge number of different

1337
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:55,120
Neuro biological and and hormonal cascades that are good for you reduces stress late at night

1338
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:59,760
Offsets cortisol a million different things really that are good for you. So I get that

1339
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:03,520
And yes, some that walk do not walk ideally that would be a walk

1340
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,560
but sometimes we'll just go into the yard and have some coffee and and

1341
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:13,040
You know, soak into whatever sunlight through through the clouds if it's a cloudy overcast day, it might be 20 30 minutes if it's a

1342
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,320
Um, it's a very bright day. It might just be a few minutes

1343
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:21,680
But really the the quality studies on humans that have looked at this say try and get as much

1344
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:26,080
Natural light as you can in the morning hours whenever it is that that is for you

1345
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:30,000
Especially the first three hours after waking if you can work outside great

1346
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,480
If you can get in your window because as opposed to just in a dark conference room, that's better

1347
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:38,080
But if you can get outside, that would be fantastic. So I get sunlight

1348
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:43,600
I hydrate I drink water and then yerba mate is my favorite form of coffee. Excuse me caffeine

1349
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:48,000
Are you waiting? How long are you waiting from 90 to 120 minutes? Are you doing any salts during that time?

1350
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:53,920
Are you taking any electrolytes in I am a fan of water with element before I had element packets

1351
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,520
I would just take a little bit of sea salt or pink salt your favorite element flavor

1352
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:02,240
I like them all. There's one I don't like. I'm not a fan of the chocolate one, but I like either

1353
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:08,000
Yeah, some people love it. My podcast producer his wife loves that. So I give it to her the chocolate mint one

1354
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,320
but um, I like the raspberry the

1355
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:17,200
Um, the citrus one. I love that stuff mango chili is if you open the mango chili and breathed in shortly afterwards

1356
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:21,440
It's like being pepper sprayed. It's absolutely insane. It's like it's like being blasted in the face

1357
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:26,160
But yeah, I mean that's that's just the best way that cold glass of water and that first thing in the morning

1358
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,400
and I mean it was you who

1359
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:34,560
Reassured me of the what I thought was bro science about your adenosine system not being active for the first 90 minutes

1360
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:38,400
And if you're going to pump caffeine onto that, you're not really actually acting on that

1361
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:42,480
Your adrenal system is the one that you need to be looking at optimal you hydration all that sort of stuff

1362
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,600
It's just such a good way to start the day. So okay, we've got

1363
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:50,240
90 minutes deep what have you been doing in that you've had your light in the eyes

1364
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,640
What have you been doing between that and the yerba matter in 90 minutes?

1365
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,280
I do everything I can to

1366
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,200
Not do email

1367
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:01,600
Not do social media and to take care of a few critical tasks these days

1368
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:05,040
I'm I have this obsession with trying to do one

1369
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,760
Cognitively hard thing a day

1370
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:08,960
one

1371
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:14,960
And one physically hard thing a day now does it not extreme physical not david goggin's level workouts or anything but

1372
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:20,320
In that 90 minutes, I'll typically try and read a research article start to finish

1373
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:26,480
Or I'll work on a document that I might be doing a grant or research paper or planning a podcast or researching a podcast

1374
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:31,040
I try and get my brain into kind of a linear mode. I try and narrow that aperture

1375
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:33,680
As if I don't the distraction

1376
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:38,400
That's created by social media and interactions with others can kind of wick out into the rest of the day

1377
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:42,720
So I'm not necessarily trying to finish something in that time, but I try and do something

1378
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,200
Challenging I experience great

1379
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:48,160
pleasure from

1380
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,400
Battling through something mentally challenging

1381
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:56,160
But that's something that I built up since my university years when I was about you know 19 or so got serious about school and

1382
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:58,080
Really started to

1383
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:02,720
Experience the the deep pleasure of like I figured that out or like that was really tough

1384
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:06,720
I don't always succeed, but that's what I'm doing in that hour to 90 minutes

1385
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,440
But I confess sometimes

1386
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:13,360
We'll take a walk during that time and maybe talk through some things that are that are challenging

1387
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:18,640
You know or sometimes I get lazy and I miss a day of that cognitive challenge

1388
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,680
Then I do caffeine about 90 to 120 minutes

1389
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,720
after waking and

1390
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,280
Even though I prefer to work out earlier

1391
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:32,480
I generally will then do some sort of physical workout. I have a very consistent routine

1392
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:36,640
I've done over 30 years where I weight train for 45 or

1393
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:40,880
Minutes to an hour every other day and occasionally I take an extra day off

1394
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:46,480
And occasionally due to travel or other commitments. I'll occasionally double up two days and then take two days off

1395
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:52,640
So it's really boring, you know talk about workout schedules, but it's really simple. It's like, you know, I'll do a

1396
01:36:54,320 --> 01:37:00,080
Kind of pushing day rest pulling day upper body push up rest upper body pull

1397
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:06,960
Rest and then legs take two days off something like that. Are you doing on the off days? Are you doing some sort of zone three?

1398
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:13,120
Always jogging or skipping rope. Those are my favorite forms of cardio sometimes swimming

1399
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:16,240
But typically I'll go running for 30 to 45 minutes

1400
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:21,840
Or if I'm feeling a little bit lazier because I always find the high intensity stuff to be easier than the long drawn out stuff

1401
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:27,600
I'll sometimes throw on a weight vest a 30 or 50 pound weight vest and I'll go out for a shorter run

1402
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,600
Or I'm a big fan of knees over toes. Ben Patrick. I know you had him on

1403
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:35,840
We were down in Costa Rica with him and his wife who had the best time and learned so much

1404
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,800
I'll occasionally

1405
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,800
Do a backwards, you know, he'll walk

1406
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:46,800
Or throw on the weight vest for that. We sometimes we'll get bands and we'll so there's a great way to combine this

1407
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:53,040
We will sometimes get two people in one of these thick bands do hill walks in the morning while getting our sunlight

1408
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,320
But that I don't really consider a workout. I consider that just kind of rehabilitate us at movement

1409
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:02,320
So on the off days I'm doing cardio and sometimes that's the morning. Sometimes that's in the evening

1410
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:06,800
I do not like to wait trained on the second half of the day because I like to be really caffeinated when I wait train

1411
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,800
I like to listen to loud fast music

1412
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:11,360
Most of the time not always I keep my phone

1413
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:15,120
Out or off of for most workouts

1414
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:21,840
Podcasts maybe if I'm running but I really try hard when I'm working out to just focus on the workout

1415
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:25,520
And those workouts the weight training workouts are always 10 minutes or so of warm-up

1416
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:30,160
And then no more than 40 to 50 minutes of really hard work

1417
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:32,240
If I do train hard any longer

1418
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,640
I don't recover enough to be able to come in a few days later

1419
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:37,920
And when I train that way I generally make pretty consistent progress

1420
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:42,480
And you're taking yourself up until what's that probably maybe 10 30 11 a.m. Something like that

1421
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,360
Yeah, and then I'll eat my first real meal now occasionally

1422
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,920
I'll wake up really hungry if I didn't eat that well the night before

1423
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:51,440
But typically the after I train I yeah, I'll eat

1424
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:58,880
I like oatmeal after I train oatmeal fruit some fish oil protein drink and then maybe 90 to 120 minutes after that

1425
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:03,040
I'll have a real lunch. My lunch is pretty much the biggest meal of the day if I have my way

1426
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:05,200
It'll be a steak a salad

1427
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:08,320
Maybe a little more starch although I sort of got it earlier

1428
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:15,280
Um, brazil nuts and that meal sometimes can extend longer and longer. I love being a feeding. I love to eat

1429
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:20,400
Yeah, so I'll eat and then I confess I usually will work a little bit more for about 30 minutes or an hour

1430
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,480
typically email and then I'll take a

1431
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:23,600
um

1432
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,200
10 to 30 minute

1433
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:28,960
Yoganidra nap or a nap and then come back refreshed

1434
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:34,240
Um, I really struggled with the naps man. I come back after that and my emotions are all over the place

1435
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,320
I'm disoriented. Maybe it's because I

1436
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:42,400
Struggled to fall asleep super quickly and therefore I'm extending that period out for a little bit longer than I need

1437
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:47,920
I probably need to try the Yoganidra thing. But for me, it's it I'm absolutely all over if I do that

1438
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:52,880
I wake up and I don't know what day it is and my emotions always feel a little bit out of whack as well

1439
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:57,920
I wake up grumpy from naps. Sometimes I'm told okay. There are a few times when I've woken up just really angry

1440
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:01,440
I have no idea what that's about. I don't know any of the neurochemistry associated with that

1441
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,520
Sometimes I wake up from naps. It's really pleasant

1442
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:06,640
I'll occasionally if the nap is early enough in the day afterwards

1443
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:09,600
I'll have a you know, a nice double espresso and get back into work

1444
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:13,680
That's the hardest part of the day actually if I was well structured in the early part of the day

1445
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:20,240
It's that two or three p.m. The key is then to try and get something really useful done cognitively again

1446
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:24,560
So some people might look at this and say wait, you're working for an hour in the morning and 30 minutes here in an hour

1447
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,560
in the afternoon when you actually working but

1448
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,760
It's really about the depth of the trench when you're working

1449
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:33,440
And so if I'm going to drop into something again for a few hours in the afternoon

1450
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,920
I'm really going to drop into it and that's typically phone off and out of the room

1451
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:42,560
And my goal is to get to the evening time so that I can do the things that I want in the evening

1452
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,640
I can enjoy like I'm always setting a goal of the next time block

1453
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:50,000
So this is something I've been doing for a long time, but even more so lately

1454
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:56,160
I don't think my goal in the next hour is to do blank. I think this is dopamine reward predictions

1455
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,320
Inaction, I think okay if I get this workout done

1456
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,800
Then I'll be able to eat at more or less the same time which I enjoy and then

1457
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:08,000
Something else will happen. So I'm very focused on what I'm doing

1458
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,920
But I'm doing it for the purposes of like opening up the next door to the next thing

1459
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:16,960
So if I can get that afternoon work block done, I'm thinking if I can just really get this podcast recorded

1460
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:21,200
Which I enjoy is that your usual time to record middle of the afternoon used to be in the morning

1461
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:26,320
But I'm getting I'm putting more and more preparation into them all the time my poor podcast producer

1462
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,960
He's like, you know, I always joke that the one thing these podcasts

1463
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:34,720
Probably will succeed in doing meaning my podcast is they're going to cure insomnia because some of them are so damn long

1464
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:41,600
But I experience so much pleasure from spending a week or two researching something and then putting some structure on it

1465
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:45,840
As you know, I mean podcasting is its own its own sort of natural drug

1466
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:49,280
It just feels good if you enjoy doing this sort of thing

1467
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:53,200
Um, so typically what we're starting late in the day now and going till pretty late

1468
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:57,840
For me the problem that I have so I'm fasted right now. We're what one minute to 4 p.m

1469
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:03,520
You haven't eaten anything today. No, no, nothing gracious. So but that's the only way if I eat I've my thoughts become slower

1470
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,840
I'm not as verbally articulate. I'm nowhere near as agile now. I could push this super super late

1471
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,840
I'm sure and it would be probably a pretty bad idea

1472
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:16,320
Maybe I could avoid maybe I could go protein and fat or just mostly protein earlier on and that would have a void

1473
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:21,120
But I just find that my thoughts and my verbal articulation just goes through the toilet

1474
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:24,400
It's adrenaline if you I mean, I think that sorry to interrupt you

1475
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:29,760
But if you ingest a bunch of glucose or you know, I think you're getting that I mean you've got to have a nice

1476
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:32,480
I'm guessing that we were to tap your vein right now

1477
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:38,160
If we could do micro dialysis on your brain that you have a nice low but steady level of adrenaline

1478
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:42,400
And listen, this adrenaline thing this dopamine thing is no joke

1479
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:47,840
This is the stuff of human evolution, right? This is the these are the same neurochemicals

1480
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:52,800
This is this is the energy drink of human evolution. This is not the rock star red bull, etc

1481
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:57,680
That stuff just hijacks this very system. I'm not saying it's bad. It's just feeding this very same system

1482
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:03,520
So if you find an eating schedule or a fasting schedule that allows you to tap into that as a resource

1483
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:08,400
I don't care what anyone says about whether or not fasting will make you live longer or not. Who knows, right?

1484
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,280
If you're in the control group, you know, what's going to happen

1485
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:12,560
So

1486
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:15,280
But everyone presumably everyone dies eventually

1487
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:18,560
So pick your pick your mode of eating be my guest

1488
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:21,760
But if you figured out a way to tap into this

1489
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:29,440
In a way that works for you by all means leverage that because until somebody comes along and says that intermittent fasting is unhealthy

1490
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,280
Well, then to me it seems at least for me eating between 11 p.m

1491
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,360
Excuse me 11 a.m

1492
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,360
Ish and 8 p.m ish

1493
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:38,880
Is great

1494
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:42,720
And what I can also tell you is that having a consistent meal schedule

1495
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:47,120
Meaning a feeding window. We absolutely know. I don't know why this isn't discussed more

1496
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:51,920
We absolutely know that that helps anchor your sleep schedule and having a

1497
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:57,920
Anchored sleep schedule helps anchor your light viewing schedule and a light viewing so it all starts to piece together

1498
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:04,400
I think that what's lost in the discussion about nutrition except for the fact that most online discussions about nutrition are carried out by

1499
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:05,920
Religious well, they're religious

1500
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:09,200
But they also seem to be carried out by people that have it's like I don't know like like

1501
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:14,320
Real feelings of powerlessness in themselves like it comes through like because they're quibbling over like

1502
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,240
Whether or not you should eat a cracker or not or whether or not, you know

1503
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:23,280
Inhaling oxygen, you know westward is going to break your fast or not

1504
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:29,680
I'm obviously I once I said David Sinclair came on my show twice and he's a fantastic human

1505
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,840
I know your friends with him and um

1506
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:36,720
He talked about the fact that his resveratrol goes into a small amount of fatty yogurt

1507
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,440
I think because it's like breakfast, right?

1508
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:42,800
So you need to mix it in and it's homemade yogurt and something else and something else

1509
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:48,240
And it's like that it's it's a shot of yogurt, right? It's enough for him to put his little capsule of resveratrol in

1510
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:53,440
And the comments were a light with people. Oh, yeah, saying that's not a real fast

1511
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:56,160
Because you've got it's so sad

1512
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:59,680
You know, it's so sad that we can't have a nuanced conversation about nutrition online

1513
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:06,400
That well, let's let's be fair calories in calories out applies, right? I don't think the laws of thermodynamics have disappeared

1514
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:07,680
Um

1515
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:12,800
And yet you have people who would argue that it doesn't and okay like we'll let them have their their arguments

1516
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:18,720
I think that the key thing is when you find an eating schedule that works for the other things that you need to do in life

1517
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,800
it's really beautiful because

1518
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:26,880
Then you really start to exert some control over these energy systems. What we're talking about is focus and de-focus

1519
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:32,640
We're talking about focus and deliberate decompression. We're not it's yoga nidra or a nap or simply a walk

1520
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:34,240
um

1521
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:39,760
And food as you point out is a wonderful source of caloric energy. We need it at some point

1522
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:44,880
But it also can create this parasympathetic response where we feel very tired

1523
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:49,040
Especially if you don't eat for long periods of time and then you eat substantial amount of starches

1524
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:51,760
You will feel like calmer and more relaxed

1525
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,440
this so

1526
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:55,440
And maybe sleepy and maybe brain foggy

1527
01:45:55,840 --> 01:46:00,160
So I I've been you know, of course assaulted by this for this online

1528
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:07,520
I do tend to eat some more starches in the evenings and fewer proteins and sure you can show me 20 double blind placebo controlled

1529
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:12,400
Or randomized controlled trials saying that if you're gonna eat starches, you should eat them in the early part of the day

1530
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,240
Well, I do that too after I train

1531
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:17,040
But ultimately what I'm interested in doing is maintaining

1532
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:22,560
The kind of bodily health and aesthetic that I'm looking for my blood lip is that I'm looking for

1533
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,560
But I want to accomplish things in life

1534
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:28,560
So I think if one gets too distracted by what's possible with nutrition

1535
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:32,080
It can be it can really take somebody off target. No one ever

1536
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:34,880
succeeded in creating anything useful

1537
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:40,480
In terms of worker relationships by overly focusing on changing their dietary intake

1538
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:44,960
But so once it works. So what once something works for you

1539
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:49,040
I say just lean into it. Just lean into it and that can change over time

1540
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:53,760
So that can really change over time. Do you know alex hall mosey? You familiar with him sounds familiar

1541
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Really hot shit on the internet at the moment this sort of gym bro who has founded this company and

1542
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:04,960
Is now moving on to bigger and better things. He's eating. I'm pretty sure he's eating the same lunch

1543
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,640
for

1544
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:10,800
10 years or something. He always has the same lunch and he's got the exact same

1545
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:15,600
Thought process around this that you do if you were going back to the morning routine thing

1546
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:18,240
if you were to design

1547
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:23,600
Or if you were to instruct someone to do the worst possible things in the morning

1548
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,080
To set their day up for failure. What would they be?

1549
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:31,280
Uh wake up and stay in bed. Uh, well, wait, there are good reasons to stay in bed in the morning

1550
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,440
But once those are completed then

1551
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,680
staying in bed

1552
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:41,520
Is curtains drawn? Yeah curtains drawn just using your passively scrolling on social media

1553
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,120
um

1554
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:44,560
like there are

1555
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:47,920
There are neurobiological data showing that when you are upright

1556
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:51,360
You actually are stimulating this area of the brain called locus ceruleus

1557
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:55,760
Whereas when you recline you actually are less alert. Literally the position of your body

1558
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:00,800
Dictates some of your levels of alertness. That's why you suggest people to not sit like this

1559
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:03,920
At their work desk, right? Yes, and if you're look and

1560
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:07,120
If you're looking down

1561
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:11,760
While working you're actually less alert than you could be if your eyes are averted slightly over

1562
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:16,480
Most people that are on their phone including me and the postural stuff is really bad, too

1563
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:22,320
I mean i'm getting i'm trying to really combat that internal rotation, you know that the c-shaped human kind of thing, you know

1564
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:27,200
It's really not good. I'm really trying in fact one. This is so common now

1565
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:29,760
the c-shaped human thing that

1566
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:36,080
It almost feels strange to be upright, you know, like people think exactly the open the the uh

1567
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:41,520
Sort of external rotation is good for us. We know this but in bed. I would say in bed

1568
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:46,720
So people are on their phone. They're in bed. They're they're not getting enough light or they just artificial light

1569
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:49,040
Where they're trying to get the sunlight through the window terrible

1570
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:55,840
They are then going and sitting and getting into like hip, you know hip flexor contraction

1571
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:59,120
They're drinking coffee too early in the day

1572
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:02,640
They aren't getting into any kind of movement

1573
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:06,480
But it's mostly about the sort of randomization of activities

1574
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:09,040
Sort of making a cup of coffee while texting

1575
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:13,120
Not getting sunlight, you know, then they're scattering that in with like a little bit of work

1576
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:16,320
But then something hits that's stressful and they're diverting their attention

1577
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:19,840
They're sort of building in this eight attention deficit like disorder

1578
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:26,960
Through they're doing they're not single task. They're not monotasking and they're not being deliberate or intentional with the things that they're doing

1579
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:31,200
They're just allowing the morning to kind of come and take them wherever the wind blows

1580
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:32,000
That's right

1581
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:37,840
And I have to say even though I describe my routine accurate my morning routine accurately if I were to really optimize it

1582
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:40,960
And I've done this from time to time. I would get up

1583
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:44,480
I would hydrate and I would immediately exercise

1584
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:47,120
I would use that early

1585
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:52,320
You know peaking of the cortisol response that comes with waking to get the body into action

1586
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:57,200
Sort of jockel willing style right 4 30. I always see his posts, but I see them at 7 a.m

1587
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,600
Yeah

1588
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:02,960
So you know jockel was up before me again today

1589
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:07,600
Yeah, he seems to always beat me by a few minutes unless I wake up in the middle of the night for a moment

1590
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,200
but

1591
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:11,840
To really get into action because that's going to generate its own

1592
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:17,600
Dopamine and adrenaline response anytime I've worked out really early like if I have a flight and then

1593
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:20,400
You know and then moved into the other components of my day

1594
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:23,840
I find that I feel better all day long

1595
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:28,720
I I also will say if I work out really early maybe between 7 and 8 a.m

1596
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:34,160
Well, then my first meal might land at 9 a.m. So you know, you need to be flexible with some of these things

1597
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:38,880
But the general principles apply I notice that you haven't put cold exposure into your morning routine

1598
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:40,480
I'm going to guess you must have a cold tub of some kind

1599
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:41,760
You have a cold tub in a sauna

1600
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:46,400
I've been less good about that lately the best time to do that for me is on my cardio days

1601
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:51,040
I do it after because you don't want to do it post hypertrophy because you're going to blunt some of the responses

1602
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,840
That are actually you're trying to get by the the workout itself

1603
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:59,440
That's right. And I have one I should say I have one rest day per week where I don't do any cardio or weight training

1604
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:02,720
I really like doing having a complete rest day, but on that complete rest day

1605
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:04,880
If I can

1606
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,000
I'll do

1607
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,240
20 minutes of sauna and then cold for three minutes 20 minutes of sauna and then cold

1608
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:11,760
I'll make the rest day

1609
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:18,080
Reparative yeah, and generally we make that social where we're talking about things and and we're very social in our working out like we

1610
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:20,640
Talk my partner and I talk while we work out

1611
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:22,720
You know when it's set when it's time to do a set

1612
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:24,480
I become a little bit of like the drill sergeant

1613
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:28,080
So like let's do your set do your set, but then occasionally I'm the guy doing a set and I'm like all right

1614
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,560
So this afternoon we're you know

1615
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:36,160
But I try and I try and really focus and I enjoy training by myself too, but generally we train together and then

1616
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:40,480
And then typically if we're doing ice bath or sauna we try and coordinate those things

1617
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:44,880
So I've seen a bunch of research about sauna. I've seen a bunch of research about cold exposure

1618
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:52,320
Contrast therapy, which is huge here in Austin going from sauna to cold and it seems like 20 and 3

1619
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,800
Three rounds is very typical

1620
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:58,240
Is there something that we're gaining or something that we're losing?

1621
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:04,400
By doing that cycle rather than doing a block of heat and a block of cold separately

1622
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:09,520
Not that i'm aware of but you know that we finally have some good science to put to this and unfortunately

1623
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:14,080
It wasn't from my lab. This is the beautiful work of susanna soberg who's over in scandinavia

1624
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:18,240
Published a paper in cell reports medicine showing that the threshold you're trying to hit each week

1625
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:24,960
Is at least you can do more but at least 11 minutes of uncomfortable but safe cold exposure

1626
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:32,720
Per week total so that could be three minutes monday three minutes wednesday so on to 11 minutes and 57 minutes per week

1627
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,760
Minimum so size. That's what they found

1628
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,960
What did they find increases brown fat thermogenesis?

1629
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:43,760
thereby metabolism thereby comfort being you know in cold etc

1630
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,440
Clearly there's a resilience effect

1631
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:51,920
Clearly there's a dopamine increasing effect and clearly you can do more you could do all that in one day

1632
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:56,080
Or you could spread it out throughout the week or you could do more it kind of depends on what you're shooting for

1633
01:52:56,240 --> 01:53:00,400
How cold people always say how cold how hot well for heat is generally

1634
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:05,200
Between 187 degrees fahrenheit and 212 degrees fahrenheit

1635
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:08,320
Somewhere in that range and for cold it's

1636
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:11,200
Cold enough that you really want to get the hell out

1637
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:14,400
But that you can stay in safely because i don't want anyone to kill themselves with doing this stuff

1638
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:16,960
Did i see you say that um

1639
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,760
evening time

1640
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,200
heat exposure

1641
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:27,120
Increases growth hormone release by 16 times or something insane, but subsequent

1642
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:35,280
Sessions of the same only increase it by a very small margin. Yeah, am i talking about my asset? No, you're absolutely right so we can

1643
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,400
We can delineate some protocols

1644
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:43,440
If you want to get better more resilient cold exposure is going to be great anytime

1645
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,880
Post cold exposure your body is going to heat up

1646
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:53,600
Think of your body heating up as waking up. So if you are concerned about not being able to sleep

1647
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:57,440
Then i would suggest you do your cold exposure earlier in the day, right?

1648
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:01,680
Heat does the opposite so i'm laying out some parameters here heat does the opposite

1649
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:03,760
You're going to heat up while you're in the deliberate heat exposure

1650
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:06,960
But afterwards there's a post heating dip in temperature

1651
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:12,160
We can talk this was all covered in an episode with dr. Craig heller on thermogenesis gets a little bit down in the weeds

1652
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:16,720
But take my word for it or if you want to get the science you can go there to find the science behind this

1653
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:19,600
So sauna at night is great

1654
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:23,760
As well now let's think about how to combine these things. So let's say you

1655
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:27,440
You know you're on it. It's a tuesday. You've done your weight training on monday

1656
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:32,720
And you want to do your heat and cold you don't have time to optimize everything perfectly you could say okay

1657
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:34,160
i'm going to do my

1658
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:40,800
Heat and cold at 10 a.m. Or 8 a.m. You get in the sauna for 20 minutes or so and then you get into the cold for three minutes

1659
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:43,920
And then you might get into the sauna again for 10 minutes

1660
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:48,400
And you get in the cold for another minute or so you end on cold

1661
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:52,400
Why because it'll wake you up and presumably you're not you want to be woken up for the day

1662
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:57,200
That also means don't then if you're doing it in a facility don't then go and have a warm shower

1663
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:01,840
Right once you've finished right coolest shower is fine because you want to clean off often

1664
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:04,160
I mean the ice bath is cleanish, but it's you know

1665
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,800
Depends where you're going in laboratories

1666
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:11,360
You're absolutely right in laboratories if we want to preserve something in particular a virus we put in the freezer

1667
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,680
If you want to kill a virus you heat it up

1668
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:17,520
This is never as dirty of a sauna as you want, but the cold tub

1669
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:22,640
Well, yeah the sauna sort of its own autoclave if it gets hot enough right and the cold

1670
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:26,960
Cold stuff needs to be cleaned out now and again you get mold growing in a in a freezer

1671
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:30,640
Which is kind of freaky to think about but you really can't it's never going to grow in a sauna

1672
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:35,040
Never going to grow if it gets hot enough now. There is what I call the sober principle

1673
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:41,600
Uh, which is if you are using deliberate cold exposure to increase metabolism end on cold

1674
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:44,320
So finish on the cold not just because it wakes you up more

1675
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:49,360
But because then you have to heat your body up naturally, which is a thermogenic metabolic response

1676
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:56,080
So end with cold and if you really want to push it you can do things like don't use a towel use evaporation

1677
01:55:56,480 --> 01:56:00,160
Uh spread out your limbs and don't huddle so that you have to shiver more etc

1678
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:04,720
I mean a lot of little games you can play, but let's say you want to reduce post exercise inflammation

1679
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:08,800
You're not concerned with hypertrophy gains of muscle size gains or strength gains

1680
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:15,280
Well, then get in the cold after your your workout do that for one to some people can do 10 minutes reduce inflammation

1681
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,040
Let's say you really want to hit growth hormone, which is what you asked

1682
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:26,320
The biggest effects of sauna on growth hormone and they are big effects are when the sauna is only done once per week

1683
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:31,040
But it's done in four cycles or sets we could say of 30 minutes each

1684
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:34,240
So that means 30 minutes in the sauna at the temperatures I described before

1685
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:39,760
Then a five minute break just air cooling off or 10 minute break then back into the sauna for 30 minutes

1686
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:43,680
This is brutal. Then again in the afternoon 30 minutes in the sauna

1687
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:45,520
then

1688
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:50,080
10 minutes just air cooling off and then back into the sauna for 30 minutes. So that's two hours

1689
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:56,960
At 187 to 212 degrees in one day in one day with a maximum of what less than sort of 20 minutes

1690
01:56:57,680 --> 01:57:01,600
Of rest in between those little sessions than the big rest in between. So you have to be very careful, right?

1691
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:07,040
Heat can kill you. You got to hydrate. You need to make sure you get enough salt like it. I mean, this is this is work, right?

1692
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:12,240
But you get you see in these human studies up to 16 fold increases in growth hormone

1693
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:15,040
So you could imagine this could exert some very strong

1694
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:20,640
Repairative effect if you're training for a big event or endurance event or maybe you're just really wiped out from the week

1695
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:25,680
This is a stressor, but it's a stressor that delivers a potent growth hormone response

1696
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:28,480
Now if you do sauna more often than that

1697
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:32,720
You're not going to want to do two hours a day in the sauna because presumably you're doing other things

1698
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,560
You have a life you have a life

1699
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:39,760
And in addition to that the growth hormone effect starts to diminish if you become too heat adapted

1700
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,480
And that raises a more interesting question, perhaps

1701
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:48,480
Which is why is it that this two hour protocol really works if you do it once a week to increase growth hormone?

1702
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:51,920
It's because it's a stressor and certain stressors increase growth hormone

1703
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,480
Does it have to be heat? No

1704
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:58,080
You could probably also do four really long rounds of ice bath

1705
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:00,640
And i'm guessing you'd probably see a similar effect

1706
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:05,760
No one's ever really looked probably see a similar effect because it's all about the stress stimulus

1707
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:11,680
Now those that work on exercise science and weight training would probably say yeah, you could also do a

1708
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:15,120
This has been shown, you know at 90 minutes 10 sets of 10

1709
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:21,520
Multiple exercises for 10 sets of 10 high volume german volume training workout and get the same growth hormone effects

1710
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:23,840
There's so many studies like this

1711
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:27,440
I personally like to do the sauna two or three days a week

1712
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:33,120
And if i'm traveling off and don't get the opportunity if i'm in austin, it's great because they're all these sauna places

1713
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:37,920
But if i'm traveling abroad, i don't have the time then i might do i might take a day

1714
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,200
I'm thinking wow i did three podcasts i'm exhausted when i'm in new york

1715
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:44,960
I like to go to a place i have no relation to them, but i think it's called spa 88

1716
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:48,320
It's a russian banya and i'll just go for the whole day

1717
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:51,600
If i've been working really really hard they serve food there

1718
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:56,800
They serve borscht and all this other kind of like pickled vegetables and um, they must think that you're russian

1719
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:59,520
You they must you must walk through the doors and they go. Hello, brother

1720
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:04,240
Sometimes i usually just don't the best way to appear russian lacks. I hope you're listening is to just not say anything

1721
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:08,160
Just just to not that's the most russian thing that you can say is nothing exactly

1722
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:12,320
That place is great and they have different saunas steam sauna

1723
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:17,200
They have cold dunk and sometimes i'll just spend three four hours there. There's one in san francisco called archimedes banya

1724
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:22,080
So sometimes that's an occasional thing now most people are trying to incorporate this into their daily life

1725
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:26,560
And just like as we said for ice bath if you don't have access to ice or ice bath or cold tub

1726
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:28,480
You do cold shower

1727
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:34,320
Or longer cool baths with heat. I realize not everyone has access to a sauna hot baths do work

1728
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:40,160
Now one thing about hot baths and hot sauna is they will nuke your sperm that is not nuke a nuke is a you know

1729
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:43,600
Slang they will reduce viable sperm counts

1730
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:46,960
So for males that are trying to reproduce, you know trying to create children

1731
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:50,640
You want to be careful about hot baths and hot sauna too often

1732
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:54,160
Some people will bring a cold pack in and put in their groin. You can't do that in a bath

1733
01:59:54,960 --> 02:00:00,880
But it's i mean sperm are maintained outside the body the testicles are maintained outside the body for a reason

1734
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:04,800
Right the scrotum has varying elasticity in order to maintain temperature of the sperm

1735
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:09,600
That's why that that's the the various effects that have been described are there on purpose

1736
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,840
um, so

1737
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:15,120
Why human evolution design this way? I don't know someone will say but

1738
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:17,840
in any case

1739
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:22,240
Unless you're trying to you know, and again the ice pack approach is interesting

1740
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:27,520
Um, some people do that actually there's a kind of interesting relationship between cold and testosterone

1741
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:35,920
And spermatogenesis. There's a little cottage industry out there. I think on amazon people will buy these gel pack underwear of

1742
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:38,560
I think they're called snowballs

1743
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:43,360
This is cooling the scrotum in order to try and increase spermatogenesis

1744
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:51,120
Now i'm not aware of any data on this but people report anarcho data and have shown their blood work and stuff

1745
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:53,680
that it

1746
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:59,200
It actually works to increase testosterone levels. I am not aware of any period studies. I am not

1747
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:02,560
I'm not I would not be sitting as comfortably as I am right now

1748
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:07,440
But but I find this sort of amusing on the one hand and then on the other hand

1749
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:11,920
I think what we're arriving at is some general principles of physiology, which are that light

1750
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:14,640
exercise

1751
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:15,680
temperature

1752
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:21,440
Both heat and cold are all very powerful stimuli for creating hormonal and

1753
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:29,200
Neuromodulator dopamine epinephrine effects and when you start to dig beneath the surface of all these protocols wim Hof breathing ice baths

1754
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:30,800
sauna

1755
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:37,280
Snowballs what you are finding is that these are all different stimuli to tap into these different neuromodulator systems, right?

1756
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:42,400
You know sunlight on our skin and on and into our eyes organizes all these hormone cycles

1757
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:47,280
There's a beautiful study out of israel just this last year pure reviewed studies showing that if men

1758
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:54,080
And women are told to go outside and get a lot of sunlight exposure on their skin for 20 minutes a day three times a week

1759
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:59,520
Testosterone and estrogen levels go up substantially feelings of desire and sexual passion go up

1760
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,960
You know, there's a real effect of the summer months

1761
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:07,200
For people and it's hormonal and that's because the skin is an endocrine organ

1762
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:08,560
um

1763
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:13,360
These effects shouldn't surprise us and some people hear these and they go

1764
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:19,120
Oh, so basically you're just telling us to like get sunlight and exercise and eat well and you know and avoid bright lights at night

1765
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:22,000
So that you can see but yeah, that's basically what we're saying

1766
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:25,840
We're saying that because there's now substantial physiology to support that

1767
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:32,000
There's nothing new in terms of the mechanisms the mechanisms haven't evolved in we believe hundreds of thousands of years

1768
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:33,440
If not more

1769
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:38,560
The ways to tap into these systems are many high intensity interval training. You're going to get increase in adrenaline

1770
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:45,200
Yoga nidra meditation a nap. You're going to get increases in serotonin. So it's not trivial though

1771
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:47,840
I want to be really clear these sorts of things

1772
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:53,120
Are not trivial. They are exceedingly powerful because they tap into systems that we all harbor

1773
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:56,560
So the beautiful thing is they work the first time and they work every time

1774
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:01,120
And there are very few things you can say that about they work the first time and they work every time

1775
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:05,360
And the reasons they work are now becoming clear to us through these more high quality studies

1776
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:09,520
There's a lot of conversations at the moment around concerns for the

1777
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:12,400
Average amount of testosterone that men have got

1778
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:16,000
Eastergens in the water and stuff like that

1779
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:18,720
Should we be worried? How worried should be?

1780
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:22,320
So, um, I just recently came back from Copenhagen

1781
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:26,720
I was there to give a talk for the lundbeck foundation and there was another talk that the lundbeck foundation put on

1782
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:28,960
They do a great popular science series

1783
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:30,000
um

1784
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,760
Called coffee and cocktails. I'm not a drinker, but people it's so european

1785
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:36,560
It's it's so different than over here. Was everybody smoking outside

1786
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:41,440
No one was smoking but people would bring were allowed to bring in real glasses with ice in them

1787
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:45,280
And yet the auditorium was silent. This was a big con is in the conser hall in Copenhagen

1788
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:48,160
It's a very beautiful venue and you couldn't hear an ice cube

1789
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:52,320
Chink the entire night and no clink clink clink no no chinking of the ice cubes

1790
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:56,720
People were in there with their cocktails and enjoying enjoying science and earlier that week

1791
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:00,560
There was a talk by dr. Sheena swan. She wrote a book called countdown

1792
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:04,560
She went on Joe Rogan's podcast. I believe earlier last year

1793
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:10,960
She talked about the decline of sperm counts from the 1930s until now and

1794
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:16,320
Ties it in a very she's a serious researcher with national institutes of health grants, etc

1795
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:24,320
Ties this to um the increasing presence of phthalates the most difficult word to pronounce in the english language besides ophthalmology

1796
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:27,040
phthalates

1797
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:32,720
That are present main present mainly in pesticides if you look at sperm counts and testosterone levels in

1798
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:35,760
males in different areas of the united states they are

1799
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:40,560
Significantly lower in areas where there's a lot of pesticide use in rural

1800
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:43,440
Areas where there's a lot of farming and pesticides

1801
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:47,600
very serious issue and in the offspring of mothers that

1802
02:04:48,160 --> 02:04:49,360
ingest

1803
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:50,880
phthalates

1804
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:57,440
There's this the anal genital distance is what they study in the lab the lot the anal genital distance literally the distance between

1805
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:03,200
The base of the scrotum and the um and the anus in males is much greater than it is in

1806
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:07,200
There's a word for that females don't have a scrotum obviously

1807
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:12,480
So they measure from the base of the genitals to the base of the vagina to the to the anus in males

1808
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:15,760
They go from the base of the scrotum depends on the study. Sometimes it's the top of the scrotum

1809
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:21,280
You know, I always say, you know, uh, you always have to be careful when people are measuring anything related to genitalia

1810
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,280
Because somebody's going to cheat in the measurement

1811
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:25,440
so

1812
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:28,000
So in any event, I don't know how they controlled for that

1813
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:34,080
But she shows these remarkable pictures in mice and in humans of people that are exposed or mice that are exposed to phthalates

1814
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:37,520
And basically males are showing the more female like pattern

1815
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:39,120
of

1816
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:44,800
Of anal genital distance when they're exposed to these phthalates in utero. Okay, this is not post birth

1817
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:48,640
This is in utero. The mother's being exposed. It crosses the blood placental barrier

1818
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:53,680
What's happening? Well, this is reducing sperm counts now. What can people do about this?

1819
02:05:53,680 --> 02:06:00,240
Well, first of all, there's this question of whether or not phthalates are having a similar effect after a child is brought into the world

1820
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:08,880
One doesn't know but we do know and this is goes back to my early graduate work was on the effects of androgens like testosterone and dhT

1821
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:10,800
on

1822
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,960
different traits of brain and body

1823
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:14,480
we know that

1824
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:22,960
For instance, it just very briefly that during pregnancy the brain is organized male by way of believe it or not testosterone converted to estrogen

1825
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:29,760
Through a process called aromatization, but the growth of the penis the fact that there even will be a penis etc

1826
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:37,520
Is set by a testosterone called dhT dihydrotestosterone testosterone converted to dhT through five alpha reductase and on and on

1827
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:42,720
That's an organizing effect on the system as they call it

1828
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:48,160
But then there's an activating effect where during puberty the testes just start producing testosterone

1829
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:53,200
Some is converted to dhT and the dhT is what creates the growth of the penis

1830
02:06:53,680 --> 02:06:55,440
Okay

1831
02:06:55,440 --> 02:07:00,240
In people that inject phthalates during puberty and in the post puberty years

1832
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:05,440
It's conceivable that those phthalates could inhibit the activating effects of androgens

1833
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:10,880
Not just what we call the organizing effects of androgens early in life. Oh, yeah. Why is this interesting and important?

1834
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:14,640
Well sperm counts are definitely going down. Are they going down so much so that

1835
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:17,200
People are incapable of reproducing

1836
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:22,080
Probably not because you know as they told us in school it just takes one and indeed it just takes one sperm

1837
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:24,800
But it is a probability. It's a numbers game, right?

1838
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:28,160
The reason, you know, I people that take anabolic steroids unless they

1839
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:32,640
Do things to offset the effect on their own testosterone and sperm production

1840
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:35,440
sperm counts are down so the probability of

1841
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:41,280
Of successful insemination is of the egg is reduced also. It's a numbers game

1842
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:46,320
So it just takes one but having many improves the probability that the one will be able to fertilize

1843
02:07:47,120 --> 02:07:49,840
So the short answer is yes. I think it is

1844
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:55,920
Very concerning now, which things should we be concerned about my understanding of the literature in here?

1845
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:57,200
I'm not an

1846
02:07:57,200 --> 02:08:03,040
I'm now venturing to territory for which I am certainly not an expert is that things like plastics that have bpa's

1847
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:08,560
May be a concern drinking water may be a concern, but the most serious

1848
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:10,240
or

1849
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:13,440
Enriched source of bpa's aren't things like printed receipts

1850
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:16,880
I was out for dinner the other night

1851
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:19,040
It was probably about a month and a half ago

1852
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:24,400
And the server came over and I reached for the receipt and as I was going for it like this one of the girls

1853
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:26,400
So I'd never met before she's a creator online

1854
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:29,520
Hit my hand away. I was like, are you really going to touch that?

1855
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:35,520
And this is the first time I've ever heard about this. This is legit. Yeah printed receipts are are a

1856
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:41,280
A rich source of bpa's and topically that could come through the skin could go transdermally

1857
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:44,160
I mean now you'd probably have to handle a lot of receipts

1858
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:47,600
I mean, I don't think you're a check out cashier. Perhaps this would be the sort of thing

1859
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:54,640
Definitely check out cashiers and listen it's going to vary. Some people are operating with a testosterone level and sperm count

1860
02:08:54,720 --> 02:09:00,320
That's already back on its heels so to speak some people have abundant testosterone and sperm

1861
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:03,360
So it's really going to depend on the individual

1862
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:07,440
I don't think people should get paranoid or delusional about any of this

1863
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:11,040
But just don't start sleeping in a bed of receipts don't start sleeping in a bed of receipts

1864
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:14,160
That's an interesting there are all sorts of jokes that could be made about that one

1865
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:17,120
That I won't make but

1866
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:23,840
There are also some other things like you know do a little bit of online research about phthalates and don't go to fringe sites

1867
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:29,840
Go to dr. Shana swans website, right? I believe she's out bound Sinai or one of the other larger medical schools in new york

1868
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:34,880
Go to her website. She's a legitimate researcher and see what's there. See what the sources of phthalates are pesticides

1869
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:37,200
Does that mean you should only eat organic fruits and vegetables?

1870
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:41,920
Maybe I don't know which pesticides people are using on which fruits and vegetables, right?

1871
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:43,920
So there's some research that needs to be done

1872
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:45,520
but

1873
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:49,680
The moment we start talking this way and people start saying oh, wow, this is really like hippie science

1874
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:54,720
This isn't hippie science. This is serious NIH funded researcher saying phthalates

1875
02:09:55,200 --> 02:10:01,680
Before birth can dramatically alter the trajectory of of the male's ability to make sperm and testosterone

1876
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:07,120
Phthalates in puberty may be able to do that, but we know that that

1877
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:15,600
Androgens in particular DHT and testosterone converted to estrogen have a powerful role in masculinizing the brain and body during those years

1878
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:20,640
Why wouldn't people be you know do a half an hour of research online?

1879
02:10:21,120 --> 02:10:25,200
Or for instance the abundant data that melatonin suppresses pregnant

1880
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:30,080
Excuse me suppresses puberty and yet people take melatonin like it was you know

1881
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:36,000
Insane super physiological levels. Yeah, am I saying melatonin is going to suppress your puberty if you took it as a kid

1882
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,280
You're messed up. No

1883
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:41,440
And yet it's very easy to replace it with some of the healthier alternatives that are out there

1884
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:47,200
So I think that one can have a thoughtfulness about this stuff and it's some and it's action oriented

1885
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:49,680
Without having to really freak out about it

1886
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:57,280
How do you think that creators like Derek from more plates more dates or greg do set us someone who's changed the way that the internet understands

1887
02:10:58,240 --> 02:11:03,600
Hormonal profiles and supplementation because since watching a lot of Derek stuff since he's become big on youtube

1888
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:07,440
I have been much more considering the balance that's inside of my body

1889
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:11,040
But I don't I don't think that that was super common before guys like him were around

1890
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:16,880
Yeah, I look Derek's not a scientist by training, but he's done an immense service to the world

1891
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:21,200
Because no one was talking about this stuff. It was talked about in bodybuilding circles

1892
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
where they talked very openly

1893
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,000
it was

1894
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:27,440
Starting to emerge in

1895
02:11:27,440 --> 02:11:32,000
testosterone replacement therapy clinics and then mostly guys were doing this stuff and lying about it

1896
02:11:32,720 --> 02:11:37,760
They're doing it, but then they don't want to talk about actually kudos to joe rogan who years ago came out and said

1897
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:41,760
Yeah, he decided to start doing trt and low dose of a testosterone

1898
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:46,320
He's already successfully reproduced in this. Oh, you know, he brought it up and and you know

1899
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:49,600
It's clear that this is becoming more common

1900
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,920
Here's some of the general principles that I think

1901
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:56,800
Forgive me Derek if I get this wrong in terms of what you believe because I never want to speak for anybody else

1902
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:58,960
but my read of the science and the actual protocols

1903
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:01,920
speak to the idea that

1904
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:04,720
Many people do not need testosterone replacement

1905
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:08,160
Young guys should really avoid doing anabolic steroids

1906
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:13,040
They can really mess up their system not just physically not just for the ability to have kids later

1907
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:20,880
But um lead to all sorts of sexual issues and sexual performance issues like there needs to be some medical incentive

1908
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:23,280
right hypogonadism for instance

1909
02:12:24,240 --> 02:12:25,360
but

1910
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:31,520
At the point where someone either has bank sperm or decides they don't want any more kids or is willing to do something like take hcg to maintain

1911
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:35,760
testicular and uh function in spermatogenesis. It's very clear that

1912
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:39,680
Going with the lowest in a doctor described, right?

1913
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:43,760
I'm not talking about illicit use that the lowest possible dosage of testosterone

1914
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:50,640
Therapy is going to be better than for instance taking 200 milligrams in a 1 mil injection

1915
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:51,920
every two weeks

1916
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:56,720
Right because you get these huge increases and then these troughs. So people are something that you've learned from Derek

1917
02:12:57,200 --> 02:13:00,480
Yes, and in talking with other people and I I'm no longer doing this

1918
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:05,920
But I I did a run of it from 45 to 46 years old and nothing before that

1919
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:11,200
Um, and I did it because I'm working on a on a book really that has a whole section on hormone therapies

1920
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:15,280
I wanted to see what it was like. I'll tell you basically testosterone gives you more energy to work more

1921
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:19,520
Um, if it's done appropriately, right? Maybe that's the the secret for legs

1922
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:24,400
Maybe maybe home always just brimming maze brimming and I'll say when I went into it

1923
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:28,400
My my levels were mid-range. They were fine. Hi to mid-range. They were kind of like sevens eights

1924
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:31,840
But I was doing some supplementation to support that I've since gone back to that

1925
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:35,680
It was funny when you say something on the internet people think that means it's forever, right?

1926
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:42,000
It is possible to start and come off, right? So so what I've done and and so here's what's what's relevant here people are now

1927
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:47,680
Spacing out, you know 30 milligrams on monday 30 milligrams on wednesday 30 milligrams on fridays

1928
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:51,360
They kind of a low reasonable dose again. Talk to your doctor. These aren't recommended dosages

1929
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:56,960
That's more typical. Another thing that's really important is that people have traditionally blocked estrogen by

1930
02:13:57,520 --> 02:13:58,640
increases

1931
02:13:58,640 --> 02:14:03,360
While doing this by taking an aromatase inhibitor nulvidex aromidex these kinds of things

1932
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:06,080
That

1933
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:09,040
almost often is a bad idea almost often because

1934
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:11,920
Having enough estrogen around allows you to maintain

1935
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:14,560
cognitive function

1936
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:20,240
And libido a lot of guys think it's just you know, and it is true if estrogen is very high and testosterone is very low

1937
02:14:20,240 --> 02:14:23,920
It could libido can suffer but if testosterone is very high and estrogen is very low

1938
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:26,400
libido can really suffer

1939
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:32,880
So a lot of people who are crushing their estrogen realize that by coming off some of those drugs they feel far better

1940
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:40,800
Far better far better. So most people I know that are doing this are taking low doses of testosterone semi frequently throughout the week

1941
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:43,920
20 to 30 milligrams every other day or so

1942
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:46,160
There's a lot of variation around this and then

1943
02:14:46,720 --> 02:14:48,720
Not doing anything to reduce

1944
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:54,640
Aromatase or if they are taking very low doses not one milligram of aromidex

1945
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:59,760
But maybe something like 0.1 milligrams of aromidex every third day or so again, not a recommendation

1946
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:04,000
Talk to your doctor the the smarter clinics are starting to think about this and actually

1947
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:09,680
I don't have any financial relationship to Derek or to Merrick health, which is his clinic

1948
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:13,520
But from what I understand they do a very good job. I did help them design

1949
02:15:14,080 --> 02:15:14,800
a

1950
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:16,240
herbal

1951
02:15:16,240 --> 02:15:22,000
Mostly herbal supplement for testosterone support for people who are not on TRT as things like tonga ali fidoge

1952
02:15:22,240 --> 02:15:25,440
But unbeknownst to most people I I've not made one penny

1953
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:31,040
On that that was just based on a conversation of the research with him and dr. Kyle Gillette and a few other people. So

1954
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:39,920
Estrogen can help maintain libido also can increase libido now. Here's something I learned that's really interesting from peter atia recently

1955
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:44,720
Women as we know make both testosterone and estrogen and of course a bunch of other

1956
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:46,880
hormones too

1957
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:50,160
if they get their blood work back and you were to adjust the

1958
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:55,200
Units that those hormones are measured in nanograms per deciliter in some cases

1959
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:59,360
Pika grams per deciliter in other cases if you normalize them all to the same

1960
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:07,120
Nanograms per deciliter you would find that a healthy woman has more testosterone than she does estrogen

1961
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:09,520
That's right

1962
02:16:10,720 --> 02:16:14,400
I asked him this three times. I'm like, you're telling me that women have more testosterone

1963
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:22,160
Circulating in them than estrogen. He said absolutely now this maybe there's a there's a caveat to that during some phase of the menstrual cycle, but

1964
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:27,280
That does not mean that their toaster testosterone levels are higher than that of men

1965
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:34,880
But this is remarkable, right? This means that these androgens testosterone and are doing interesting things in men

1966
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:40,000
End in women and estrogen as we just described are doing really interesting things certainly in women

1967
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:46,560
End in men. So this idea of more testosterone less estrogen good is always the case. That's simply false

1968
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:49,680
You have to think about whether or not it's a man whether or not it's a woman whether or not

1969
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:52,400
The goal is more less

1970
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:55,520
Typically people aren't going for less libido, but I suppose it's possible

1971
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:59,440
Some people out there with them. Some people might be highly distracted by an excessive libido

1972
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:03,040
That's a different story, but and then of course DHT

1973
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:06,000
So I think one of the things that Derek has really contributed to the world

1974
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:09,200
And I think is important for people know that a lot of the drugs

1975
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:11,760
That are used to treat hair loss

1976
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:16,880
Finasteride propitia things like that block DHT receptors to hydrotestosterone

1977
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:23,200
DHT is responsible for beard growth in the face and for balding male pattern baldness people because they want their hair

1978
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:27,040
We'll take these drugs if they take it them in pill form

1979
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:32,880
They're blocking DHT everywhere and they can experience severe defects in libido and sexual performance

1980
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:38,160
Now before that choice between your hair and your erection for a lot of people it is right

1981
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:42,640
I mean for now there are now topical things and Derek talks about all this kind of thing

1982
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:48,240
They're top really really deep. He goes really deep into all this and what's interesting is, you know, we also can take a step back

1983
02:17:48,320 --> 02:17:51,840
And say like what's the landscape of health information that created this

1984
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:56,240
Opportunity for a kid in his 20s. By the way, no one knows his last name

1985
02:17:56,800 --> 02:17:58,800
Very clever. No one knows his last name

1986
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:02,960
Um, I'll play Derek. It's kind of an avatar of a human, right? Although he's real

1987
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:09,440
What created this landscape for this guy to be able to get this information out there even though he's not a physician

1988
02:18:09,440 --> 02:18:10,320
He's not a scientist

1989
02:18:10,320 --> 02:18:16,160
And I think what it is is that he saw that there was all this information nested in these very niche communities

1990
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:18,880
That most people don't want to look like a bodybuilder, right?

1991
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:23,120
And yet what he did was he sort of normalized the discussion about hormones

1992
02:18:23,680 --> 02:18:27,040
He normalized the discussion about other things like dopamine and cortisol

1993
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:30,560
Etc. And what's interesting is that science now

1994
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:37,680
Is kind of following suit, you know 10 years ago a discussion about hormone therapies would never come up in the hallways of

1995
02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:39,920
discussions with my colleagues

1996
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:43,920
Since doing an episode of the podcast on optimizing testosterone and estrogen

1997
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:48,400
No fewer than 10 of I'm not going to name names, but these are serious scientists

1998
02:18:48,480 --> 02:18:53,360
And it's a mixture of men and women have approached me about like, hey, like what can one do in order to adjust

1999
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:55,600
testosterone or estrogen levels is

2000
02:18:56,080 --> 02:19:00,400
Um estrogen therapy for menopause a useful thing when should one start now?

2001
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:03,360
I'm not an endocrinologist so all I can do is point them in the way of information

2002
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:06,000
But this is an important area and here's why

2003
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:13,280
Hormones control neuromodulators like dopamine estrogen and so on and those neuromodulators powerfully influence our states of mind

2004
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:16,560
So if your hormones are out of whack your neuromodulators are going to be out of whack

2005
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:18,880
Typically the treatment for depression would be to go in and just

2006
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:24,000
Give a serotonin reuptake inhibitor or well butron type dopamine thing and that has its use

2007
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:26,160
But I love this

2008
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:30,960
trend now not towards hormone therapy necessarily but just toward a thinking a mindset of

2009
02:19:31,360 --> 02:19:37,680
How deep in the layers of my biology can I go to create these sort of waves of health that rise up to the level of

2010
02:19:38,640 --> 02:19:40,160
ability to focus

2011
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:44,480
And etc for so many years it's all been attacked at the surface kind of the waves

2012
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:49,440
On the surface of the ocean and yet there's this like we're now talking about the deep tectonic plates

2013
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:52,720
Movements that are affecting all that in any case

2014
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:57,360
Around about 30 years ago. You took a real hard turn in life

2015
02:19:57,440 --> 02:20:02,880
It seemed like you drastically altered the trajectory that you were moving on for quite a while and I'm very interested

2016
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:04,800
in how

2017
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:10,400
Anybody manages to make severe life changes like that. I think that many people can

2018
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:15,280
They believe that they have control over maybe their daily habits and little things here and there

2019
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:21,200
But they don't have huge global control over their life direction. Certainly not in the way

2020
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:23,920
that they want

2021
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:26,160
Reflecting on that now

2022
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:32,480
Does it almost surprise you the sort of the ability that you have to be able to change that direction? It seems so unbelievably rare

2023
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:36,080
Uh, right. So it um, I don't know

2024
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:39,520
Um, I like to think everybody harbors it inside themselves

2025
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:44,640
I I can say without going into the whole backstory because I've done it before I mean at at 19

2026
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:49,680
I basically just looked at myself and decided that I was a loser, right?

2027
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:55,280
I mean, I was able bodied which was helpful. I had a mind that could remember things which was helpful

2028
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:58,080
I was interested in a few things

2029
02:20:58,160 --> 02:21:01,680
But none of those things were setting me up for career or ongoing progress

2030
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:07,040
And I had a lot of maladaptive behaviors, right at the time I was getting involved in fighting

2031
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:12,160
I just I just didn't I wasn't completing my schoolwork. I was just really in a bad place

2032
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:15,760
And it was really fear and desperation

2033
02:21:16,400 --> 02:21:18,240
mostly fear

2034
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:20,240
That inspired the the switch

2035
02:21:22,480 --> 02:21:25,040
Along the way and I haven't talked about this publicly

2036
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:29,200
You know to any great extent but along the way I hit numerous roadblocks again and again

2037
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:34,400
Sometimes they were situational like people close to me dying and the grief that came with that sometimes it was my own

2038
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:40,080
Kind of um feeling like I was getting pulled back toward a state of mind that wasn't healthy for me

2039
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:43,200
Uh and so on but I think what I've

2040
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,440
been good at

2041
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:48,080
at least good at not great at but at least good at is

2042
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:50,560
finding

2043
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:54,000
Really good mentors that would allow me to get to the next

2044
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:56,640
node of the next milestone

2045
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:00,080
And I should say that some of those mentors were real people

2046
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:03,120
That I I didn't say can you be my mentor?

2047
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
not that that would be a bad thing but

2048
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:09,040
Really tried to model my behavior after people that I respected

2049
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:15,520
And sometimes those mentors were people that I didn't know at all. I mean, I'll just say this right now

2050
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:20,960
I I mean, I'm an embarrassment by saying that but you know, I was a junior professor meaning before I got tenure

2051
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:23,040
running a lab

2052
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:25,040
I had a bulldog puppy

2053
02:22:25,360 --> 02:22:29,600
A laboratory and a home for the first time in my life and feeling very very

2054
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:32,240
Overwhelmed and distraught and I made

2055
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:34,960
Many of the things that I heard

2056
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Tim Ferriss say

2057
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:42,160
Sort of central to my way of doing things. I didn't go four hours of work a week

2058
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:45,920
But I did start to get extreme about organizing my schedule

2059
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:49,840
So he was a big influence on you Tim huge huge and and I know Tim a little bit

2060
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:53,040
We have some common friends and I feel very fortunate that now we're in touch because

2061
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:56,640
Gone on his podcast and gotten to know one another but just huge

2062
02:22:56,720 --> 02:23:02,880
I mean like there were no organizational forces in my life for me at that time that could help me navigate through this landscape of

2063
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:06,400
You know, I'd never been a professor before I had

2064
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:10,800
Taught it now those many years ago now, but um, I knew how to do science

2065
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:16,080
I felt confident in my ability to take an empty room and a budget and create by the right equipment and do the experiments higher

2066
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:18,080
The people I had no problem with that

2067
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:19,840
but how to

2068
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:22,880
regulate my time and my energy and how to

2069
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:26,160
Communicate with people

2070
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:30,240
I mean he had these like little things that I don't like the word hacks. I hate it because hacks are

2071
02:23:30,880 --> 02:23:34,560
Implies that you're using something for a purpose that it wasn't intended for that's a hack

2072
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:37,200
But he had things like instead of asking people

2073
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:43,280
You know like what's up when they come in your office asking them, you know, what specifically, you know, what can I do for you?

2074
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:44,480
Like what do you need?

2075
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:50,240
Right really cutting to the chase because time became a valuable resource little things like that tiny things on the fit on the surface

2076
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:53,760
That translate into huge conversion in terms of time and energy

2077
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:55,200
um

2078
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:58,880
And even just setting aside some savings and things I it's not that I'm not

2079
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:00,480
Dumb about money

2080
02:24:00,480 --> 02:24:04,320
But I wasn't I've never really taken the time to think about how I was going to invest money or do anything

2081
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:09,520
So tim did a tremendous service for for me without realizing it and I've thanked him now a million times

2082
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:12,400
I'm gonna thank him a million times. I'm thanking thank you tim. I'm thanking you again

2083
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:15,760
Things like that. So it's selecting mentors then eventually

2084
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:20,560
When it came time to start podcasting. I mean lex whether or not he knows or not, you know, just thinking

2085
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:23,520
Oh, here's another guy who's a he's a scientist. He's mit

2086
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:29,120
The fact he always wore that suit and I'm gonna copy him and just always wear the same thing because I don't have to take

2087
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:32,160
Guesswork I can take the guesswork out of it. There were little things that

2088
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:36,560
were super deliberate that just saved me time and energy and I think that

2089
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:41,680
That's helped me along the way and then the other thing is I have really tried to adopt this idea that

2090
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:45,040
When it's inevitable

2091
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:48,560
And it will inevitably arrive that stress grows us

2092
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:53,360
That it really sharpens decision making it really sharpens decision making and you know

2093
02:24:53,360 --> 02:24:55,680
If you have a very stressful event and then you recover from it

2094
02:24:55,760 --> 02:25:01,120
The worst thing to do is just go and keep going you need to take some time and reflect about what led into that

2095
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:08,640
So I think I'm very good at leveraging fear into positive change if I really think about most of the major shifts in my life it was

2096
02:25:09,440 --> 02:25:15,520
I'm scared as hell to remain in this situation and I'm very good at broadcasting fear into my future

2097
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:19,520
Uh, you know, if I've ever been in a bad relationship, it was

2098
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:22,400
Clearly if I stayed in it couldn't have been so bad

2099
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:24,960
That I felt like I had to leave so I would

2100
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:28,800
Broadcast and project, you know, how horrible it would be for my future children

2101
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:35,120
And I might even build that up a little bit my system now one could say well, maybe you could have navigated it successfully

2102
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:41,520
I'm better at projecting fear into my future and that has led me to make I think better and better decisions over time

2103
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:44,800
That's it. How much of the old andrew

2104
02:25:45,440 --> 02:25:46,640
still

2105
02:25:46,640 --> 02:25:50,800
Rises to the surface today. I know that the music that you tend to listen to when you're training is

2106
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:55,920
Still pretty punky and when I work. Yeah, I mean I have two very polarized versions of music

2107
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:59,440
I do love, you know, I love bob dillon. I love joe strummer acoustic

2108
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:01,760
I like I you know, I like melodic music too

2109
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:07,440
But yeah, I'm listening to rants. It's diff little fingers. I mean, I'm I mean, I was the first ever gig I went to

2110
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:13,760
Siff little fingers. I'm just I've never actually seen them play live. I'm a huge stiff little fingers fan. Huge stiff little fingers fan

2111
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:15,280
um

2112
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:19,200
Huge against me fan huge rancid fan. I mean, you know for people that

2113
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:23,920
Um of my generation, they probably remember it people were younger probably think oh, that's all 90s stuff

2114
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:25,520
But a lot to me

2115
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:29,040
I mean, I have huge collections of like 80s and 90s music 70s music

2116
02:26:29,440 --> 02:26:34,400
Second wave punk third wave punk. I collect a ton of that stuff. I love it. I mean how much of me still exists

2117
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:36,480
I believe that

2118
02:26:36,480 --> 02:26:41,840
We are all born fundamentally with some gift and it's our job to reveal that gift to ourselves

2119
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:48,160
And you know, here I'm I want to thoroughly acknowledge someone else who's been a great mentor without ever meeting him as a robert green

2120
02:26:48,160 --> 02:26:51,760
I think is a is a one fantastic guy fantastic. I've never met you robert

2121
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:55,280
But I'd love to meet I mean, it's one of these things where I used to put you in touch

2122
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:56,640
He's been on the show twice amazing

2123
02:26:56,640 --> 02:27:00,960
I used to suggest the book mastery to to graduate students and to undergraduates like, you know

2124
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:03,280
Learn the this process of finding a mentor

2125
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:04,880
um

2126
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:10,400
And in science we have natural mentors graduate advisors and postdoc advisors and I I made sure I will say this

2127
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:15,920
I should have said this earlier when a mentor has sort of arrived in my life either virtually or in reality

2128
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,600
I make the most of that relationship. I really nurture those relationships

2129
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:23,200
I mean, I still go to visit the children of my dead graduates

2130
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:24,960
advisor

2131
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:28,560
Kids, you know, because I care so I mean these are like these people are like family to me

2132
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:32,080
How much of it still exists? Well, the energy has always been the same

2133
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:35,280
The energy is I have an absolute obsession from day one

2134
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:40,640
This maybe was what I was kind of born with to I like to learn things and share them with the world

2135
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:47,760
I was six years old giving lectures on monday after reading about medieval weapons or, you know, goldfish biology

2136
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:51,520
In class and when my parents thought I was crazy and they took me a psychiatrist

2137
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:56,240
And I'm like, no, he just really likes learning and really likes telling people about that about what he learns

2138
02:27:57,280 --> 02:27:58,560
so

2139
02:27:58,560 --> 02:28:01,680
And I had a little bit of an underlying Tourette's when I was younger I had a grunting tick

2140
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:07,040
I had a look and when I'm tired it sometimes emerges a little bit and for me learning and kind of seeking

2141
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:09,520
kind of calms that somehow

2142
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
as does training

2143
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:16,240
As is skateboarding I did boxing of course head damage isn't good. So I stopped boxing but

2144
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:22,400
That's always been in me. That's how I'm that's how my nervous system kind of tilts left in that way

2145
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,840
The energy

2146
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:28,960
I would say I'm able to turn the dial

2147
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:33,440
I'm able to tap into kind of some old hurts and angers as fuel

2148
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:39,200
But I really try and orient towards things in a very Lex Friedman ish way from a place of like show them love

2149
02:28:39,360 --> 02:28:43,360
Show them show them do things from a place of love because it's a more continual resource

2150
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:48,320
Really believe it's this dopamine epinephrine cycle positive feedback cycle. I really do

2151
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:51,120
And so that's all there

2152
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:57,840
You know, I have pretty much eaten the same way I have since college. I really I haven't really changed the way

2153
02:28:57,840 --> 02:29:00,720
I eat that much. I mean, I probably ate more junk every once in a while

2154
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:05,040
I scream and pizza and stuff and now I have less of an appetite for but I still am the same

2155
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:07,040
I still train every other day. I um

2156
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:11,920
I love music. I love movies. I love nature. I love the flora and fauna of life

2157
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:16,080
I mean, I have this kind of obsession with fish tanks freshwater fish tanks. I love

2158
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:25,040
And listen, I my ex-girlfriend is a she's a florist. I I developed a love of flowers, you know in those years

2159
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:27,760
I love, you know, I

2160
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:31,120
I'm probably the one guy who was like wandering around in college

2161
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:36,480
I would go to these like orchid festivals and some of them look like aliens and I just I just love learning

2162
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:40,240
and I love digesting novel information and

2163
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:41,360
um

2164
02:29:41,360 --> 02:29:42,640
And now

2165
02:29:42,640 --> 02:29:46,800
You know, I have to say I'm in a place where the people that I'm closest to I mean

2166
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:50,400
Thankfully really kind of support that and I can indulge it through podcasting

2167
02:29:50,480 --> 02:29:55,440
It's so lovely now that the environment of curiosity. I think that podcasts and and youtube and

2168
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:57,680
creators have

2169
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:00,800
Engended it's so cool. You know the the fact that you get to

2170
02:30:01,360 --> 02:30:05,120
Find out about something that you really care that you would have done right you would have done it

2171
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:09,040
For free without anybody else knowing about it right and then somehow

2172
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:16,960
Telling other people the thing that you found out in this version of the simulation is called a job or a pursuit or something

2173
02:30:16,960 --> 02:30:19,440
It's it's wild another thing

2174
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:23,360
That has carried over from your youth or your tattoos

2175
02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:26,080
Which I've heard you talk about

2176
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:28,080
But never seen

2177
02:30:28,320 --> 02:30:31,520
What's your relationship with your tattoos and why is no one ever seen them? Yeah

2178
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:35,200
Um, yeah, actually it was tim ferris that outed me on this one

2179
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:38,000
He was like I found a picture on the internet with you in full sleeves

2180
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:39,360
um

2181
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:44,640
Yeah, you know, I believe that you know tattoos are I mean this has come as no surprise or a

2182
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:50,800
literal expression of what we feel on the inside and you know, I and I'm not recommending this kids don't do this

2183
02:30:50,800 --> 02:30:56,160
I started getting tattooed really young. How are you about 14? I got my first tattoo. No way. We did them ourselves

2184
02:30:56,720 --> 02:30:58,720
With india your first one is yourself. Please don't no

2185
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:04,000
Please no one do this india ink and a needle and um, we used to do these is really bad

2186
02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:10,160
They're called nicknack tattoos or we kind of would do this at home. Don't do it. It's really bad to get bad infections. They're ugly. They they

2187
02:31:11,440 --> 02:31:13,440
Blur they bleed that's not good

2188
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:18,720
Um, yeah, I started getting tattooed. I when I was a kid and growing up skateboarding in the punk rock scene

2189
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:22,480
There were these guys that um in the town where I lived they called themselves the yatsi guys

2190
02:31:22,480 --> 02:31:25,760
I don't know why I don't know what that was about, but they all had full sleeves

2191
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:29,360
And they were super nice guys and they were all into skateboarding and

2192
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:34,560
You know and vehicles and I just looked up to these guys. I thought like someday. I want full sleeves

2193
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:36,240
I

2194
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:41,600
Yeah, I've got full sleeves. I'm basically like neck to neck to wrists. So chest piece as well. Yeah, but yeah

2195
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:45,920
Back's covered. Yeah, nothing on my legs. Nothing on my stomach ribs. Yeah

2196
02:31:46,480 --> 02:31:50,880
tops of my tops of my shoulders and um, I got a big picture of costello my dog back there

2197
02:31:50,880 --> 02:31:54,400
I've got a picture of his paw back there. I've got a picture of another dog used to have um

2198
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:58,080
There's still some space for a few things. There's some things very personal to me

2199
02:31:58,480 --> 02:32:03,280
Um, is that the reason that you prefer not to show them? Yeah, you know, I think that there are a couple reasons

2200
02:32:03,360 --> 02:32:05,440
I'll just be clear as to why first of all

2201
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:11,680
When I show up to podcast it's the same way I show up to lecture in the classroom auditorium

2202
02:32:12,320 --> 02:32:13,760
and I

2203
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:19,040
Swear on my life. This is my mindset and this is my mantra when I do it. I'm there to teach. It's not about me

2204
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:21,840
It's about a student. It's about the people learning

2205
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:25,200
I don't want it ever to be about me. I don't want the focus to be on me

2206
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:27,200
I mean, obviously I'm the voice and the person talking

2207
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:32,800
But I really want people to internalize the information and I do think that the tattoos because they have nothing to do with

2208
02:32:32,800 --> 02:32:35,840
The information are a distraction. They're just a distraction

2209
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:41,600
I don't know it would sort of like be wearing like a bright yellow shirt or something. It's not my style

2210
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:45,120
I prefer to kind of make myself disappear as much as I can

2211
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:47,600
Um and let the information come forward

2212
02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:52,480
That's you know, even when I gave scientific lectures, which I still do of course for my my professor job

2213
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:56,960
I generally liked the room to be pretty dark and I wanted the light to be on the data on the slides

2214
02:32:57,120 --> 02:33:00,080
I was happy to be the voice, but I want people thinking about the data

2215
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:05,360
So podcasting is a little different to come through as a voice or on youtube a voice in an image, but

2216
02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:08,160
I really prefer that it not be about me now

2217
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:13,680
There's a human element too and I think things have changed a lot when I was growing up tattoos were not accepted

2218
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:17,200
There are many work environments where if you have for instance

2219
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:18,880
Where

2220
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:24,640
People prefer that they're surgeon or their doctor not have tattoos some people might prefer their surgeon or doctor have tattoos

2221
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:26,720
When I was growing up if you had a

2222
02:33:27,360 --> 02:33:28,000
I never had one

2223
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:32,320
But if someone had a nose ring they had to cover it up with a band-aid or take it out if they worked at the coffee shop

2224
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:38,160
Remember that you probably don't you're probably young enough or the or eyebrow ring think trends have changed right things have changed

2225
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:41,920
And I'm kind of old school because I'm kind of old now 46

2226
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:49,280
And the etiquette for me has always been to you know, and this is lex does this too is I I personally

2227
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:55,520
Behind that if I can just show up as formal and consistent as possible that people will at least know that I'm taking them seriously

2228
02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:58,640
So I don't really do it for me. I pretty much do it for the audience

2229
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:06,240
And also none of the tattoos are like that interesting. It's my dog. I really like raptors. I've got a bunch of birds

2230
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:10,960
I've got I mean I have all sorts of different things like raptors like the dinosaur. No raptors like

2231
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:16,400
Red-tailed hawks and blue, you know, I like birds and I had either dinosaurs or trucks

2232
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:20,080
You know, you really need to love four raptors. No, no no four raptor

2233
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:23,680
I drive I drive a Toyota four-runner and I love it. I've got one truck and I love that thing

2234
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:25,600
Although gas for right now

2235
02:34:25,600 --> 02:34:29,280
I mean it's you kind of got a wonder about having a gas-driven vehicle like a four-runner

2236
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:33,360
In any case, yeah, the tattoo thing I would say for for younger people coming up

2237
02:34:33,360 --> 02:34:36,320
Just be aware that you can't control other people's perceptions either

2238
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:40,160
And so, you know, I always made it a point that I didn't want things on my knuckles

2239
02:34:40,160 --> 02:34:42,960
I didn't want them on my hands. I didn't want them on my neck. I didn't want them on my face

2240
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:49,760
Do I judge people when they have them? No, but do I want them for me? No, I also think that this is very neuroscience-y

2241
02:34:50,400 --> 02:34:53,200
As a neuroscientist that we have dedicated brain areas called fusiform

2242
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:57,680
Gyrus it's a face area that's dedicated to the processing of faces

2243
02:34:58,080 --> 02:35:03,520
Even if I just put two dots and a line in between them on a piece of paper you see that as a face

2244
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:11,200
When one puts a tattoo on their throat or on their face, it actually changes the way that the face is perceived, right?

2245
02:35:11,360 --> 02:35:16,720
I mean it almost looks like another mouth there, right? It's a very different look. It's it can be a little bit jarring

2246
02:35:16,960 --> 02:35:22,320
I'm not saying one shouldn't have it, but it can be a little bit jarring. It's it changes the look of the person forever

2247
02:35:22,640 --> 02:35:24,880
It's not just that it's above the neckline

2248
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:29,680
It's that it kind of competes with the processing of their face in its normal way

2249
02:35:30,080 --> 02:35:34,000
And so for me whenever I see somebody with a throat tattoo or a face tattoo

2250
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:39,120
Sort of like it's hard to kind of orient around that and I think there's some biology to

2251
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:42,800
To that relates to that but like when it comes down to it

2252
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:46,640
I mean people need to be individuals and live their life the way they want to live their life

2253
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:50,720
I've also never been that much of an iconoclast. I've not

2254
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:57,120
You know, I grew up in the punk rock thing. Um, you know, I hate in-group out-group stuff

2255
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:01,200
I always had friends from a lot of different, you know friends are jocks and hippies and punk rockers and

2256
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:05,920
You know straight and gay and like I don't care as long as people are living their best life

2257
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:11,680
And they're not harming anybody like I'm like great. Go for it. I I'm very laid back in that way

2258
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:14,160
Of course if people are harming other people

2259
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:18,000
Then I believe that like a little bit less liberty and independent freedom

2260
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:22,320
I mean liberty is you know, one of the highest things though, you know for me so

2261
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:23,760
I

2262
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:29,920
But I don't tend to I don't consider myself a very judgmental person but you can't always control the perceptions of others

2263
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:34,800
So I would just think people should be thoughtful about what they want to accomplish in life in terms of a life mission

2264
02:36:34,880 --> 02:36:38,240
And just ask whether or not some of the permanent cosmetic changes

2265
02:36:38,240 --> 02:36:43,040
They might make might might align with compete with or be neutral for those life missions

2266
02:36:43,360 --> 02:36:48,480
My life mission is very simple. I want to teach people the beauty and the utility of biology. I'm going to do that today

2267
02:36:48,560 --> 02:36:53,600
I'm going to do that until I take my last breath in one form or another because that's what excites me

2268
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:57,280
And that's like what keeps the dopamine cranking dude. Let's bring this one home

2269
02:36:57,360 --> 02:37:03,120
Look, I really really appreciate you the work that you've done the fact that I feel like I have a lot more agency over my life because

2270
02:37:04,480 --> 02:37:08,480
I understand that my internal processes are something that I can influence

2271
02:37:08,560 --> 02:37:13,520
You know the first time that I heard you say that you cannot control the mind with the mind a lot of different things clicked for me

2272
02:37:13,520 --> 02:37:17,440
So I'm very glad that Lex bullied you or convinced you to start doing your show

2273
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:22,480
And uh, yeah, I'm looking forward to hearing a lot more of what you've got to do in the future

2274
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:25,600
Well, thanks so much and thanks for bringing me on today. Obviously

2275
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:28,240
We've been in touch and I

2276
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:33,520
Align with you and I feel resonance along the life as a podcaster, right?

2277
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:35,520
But also we've had a chance to interact a few times

2278
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:40,400
I'm looking forward to more because I think what you're doing bringing knowledge to the world is is so important

2279
02:37:40,400 --> 02:37:43,200
And I so appreciate your your questions and learning from you

2280
02:37:43,280 --> 02:37:46,240
I'm also going to get these resources about the expectation effect and the rest

2281
02:37:46,240 --> 02:37:49,280
I've been taking notes here because I I'm obsessed with learning

2282
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:53,840
So why should people go people want to make sure that they they listen to more watch more follow more of your stuff

2283
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:57,360
Where should they go? Thanks for asking. Yeah, it's very straightforward. It's huberman lab

2284
02:37:57,920 --> 02:38:01,360
Is the podcast and it's all the standard places youtube apple spotify, etc

2285
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:03,280
Huberman lab on twitter

2286
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:06,560
Huberman lab on instagram and the twitter and instagram mainly are short content

2287
02:38:06,640 --> 02:38:12,240
I used to do a lot more hand drawings and I think you're doing instagram pretty much as well as any science communicator that i've seen

2288
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:16,400
I don't think there's anyone else that's optimized it better than that. Thanks right now. Thanks

2289
02:38:16,400 --> 02:38:21,200
Yeah, I try and answer comments and respond to things and any of those three places and we have a website

2290
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:22,960
Which is huberman lab dot com

2291
02:38:22,960 --> 02:38:26,480
There where all the podcast episodes are linked salt things in all formats

2292
02:38:26,480 --> 02:38:31,440
We have a newsletter and you know people can peruse that if they want it's all I should say zero cost to access

2293
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:36,000
So that's been a major goal that we've stuck to which is to just we don't put anything behind a paywall

2294
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:41,280
The information that's there is the information that anyone can access dude. I appreciate you. Let's go and get hot and cold
