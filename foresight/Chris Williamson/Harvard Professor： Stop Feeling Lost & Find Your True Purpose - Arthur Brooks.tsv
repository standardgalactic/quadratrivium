0	7040	What's do most people get wrong when they think about happiness they think that they can be happy and
8040	10040	Happiness is not a destination. It's a direction
10560	12840	One of the most important things that we've lost
13120	18960	Sido particularly in the current generation of young adults is thinking that if you're unhappy for any particular reason
19120	23120	Something's wrong. Something's abnormal and that's completely incorrect
23200	28680	We have negative emotions for a reason that they make us feel unhappy the negative emotions are signal
28680	32080	That something's aversive outside of us and that's not gonna change
32080	35360	We need sadness and anger and fear and disgust furthermore
35360	38760	We actually need negative experiences so that we can learn and grow
39560	44320	Happiness is a direction and therefore we shouldn't be trying to attain happiness
44320	51000	We should be trying to attain happy urness, which is obviously a neologism, but that gets the point across that's that's mistake number one
52040	58360	What is an analogy that people can use to understand how happiness isn't a destination?
58360	65760	We we think of happiness as a thing we think of happiness as a feeling a state an affect that we arrive at
68120	70920	What's a what's another way that you can explain this
72760	74920	Disquieting of what happiness is
74920	80800	Happiness as we talk about it is really a state compared to something else and it's a long kind of a number line
80800	86480	We we're getting happier means happier than what is what it comes down to and it's just it's a it's kind of a
86760	92040	It's a status in which we have these macro nutrients more or less in equilibrium
92040	95240	You'll never be perfectly healthy, but you can be healthier
95320	99720	You you're never going to eat a perfectly nutritious diet, but it can be more
100720	107200	Nutritious than yesterday. What's more nutritious than yesterday? Well, you have a good for example macro nutrient balance to your diet
107200	113600	I'm a healthy nutrition nerd as are you and and we know that you you got to get your macros right
113680	120000	You have to have you be paying attention to your protein carbohydrates and fat and have them more or less in balance and proportion and relative abundance
120000	126400	The same thing is true for your happiness. So I start happiness discussions by saying there's three macro nutrients for happiness
126400	130320	Just like there's three macro nutrients for food that you have to get right
130320	132320	They are enjoyment
132320	138440	Satisfaction and meaning those are the three things to pursue and everybody can get better at those three things
138480	143320	That's an analogy that people can actually particularly people that would be wanting to improve themselves
143320	148040	That's why they're listening to modern wisdom that they would actually help them understand the whole process
148680	153240	What is the truth behind people who try to be happy and make themselves less happy?
154760	158520	What they're trying to do is to feel good all the time, you know back in the 60s
159320	164200	Uh, you don't remember this. I barely remember this the hippies used to say if it feels good do it
164760	167720	I remember my dad hearing that and saying that's the end of america
168360	169880	He was kind of right
169880	175080	The problem is that that people still think that feeling good is
175640	182280	Is is the happiness state and they're trying to feel good all the time as opposed to having a a tangible set of goals
182440	185720	Like I am going to enjoy my life in a better way
186040	188280	That's more stable and it's not just looking for pleasure
188520	195000	I am going to try to achieve things in my life with goals and direction that gives me adequate access to satisfaction
195320	198440	And I am going to do what it takes to find the meaning of my life
198520	204920	Even if it hurts those are strategies that actually lead us to live a much better life with actually a lot more happiness
205800	211640	Right. So what is the relationship between feelings and happiness then because presumably this uh
212360	214920	conglomeration of different contributing macronutrients
215560	222680	Arrives us at a state of some kind. There is an outcome of some kind if that isn't happiness
223160	224600	What is it?
224600	230200	So feelings are evidence of happiness like the smell of your dinner is evidence of dinner
230760	236920	What happens is if you're you're you're achieving these states adequate states of enjoyment satisfaction and meaning
237160	244200	You will get a better mood balance such that you're enjoying more joy and interest and you know a positive surprise
244360	249960	And you're you're suffering less from avoidable levels of disgust and sadness and anger and fear
250280	255160	And that mood balance will be evidence that you're actually on the right track with the macronutrients that you're getting
255160	261320	In the same way by the way, chris that you'll have a lot more energy if your macronutrients in your diet are are actually on point
262280	264280	right, so in this way
265240	269960	Is it advisable for people to sort of turn the bar stool upside down and think
270600	273800	Rather i'm not happy. That is a problem to
274520	277480	My current state is not one i would describe as happiness
277720	281960	That's an indicator that one of the three macronutrients is missing from my life diet
282440	287960	That's right and and every single person i've ever met in my whole life and i perhaps besides the dalai lama
288600	294440	Has has issues in their macronutrient profile that can lead to progress. This is really good news by the way
294440	300280	You know one of the most deleterious things that we say to young adults today and our kids is you're perfect just the way you are
300520	302520	What could be more depressing than that?
302600	304600	It's like i feel i feel
304600	308200	Garbage and you're telling me i'm perfect just the way i am that means i can't make progress
308600	313320	The truth is everybody can make progress because i've never met a single human being
313720	318200	That is perfect in enjoyment and satisfaction and meaning and i have a whole set of protocols
318600	322280	That will help people understand where they can make progress and where they need to make progress
323240	325000	What is the
325000	327000	current state of modern
327000	330280	Happiness what does the research tell us because we're hearing stories
331720	335640	Feelings of listlessness and hopelessness and disconnection and all the rest of it
336200	338920	What is the weather report for 2024 happiness?
339640	340600	so
340600	344760	Well like the owl was saying that in the in the advertisements your results may vary
345800	350040	Because you can be doing a lot right when society isn't unfortunately society
350600	354520	As we understand it particularly in the oecd countries in the western industrialized countries
354840	359240	Happiness is going in the wrong direction and we actually understand why but here the basic data
359800	365080	Most of the western countries the industrialized nations have been ticking about a half point down
365240	369000	Every year in the percentage of the population that says i am very happy about my life
369480	371400	so typically you know going back to about
372120	375560	1980s 1990 in the united states for example
376280	380360	About 35 percent of the population said i'm very happy about my life
380840	386280	About 15 percent said i'm not happy about my life and the other half was i'm somewhat happy
386520	391160	That's kind of the general proportions and there's better ways to measure it with greater granularity but that gives me an idea
391160	395560	What's happening you've been finding that that's ticking down so such that for the first time now
396280	401240	Not happy is higher than very happy and that's consistently happening now over the past few years
401560	405400	So that's been just this gradual decline now. Some people are getting a lot happier
405400	409240	But society in general is seeing this and this is largely being
409800	416840	Pulled down by certain demographics. You find young adults are less way way less happy than they used to be especially young women
417480	421160	Especially young women with very progressive political views. They're
422040	426520	I mean really really declining and there's one little subgroup, which is men my age
427640	431960	That and and this has to obviously this has to do with macroeconomic factors, etc, etc
432200	433160	so
433160	437960	This is these are interesting questions from a kind of a policy perspective a sociological perspective
438200	440760	But more importantly from a psychological and personal
441480	443880	Strategy perspective such that we can live better lives
444680	448200	What do you lay the decline of happiness at the feet of psychologically?
449160	453960	There's kind of climate factors and weather factors and I don't mean that literally that's a metaphor too
454040	455800	It's kind of like you and me dating is a metaphor
455800	461080	So the climate is the climate of faith family friendship and work in this country
461480	467160	Those are the habits of the happiest people. There's tons of literature out there that give you 10 000 happiness habits
467560	472600	Okay, but they're all trivial compared to the big four, which is your faith or life philosophy
472920	474920	Though the y of your existence
475160	480200	Metaphysically that will make you small and the universe large. You must transcend yourself
480280	485160	You'll be stuck in the tedious psychodrama of of christness. I mean, it's like it's
485720	488680	It's great for a minute but 24 hours a day you're going to lose your mind
489160	492920	You need to zoom out is the bottom line and I've got a bunch of ways that you can do it
492920	496200	I've got to have a folder full of ways that you can actually achieve this which
496760	498760	Up to and including the faith of your youth
498840	502040	But not not exclusively second is family life
502440	508840	Family life is critically important and is woefully neglected and it's societally increasingly neglected as well
508920	511400	Which which is accounts for a lot of this decline
512280	517320	Friendship friendship is actually getting harder and harder to come by we find that more people say nobody knows me well
517560	521640	And last but not least we have more of a dysfunctional relationship with work than we've had in the past
521640	525800	It's less like a vocation. It's less like a mission. Those are the climate factors
525800	530040	I know you're going to want to talk more about specifics in each one of those silos
530360	536760	Then there's the storms the storms have been have created down drafts of happiness from which we have not recovered in
537240	541000	2008 to 2010 it was screens smartphones social media
541400	547240	Especially among young adults. This is we understand the brain science on how this is incredibly deleterious to happiness
547720	551960	Second starting in about 2014 across most OECD countries
552200	559640	But really in the united states and the uk was the was the culture war was the incredibly polarizing ideological conflicts where
560600	567960	Malignantly narcissistic political and media leaders were conscripting child soldiers into their culture war by saying if somebody
568280	572040	Disagrees with you politically. They're denying your right to exist
572680	575400	And you must hate them unbelievably terrible for happiness
575400	578600	And last but not least was the loneliness that came from the coronavirus epidemic
579160	581400	For young adults that were coming of age
582120	584680	Synaptically in the plasticity of their brains
585240	590440	They literally didn't learn how to make friends and and have proper in-person love relationships
590680	594120	Which is probably the worst thing that's happened to happiness in the last hundred years
594760	600600	Why hasn't happiness been so robust that it's bounced back? What has locked in these losses in the market?
601320	605640	Well, if you if I could do one thing for somebody to make them happier one thing
606120	607880	It's eye contact and touch
607880	612440	That's the one thing. Why because you know, the neurophysiology is straightforward. You've talked about this on your show
613160	617320	The the the neuro peptide of connection is oxytocin
617800	622600	It's intensely pleasurable and and again, we don't want to be reductive about the brain chemistry
622600	626840	But this is a really important thing for us to understand. We're a kin based species
626840	632920	We know hours and hours know us and we get pleasure from being close to our kin such that we are averse to
633320	635320	Walking the frozen tundra and dying alone
635880	643160	Okay, that that natural impulse is actually guided in no small part by this neuro peptide that functions as a hormone in the human brain called
643320	644600	Octitocin
644600	647320	We don't get it when we don't have eye contact and touch
647960	652680	How do you not get eye contact and touch by conducting your friendships through an iphone?
653240	654760	with social media
654760	659400	By going to school on zoom by never going into an office man
659480	660760	I mean, it's it's it's crazy
660760	664440	Look, if I were in austin we'd be doing this in person because it would be it would be better
664520	669640	And it would be better because we'd have more eye contact and because we'd be getting more oxytocin over the course of this conversation
670120	674120	Young people who've never gotten that have wired their brains differently
674440	679560	And the result is it's not clear that they're ever going to be able to recover from what we've done
680120	683560	Not I mean, I don't I don't mean to be you know catastrophic about it, but
684440	691320	I'm not entirely convinced that this that we're not losing a generation to oxytocin deficit and lowliness
692520	694520	this
694600	696600	is bad news
697480	699480	predictably for
699480	700120	the
700120	702120	lone ranger sigma male
702440	707880	Guys out there who don't need friends and i'm going to make it on my own and it's too hard to get out there
708040	714840	And I'm just going to retreat myself to my little digital cabin in the woods and not spend any time together
715880	717880	It's one of the reasons why I'm such a
718360	720680	a critic of cynicism on the internet that
721240	724600	Things won't get better and people who say that it can are the problem
727480	729480	It is so
729560	733720	I mean look if you have managed to convince yourself that things aren't going to get better and
734680	739480	You are robust in your thinking and it's not going to change. All right, whatever like I don't want you to
740120	744840	Leave society but so be it but it's fucking evil for you to convince other people
745480	750280	Of the same like you for you to somehow convince other people that no it's not there's no
750840	754680	Point in trying to get into a relationship. There's no point in trying to have friends
754680	757480	There's no point in trying to contribute to society. All right
757480	762600	Well, I mean like all of those things will very reliably make you miserable and you're basically saying
763320	768680	My philosophy is the one to follow despite the fact that we know the direction. It's going to take you in
768680	773400	Yeah, yeah, you know, let me let me let me make sure that I'm not I'm not actually guilty of that
774120	776280	By saying that I'm worried about losing a generation
776600	781880	You can rewire your brain the question is whether or not that you have this is that the society is
782280	787640	Is giving us adequate opportunities to do so and if it isn't take those opportunities yourself
787880	790680	nobody is permanently lost if they actually will will
791640	796760	Will do what actually needs to be done and adopt the attitudes that show that for example
797400	801880	You're better off when you're around people you need real friends
802440	804440	You'll be a lot happier
804440	808920	All the young men listening to modern wisdom if you fall in love and get married and have children
809000	814440	You'll be happier. You'll be a lot happier. It's not true what the red pill community is telling you that you'll be
814840	819240	Subjugated and miserable your whole life. I got the data trust me on this. This is the whole point
819640	825400	I'm worried about losing a generation precisely because the messages are coming out that these things are stupid and don't make sense
826120	828360	That's the wrong set of of messages
828520	832120	I want to be transgressive and counter cultural against the
832600	836840	The technology that's saying that you don't need to be in person and against the culture
837240	840760	That's saying that not being around people is better than being with people
841560	843560	Bravo. Okay, faith
844120	845160	family
845160	847160	Friendships contributing in terms of work
847720	848760	right
848760	850600	faith i'm a
850600	851560	non
851560	856840	Religious person non-believing person right many people listening will be if they don't have a direct
857480	859480	route to access faith
859480	862360	What are some of the highest return strategies they can do?
862920	866200	So remember the point isn't faith per se as transcendence
866600	870200	You need to do something that will make you small and the universe big
870520	872680	That's what that that's what the science really says
873160	878360	And you know in mother nature doesn't want you to do that mother nature is like it's all about you
879080	884200	You are the star of your psychodrama and why because you know that that's you know evolutionarily
884200	886600	It sort of makes sense that you'd be focusing on yourself all the time
887480	891000	But also it's worth pointing out that mother nature doesn't care if you're happy
891800	893800	mother nature
894760	901640	Only cares that you survive and pass on your genes and so therefore happiness. That's that's your problem in your business
902120	907000	That's the key thing for us to keep in mind. I think that's just to interject there. I think that that
907800	914280	Realization that humans are not designed to achieve happiness that that's a state which might be
914920	919000	It's it's neither necessary nor sufficient for you to do what mother nature wanted you to do
919000	921640	It was just it was like a byproduct of it. So
922200	924920	Realizing, you know, it's not like you're swimming upstream
925400	928360	But that most of the set points and motivations
929160	930120	that
930120	932120	Your system will try and push you toward
932680	935320	Are not going to be conducive to happiness
935560	940520	So when the question of why why is it so hard to be happy or why is happiness a big dearth in the modern world?
940680	943480	It's like well, it's been in a big dearth for a very long time
943480	948120	There is no reason for your system to try and encourage you to be happy in the first place
948760	952520	Yeah, that's right and and and to speak in terms that you've often used in your show
953160	955420	That is to be managed by your limbic system
956380	961020	As opposed to actually drawing the experiences of your life into your prefrontal cortex
961420	967500	The c-suite of your brain where you're making decisions that the divine path actually comes from being fully human
967900	970860	The animal path comes from not being fully human
971180	975420	That that leaving these sensations in the emotional centers of the limbic system of your brain would say
975900	980300	Do this because you feel that that's no way to live. That's a really important thing to keep in in mind
980700	983180	Mother nature says you're the star of your psychodrama
983420	988060	You want to be happy? You have to leave that behind and the way to do that is to achieve transcendence from yourself
988540	993980	Here's a really good way to do that. You and I are one of your neighbor out there in austin texas is ryan holiday
994140	1000460	Our mutual friend ryan hall of it. He's great. He's the world's leading expert on the modern understanding of the stoic philosophers
1000780	1007180	He reads senica for fun and epictetus and marcus aurelius and he's talking about wall cicero said
1007580	1011580	It's just amazing how he does that. Why because he actually wants to achieve transcendence
1011980	1017500	By doing the hard things that come from the denial of the visceral pleasures that are embedded in the
1017980	1024540	In the impulses of the limbic system. That's really what stoicism is all about. That's the divine path of transcendence using pure philosophy
1024940	1027580	Many philosophies will do that. I don't recommend niché
1028060	1033740	That's what a lot of sort of the modern crowd is is talking about which leads to some of the problems that we were just discussing a minute ago
1034140	1035980	There are better paths
1035980	1041580	Some people will actually get this by getting out of their head in a meditative experience using nature
1041980	1044540	So one of the things that I recommend to a lot of young people today
1044620	1048300	A lot of young guys coming out of college will call me. Ah, I feel lost
1048620	1050060	I thought I was going to be
1050060	1054300	So clear about my life when I got out of college and so what do I do professor?
1054700	1057820	And one of the things that I often recommend is i'm not going to you know
1057820	1063740	Tell them to go find some specific faith or sit in the mouth of the cave and talk to the guru or learn how to meditate immediately
1064140	1067020	What I say is get up an hour and a half before dawn
1067580	1072620	That's called the brahma muhurta in samskrita. That's that means in samskrita the creator's time
1073340	1079580	That is a very special time for for the development of your own brain because what you find is if you get up
1080140	1081980	systematically before sunrise
1081980	1083980	You're going to be more focused
1083980	1087980	You'll learn more quickly and your attention will be better throughout the course of the day
1087980	1093180	There's a lot of research that shows this get out of the house when it's nice and dark and cool
1094140	1097580	And walk for an hour be ambulatory for an hour
1098140	1101420	And and such that you're doing it as the sun is coming up by the end of your walk
1101660	1106540	And you can hear the crunch of the gravel on the trail beneath your feet. You don't have your device
1106620	1111180	You're not I mean I I strongly recommend listening to modern wisdom not then
1111820	1116380	That's not when you're listening to your podcast. You're listening to your heartbeat. You're listening to the birds
1116460	1119660	You're listening to the the sound of the trail in your feet, etc.
1119980	1122700	This is a very good way to do it. There's a lot of science to back it up
1123100	1126620	This is not just romanticism another way to do this is to
1127260	1128700	Is to actually
1128700	1134620	Stand in awe of great genius. I recommend learning about the fugues of yohan sebastian bach
1135100	1137260	And listening with utter seriousness
1137980	1142220	For example to his cantatas. He's got hundreds of them. They fell off his pen
1142540	1146780	Learn about that. It's just gonna it's gonna blow your mind. You'll be small. Trust me
1147260	1150620	You could start of a postant of meditation practice. Why not or
1151420	1153180	I go to mass every day
1153180	1158300	You can practice your faith and and by the way chris. I understand that you don't have a faith or you know a sense of this
1158940	1164780	You might after 40 and being open to the impulse to actually find the divine in your life
1164860	1168060	That's a critically important way to actually practice this as well. Just the openness
1168540	1171020	I went to my first american
1171500	1173180	Bible church
1173180	1174700	service on
1174780	1177740	Easter Sunday this year and
1178860	1185580	Boy was that that was an experience. There was a rock band. There was an led wall. There was pyrotechnics
1186220	1188220	I pulled up behind a
1188700	1190380	uh
1190380	1196700	Like super fast american muscle car that had god now as the number plate
1197020	1200620	So I found that it was very enjoyable and I can totally see why people do it
1200620	1205260	So I'm absolutely open to I'm open to the potential of that. All right. That's faith family
1206220	1207980	yeah, so
1207980	1212300	This should be pretty obvious not everybody by the way has access to
1212860	1217180	Functional family relationships. I get it and some people actually have to kind of assemble a family
1217740	1221420	But I'll tell you it's a kind of a funny thing. I mean, I didn't quite understand this until
1222060	1226620	Later in life and part of the reason is because I had at best kind of a cordial relationship with my parents
1227340	1230940	It was there's nothing wrong. They were there were good parents, but you know, I was doing my thing
1230940	1237020	I was living in europe through my 20s. I was I was a professional musician when you were, you know, throwing people out of bars
1237180	1239180	I was playing in a symphony orchestra
1239260	1243100	Which is a different lifestyle, but you know it bears certain similarities as well
1243180	1247500	You know you're out late at night and you're far away from home and you're living your dream and the whole thing
1247580	1249340	And I can't remember thinking
1249340	1254700	In my 20s, I should get to know my parents. My mother was an artist. My father was a mathematician
1254700	1257900	They were very interesting and intellectual and cultured people
1258860	1260860	And then they died
1260860	1262060	They just
1262060	1263660	died young
1263660	1268780	Now my father was pretty close to my age now and uh, and it was too late and I thought
1269900	1275020	You know, what does that mean? Does that set me back? And it turns out that I could fix that because now I have adult children
1275100	1277100	I'm a grandfather at this point
1277260	1280060	And I talk to all of my kids every single day
1280700	1281740	I see my grandson
1281740	1283260	I'm moving
1283260	1286460	Because my kids are moving and my grandchildren are going to living in a different place
1286540	1289340	And I'm not going to commute to them is what it comes down to
1289980	1295980	You must have family relationships or manufacture family relationships in your life and you must not have schism for
1296620	1298860	Stupidities like differences of political opinion
1299340	1304220	The narcissists and politics will tell you to stop talking to people in your family because they I don't know voted for
1304300	1306780	Trump or didn't vote for Trump or whatever the thing is
1307500	1312540	It's so idiotic that you would sacrifice your own happiness for somebody else's political cult
1312860	1315180	It's completely nutty is the way that that works out
1315420	1320300	You need to have it keep it or make it and make it a part of your life that you exercise every day
1320860	1322860	all right friends
1322940	1327420	Friendship is should be the easiest because we're all surrounded by people all day long
1327980	1332780	And it turns out it's the hardest for a lot of people. I'm kind of a striver whisperer in my practice
1332940	1337180	I specialize in people that really want to make a lot with their lives that are serious about the
1337820	1341660	Entrepreneurial venture of their own life. They're the startup entrepreneur of me Inc.
1341660	1343660	I really admire that and it's something that I teach
1344220	1347900	The problem with that is it's very easy to no longer have real friends
1348620	1354700	They have deal friends, but not real friends and and real and deal are different deal deal friends. They're useful
1355020	1359420	They're very useful, right and it's good to have people who are useful to you and it's good to be useful to others
1359500	1360780	Don't get me wrong
1360780	1363660	But you need useless friends too people who just love you
1364380	1367020	You need useless friends. I don't mean worthless friends. I have those too
1367340	1372700	You need people who who are not useful to you and you're not useful to them
1373020	1377500	They just love you chris and and we have fewer and fewer of that. That's the reason that
1378140	1381820	60 percent of 60 year old men today say their best friend is their wives
1382220	1385180	And 30 percent of their wives say their best friend is their husband
1385500	1392300	That's a a sad story of unrequited love for men my age. It's really important to keep this in mind
1392540	1396220	It's also because women seem to be able to hold on to
1396780	1398780	uh, that allo parenting
1399260	1404700	Adjacents group of close friends better than men do. I mean, this is one of the reasons why during
1405260	1408300	divorces men have a worse time of it
1409020	1413820	For many reasons, but one of them being that they often subjugate their friend group for their wife's friend group
1414300	1417260	And when the wife goes away the friend group goes away
1417820	1425580	Yeah, yeah, so for in traditionally organized families in in past times in particular when dad left and and made a living
1426140	1429740	Outside the home at work. He would be cheating his family by hanging out with his friends
1430220	1436780	And so he didn't and the result is that he lost his friendship chops over the years and got lonelier and lonelier and lonelier
1437180	1439180	Now you think it'd be much better now
1439180	1443260	It's much worse because everybody's doing that now everybody's men are doing that women are doing that
1443260	1448140	And you find that women and men under 30 are now the loneliest cohort in our society
1448300	1452940	And the more successful they are in their lives the lonelier they tend to be in their lives
1453260	1455660	They're more likely to say that nobody knows me well
1455740	1458860	The reason is real and deal and you got to do the work
1459100	1463180	I mean for a lot of people they haven't had close friendships since college or from high school
1463740	1469580	And when they're you know, 28 years old and now 35 years old they're 45 years old and everybody's incredibly useful to them
1469900	1476140	Now to be sure the the most successful marriages are the ones that are based on on on deep friendship
1476300	1480220	We call it companion at love which sounds, you know, distinctly not hot
1480620	1485500	I get it, but it's important because that's the the closest friendship you're going to have but it's not enough
1486140	1489500	You find that the happiest people they have they're very close friends with their spouse
1489580	1495740	But they have one really close friend at least besides that introverts usually have one really close friend besides a spouse
1496060	1498060	Extroverts have more like five
1498060	1501740	They don't have 20 because you don't have the time to maintain that but it's really important
1502460	1507100	How often do we need to see our friends? How do we determine whether somebody is real or deal?
1507660	1511260	What's the amount of time that we need to spend with them per week, etc, etc
1511260	1516140	Yeah, there's lots of rules for that and again, this falls into the your results may vary category
1516220	1519580	But there's one thing that I do know when somebody says, oh, yeah, no, no, I mean that's like
1520300	1523900	I have some real friends. Let's say think about your most real friend who's not your spouse again
1524220	1526220	When's the last time you talked to him?
1526540	1529580	I don't know two months ago. Not a real friend. I'm sorry
1530140	1533820	I'm sorry. I mean, it's like if it's your real friend you keep up to date with your real friends
1533820	1539340	I have two guys that I talk to every week and they one lives in san francisco and one lives in atlanta
1539420	1540940	I live in boston
1540940	1544460	I see them in person. I saw one of them for breakfast yesterday in new york city
1544460	1547820	We take opportunities with one of them. We go on vacation together with our wives
1548460	1552620	That's the effort that you make because you you want to see the people you love
1553100	1555980	You want to see him in person you make the effort you want to talk to him
1555980	1559660	You miss him you actually miss him if if you don't miss the person
1560140	1563420	It doesn't kind of hurt your heart because you haven't talked to him in a while in a week
1563980	1568380	It's not a real friend. What's the difference between real and deal? How can someone tell a lot of the time we
1569180	1574940	Feel like real friends are also impressive if you're on the personal growth journey. It's difficult to
1575580	1581820	Distinguish real and deal from real ordeal. Yeah, the difference is that with a deal friend
1581980	1588380	There's something in front. There's this trend. There's a transaction that's happening. That's more important than the emotion transaction
1588460	1593180	Trump's emotion. There's nothing wrong with that with people in your life. By the way, it's not like you should
1593820	1598460	Fire all of your transactional friendships. No because you'll wind up without a career to be sure
1598780	1600620	It's very good to help each other
1600620	1605100	But if the emotion that you feel for the person is more important than the transaction you could undertake
1605500	1609740	Okay, that's good in which case you can actually have deals with your real friends
1609980	1616620	But that's the key component and if for all of them, it's like I care a lot more about how the person is useful to me
1616940	1619180	Than the person's life. That's when you know
1619740	1621740	Got you final one. What?
1621820	1622940	Yeah
1622940	1625660	Work is you know, people listening to us right now
1626780	1630300	They want an edge in their lives and I and I understand that in a way that they
1630860	1637100	Measure that edge frequently is is in their and their success. You know, I think I probably at first listened to you
1638060	1642460	Three years ago, maybe the first time I heard your show and I think you just passed
1643340	1645340	I don't know a hundred thousand
1645660	1650140	YouTube subscribers or something that was a long time ago because you have a lot more than that right now
1650300	1655340	And I remember you're like, I can't believe it man and your career was kind of blowing up
1655340	1660060	I remember thinking that because I was thinking yeah, this young guy is doing great. It's very inspirational
1660460	1664220	I love people who are in the hunt. I really really love people who are in the hunt
1664460	1666300	The problem is
1666300	1669580	That when it comes to work the hunt itself doesn't give you
1670140	1673980	Doesn't give you the satisfaction that you're going to desire mother nature lies to you in many ways
1673980	1677980	But and we've talked about it before but but here's one of the biggest lies that mother nature gives you
1678380	1680380	If you're successful and making
1680860	1686780	Progress and money and power and the admiration of other people then you'll be happy you get happiness for free
1687100	1689980	Success first happiness second. So you don't have to worry about happiness
1689980	1691980	You just have to be successful money power
1691980	1692700	admiration
1692700	1694700	Maybe a little pleasure thrown in there along the way
1695260	1698300	Those are the worldly idols by the way st. Thomas Aquinas
1698620	1703340	In paraphrasing Aristotle and the Summa Theologia written in 1265
1703820	1707820	Classified those as the world's idols he was an excellent social scientist
1708220	1712140	Because it turns out that those are the intermediate good. There's nothing wrong with those things by the way
1712140	1717340	I'm not condemning those things. They're just incomplete for your happiness if you you have those as the goals
1717420	1721740	You're in real trouble. Okay. So what are the right goals from work? It's twofold
1722300	1724800	number one earn your success
1725500	1731500	That means create value with your life and work in your life in the lives of other people and you have to be rewarded and
1731820	1735340	Acknowledged and recognized for the the real value that you're creating
1735900	1743020	10 years nonsense loyalties nonsense merit hard work and personal responsibility and you're rewarded and recognized for it
1743020	1745020	And you believe it that's earned success
1745580	1749340	That by the way, that's why I'm a complete advocate for the free enterprise system
1749900	1753020	Not because I you know, it's like rah rah rah capitalism adam smith
1753020	1753740	No
1753740	1759340	Because it makes people happy when they're succeeding in the in the in a system that rewards merit and personal responsibility
1759340	1763100	It's not perfect, but it's the only system we got that really does that that's number one two
1763580	1765580	Now i'm going to sound like a commie
1765580	1767340	service to others
1767340	1772700	Service to others you need to actually believe actually that's not communism. That's capitalism too. I take it back
1773340	1777740	Service to others is incredibly it's it's this will bring you joy to your work
1777820	1781340	You have to know that people need you the essence of human dignity
1781820	1783580	Is about being needed
1783580	1790860	Is like feeling it like an asset in society the essence of despair is feeling like a liability to be managed
1791020	1795340	By your family by the welfare system by anybody else
1795420	1800540	Which is why it's so terrible to be in poverty because of the way that we treat people in poverty
1800540	1805740	We don't look at them as assets to develop which they should be because human beings are human beings with equal dignity
1806140	1807580	We treat them like, you know
1807580	1814860	Liabilities to manage by the by whatever system that they're they're talking about to create value in the lives of other people to
1815420	1821020	To to to serve others means that they need you and that is the true secret to everything else
1821100	1823180	Now you get it like crazy because you know
1824060	1826940	You don't you don't have gunned anybody's head to listen to modern wisdom
1827420	1833580	They're coming to you voluntarily and that is this affirmation. They need me. They like it. It's in the comments. Thank you
1833740	1835180	My guess is you get
1835180	1840060	20 emails a day from people who say that that podcast really changed my thinking
1840540	1845820	They need you. Well, everybody needs that every single person needs that whether you're you know picking apples or
1846460	1849980	You know trying to you know running for congress you actually need that in your life
1850300	1853820	Those are the two service to others and and earning your success
1854700	1856700	I had an essay that I wrote
1857260	1858460	Probably about a year ago now
1858460	1861740	I want to read it to you about the tension between success and happiness
1862220	1864540	One of the most tensions one of the most common tensions
1864540	1868780	I talk about at the moment is between a desire for success and a desire to feel like we're enough
1869340	1870860	Success is a strange thing
1870860	1876140	Presumably we want success because we think a more successful life will bring us more happiness meaning and fulfillment
1876460	1878940	Here's the problem. We sacrifice the thing we want
1879340	1884140	Happiness for the thing which is supposed to get it success failure can make you miserable
1884220	1887660	But i'm not sure that success will make you happy one of the most common dynamics
1887660	1890780	I see amongst high performances is this parents want their child to do well
1891180	1895260	Parents encourage their child to do well by praising when they succeed and criticizing when they fail
1895500	1899980	The child learns that praise and admiration is contingent on succeeding this lesson
1900540	1906060	Metastasizes through early adulthood into I am only worthy of love acceptance and belonging if I succeed
1906380	1908860	Now powered by an internal feeling of insufficiency
1909020	1911260	This person is driven to achieve many things
1911420	1916620	They're prepared to outwork out hustle and out suffer everyone else because they're not just running toward a life that they want
1916860	1921900	They're running away from a life that they fear success and progress ameliorates the feelings of insufficiency
1922140	1925740	Therefore success and progress becomes prioritized above everything else
1925980	1930940	Now don't get me wrong many high performers genuinely love the work that they do and many are driven by a well balanced
1931020	1933420	simple desire to maximize their time on this planet
1934220	1936540	Rather than trying to fill a void inside of themselves
1936860	1941660	But if I was to place a bet I'd guess that the majority of high performers are driven by fears of insufficiency
1941900	1944220	Rather than a holistic desire to be better
1944540	1948460	I think people who are high achievers on average are more miserable than the average person
1948780	1953420	So what does it mean that the people we admire most are the ones with the least admirable internal states?
1953820	1958140	If the pursuit of success is in an effort to make us happy and in the pursuit of success
1958300	1963340	We make ourselves miserable. Why not just shortcut the entire process and just be happy?
1963820	1966620	Is that even possible now external accolades count for a lot?
1966700	1971820	And I don't think that recanting all worldly possessions and retreating to a cave in the woods is an optimal strategy
1972060	1978140	Some degree of external material success is important to make us feel validated and satiate our desire for status and respect
1978460	1985340	But external success will not fill an internal void and insufficiency adaptation is this if your drive
1986060	1990940	Comes from a fear of insufficiency and you continue to disprove those fears with success in the real world
1991180	1997340	And yet the feeling of insufficiency persists. What makes you think that the answer to this problem is more success
1998620	1999900	nice
1999900	2002780	Very astute you're a natural social scientist
2003340	2005820	I admire it and it's all true
2006060	2009500	Look everything is like there's a ton of science that backs all that up, but you don't need it
2010060	2014460	Everybody knows that that look if you go for the success to get the happiness
2015020	2018940	You're going to get the success because we'll be unto you if you have the wrong dreams
2018940	2024380	Your dreams are going to come true if you work hard on them, but you're not going to get to the happiness the right strategy
2025260	2028860	Is to shoot for greater happiness and then you'll have enough success
2029660	2032620	Now those words for a guy like you a stranger like you
2033180	2035180	They give you a little chill don't they?
2035660	2041500	Because enough success doesn't sound right. No, no, man. I'm not doing this for enough success
2041980	2044780	I know tons of guys back in high school who have enough success
2045500	2047500	I don't want that. I want to be
2047900	2050620	I want to be special chris. I want to be special
2051500	2059660	How many people with a success addiction, which is the fundamental brain delivered underlying dopamine?
2061340	2066140	Moderated or mediated addiction which lies behind workaholism by the way
2066860	2070620	How many of those people have chosen specialness over happiness?
2071020	2075980	That's what you're talking about any loser can cultivate all these relationships and all these friendships
2076300	2080380	But not every loser can work as hard as I do and become a navy seal
2081020	2086380	and do you know 50 pull-ups and and have you know 40 million
2087260	2089260	Instagram followers. I don't know
2089820	2093820	If that's specialness and and by the way mother nature is arriving you once again
2094220	2097980	Mother nature does not care if you're happy, but mother nature wants you to be special
2098460	2103260	So that you'll be able to survive more easily by having a higher rank in the kin group
2103740	2106860	And being able to pass on your genes because you'll be the alpha
2107820	2110940	But that's not what you want. That's actually not even what you want
2111020	2114140	You're gonna get enough food and you don't want 750 kids
2114940	2122140	You what you want is a really really good life and you're being driven by these ancient impulses
2122300	2127660	That's exactly what you're saying and you've walked into a dopaminergic
2128220	2133020	Moderated and I don't know why I actually had this thing come up on my screen right now. It's fine. It's fine
2133580	2142220	It's a why we we we walk into a a a success addiction that makes your brain look more or less like a methamphetamine addicts brain
2143020	2145020	How can people
2145340	2149340	Learn to unwind and detach themselves from their desire for success
2149740	2155740	You don't need to unwind your desire for success. You need to understand and manage your desire
2156380	2159740	That's what we need to do on all these things. You don't need to want different things
2160300	2164380	You need to manage your wants for these different things. Look, what does that? I don't drink?
2164620	2166940	I don't drink alcohol. I don't drink alcohol
2167100	2172300	And the reason I don't drink alcohol is because there's a lot of alcoholism in my family and I drank way too much when I was your age
2172700	2174700	I drank a lot when I was your age
2175340	2176620	And so
2176620	2178620	I stopped
2178940	2182700	And I stopped a long time ago. I stopped over 20 years ago. I still want alcohol
2183180	2189420	I'm not going to stop wanting alcohol. What I do is I manage my desire for alcohol through visa v my behavior
2190060	2194940	That's what we need to do. Look, of course, you're ambitious. Of course, you're driven for tremendous success
2195020	2195820	That's wonderful
2195820	2203340	But it can't manage you that that that drive that ambition that that that intense visceral sense that that you'll only
2203740	2207580	Be special if you have enough success you can't let it manage you is what it comes down to
2207580	2211100	Of course, you have these desires. By the way, chris, you're going to get married at some point
2211420	2215740	And and after you're married you're going to look at a woman and she's going to be incredibly beautiful
2215900	2220380	And you're going to have a sense of natural human desire for her and you're not going to act on it
2220700	2225740	That's the same thing is true when when you could work the 14th hour instead of spending the first hour with your kids
2225980	2229740	You're going to make the decision to sublimate that desire and manage it
2230540	2233820	Yeah, that's interesting. I remember david bus told me this story
2234540	2236780	That a reader sent in to him
2237580	2240860	Saying that his book had saved his marriage
2241260	2246060	Because this guy had been married for a while maybe between five and ten years something like that
2246380	2250060	and he'd found himself being attracted to other women and
2250700	2259500	He took that attraction as some sort of sense that his existing relationship was wrong if I was
2260300	2263820	Fully totally renaissance period besotted with my partner
2264140	2266940	I wouldn't have eyes for any other woman for the rest of time
2267340	2273740	And david explained that there is a very very well embedded reward system that men get when they look at
2274060	2281660	Even a pair of rocks that slightly resemble boobs like you are driven to just like sexualize and look at anything
2281740	2283260	whether it's like
2283260	2285260	geological or otherwise and
2286220	2290460	He said that it sort of liberated me from this sense that I can't
2291420	2296540	The desire itself is wrong and I must tell myself a story about it. It feels a little bit to me
2297340	2299340	like this
2300140	2302940	Line that we have drawn between when I get enough success
2303020	2307740	I will allow myself to be happy or I will I will have justified happiness happiness will come as a byproduct
2308140	2310140	Along for the ride with success
2310220	2316780	That's kind of the same look your desire to continue to chase this thing may not really
2317500	2318940	Cease all that much
2318940	2322780	But your choice about whether or not you do work the 14th hour today
2323420	2327340	Is one of those and it's not just about you know, it's kind of further upstream
2327340	2330780	I'm going to guess what you need to do is go further upstream than this and think about
2331180	2332620	How many hours a day do I want to work?
2332700	2336460	How much work do I need to put on my plate in order for me to need to work those number of hours
2336620	2340780	Because otherwise what you're going to end up doing is failing at things that you've intended to do
2341020	2346060	Like if you've put 14 hours of work on your plate, like you kind of need to do it until you no longer need to do it
2346540	2348860	And that is a more sort of life design
2349660	2351260	position
2351260	2353740	That's right. The unfortunate fact is that
2354620	2360540	You won't know how to do anything else once you become hopelessly addicted because these behavioral patterns feed on themselves
2360620	2363580	Notwithstanding the fact that you're getting unhappier and unhappier
2364460	2367820	Furthermore, there's one other thing that's keep that's worth pointing out if you were
2368540	2371180	An you know an untreated alcoholic
2371740	2377500	Nobody would say like dude last night you put away two bottles of vodka. That was impressive
2377820	2383500	I admire you for that. They'd be like get some help man. That was it's pathetic
2383820	2387820	But if you work 14 hour days, they're going to be like man, you're going to be the next Elon Musk
2388380	2390380	What do you admire about Elon Musk?
2390380	2391900	He works all the time
2391900	2397740	He and you know people will admire the fact that he says I haven't taken a day off since 2008 or something like that
2398060	2404140	We love workaholics in our culture. We love success addicts. We love people who are
2404780	2409580	Self-objectifiers, but let's just think about that a little bit. I mean, I bet when you were a kid
2409580	2411580	Did you have a good relationship with your dad?
2411900	2413260	Yeah, not bad
2413260	2416220	And I bet that he said that you shouldn't objectify women
2416380	2422380	You shouldn't look at them and say that they're nothing more than sex objects or that you should treat them like real people, right?
2422780	2423980	you know
2423980	2429980	Why because you you're a boy and you have an impulse to not do that for all the reasons that david buss has made very clear on your show
2430860	2436940	Okay, well, you shouldn't objectify yourself either chris and and a self-objectifier is somebody who looks in the mirror and says
2437420	2439420	That's a success machine
2439740	2441740	That's somebody and you know that these
2441820	2448140	Affirmations it'd be like looking in the mirror and saying that's somebody who can say stay stoned all day
2449100	2451020	It wouldn't do that. That'd be pathetic. It could be weird
2451020	2455420	And yet that's kind of the thing that we do with the self-objectification which is downstream from success addiction
2455500	2457500	Which actually is related to workaholism
2457900	2463180	Which all these weird patterns of behavior that we establish often before even before adolescence
2463740	2468300	All right, let's get into the macro nutrients the component parts of happiness
2468300	2475100	We've got three to go through one other. Yeah enjoyment satisfaction and meaning and they seem self-evident, but they're not
2475660	2479660	The that to be I'll give you an example enjoyment sounds like pleasure
2479660	2482780	But it's completely different for all the reasons that we've kind of discussed
2483340	2485340	pleasure is a limbic phenomenon
2485580	2487580	pleasure is uh is uh
2487900	2495180	And it's a set of signals in your limbic system saying that something is either really good for helping you survive to get calories
2495180	2498220	Are really good for getting mates and passing on your genes
2498540	2502700	That's really the and and we become ingenious at in the laboratory
2503260	2509100	Creating new ways to get those sensations. So, you know, everything from gambling to pornography to
2509740	2511740	methamphetamine to
2511980	2518860	Fentanyl to alcohol all these things do is they mimic different ways that in the place to seem before we had substances in these behaviors
2519020	2522540	That we would get pleasure from something that actually helps us survive and pass on our genes
2522940	2527820	Unfortunately, all those things that I just mentioned are addictive and bad for you because
2528300	2531580	You know, what you're doing is you're artificially stimulating something you don't need to do
2531740	2536300	And in a way that your your body and brain are not accustomed to and so they're incredibly unhealthy
2536540	2539580	A lot of guys, especially your age, don't realize how dangerous
2540220	2544940	Is for the brain for example, but what it is is just it fires up that impulse to pass on your genes
2545420	2551820	In an artificial way. Okay. So why do I bring that up? Because all those limbic searches for pleasure are different than enjoyment
2551900	2555340	Which is fundamentally an experience in the prefrontal cortex of your brain
2556060	2560140	And you don't have to not have pleasure by the way. I'm not I'm I'm catholic. I'm not I'm not a puritan
2560940	2565500	And what you need is the source of pleasure plus people plus memory
2565980	2571500	Thus delivering the experience into your prefrontal cortex, which is part of happiness. So I'll give you an example
2572300	2576460	I was doing work with a big beer company and we were talking about these ideas and I said look
2577100	2580140	Associate your product with enjoyment not pleasure
2580620	2586460	And I said, what do you mean? Well, don't run a commercial of a dude alone in his apartment pounding a 12 pack
2587340	2593420	Why because that's the pursuit of pleasure and everybody knows is addictive and dangerous and irresponsible and pathetic
2594380	2597900	Do the ad where the guy is having a beer with his brother or his friends
2598140	2603260	You've taken beer plus people plus memory and that equals enjoyment and that's part of happiness
2603580	2609420	If you're doing something as pleasurable and and it can be addictive and you're doing it alone. You're probably doing it wrong
2610220	2613980	That's where pornography comes in. That's where gambling by yourself comes in
2614140	2616940	That's where eating a whole cake by yourself comes in
2617340	2621420	That's where using what drinking alone comes in all of these particular behaviors
2621500	2628620	And that's an example of how the the neuroscience of this can be intensely practical in helping you to lead a better life and change your habits
2629180	2632700	What else is there to say about the
2633900	2635660	way to use
2635660	2643180	Pleasure people and memories is there something you should do to embed memories more effectively other types of pleasures that seem to be better for
2643180	2647100	Happiness or not other types of people. Is there a way that you can reinforce this?
2647100	2651900	Do I need an ebbing house forgetting curve flash card anky deck to be able to remember all of the shit that I did?
2652460	2655100	I mean, hey man, let's make it. Let's make some money. So
2655820	2663420	I mean, see you're such a natural entrepreneur. It's it's unbelievable. You go write your product. It's great. Um, yeah, the people shouldn't be addicts
2664060	2669980	You know, it's not going to be helpful to you if your community of people who help you enjoy things that are pleasurable are also drunks
2670620	2676540	So so it's obviously the case that you want people who are trying to enjoy each other's company as opposed to simply focusing on the
2676940	2681100	The source of the pleasure the the chemical or behavioral source of the pleasure. That's really important
2681900	2687580	Actually just to interject that I wonder whether I wonder whether there's an analogy to be drawn between
2688940	2693100	Um, let's say that you know a bunch of people in a crack den all of whom are just smoking crack
2693100	2697340	And the only reason that they're there is to like be around other people that also do crack
2697340	2700380	That's just the environment that they they exist in. I wonder whether
2701100	2704780	There is kind of an equivalent if you were to let's say be
2705740	2712140	A professional athlete of some kind training in a facility with a bunch of other individual athletes
2712380	2717980	But all of whom were only there because they also needed to use the facility individually that they were there for the
2718380	2721020	personal pursuit now, obviously the pursuit of
2721500	2725100	training versus the sort of direct pleasure that you get from taking drugs
2725420	2727340	but my point being that
2727340	2728460	there's
2728460	2729900	a lack of
2729900	2735900	Interaction between each of those individuals. They're very much siloed within their own experience of whatever the pleasure might be
2736700	2738700	You are at a gaming a games
2740620	2742700	Place where tons of people can play call of duty
2742860	2746140	But none of you are playing against each other and none of you are speaking to each other
2746620	2749660	Right like you're with people. It's doing it in community
2750380	2751740	But it's not
2751740	2756060	Integrating with the people. Yeah interaction is critically important. You're not with other people
2756300	2759100	You're not actually with other people if you're just
2759740	2761740	In a crowd. I mean you can feel unbelievably
2762540	2767100	Lonely walking down the street in New York City. You're technically all walking down the street in New York City
2767180	2769660	This is with little kids. You'll see this when you have children
2770460	2774220	Before they learn how to interact with each other they do they do something called parallel play
2774780	2779020	Where you'll bring two little kids two little two year olds together and they'll be playing with blocks
2779100	2783020	But not together parallel like they want to be looking at each other's way that that works
2783340	2785340	That doesn't stimulate oxytocin
2785980	2789500	And so if you want to get into the neurochemistry of what we're talking about here
2790060	2796700	You're not going to get the benefit of pleasure plus people plus memory unless you're doing something that really stimulates oxytocin
2796780	2800540	Which means intense interaction eye contact and ideally human touch as well
2801100	2803100	Right. Okay. So this is an argument to
2803980	2804940	You know
2804940	2808860	Give your friends a hug when they just win at a board game to like reach up a high five
2809180	2814140	I play a lot of werewolves. Have you played werewolves? No, I haven't okay. So werewolves is like a
2814780	2819340	It's a role-playing card game where everybody in a circle is given a particular character
2819660	2824460	Some are good guys some are bad guys and you don't know who's who and you have to bluff your way through
2825020	2830300	The game and oh, I thought about that. Yeah. Yeah, there's another game called mafia, which is basically the same but with different characters
2830860	2832860	and I have observed
2833340	2835340	People that have been married for 15 years
2835740	2841100	Where they completely straight face just lie to their partner about what their role is. No, of course not, honey
2841180	2846860	I love you. I would like so we've had to make a rule that like what happens during werewolves stays during werewolves
2847100	2852060	Because the potential blast radius of sort of the loss of the loss of certainty
2852700	2856620	Lots of trust. Yeah, exactly. There's a lot of uh, I play with a lot of like
2857260	2861660	World-class pro poker players too, which is just like a kind of to be honest an unfair fight
2861820	2864140	My point being that with that as soon as the game's finished
2864460	2866460	Everybody gets up everybody's sort of high five
2866460	2868220	There's been a ton of tension for a long time
2868300	2870540	Some people have been working together some people have been working against them
2870540	2874940	But they've been working together too and everybody's sort of high-fiving and all the rest of it and it's very enjoyable
2875260	2880060	Um, what is there to say just to round this out? What is there to say about memories?
2880540	2886060	Um, what can we do to maximize the yield of memories when it comes to enjoyment?
2887020	2890540	The key thing is actually to do something that's not part of your ordinary routine
2891020	2893020	The more that you'll actually
2893020	2898860	Disequilibrate your experience around for example a particular occasion or in a particular place
2899340	2904220	That will add to the memory such that it will be easier to recall to put together and to recall
2904620	2908780	And you'll be able to do it to to to to recreate that enjoyment again and again and again
2908780	2915340	What you'll want is to do something where the experience doesn't stop at the end of the action
2915980	2919340	That's what you really want. What do you mean when you say disequilibriate?
2920060	2923580	Disequilibrate what your ordinary routine is so so you'll notice that
2924220	2928140	The things that you do every single day you don't remember them the things you don't do every single day
2928220	2934380	You remember them and that's how you the recall so you can have the duration of the experience be richer and longer
2934620	2940220	To do is to you know when you're going to hang out with your friends go someplace with your friends right as opposed to
2940380	2942140	Is this a degree of novelty?
2942140	2946540	Yeah, and that's one of the reasons that I recommend that couples for example leave the house
2947100	2953260	That they do things together outside of the house. So they're not you know, they don't get into too much of a domestic routine, which is a very
2954460	2961500	Un a sort of uninteresting way to run your marriage is to do the same thing over and over and over and over again
2961500	2964300	You're just not going to get the benefits of enjoyment in the same way
2964940	2970940	I had uh, Susanna Hallinan on the show forever ever ever ago. Now remember she had this really great book
2971500	2974780	Uh talking about how to make time move more slowly
2975340	2977820	Yeah, it was so fascinating and it seems to me
2978620	2983580	At least my current sort of conception of it, which may need to be updated now is novelty and intensity
2983820	2989100	Those seem to be two of the things that increase the frequency of memory blocks sort of being dropped in that you know
2989980	2996300	Someone that's listening has driven to work a thousand times. That's a thousand journeys, but it was always the same route
2996620	2998620	so you have condensed a thousand
2999420	3004620	15 minute half hour blocks down into essentially one memory apart from that one time that there was a car crash
3004620	3008220	next to me and it was different because novelty and intensity and um,
3008780	3010460	yeah, I think just trying to
3010460	3012220	Keep that in mind to you know
3012220	3018380	Turn left instead of turning right when you go to the shops to go to a different restaurant to travel to a different hotel to do the whatever
3018700	3020700	Um, I think important
3021260	3025100	It is important and and there's a lot of ways that you can do that my wife and I have tried to do that
3025100	3027100	We've moved 20 times
3027260	3032860	In the 35 years that we've been together, uh, I mean we I mean it sounds like we're in the witness protection program
3032860	3037180	I realized but it's part of it is just because when we decide that we want to do a new thing
3037180	3042140	We do a new thing we've moved three times in the past five years because you know, where do we want to live not here?
3042300	3043820	I try that
3043820	3048540	And and this this it's not a search for novel it can become a pathology to be sure
3048700	3050700	You know, you actually can't stop any place
3050940	3053580	But the whole idea that you can live in a new way
3053980	3057500	Try a new thing and not letting it turn into kind of a groove
3057500	3064460	One of the reasons that the perception of time speeding up happens as people get older is because their openness to experience starts to decline
3064460	3068940	particularly after 55 your openness to experience increases
3069420	3074300	Um through your teenage years into your early 20s and it stays relatively constant until your mid 50s
3074300	3077180	And then it really takes a big dip as a as a matter of this
3077820	3083660	The way that we typically measured it and what we see your love of new things starts to decline you you got to fight against that
3083820	3085820	If you want if you don't want time to go
3086060	3090940	Terrifyingly fast and and and suddenly life is over one of the best ways to do it as you
3091420	3094060	Correctly point out is to inject more more
3094380	3098140	You know newness of the ways that you do things in your life and to do that with your partner as well
3098780	3100780	All right satisfaction. Yeah
3101020	3106620	Satisfaction is a weird one. So satisfaction is you know, we talk about it all the time, you know
3107180	3111180	But we don't really define it satisfaction is the joy that you get after struggle
3112140	3116700	And this is the weird human mystery only humans want pain
3117260	3121900	We only humans want to sacrifice and struggle because then the rewards are sweeter
3122300	3125900	The more you struggle before the more and and everybody kind of knows that's true
3126060	3130780	And yet we don't follow through on that very often. We're always looking for the easy way out
3130860	3132860	That's the reason that there's this kind of this
3132940	3136220	Call of the wild that people have when they listen to people like david goggins
3136780	3142940	Or jack-o-willingke because they're whole or rich role, you know, these are all mutual friends of ours, obviously
3143100	3148860	And it's like the the the thing that's kind of calling from nature to people when they hear this and they find it so attractive
3148940	3151260	It's like, yeah, yeah, man. I need more pain
3151660	3157340	I need more pain in my life because then my life will be sweeter and yet they're going through life trying to find the
3157340	3159340	Easiest way out. This is a real mystery
3160060	3163500	Actually, it's not, you know the divine path requires struggle
3164140	3169420	And the animal path wants convenience and ease and a complete lack of pain
3169500	3171500	It wants sort of an analgesic existence
3172140	3177340	So one of the things that we do is we try to teach our kids this, you know, when your kids are little you say
3178380	3179900	Don't eat before dinner
3179900	3185580	All parents say this and the and the kid is always like why and you make up a bogus
3186220	3191180	Excuse like it's bad for you. You know, you're not going to get your proper nutrients. It's all nonsense
3191580	3196780	You don't want your kid to eat before dinner because you want your kid to be suffering a little bit of hunger before dinner
3196780	3200220	So they'll enjoy their dinner and be happier. That's what you actually want
3200460	3203420	But you can't quite articulate it and you don't want to tell the kid
3203500	3206460	It's because I want you to suffer you want the kid to suffer
3207180	3210460	And so that's an important thing to keep in mind and that's a real conundrum
3210460	3214060	And the the more that we can understand that the more that we can expose ourselves to
3214540	3216540	Suffering for the right reasons
3216540	3222220	You really should get up before you're ready and while it's still dark. It's best for you to do that
3222780	3225580	You should work out in the morning. It's a good thing to do
3225980	3227660	I mean, I get it not everybody can do that
3227660	3232460	You should do these things that actually hurt and your day will be better and your life will be happier
3232620	3237740	That's the first mystery is you know trying to sort that the second mystery however is bigger
3238300	3243580	In satisfaction, which is that mother nature tells us that if we get that thing like that millions
3244380	3250700	YouTube subscriber, you're gonna love that forever. How long did you enjoy that like half an hour five minutes?
3251580	3253980	Yeah, that's pretty good. All right five minutes, right?
3253980	3258140	And but but your brain told you the whole way that when you got that it was going to be awesome
3258620	3262060	You know, so so Mick Jagger saying I can't get no satisfaction. That's wrong
3262620	3265900	You wouldn't try and try and try and try if you couldn't get no satisfaction
3266220	3268220	You can't keep no satisfaction
3268700	3271740	That's the real problem and you try and you try and you try and that's what
3272220	3274860	The reason for that is what neuroscientists call homeostasis
3275340	3281420	Which of course you know about and homeostasis is the tendency of any physiological system to go back to its baseline
3281580	3287180	So you're ready for the next set of circumstances. It's true for your emotions. It's awesome. It's awesome
3287500	3291820	Forget it. I got to go back so that I'm not distracted from then so I can stay in the hunt
3292380	3295180	Is what it comes down to otherwise I'd start to death after I got food
3295260	3298620	You know be like I was good enough and then you die and you don't want that
3299180	3305260	So that's the key thing and we the mystery is that really smart sophisticated people never figure that out
3305580	3309900	And they conclude that they just didn't have enough and this gets back to your success problem
3310380	3316220	This gets back to the success conundrum. It's like, yeah, I got that thing, but I'm still not satisfied
3316460	3320620	So I guess I needed five million. I guess I needed 50 million
3321180	3325020	The first thing that a billionaire concludes is that he needed another billion
3325420	3330460	Have you seen have you seen that study where when pretty much anybody is asked
3331100	3333660	What level of wealth would you be satisfied with?
3334140	3337260	It doesn't matter what level of wealth you're at. It tends to be almost
3337900	3342780	Exactly three times your current income. It's like at about three times where I'm at now
3343500	3347260	That's that's my sort of settling point, but it scales all the way up to a billion
3347820	3351660	Yeah, yeah, there are different studies that one of the studies. I mean some studies say is 40 percent
3351820	3354540	Some studies say is 300 percent the bottom line is more
3355260	3360780	Because that's what your brain is telling you that the secret to satisfaction that endures is more
3361580	3367260	More what more money more power more pleasure more honor more instagram followers more sexual partners more more
3368060	3371820	And and the problem with that is that it doesn't recognize that there's
3372460	3379020	A divine version of that that actually works. There's a what I did it again. I keep getting these weird effects on my camera
3380060	3382060	That there is a way to hack this
3382620	3386860	This this neuro physiological matrix this evolutionary matrix
3387260	3391580	And the way to think about this so that you're not subject to this you can be free forever, by the way
3392140	3397740	Is by remembering the satisfaction that endures is actually a function of all the things you have
3398300	3400300	Divided by the things that you want
3400940	3403340	haves divided by wants is the right
3403980	3408380	Mental model for you to pursue and that means of course you have a have more strategy
3408460	3411420	Of course you do you also need a want less strategy
3411820	3415100	You need to manage your wants just as much as you need to manage your haves
3415100	3418620	I realize that's very Buddhist, but it's actually in every spiritual and philosophical tradition
3419100	3423820	And so the way that I do that the couple of ways to do that one one way to think about that is to think about the metaphor
3424540	3430060	The metaphor of success for entrepreneurs is kind of like you're an artist and and you're putting
3431180	3433180	Brushstrokes on a canvas of your life
3433660	3438460	The right metaphor is is at some point in your life at least is actually the sculptor
3439020	3446380	Where you're chipping away the jade or the marble to find the true work of art within and that means getting rid of the detritus
3446860	3450380	The part of the block of marble that's not the horse or the rider
3450860	3455500	So that you can find the horse and rider inside and one way to do that that I often do
3456220	3461340	Is like I used to have a bucket list everybody who listens to this podcast those little bucket lists
3461420	3463420	I have a reverse bucket list now
3463660	3469020	Where I take my worldly cravings and desires and ambitions, which I still have I'm turning 60 in two weeks
3469340	3471340	And I still have the these dumb
3472060	3476380	You know at this craven trivial desires. I'm a weak weak man
3477020	3481020	But I'm I actually will write them down on my birthday and I will cross them out
3481740	3482860	Not because I'm not going to get them
3482860	3489580	But because I want the management of those cravings and desires to be in my prefrontal cortex and not in my limbic system
3489900	3497020	Can you give us some examples of of what you cross out? Yeah, so one of the things will be for example these worldly
3497900	3501100	Metrics of success in my particular industry that are trivial
3501420	3505420	So for you, it would be a certain number of of youtube subscribers for me
3505500	3508060	It would be a certain number of
3508780	3510780	sales of my latest book or
3511340	3514460	Or prestige inside the university or whatever it happens to be
3515100	3517100	Now and I realize I know
3517420	3521660	You know, I I authentically know as do you that these things are trivial
3521980	3525900	And yet we we look at them as a marker of our own specialness and our own
3526700	3529420	Sense of accomplishment when I write them down
3529500	3532700	I acknowledge that I have the desire when I cross it out
3532860	3537260	I say I I have the desire, but I will not be attached to this goal
3537900	3542060	That you're you're you're physically negating the attachment from the goal
3542700	3545180	That I mean, of course the attachment on understanding, you know
3545260	3551180	Ducca is that concept to the first noble truth of Buddhism that life is suffering because of ducca because of this
3551500	3555740	Sticky craving for the inadequate things, but it is not saying I'm not going to do that
3555820	3559340	I'm not going to get that it's saying that I'm not going to be attached to that and it's incredible
3559580	3561580	This year on my birthday by the way
3561580	3563740	I got a big one coming man with a zero
3564940	3570380	My attachment that's bothering me right now. I'm going to admit it. I have too many political opinions
3570860	3572540	I really do
3572540	3575660	They're they're weighing me down. They're they're making it harder to have friends
3576460	3581500	Then they should be so I'm going to write down my 10 strongest political opinions and I'm going to cross them out
3582060	3586700	Not that I'm saying that I don't believe these things, but I'm not going to be attached to my rightness
3587660	3590940	That humility is going to set me free and that's a kind of a metaphor
3591340	3593900	Tick not ha on the great vietnamese buddhist monk
3594540	3597820	He wrote that our greatest attachments are to our opinions
3598380	3600780	And that's you know triply true for me right now
3600860	3605580	So man, I I need freedom and and I'm going to get it by by talking about
3606380	3608380	the wants that's just a house
3609100	3610300	that
3610300	3614300	Practice the exercise of writing down the things that you want and then crossing them out
3615020	3619740	Sounds great symbolically. Lovely the writing the physical writing of something lovely
3621020	3625180	Presumably that's not just a master key that downstream from that and yes, I'm still going to have it
3625420	3627420	But where are you going in your mind?
3627500	3634540	Is there a practice which is more repeatable and robust that when your desire to correct somebody about their view on abortion?
3635020	3637020	arises that
3637100	3641100	What where are you going to there to permanently be crossing it out?
3641820	3646220	You know what it does is it makes you remember the attachment in the moment of behavior
3646380	3650940	That's what that thing does. That's what the important thing is because when it's in your prefrontal cortex
3651660	3653260	then it's not
3653260	3658940	Then it's a behavior that is that is manageable in in the executive centers of your brain
3659500	3661500	And so what will you do instead?
3661500	3666700	When somebody sits down next to me and says something that I really just I don't believe about abortion
3667180	3669900	And I think that I think now I have my opportunity
3670300	3672300	Because my prefrontal cortex is managing and I say
3673180	3675180	Tell me why you think that
3675260	3677260	Would you please tell me why you think that?
3677500	3680780	And and you listen to learn it's an extraordinary thing
3680860	3685980	And by the way, you get smarter and you're wrong less often and you get less embarrassed and you lose fewer friends
3686220	3688620	And and when you do that the other person that you're talking to
3689100	3695340	I just gave a long lecture on the on the on the neuroscience of the absorption of messages and political communications
3695340	3696540	that I just get a lecture today
3696540	3701100	And one of the things that you find is the more that you do that the more people think that you're that that you're a
3701100	3704860	Very smart person who makes very good points and that your point of view is actually quite persuasive
3707100	3708540	To shocker how that happens
3708540	3713340	Can you you mentioned earlier on something I've heard you talk about before to do with the common idols?
3713820	3717340	That uh, people kind of get waylaid by can you just go through this?
3717980	3723260	Yeah, that was we mentioned that just a minute ago. That was the Aquinas four idols money power pleasure fame
3723980	3728220	money power pleasure fame now Aquinas asserted this is 1265 you didn't have data
3729260	3732140	But man he was the best and Aquinas said
3732860	3738460	That everybody falls prey to one of these things more than anything else that this is an exhaustive list
3739180	3742940	Of the things we care about the most now money is pretty obvious money or wealth it or you know
3743340	3744940	financial resources
3744940	3750780	Anything that actually allows you to buy stuff and shows that you're a very important person, you know that these markers these
3751740	3753900	um medium of exchange and store of value
3754460	3761180	The second is pleasure we've talked about and or power power is is the ability to control the behavior of others
3761260	3765900	And the last is actually a really kind of a you know a lot of people listening to us are like I don't care about fame
3765980	3768460	You know, I don't want to be instagram famous, but that's not it
3769020	3772460	It's really the prestige and the admiration of the right people
3772860	3776460	I mean if you can be completely screwed up if you were on the disney channel as a kid
3776860	3783740	And what you want is the admiration of strangers and they're literally people's brains who are wired like that because they got famous before they were
3784460	3789180	While their brain was still in formation and they'll be like somebody who got addicted to methamphetamine as a 14 year old
3789260	3791900	They'll they'll never be normal is what we actually know
3792620	3799500	But but most aren't like that, but they still want to be considered somebody for the people whose whose opinions actually matter
3800300	3803180	Those are the four idols and I play a game with my students
3803820	3806620	What's my idol because once you know your idol
3807100	3810940	You can actually control your behavior and manage yourself in a much more effective way
3810940	3813580	You have to know your weakness is the way that this works out and a lot of people
3813580	3816940	It actually don't so do you want to play the game chris hit me you want to play?
3816940	3819500	What's my idol? Okay. I'm right the way to play
3819740	3824540	What's my idol is not for me to say what which of the four really controls you
3824940	3829340	Is to say which of the four do you not care about and start eliminating them?
3829740	3834460	Because then we're going to wind up on the one that's really harder for you. So money
3835180	3836220	power
3836220	3837580	pleasure
3837580	3838860	honor
3838860	3841900	You got to give away one. Which one are you going to give away power?
3842620	3844380	how come
3844380	3846220	I
3846220	3850220	Don't notice in myself a desire to really accumulate power of any kind
3850860	3853260	Okay, so I'm going to make a prediction about you
3853980	3856620	You hate it when people have power over you. Oh, yeah
3857420	3858700	That's it
3858700	3864060	People who hate having people having power over them are averse to having power over other people as well
3864860	3868940	You're a non hierarchical person. You're a non hierarchical guy, right?
3869180	3873180	Yeah, the the org structure of the business would suggest that as well. Yeah
3873500	3877340	Yeah, that's it's and that's almost always the case. Okay. Good. So now we've got money
3878060	3879100	pleasure
3879100	3881660	And fame or honor or prestige average
3882220	3884940	You got to give another one away and it's harder now. What are you going to give away next?
3885740	3887740	Uh money
3888300	3890300	Money how come
3891180	3894140	One of the of all of the different mental pathologies that I have
3895180	3897180	materialism
3897180	3899180	a desire for sort of
3899260	3905100	Flashness in terms of possessions is just not something that I have. I have a degree of scarcity mindset
3906380	3907660	which
3907660	3913660	A abundance kind of ameliorates, but for me, it's just it's it's not something that I really think about very much
3914140	3916140	Did you grow up with nice things?
3916700	3921900	We were like lower working class. I think okay lower middle class kind of like lower working class
3922300	3926220	Oh lower working class. Okay. Like my wife grew up in Barcelona. So it was you know
3926460	3930460	Sometimes you paid the light bill and sometimes you didn't pay the light bill. Okay. You didn't grow up with nice things
3931180	3933260	This might be the case now when it comes to this
3933580	3940620	There's a very interesting set of sociological theories that you can never be actually comfortable more than one and a half classes
3940780	3942780	Above that in which you were a child
3943340	3946780	So if you were if you were kind of lower working class that means that
3947340	3952700	The tastes above upper middle class are going to be like that stuff is boring, man
3953260	3958300	That's that it's like you want me to collect art. Why would I spend my time collecting art?
3958300	3961740	I want to talk about stuff and ideas and things that actually excite me
3962060	3963340	And so that might be part of it
3963340	3967500	But also you've had a pretty a pretty I mean at age 36
3968060	3971660	You've had economic success beyond your wildest dreams, right?
3971900	3976780	And you probably figured out that there's not that much stuff that you can buy. That's really that fun
3977580	3978940	all right
3979020	3984460	As soon as you as soon as you can fly business class and not have to think about the cost of a coffee
3985260	3989660	Most stuff downstream from that. I mean, you know, there'll be some things once I get a family
3989820	3993580	There'll be I think that you kind of transcend your own desires in that way
3993660	3997420	And it's more to do with providing for the kids and so on and so forth
3998540	4000540	But yeah, you know
4001820	4003820	I'm very very glad of that and I think
4004540	4006540	Lots of people
4006860	4013020	Don't realize that they're kind of blessed by having no or a limited materialism set point
4013580	4019340	That like if you look at how much money you need in order to be happy with the worldly possessions that you have
4019420	4021980	With the degree of keeping up with the Joneses that you're motivated by
4022380	4028220	With the shows of affection and love and and gifting that you need to do to other people or that you need from other people in order to feel loved
4028940	4030540	If you don't have that
4030620	4036220	That's basically like you needing you being a much more efficient system financially
4036460	4039820	Like there is somebody else out there who needs 10 times your salary
4040380	4044140	To get the same level of satisfaction out of life. So I
4045260	4046940	Reframed that probably about
4046940	4054700	Five years ago and just it's one of the things that I'm I genuinely feel blessed about whether that's from genes or or environment
4054860	4058220	I'm like, I don't need it and it's by the way, it's great
4058860	4062700	But it's not a super virtue because we haven't gotten your idol yet
4063100	4065740	We're getting that don't worry don't worry and we are getting back down to us soon
4065980	4069660	And what you find is that there are certain there are certain guys who are way
4069740	4072220	I mean, they they they they objectify themselves
4072860	4079500	With their relationship to money in the same way that women often do for the same reasons evolutionarily and and they're in their physical appearance
4079980	4083580	Why because this is going to predict your you know, sort of as a as a
4083900	4087500	Predictor of your success in mating markets despite the fact that you're not even in mating markets
4087740	4092700	So a lot of that's primordial and has to do with you know, what the idol is for all kinds of reasons that we could talk about
4092700	4093260	Okay
4093260	4098380	Now it's getting uncomfortable because there's two left and you've already through process of elimination told me that these are the
4098380	4101500	Things that you care about. Okay. So number one
4102220	4106460	um, you know, let's let's put these in order because you got to get rid of one of these pleasure
4107580	4110540	An honor you got to get one you got to get rid of one
4111420	4113420	Pleasure can go
4113820	4115820	You like pleasure, don't you but
4115820	4117820	But now I know what you're really like
4117820	4119820	I found out what you really want Chris
4119820	4125020	It's not a surprise to anybody my desire for prestige to be recognized and validated by the world
4125580	4130620	I yeah, I know I know because you're doing this you're doing you're doing something you're performing in public
4130940	4135660	And most people who are you know, straw you're in a strong extrovert clearly you have openness to experience
4135740	4139820	You have an agreeable nature. You're probably not highly neurotic
4139980	4144780	You've got all the things that actually go into somebody surprised if you if you if you do a big five on me
4145100	4146780	Uh, I come in
4146780	4149260	Uh, neuroticism is uh moderate
4149820	4150860	Uh
4150860	4154220	Get most of my energy from being on my own. I'm an only child
4154780	4157740	Uh, I choose to work on my own. So, you know that
4158860	4166540	Turn it on turn it off thing. Um, it's definitely there. But yeah, I I'm glad that I've managed a lot as a an extroverted
4166540	4170540	Loan neuroticism person, but uh, I fear that the source code may be slightly different
4170860	4173660	It might be it might be and you know, you don't know until you know
4174140	4177420	And and you know, there are people who present in a particular way and have a
4177900	4182300	Habitat that's quite different because they've been able to they're so good at getting along in society
4182540	4185980	But what we do know now is what your weakness is going to be
4186220	4191100	So five years from now, I predict you're going to be married and the argument you're going to be having with your wife
4191580	4196140	Is because you're going to be doing something that's going to bring you new heights of success
4196780	4200620	And your wife is and and then you're going to have this argument with your wife who's going to say
4201740	4204300	I don't want you to I want you to be around more chris
4205020	4208940	And you're going to say yeah, but you love all the great things that this lifestyle brings
4209020	4213020	And then you're mad at me for doing the things that it takes and she said I'll take you
4213980	4217500	I mean, I'm going to accept those things that don't have you but I'd prefer to have you
4217900	4221260	That's what I predict is the argument that you're going to actually have with your wife because
4221980	4223820	You love success
4223820	4228140	You love success. It feels good. That's the thing that actually and what do I mean by it feels good
4228540	4231740	That means it gives there's a lot of dopamine that comes from success
4231820	4235420	Which gives you anticipation of reward and when you get the success
4235500	4240620	It taps the ventral tegmental area of the chris brain, which gives you this little burst of joy
4241340	4246620	That's what's happening when this one these weird things these markers of success actually happen and those things happen to be
4247660	4250140	That centering around the admiration of other people
4250540	4255180	That you got to keep your eye on because all the mistakes you make in your life that you look back on with regret
4255180	4257180	Are going to be because you follow that particular idol
4258460	4261420	Meaning final holsman of the apocalypse
4263020	4265020	Yeah, so
4265260	4267260	This is the most important meaning
4267900	4271900	I can go because I'm very disciplined. I can go a long time without
4272780	4275420	Enjoyment and I can go a long time without satisfaction
4275820	4278220	But I can't go 10 minutes without meaning and be a happy person
4278300	4280700	And this is the biggest problem that we have among young adults today
4281260	4285260	I have all kinds of tests that I give people to see whether or not they have a proper sense of meaning in their life
4285260	4287500	And I'm not judgmental about what that meaning is going to be
4288220	4290460	But I do know I can tell people
4291180	4295900	When they have a crisis of meaning and this is the biggest predictor of unhappiness for people in their 20s today
4295900	4301340	Now most people in their 20s are actually not in the in the active pursuit of meaning
4301420	4306540	Whereas in about 1960 most people were in an active pursuit of meaning
4307020	4311820	That's a big generate a set of generational differences that we have and it's a big one of the big
4312380	4315100	The biggest explanations for the things that we talked about earlier
4315100	4318860	Which is the degradation of of general societal happiness and particularly among the young
4319340	4323660	So meaning is actually kind of a combination of three things. It's coherence
4324300	4326300	Why things happen the way they do you have to have a
4327020	4331900	A theory of the case about why things happen. It doesn't mean it has to be right or it has to be mine
4332060	4336940	But you have to like this is why things happen yours tends to be very scientific about why things happen
4337900	4344140	Second you have to have a sense of purpose purpose and meaning are not synonymous purpose is a subset of meaning
4344780	4350700	That is direction and goals purpose is i'm going in a particular direction towards specific things
4351260	4352940	That's what it comes down to
4353020	4356620	And significance is the belief that your life matters
4357740	4359740	So it's it's coherence
4359740	4361340	Purpose and significance
4361340	4364620	Now there's a test that I give my students and by the way that I give my children
4364700	4367820	My kids are younger than you my kids are in the all three of my kids are in the 20s
4368300	4371260	And all three of my kids had to answer these questions
4371420	4374940	I made them write a business plan when they were when they were coming out of high school
4375580	4379340	You know, which is like a business plan for the enterprise of their lives for the next five years
4379500	4381500	I'm a b-school professor. I can do this
4381660	4385260	And uh, and I'm the venture capitalist. So, you know, I deserve a business plan
4385980	4391260	And and the point was what are you going to do to find the answers to two questions the two meaning questions?
4391740	4393500	Why are you alive?
4393500	4396460	And for what are you willing to give your life joyfully at this hour?
4397260	4400860	You need answers to those questions. You need to be alive for a reason
4401340	4404700	And you need to be willing to stop being alive for a reason
4405340	4407340	those are the meaning questions so
4408620	4411020	What are your answers? Why do you believe you're alive?
4411660	4413260	Why are you on earth?
4413260	4416300	A sperm and an egg is not the right answer and a stork isn't either
4418220	4419660	I think
4419660	4422380	The thing that I often come back to when I ask myself this question is
4423180	4428060	Uh to understand myself and the world around me. I get so much
4429820	4431820	Joy, I'm at my best when
4432620	4438060	I'm learning about things and engaging with ideas downstream from that
4438060	4441180	I can teach you to other people and do all of the rest of the stuff, but um
4441820	4446860	Maybe I'm revealing my sort of only child bona fides here, but so much of it is just
4447580	4450700	me understanding myself and the world around me like that's
4451980	4455020	It's been the single lineage trajectory throughout
4455740	4457740	All of the good things that I've done
4457740	4461980	Yeah, no, and and you just told me what you want to do with this life that you have
4462460	4466960	What you enjoy the most where you find the greatest productivity, but this is a little bit different
4467900	4470940	Why do you think that you were placed on this earth?
4471580	4474620	What is the purpose for which you were placed on this earth?
4475820	4480060	Now if if you're a radical materialist, you might say it's just all random, man
4480620	4485260	I wasn't I wasn't nobody down. Yeah. Yeah for sure. But my guess is you don't believe that
4485900	4488780	Why why did the universe create Chris Williamson?
4490700	4494860	I think to find and talk about good ideas that seems to be the thing that comes to me
4495500	4499260	You want to serve others? You just told me why why do you want to talk about things?
4499260	4503020	Otherwise, you wouldn't bother we wouldn't be having we're having a conversation in public
4503900	4509820	Why because we want people to listen to it and it might just be completely venal on your on my part because by the way
4510220	4515500	My idols map exactly onto yours. I'm the 60 year old version of you. Sorry
4516060	4518060	I know I know it's like maybe you'll you'll still have hair
4520300	4522700	If you're lucky, but but okay
4523740	4529020	If it's purely venal, that's just not good and that's a that's that's a bad answer to the question
4529020	4532220	but if it really is I want to serve the world by
4532940	4534940	uncovering its mysteries
4535100	4539580	And in so doing people will be able to lead better informed better lives
4540460	4542460	In other words, you were created to serve
4542620	4544620	In a certain way solid
4545020	4546780	now it gets harder
4546780	4550060	For what would you give your life joyfully at this at this hour?
4550380	4552380	Mom dad and
4553340	4556220	Like perhaps a golden retriever that's younger than five years old
4557100	4560940	Would you really give your life for your mom and dad? Yeah
4562220	4568540	You would die for them despite the fact that they're significantly older. Yeah. I mean, they would they would be I would be in a lot of trouble
4569660	4571900	But it's something that I would be prepared to do
4572620	4577260	There would absolutely as with almost anything I've ever had to do with them. There would be a very long portrayal
4577340	4581180	Negotiation, which would all of us would be dead before that was finished. So it might be a moot question
4581740	4585900	It's a hard one and it's a especially hard question for young adults who don't have children yet
4586140	4588140	It's a really hard one, right?
4588140	4592300	Where are we getting that deepest sense of meaning from what is that that we've transcended ourselves with?
4592300	4596380	You're like, you know, you know from the utilitarian perspective when you think
4596380	4599660	Ah, how much longer if mom and dad got left and what do they really want to do?
4599660	4603340	Ah, you know, what do you look at what you can give the world you haven't even passed on the genes yet?
4603580	4609260	Like even from their perspective, they would probably say even fuck you like just don't let especially because I'm an only child
4609260	4613500	Like don't let the bloodline end here. Like god dammit. Like at least, you know, like
4614460	4618620	Come into a cup before you do this so that we can you know, you're some some lady in a turkey base to somewhere
4618620	4623100	I can actually keep this guy. I don't know. But yeah, it's uh, it's difficult one. It's difficult one, man
4623100	4627340	Like to think about for sure. It wouldn't be like it wouldn't be my uh, country of birth
4628140	4630140	and it wouldn't be my uh
4630220	4631740	country of birth
4631740	4636700	And it wouldn't be my uh new country of adoption. It wouldn't be the faith that I don't have
4637260	4638940	uh, it wouldn't be the
4638940	4640940	sports team that I
4640940	4642940	barely keep up to date with
4643980	4646460	What's your sports team by the way texas rangers?
4647420	4650140	Really? Oh, yeah, I'm a bar. I'm a barsa man
4651020	4653020	the um
4653180	4659980	Well, we both we've both swapped sports. I've followed an mlb team and you've followed a like Spanish football team
4660380	4663420	I I married a catalan. There's no other way. There's no other way to
4664540	4667340	Keep family harmony. Well, do you have a best friend?
4668300	4671100	Yeah, would you would you would you die for him?
4673740	4676620	I definitely consider it. I bet you would
4679020	4681020	He's younger than me
4681660	4685660	The utilitarian and you again. Yeah, I fucking just can't get out can't get out the front of my brain
4686060	4690860	But this is the point this is that this is the introspection that's required to actually find a full sense of meaning
4690940	4695580	This is worth going away for five days on a silent retreat and thinking about these questions
4696060	4701820	And it's funny because you know, my adult kids have come to very different revelations about this because I push them push them push them push them
4701820	4705980	I have a I have a son who's a sniper. I have a son who's a marine sniper
4706700	4710140	Um, and he just got out of the Marine Corps now. He's he's he's in the reserves
4710140	4714780	But he was active duty for four years as a marine sniper. This is a this is a scary job, man
4715740	4721980	For me as his father and he went in as a knucklehead, you know, and he came out at 23 married
4722460	4724700	He's now five months out. His wife is pregnant
4725500	4727100	Um, and here's his answers
4727100	4732860	I mean because he found his answers by by actually putting his life in danger and doing all these really like wicked things
4733420	4734940	um
4734940	4740380	My I was created because god made me to serve other people. You know, he believes that these are not the right answers
4740380	4746700	These are his answers. Um, I would joyfully die for my faith and for my family and for my fellow marines
4746700	4751100	And for the united states of america and our allies chris. So this is
4752540	4753740	This is
4753740	4761180	Solid stuff and and he's i'm telling you he he actually has called me I screamed his call because he called while we were talking
4761820	4768940	Sorry sniper. Don't don't shoot me through the window. There's carlos. He's the best and he's six foot five and he's you know covered in tats
4769660	4771420	and um, he's
4771420	4773660	He's happy because he has these answers to these questions
4773660	4777980	But he did the work is really what it comes down to and this is what I recommend to a lot of people who feel
4778460	4782140	That little bit of hollowness that slight bit of deadness within
4782700	4787180	Where things that i'm doing every day, you know, it's like, I don't know I don't want to stand in this line
4787260	4792700	What's the meaning of me actually drive sitting in traffic and doing this when you have the answers to those questions?
4793100	4796860	There's a why for even the most trivial things that you're doing in your life
4797020	4800700	And that's a really really beautiful thing if I can do one thing for people
4801100	4806060	It's actually to encourage them to look for the answers to those questions. How can we improve our coherence?
4807820	4811180	So our coherence is the why things happen the way that they do
4812220	4816940	And uh that theory of the case is really tricky, but it gets back to the sense of transcendence
4817500	4822060	If you pursue a strategy of transcendence coherence comes in its wake
4822620	4825980	Even if you can't quite articulate why things happen the way they do
4826220	4829020	You have a sense of why things happen the way that they do
4829500	4832700	If you study dystoic philosophers with the utmost seriousness
4833100	4839820	The understanding of why things happen the way they do even if they're random and even if they're unfair becomes acceptable to you
4839980	4843500	And that acceptance of that is a sense of coherence on its face
4843980	4850940	Maybe you're a complete radically physicalist atheist who denies the utter existence of free will if you study the science
4851500	4857980	With enough seriousness of that you can you can make your peace with a coherence that actually comes from the randomness of the universe
4858060	4859580	my father was a
4859580	4862780	phd biostatistician he was the smartest guy ever met
4863580	4865020	and um
4865020	4869020	He said when he was dying of cancer when he was more he was just a little bit older than me
4869820	4871820	and I said it's just
4872220	4875180	Sucks it's not fair and he said
4876060	4878380	Somebody's gonna be on the left side of the distribution
4881820	4883820	Hahaha
4888060	4894140	Spoken spoken like a man that looked at a lot of graphs throughout his career. It's coherence, baby
4895740	4899420	But you can get coherence in a lot of different ways. You just have to do the work
4900220	4902220	To figure out what you believe
4902860	4904860	purpose
4905740	4910620	Purpose to to to create the goals and the directionality of your life
4911660	4914380	Now this is not a sense of attachment a lot of people will say well
4914460	4916380	I'm gonna make my bucket list
4916380	4922060	And I'm gonna earn this and I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna meet this person and I'm gonna you know shake hands with the president
4922140	4928780	I don't know whatever the dumb thing is that people are really into that's not it the buddhist talk about intentionality without attachment
4929660	4935100	Now there's a there's a the way to think about purpose. There's a do you speak Spanish right chris? No
4935740	4939580	Okay, there's a word in Spanish. It's a very evocative word is rumbo
4940060	4946460	Which in in English is it's not common. It's called rum line rhum rum line. It's a navigational term
4946700	4948700	That's the straight line
4948860	4951660	That goes from where you are to where you want to wind up
4952220	4958140	To do navigation properly you need a rum line rumbo is actually used in Spanish in the vernacular to say
4958380	4961660	This is your directionality. This is to figure out your purpose in life
4962060	4967820	What you need to figure out is where you think it would be good to end up to have a straight line to get there
4968060	4973180	And then have a complete utter lack of attachment on whether or not you're sitting on that rum line
4974140	4978380	That turns out to be the way to understand purpose. That's intention without attachment
4978780	4980620	Of course, I'm going to lay out the things that I want to do
4980780	4983100	Of course, I'm going to and I am completely
4984140	4988860	Flexible if life takes me in another direction for something that actually meets my moral
4989340	4995020	Metaphysical my love goals in a better way. That's the way to actually be thinking about purpose
4995900	4996860	if
4996860	4999180	Suffering and difficulty are so important to meaning
5000060	5002300	How do you advise new parents who are
5003100	5005100	Successful because of the challenges in their past
5005420	5007420	But now have more resources
5007580	5011740	To make life easier for their kids than their parents did when they were growing up
5012060	5017020	That by using the things that they've worked for they may rob their children of the very challenges that would make them happy
5017580	5020860	Yeah, guilty by the way guilty guilty is charged
5021580	5024140	You know, I'd say it's a the greatest
5024780	5028460	Privilege is feeling like you've had a lot of success and you earned it
5029100	5031100	That's an incredible privilege
5031100	5037100	The greatest I mean the the the worst thing you can do for your children is making them wonder whether or not they earned their success
5037500	5039900	Like did I did it was a me or is it my dad?
5040460	5045580	You know, was somebody kicking down the door for me. Am I a baby nebo? I mean what what what right?
5045660	5048940	That's a real problem and a lot of that has to do with the fact that that we're
5049500	5053900	We're simply trying to make it so that the difficulties are cleared away exactly as you say
5054140	5056300	This leads to a lot of problems that we see today
5057020	5060460	Safetyism, you know, the fact that we're we're completely
5060940	5067100	Freaked out about a lot of difficulties that don't exist and we're and we're inured to the problems that really do exist
5067100	5070380	So we don't let our kids walk to the store, but we give them, you know
5071100	5074460	As you know unlimited access to smartphones and social media
5074940	5080540	at age 13 and like predators and creeps and god forbid politicians and you know
5081580	5088460	Dictators on tiktok. Yeah, our are climbing out of the screen and into their brains and you know and and and
5088940	5093340	Destroying their sense of self-worth and and creating social comparison and all these deleterious things
5094300	5098060	What we need to do is to set our kids up to do really hard things
5098780	5102940	And and and it's telling them that it's okay if they fail
5103740	5107820	Not because what we tell them when we're when we're protecting them from everything is that it's not okay to fail
5108220	5113820	And we create a pathological fear of failure, which is a death fear. We're giving our kids a death fear
5114700	5116700	Death all death is
5116860	5119820	Is the death of who you are to you? There's an essence to you
5119820	5122940	So a client would say that your soul is your christness
5123660	5125660	That a dog's soul is this dogginess
5126380	5128060	Each one of us has an essence to us
5128060	5131180	No, we define that essence on the basis of who we see ourselves
5131420	5138060	And if you are never allowed to fail you become the person who doesn't fail and failure becomes a death fear for you
5138220	5140460	Why would you install a death fear on your kids?
5140780	5143580	Well, because you want to keep them safe and that's a terrible thing to do
5143660	5147740	So the way to get beyond that even if you're blessed with tremendous financial resources
5147740	5149740	So they don't have to worry about making rent
5149980	5154540	When they're kids they don't have to worry about getting their caloric needs is you have to say
5154700	5157740	I expect you to be doing difficult things
5158300	5163900	And I don't expect you to succeed all the time if you're not failing enough. You're not doing it, right?
5164060	5167820	That's and and and okay now you're gonna say how do I do that? Okay. Here's how you do it
5168540	5173100	Do it yourself. It does not matter what you tell your kids all that matters is what they see
5173900	5175900	If you want your kids to grow up in the catholic faith
5176540	5181020	Make sure that they see you on your knees on sunday. That's all that matters
5181580	5186540	If you want your kids to do hard things do hard things if you want your kids to deal with failure fail
5187180	5189980	And and have them see you'll see how you fail and that's why
5190540	5194140	these lessons in modern wisdom are important for 60 year olds and 20 year olds and
5194780	5196780	kids
5197100	5199100	Talk to me about the difference between
5199580	5201580	happiness and unhappiness
5202060	5209180	Is unhappiness simply the absence of happiness? Are they different networks the ways to avoid them separately?
5210300	5213420	Happiness is not the opposite opposite of unhappiness on the contrary
5213500	5215980	So the the experience of happiness has a lot to do with
5216460	5221260	But positive emotion and the experience of unhappiness has a lot to do with negative emotion
5221820	5225340	We go through life with different kinds of positive and negative moods
5225340	5229500	And they're largely produced in different with different structures of the limbic system of the brain
5229740	5234780	Because we're reacting to different outside circumstances some of which are opportunities and some of which are threats
5235020	5241500	So it makes perfect sense that that unhappiness is not the absence of happiness. These are different sensations
5241740	5244860	Largely unhappiness is experienced on the right side of the brain
5245420	5250220	And unhappiness on the left side of the brain and we know this because of the musculature of the face when people are experiencing
5250300	5253420	A lot of negative emotion the left side of the face is more active
5253900	5258460	And you can tell you know when somebody's about to cry the left side of their face is more active
5258460	5262300	It twitches a little bit you get when you're when you're married you'll see this
5263980	5265980	And you're like, uh-oh
5266300	5269100	You get like a five second warning. It's just amazing
5269740	5273660	If you you know, it's like it's what it's like if your husband is studies neuroscience
5273820	5280300	So it's important that we understand that because then we can manage both our happiness and our unhappiness and we can see
5281260	5283100	Which is a greater?
5283100	5285100	Which is a greater challenge?
5285180	5291900	Happiness or unhappiness in our lives for me happiness is not the greater challenge for me unhappiness is a greater challenge
5291900	5293900	I have very high negative affect
5294140	5300380	I'm a normal i'm a naturally negative affect person because I fall in this personality characteristic called the mad scientist
5300620	5304380	Which is unusually high positive mood and unusually high negative mood
5304860	5308780	That's important thing for us to understand that that that that you know
5309420	5310860	Which is your challenge?
5310860	5316380	And so I'm spending a lot of my effort managing my unhappiness as opposed to trying to boost my happiness
5316780	5321580	And there are lots of there are terrible ways to do that like drinking alcohol looking at pornography gambling
5322540	5327900	Workaholism the best way to do that by the way is vigorous physical exercise seven days a week
5328060	5330940	And so that's what I do to start my day the first hour of the morning
5331420	5333660	Not because I'm some sort of you know, look
5334380	5336380	vanity doesn't favor me
5336620	5338620	The reason that I do that is because
5339180	5341180	Um, I I want to feel less unhappy
5342300	5348620	So there are different pathways for making people more happy versus making people less unhappy
5349340	5355420	And all of the stuff that we've gone through so far although fantastic and maybe great for refining your happiness level
5355980	5357980	you can still be
5358540	5363900	Pressing the accelerator harder whilst you've still got the brake pushed down if you don't look at these things which cause unhappiness
5363980	5367100	So what are the other biggest strategies beyond?
5367980	5370860	High intensity training that you do seven days a week. What are the
5371740	5373260	highest return
5373260	5375260	Uh tactics that you use
5375260	5377260	Clear away the barriers to your happiness
5377500	5382620	Because one of the sources of unhappiness is not having access to the sources of happiness in your life
5382940	5385740	That's a source of aggravation and frustration
5386380	5393020	So clear away the barriers by by by getting rid of your prejudices against trying to develop your faith or spiritual life
5393980	5399340	Clear away the barriers to the prejudices that you have and and the the difficulties that you have toward family life
5399900	5401100	friendship
5401100	5405260	The the behavior and attitudes that you have toward work, etc. That's really important
5405580	5410060	third and probably for many people the most important is taking seriously the
5410700	5413180	mood disorders that are so common in our society today
5413740	5420700	understanding the essence of what what chronic and and and generalized anxiety is all about in people's lives what
5421180	5427260	What clinical depression actually means and how to treat it because the greatest source of unhappiness and misery for a lot of people
5427260	5427980	It's just
5427980	5429660	Straight on common mood disorders
5429660	5434060	And they can't actually even get to the better things in their lives because of these barriers that are actually coming in the
5434380	5436380	In terms of these sources of unhappiness
5436380	5438380	That's the big ones that i'm talking about
5438700	5439740	general
5439740	5445580	High levels of negative affect that do not go into mood disorder. I strongly recommend physical diet and exercise
5445740	5450380	You know the the kinds of self care that that have a lot of discomfort attached to them
5450860	5456380	Always be thinking about the hygiene of removing barriers to your happiness and taking care of your mental health
5456540	5458540	Those are the best ways to think about it
5459500	5462300	Why do you think it is in the modern world that
5463020	5465500	Anxiety appears to be the most prevalent
5466380	5470220	emotional state that people are in why has that one emotion
5471260	5473260	grabbed a hold of
5473340	5475340	the 21st century so much
5475580	5480540	Anxiety is unfocused fear fear is a natural physiological phenomenon that
5480940	5482940	that comes from
5482940	5487180	A stimulus that that that then lights up the amygdala in the brain passing a
5488460	5491260	A signal through the hypothalamus into the pituitary glands thus
5491820	5497980	Leading to the adrenal glands putting out epinephrine and later on cortisol stress hormones in response to some sort of a threat
5498060	5501900	That should be intense and episodic the problem in modern life
5502380	5507100	Is that that we don't have these intense episodic episodes of fear on the contrary
5507100	5511420	We have we have minor threats that are very diffuse but chronic
5512140	5515820	And that is that leads to an unfocused fear aka anxiety
5515820	5521260	Which is a very slight drip of cortisol going into your brain again and again and again and again
5521420	5523420	And how do you get it by opening up twitter?
5523580	5528140	How do you get it by by being on a you know an overly long zoom call when you need to pee?
5528700	5532380	How do you get it by actually being in a you know a work relationship?
5532460	5539260	That's ridiculously tense that you're not doing anything about modern life is all about not having your life threatened
5539340	5543340	But feeling constantly under a little bit of threat which gives you unfocused fear
5543660	5549180	That leads to a stress response that comes from your adrenal glands and that gives you a tremendous amount of agony
5549500	5551500	That's just spread out and constant
5554780	5556460	I
5556460	5559020	One of the things that you've mentioned that you you said that you have a
5559980	5563900	Disposition toward negative emotional states
5564700	5568780	How much have you found in your practice and also with yourself that people can?
5569740	5571740	Rewrite their childhood and their past history
5572300	5574300	Because I think a lot of people feel
5574780	5581260	Trapped by their past and that they're stuck in their patterns and that you know this all sounds well and good Arthur
5581260	5588700	But really what you're talking about is sort of putting a little bit of icing and some sprinkles on the top of a dog
5588780	5589900	cake
5589900	5594060	You can rewrite your past you can't actually make a different past
5594060	5597260	What you can do is is understand your memories in different ways
5597260	5602380	And it starts with an understanding of how memory actually works in the brain memories are not extant
5602460	5607180	They're reassembled from all different kinds of parts. That's the reason that memory is so unreliable
5607660	5612940	You can remember with incredible vividness what happened on 9 11. I was in new york on 9 11
5613020	5615660	I saw the first plane hit the first tower
5616380	5618780	I mean it was I remember it vividly
5619020	5624940	But but the data show that what I remember vividly is probably not completely accurate because I'm
5625340	5628220	Reassembling that memory so frequently from different literally
5628220	5631340	I mean the different parts of the memory are stored in different locations in the brain
5631740	5636060	And those will get corrupted just like files will get corrupted in a computer from time to time
5636380	5640780	And one of the ways that will get corrupted is because of the biases that I have in my ordinary life
5641340	5644940	This is the reason that you and your sister I realize you don't have a sister
5644940	5649020	But if you had a sister you and your sister could be looking back to a Thanksgiving 15 years ago
5649020	5651100	Which I realized you didn't have and have because you're british
5651580	5657900	But and and one of you could say oh that Thanksgiving with uncle mark and aunt betty
5658220	5662460	It was so great and your sister was like wasn't that the wasn't that the one where uncle mark
5663180	5668060	Got you know blind drunk and and then beat up the neighbor and passed out in the front yard
5668940	5670940	That was terrible that year
5671020	5676140	You're both right, but you're assembling the memories from different places with biases and emphases
5676620	5681340	Placed in different parts of the memory with different corruptions that have happened across the decades
5681980	5686540	That's a really important thing because you can reassemble your memories in different ways
5687420	5693100	By by helping people to emphasize the parts of the experiences in your past that were positive and not just negative
5693340	5695340	Some people are retrospectively
5695340	5697180	unbelievably negative
5697180	5702060	And and that has everything to do with the way that they've stored and are reassembling their memories
5702700	5704700	And and you don't have to do that
5704780	5709260	You can actually choose to look back on the parts of your childhood that actually were sweet
5709340	5713360	And the more that you do that the better you'll get at doing that and the more that you'll naturally
5713500	5717340	Reassemble those memories in ways that favor you more and you're not wrong
5717820	5723180	You're just looking at different parts of the experience and repairing the you know the memory the memory assembly process
5723740	5729100	Yeah, I love that. What about the role of envy another emotion that's very prevalent in the modern world?
5729420	5731420	What what is that to say about envy?
5731420	5735980	It's evolved and the reason is because we live in a hierarchical kin based species
5736620	5739660	We actually were tropical. We're a tropical species
5740540	5746220	Evolved to live in kin groups that are hierarchical now some of that we can get beyond like, you know
5746220	5750140	We invented coats so we don't have to live in really hot places anymore
5750620	5754060	But some of it we haven't gotten beyond we're still kin based and we are still
5754540	5760780	Very hierarchical and the way that you you tend to see your likelihood of survival and gene propagation
5761020	5766540	Is rising in the hierarchy and the way that you know that you're rising in the hierarchy is paying attention to people who have more than you
5767180	5771340	And wanting what people have who have more than you a k a n b now
5771980	5776460	That's a big I mean, that's a that's a survival tendency in in the Pleistocene
5776540	5782220	But it's a it's maladapted to the to the modern world and it's exacerbated by the technological
5782860	5788620	Innovations that we've had such that we're aware of the hierarchy of the entire human race all the time
5789180	5790300	on social media
5790300	5793980	The biggest problem that we have is you don't feel envious of you know, the loser
5794460	5797660	You know down the street from you who has a slightly different
5798300	5801900	You know rv up on blocks in his yard compared to yours
5802380	5803900	you envy
5803900	5809500	The Kardashians, which is completely absurd you have you you envy somebody who's got
5810060	5814460	You know all the wealth in the world you envy a billionaire despite the fact that you've never met one in person
5814700	5819020	So that's the biggest problem that we've taken an evolutionary tendency and we've blown it up with tech
5819180	5822300	With our technological means and turned it into an actual form of mental illness
5823340	5829820	That means that we have to take it on on his face and use our prefrontal cortex to combat these limbic tendencies that are ruining your lives
5830380	5832060	That's a lot of what I talk about
5832060	5837420	You mean making sure that you're you're you're consciously not comparing yourself to people outside your group
5837980	5843740	To you know to if you need to get rid of the apps and stop paying attention to these rich people
5843900	5847740	Only because you enjoy watching the lifestyles of these rich and famous folks
5848140	5850140	That's an unhealthy thing for you to do
5850700	5853580	A lot of the things that I often talk about to get rid of this as well is to
5854060	5857180	Is is to to separate your envy from from benign
5858060	5863020	From the malicious malicious envy is that you feel envious of people who have something that you don't feel that they've earned
5863660	5869580	Ignore that and pay attention to where you have benign envy where you think that they've done something that's really virtuous
5869900	5871900	And turn your envy into admiration
5872620	5878060	And then you've actually made it into something that's really beneficial that will benefit you and won't make the world worse
5879180	5881180	Yeah, it's so interesting to think about how
5882140	5883260	that
5883260	5885260	very adaptive
5885420	5889900	Impulse that we had I need to track my place within the hierarchy, but you know
5890700	5895180	That was 150 people if that it was probably actually 70 people
5895580	5901580	Probably 30 70 and yeah, just speaking of what we were talking about earlier on when we were discussing the
5903500	5910940	Slot that your intimate partner takes up. I had robin dunbar. He's been on the show twice now. Maybe three times. He's so
5911660	5916060	Fantastic the first time I ever recorded with him. It was I think 8 p.m. On a Friday
5916620	5923420	Evening in the uk 2 p.m. Here in austin and he just had a big glass of wine that he slowly worked his way through as he was just
5924380	5925900	unloading
5925900	5929100	evolutionary psychology social psychology insights, but
5930300	5934460	One of the you know, you've got this sort of small group within maybe a slightly larger tribe
5934780	5938380	And you can track your place within that hierarchy relatively easily
5938460	5943900	But if envy is the only one of the seven deadly sins that doesn't feel good, which is kind of an interesting insight
5944460	5947820	Not even fun. Not even fun. Not even fun to do it. Um
5949500	5953980	You have essentially an unlimited way that an envious mind can find to
5954460	5958140	Subjugate you below someone else. Well, yeah, sure
5958380	5959580	I've got more money than them
5959580	5963980	But they seem to be a little bit better educated than me or their wife slightly hotter or they drive a faster car
5964300	5967420	Or you know, they seem to be a bit more muscular or or whatever like, you know
5967500	5970700	There's a million different ways that you can do this with now
5971500	5973500	essentially an unlimited global
5973900	5976940	Marketplace hierarchy within which you can compare yourself
5977580	5980780	Yeah, this is one of the reasons that men have now become orthorexic
5981420	5983580	You know that men men are now weirdly
5984220	5984940	um
5984940	5991100	Comparing their biceps men my age are paying attention to you know, the you know, they're
5991660	5996780	Physical prowess by looking at, you know, these youtube channels in ways that we wouldn't have any concept of it
5996780	5998540	They were to live happily
5998540	6001580	But instead they're like, I don't know man. I think I need to go on trt
6002380	6005660	Why because I don't know. I mean, I'm looking at all these other guys. They look great
6005980	6008620	You wouldn't even have a you wouldn't be conscious of this. You'd be, you know
6008780	6011180	Happily living your life in your own silo
6011740	6015980	But this exposure that we have to this massive comparison group is
6016140	6020700	unbelievably unhealthy because you're always doing this hierarchically
6021500	6022700	evolved
6022700	6026620	Thing this tendency this habit that we actually have and you have to combat it on purpose
6026620	6029740	There's no way that you're just going to make it go away by by changing your environment
6030140	6033340	This brings up one key point by the way because of all these things that we're talking about
6033740	6039580	It's very efficient inefficient to try to improve your life by changing the whole outside world
6040300	6043740	It's very inefficient to curate the entire outside world
6044060	6046060	It's efficient to work on it yourself
6046620	6053660	By moving your experiences from your limbic system into your prefrontal cortex aka to be metacognitive. That's why that's what I talk about all the time
6054620	6056460	We've gone through a lot of the big
6056460	6059260	Sexy things I think from your recent thesis
6060220	6061820	Is there anything
6061820	6065180	from your book or from your work and from this kind of domain of work in general
6066140	6067340	that
6067340	6069660	people you wish people paid more attention to
6070140	6074300	Is there something that is seemingly unpopular and sexy but
6074940	6081660	Has more bang for its buck that you wish you could bestow more people to remember it when you when they read stuff that you've put out
6082460	6084460	Yeah, I mean
6085260	6087260	There's a concept that people don't
6087980	6094460	Pay attention to very much because our world is largely been organized over the past 30 years
6095340	6096700	by
6096700	6097900	by
6097900	6099900	technicians engineers and bureaucrats
6100780	6107500	We've actually we've handed the keys in our culture over to people that say that if we can solve a series of complicated problems
6107500	6109500	We'll live in peace and happiness forever
6110540	6116140	That's a completely misguided understanding of the human experience. There's two kinds of problems in life
6116860	6119420	There's complicated problems that engineers solve
6119980	6121980	these are problems that are
6122460	6126300	ferociously hard to solve but once you solve them you can replicate them with effortless ease
6127180	6131740	That's like making a toaster or a jet engine. Those are complicated problems
6132380	6135900	All the problems that we really care about in life are complex problems
6135980	6143500	Which is to say that they're very easy to understand the solution and completely impossible to solve because they're dynamic in nature
6144860	6148940	Your toaster is complicated. Your cat is complicated is complex
6149580	6155580	It's you know what it wants. It's warmth and scratches and a litter box and food
6155740	6157740	But you never know what it's going to do
6157740	6159740	That's why it's interesting
6159740	6163820	Your your marriage is complex, right? It's very complex
6163820	6165900	You know what it means to be happy in your marriage
6165900	6171500	But you can't get there with any amount of stuff and any amount of money and any amount of technology
6172060	6174060	A war is complex
6174540	6179740	I win they lose that's the solution. How do you get there? I don't know a football game. Look, you like sports
6179740	6184380	I like sports. I love barca. I love watching soccer. I love watching spanish premier league soccer
6185180	6188620	You know the best days barca wins, but I don't know that's why I watch
6189100	6192620	Because it's a complex thing the biggest mistake that we make
6193340	6199820	Is thinking and a lot of what we've talked about in this episode comes down to this is thinking that my complex human problems
6199900	6203260	Are going to be solved by external complicated solutions
6203740	6205740	And that's what the world keeps trying to tell me
6206300	6213180	The world says if you take this and you try that and you buy this and you adopt that
6213900	6216700	Then you're finally going to be happy and it's not true
6217420	6219420	It isn't true. Here's the thing about life
6220300	6223660	Life comes down to the complex problems of the heart
6223980	6228940	Which are all about love and you can't solve that with a product you can only
6229740	6232140	You can only live that in real time
6233340	6240460	You want a better life live it in real time be fully alive right now suffer with it experience it
6241020	6245660	That's what you have to do. That's what we had to do two million years ago. And that's what we still have to do today
6246620	6250460	Hell yeah, Arthur Brooks ladies and gentlemen Arthur is been really great
6250460	6257020	I I adore this sort of blend that you have of eastern and western of sort of neuroscience with the mindful with
