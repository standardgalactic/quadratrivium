0	6000	You've spent a lot of time studying history and writing about current events at the moment.
6000	11000	How would you rate your predictive ability given the current state of the world?
11000	17000	Were the things that you foresaw coming or things that you've been particularly surprised by?
17000	22000	Well, nobody gets to predict with 100% accuracy anything because among other things,
22000	26000	all the time things happen that you could never have seen coming.
26000	29000	I could never have seen COVID coming. I just didn't.
29000	32000	So whenever anyone boasts about their predictive capabilities,
32000	34000	I always think you have to deal with a certain amount of humility
34000	39000	because things happen all the time you couldn't see.
39000	43000	You can only see around the bend of the road you're coming to.
43000	46000	You can't see around the corner.
46000	50000	Yeah, I mean, some things I've written about for years,
50000	54000	particularly in my book, The Strange Death of Europe that came out in 2017,
54000	58000	which I think are sadly coming to fruition.
58000	63000	And I say sadly because people think that if you've predicted something and got it right,
63000	64000	you would feel any pleasure.
64000	68000	And that would only be if the thing you were predicting was something you looked forward to.
68000	71000	And what I was predicting was something I was dreading.
71000	78000	And that was the transformation of our country of birth
78000	82000	and many other countries in the West due to demographic change.
82000	86000	And I mean, every day now, pretty much somebody says to me,
86000	88000	gosh, I used to think what you were saying.
88000	91000	The Strange Death of Europe was a bit out there and now I realize you were right.
91000	94000	But it gives me no pleasure for them to say that.
94000	97000	Because I always sort of think, well, if you'd have agreed back then,
97000	100000	some things might not have happened.
100000	105000	But as Mark Stein said, demographics is destiny.
105000	111000	So it's one of the things you can predict with the most ease.
111000	118000	Did you have Victoria's Secrets plan to bring sexy back on your 2023 bingo card?
118000	121000	Why are Victoria's Secrets bringing sexy back?
121000	126000	After experimenting with 300-pound mannequins, plus-sized models, disabled models, trans models,
126000	128000	a male model and a 38-year-old football player,
128000	132000	Victoria's Secrets have made the controversial decision to switch strategy
132000	135000	and start using hot women to model their underwear again.
135000	140000	That makes commercial sense to my mind.
140000	145000	I'm always amazed that advertising executives find it complex, this stuff.
145000	149000	All you need to do is stick sexy guys on stuff and stick sexy girls on stuff
149000	153000	and sell all the merchandisers, which pretty much writes itself.
153000	159000	Yeah, I'm not particularly surprised that if you stick Lizzo in a bikini,
159000	164000	it's not as appealing as a bit of sales merchandise.
164000	167000	But, you know, live and learn, I suppose?
168000	172000	One of my friends owns a very big clothing company
172000	179000	and for a while they tried plus-sized models, mostly for women.
179000	182000	There's not much of a body positivity movement for men.
182000	184000	No, not like a beer gut movement.
184000	187000	The skinny fat revolution.
187000	193000	And he said, we've split tested this into oblivion, big girls don't sell clothes.
193000	197000	So when you see that, when you see a company, you know,
197000	202000	and some are making double plus-sized dildos or whatever,
202000	207000	the company is actively hurting their top line and bottom line
207000	209000	to be able to send the right message.
209000	211000	And that's all well and good.
211000	218000	Up until some shareholder meeting where some 70s year old guy
218000	222000	looks at the far right column of an Excel sheet and goes,
222000	223000	what the fuck's this?
223000	224000	Yes.
224000	226000	And they go, no, you don't understand.
226000	230000	It's this really cool new movement.
230000	231000	It's very progressive.
231000	234000	And he goes, I don't care.
234000	237000	I want more money than we had last year
237000	239000	and this is less money than we had last year.
239000	243000	Yeah, I mean, I suppose it all starts off from a good place
243000	245000	like some or many things.
245000	249000	But look, if you, you might agree that, you know,
249000	252000	it's not a good thing to sell anorexic looking models
252000	253000	to young women.
253000	255000	And that's, yeah, okay, let's all agree on that.
255000	259000	But you can, you can stop somewhere before morbidly obese.
259000	261000	You know, that's where the whole thing goes wrong
261000	262000	with body positivity thing.
262000	265000	Plus there's a place where the body positivity shouldn't occur.
265000	268000	It should be, I mean, if somebody is so morbidly obese
268000	270000	that they're at significant risk of heart failure,
270000	271000	you shouldn't celebrate them.
271000	274000	You should say, hang on a minute, steady on the donuts.
274000	275000	But they don't say that.
275000	278000	They just, they run all the way.
278000	281000	I wish that you could just have sort of healthy looking women
281000	284000	on the ads and just draw the line there.
284000	287000	But as ever, they sort of don't know where the line is
287000	289000	until you just say something wrenches them back.
289000	291000	And I think wrenches them back is normally,
291000	293000	as you say, the bottom line.
293000	296000	Yeah, I have been thinking about this sort of performative
296000	298000	empathy point for a while.
298000	300000	Got this idea, I need to meme it better.
300000	304000	But I think something like short term empathy
304000	307000	or the shallow pond of empathy, I've been thinking about
308000	311000	what is most popular in culture at the moment
311000	315000	is something that optimizes for its immediacy
315000	318000	to signal that you are a good guy or good girl.
318000	319000	Right.
319000	323000	Even if that's at the expense of the ultimate outcome
323000	324000	for the person.
324000	328000	So let's say you're able to do something giving the child ice cream.
328000	330000	It may be what it wants right now.
330000	332000	It may be bad for it long term.
332000	335000	But if you're the ice cream promoter for the young children,
335000	337000	you will be seen as a good person.
337000	340000	And if you're the person who's saying, hang on a second,
340000	342000	that's not what you want long term.
342000	344000	Maybe responsibility in Peterson language.
344000	347000	Maybe not casual sex in Louise Perry language.
347000	351000	Maybe not as much food as you want in body positivity language.
351000	356000	You're seen as bigoted or judgmental or whatever.
356000	359000	Because there's no countervailing force in the culture.
359000	363000	The unlimited empathy, people have run a long way very fast
363000	366000	because as you say, there's a short term gain to be seen
366000	367000	to be being empathetic.
367000	369000	Let's celebrate yourself.
369000	372000	But ordinarily you would have some other counterforce in the society
372000	375000	and different forces have provided that in history,
375000	376000	including the church.
376000	380000	But if there is no counterforce to say, for instance,
380000	384000	long term gratification, better than short term or whatever,
384000	386000	then yeah.
386000	389000	And that's a sort of unappealing position in our society now.
389000	391000	There's plenty of room for people to be in that space.
391000	394000	But you're still on the defensive.
394000	399000	We're still in a society where effectively to own an ice cream truck
399000	402000	in the sort of language of a child would seem to be a great thing
402000	404000	to have the short term thing.
406000	407000	Yeah.
407000	408000	Not many people want that role.
408000	410000	It's sort of uncool in some way.
410000	412000	It might become cool at some point in the future
412000	415000	when more people realize that the short term gratification thing
415000	418000	was leading to diabetes or whatever.
418000	420000	It's the same as one of the justifications, I think,
420000	422000	for why people aren't having children,
422000	426000	that upfront children, you just see a very, very large cost
426000	428000	on all of the joy and stuff.
428000	432000	What the economists put it is that the child tax,
432000	436000	the amount of money you have less if you have a child,
436000	440000	weird way around to look at the future of the species, isn't it?
440000	444000	If only I died with more money in my bank account.
444000	446000	Life of regret.
447000	449000	Death of regret, perhaps.
449000	455000	Well, it's kind of the, as well, the Mexican fisherman story.
455000	456000	Are you familiar with that?
456000	457000	The parable of the Mexican fisherman?
457000	458000	No, I don't think I am.
458000	459000	This is cool. You'll like this.
459000	464000	So an American businessman goes on holiday to Mexico.
464000	465000	And while he's there.
465000	466000	It's a true story.
466000	468000	It's a parable, though.
468000	469000	Got it.
469000	470000	Fucking hell.
471000	472000	He goes on holiday.
472000	475000	He gets taken out fishing by a local Mexican.
475000	477000	And he asks the Mexican how he spends his time.
477000	480000	The Mexican says, I fish a little on the morning.
480000	481000	I catch enough for my family.
481000	482000	We go back.
482000	483000	We cook.
483000	484000	We laugh around the fire.
484000	485000	And I spend time with my children.
485000	487000	And the American businessman goes, that's stupid.
487000	488000	Here's a better idea.
488000	491000	What you should do is actually spend most of your day fishing.
491000	494000	And then with the surplus fish, you could sell them at the market.
494000	496000	And the Mexican fisherman says, why would I do that?
496000	499000	So, well, once you've got the additional money,
499000	501000	you could start to employ some of your friends.
501000	503000	And they could come out fishing with you, too.
503000	506000	And you could catch more fish, which you could sell at the market for more money.
506000	508000	He says, why would I do that?
508000	509000	He says, well, once you've done that,
509000	511000	you would be able to incorporate an America
511000	513000	and you would maybe be able to start a canning factory
513000	516000	so that you could own the entire production process
516000	518000	and you could then sell the company for a lot of money.
518000	520000	He said, why would I do that?
520000	522000	He said, because once you've done that,
522000	524000	you'd be able to fish a little on the morning
524000	527000	and then go back and spend time with your children around the fire.
527000	528000	Very good.
528000	532000	And I often think about that as a much more direct route to happiness.
533000	534000	You know?
534000	535000	Yeah.
535000	539000	Well, that's the classic thing that the place you end up
539000	541000	is the place you started from.
541000	544000	There are lots of reasons why people aren't having children.
544000	547000	And a lot of them are simple economic things.
547000	549000	I mean, all of the western countries
549000	552000	that have terrible replacement birth rate figures
552000	556000	are because of very easy things to solve,
556000	558000	like cost of housing and things like that.
558000	560000	It's not hard to build affordable housing.
560000	562000	They've proved to be incapable of doing so.
562000	565000	So young people wanting to both get on the property ladder
565000	568000	and start a family think they have to do either or.
568000	570000	And they're not entirely wrong,
570000	572000	but that's something that governments could have sorted out
572000	573000	and none of them do.
573000	576000	They're so hopeless at it and they have been for years
576000	578000	under consecutive governments.
578000	581000	They never build enough housing so young people don't see a future,
581000	584000	don't feel hopeless and then don't have kids
584000	587000	and then everyone wonders why there's a demographic crisis.
588000	590000	Intergenerational competition theory
590000	592000	is something I learned about a couple of weeks ago.
592000	593000	You familiar with this?
593000	594000	Yeah.
594000	596000	I didn't know about it before, but it makes complete sense.
596000	598000	There was always this talk of millennials
598000	600000	are the first generation to have done worse than their parents.
600000	603000	Well, they're not the first in a while.
603000	605000	First in two generations.
605000	608000	And it seems like millennials actually probably
608000	611000	just about managed to get over on average.
611000	613000	But Gen Z materially,
613000	615000	difficulty in getting on the property ladder,
615000	618000	the most common living arrangement for men under 35
618000	620000	is still at home with their parents.
620000	625000	And yeah, it bakes in this sort of
626000	630000	intergenerational competitiveness
630000	633000	and a dissatisfaction when you look at where your parents were
633000	636000	and this felt sense that your parents got advantages
636000	638000	that you never did.
638000	640000	Which is usually not true.
640000	642000	I mean, they didn't suffer inflation at the same rate.
642000	645000	They suffered very high taxation in the post-war period.
646000	648000	We haven't had taxation as the levels it was at
648000	651000	in the 1960s and 70s, for instance, in the UK.
653000	655000	There was a time when people were top rate
655000	657000	taxpayers were paying 99% tax.
657000	660000	A friend who once in that period paid over 100% tax one year
660000	661000	for reasons he could still lock.
661000	662000	How's that possible?
662000	664000	It will be back tax and that sort of thing.
664000	666000	So, I mean, there's a tendency,
666000	668000	particularly among millennials and after,
668000	670000	to think that their parents had it very easy.
670000	673000	And my experience of people from that generation,
673000	676000	the boomer generation, it didn't feel easy at the time.
676000	680000	And yeah, there were certain things getting on the property
680000	682000	housing ladder was a little bit easier than it is,
682000	684000	or significantly easier.
684000	687000	Once you have, what is it, five times average earnings
687000	693000	being inadequate to get to the average property price,
693000	696000	you see the split go on.
696000	698000	But you always have to factor.
698000	700000	I mean, if you say, you know, the millennial,
700000	702000	the first ones or Gen Z were the first ones
702000	705000	who said whoever to have a better standard of living,
705000	707000	you have to bake in things like,
707000	709000	oh yeah, well, they had a world war, you know.
710000	712000	So, that's quite a big PS.
712000	714000	Well, there's a big footnote.
714000	717000	So, yeah, everyone has their challenges.
717000	720000	I just don't see why once you've identified them
720000	722000	and know the way out of them, you don't do them.
723000	726000	I was talking to mutual friend Eric Weinstein about this.
726000	728000	I also spoke to Sam about this.
728000	730000	I've spoken to a bunch of people.
730000	735000	Why in your opinion do you think everybody struggles
735000	738000	to agree on the truth now?
738000	740000	Oh, that's quite straightforward.
740000	742000	We can't agree on what's happened.
742000	747000	So, broadly speaking, an event happens now
747000	749000	and some people believe it has happened
749000	751000	and other people think it hasn't.
751000	754000	I mean, we've been through a number of deranging years
754000	757000	since we first spoke in which, for instance,
757000	759000	you know, they say there's been a global pandemic
759000	762000	which some people believe was something
762000	764000	which killed millions and millions of people
764000	766000	in their own country and think they were just about saved
766000	768000	from dying themselves.
768000	770000	And other people think it was a fake
770000	772000	and other people think we just massively overreacted
772000	775000	and other people think it was all planned
775000	779000	and nobody agrees what happened.
779000	781000	That's just to take one example.
781000	783000	In America, you have obviously the fact
783000	786000	that nobody agrees who won an election.
786000	787000	That's a problem.
787000	789000	And so you just have basic things.
789000	791000	Nobody can agree on it. It just happened.
791000	793000	I always say in America, you know,
793000	795000	it would be nice if we could just agree
795000	797000	that one thing that's just happened happened
797000	799000	but then nobody wants to.
799000	802000	It says you must be a WF shill if you believe that.
802000	804000	So I think it is the problem.
804000	806000	And then obviously underneath that is just the problem,
806000	808000	the fact that the treadmill of social media
808000	810000	has totally changed the way in which we communicate,
810000	812000	the way in which we learn things, absorb things.
812000	814000	And we don't know what the consequences of that are.
814000	816000	We're so early into it.
818000	820000	And it seems to me that among other things,
820000	822000	it's allowed people to have their own version of recent events,
822000	825000	recent history, past few days.
825000	828000	And so when you sit down to talk to somebody,
828000	830000	you can fairly swiftly work out
830000	832000	whether they're somebody who's open to the idea
832000	834000	of things that happened having happened
834000	837000	or whether or not they will fight you all the way.
837000	840000	And that just makes everything much harder
841000	843000	than it used to be.
843000	845000	And that isn't to sort of particularly pine
845000	847000	for the era of a mono narrative.
847000	849000	If that era ever particularly existed
849000	852000	and you read history, not clear that it did.
852000	855000	But it's just massively worse.
855000	858000	And news is coming at us at such a pace these days.
858000	861000	And it's just like, you know, every day feels like,
861000	865000	you know, a month's worth of news in the past.
865000	868000	Things just fly by you so fast
868000	870000	that you don't even have time to absorb it
870000	872000	before it's happened.
872000	874000	So I think that's part of the reason.
876000	878000	And in any case, the whole concept of truth
878000	880000	as being a desirable thing in the society
880000	883000	seems to have eroded from both the right and the left.
885000	888000	Well, truth, for instance, used to be the basis
888000	891000	for a university education
891000	894000	and the basis of university inquiry
894000	897000	that you sought the truth wherever it led you.
897000	900000	That was the point of academia, for instance.
900000	902000	Politics was different.
902000	904000	Politics was always about having to find a way around
904000	906000	truth and deal with it.
906000	908000	Addressing convenience.
908000	910000	Yeah, address it where you could, but, you know,
910000	912000	get around it if it was too awkward.
912000	915000	But inquiry used to be about seeking truth.
915000	918000	And we've been like that for a couple thousand years or more
918000	920000	since the Greeks, certainly.
920000	923000	And then it changed at some point relatively recently.
923000	928000	And truth is now not a desirable thing
928000	930000	because truth hurts people.
930000	933000	And it can be mean.
933000	937000	So it's not only that people have different opinions on things.
937000	939000	They don't agree that the thing we used to agree on
939000	941000	is worth going for.
941000	943000	Well, they have different facts.
943000	945000	But they don't agree that, I mean, they don't agree
945000	949000	that you should just follow truth wherever it takes you.
949000	952000	Because other things are prioritized over truth.
952000	956000	I still prioritize truth over all things if I can and try to.
956000	959000	And I think that's the interesting thing about the world
959000	962000	is finding out what is true and what is not.
962000	967000	But other people don't seem to have that same appetite anymore
967000	971000	and would rather live in lies,
971000	973000	which I think is very dangerous for an individual
973000	975000	and very dangerous for society.
975000	978000	In fact, it's dangerous for an individual
978000	981000	and lethal in a society, I'd say.
982000	986000	It's interesting to think about the motivations
986000	991000	that people have for not believing something
991000	994000	which is already on an unshaky foundation
994000	998000	of we can't agree on the thing that we're not believing about.
998000	1002000	And Gwinda, one of my friends has this idea that
1002000	1007000	if no amount of evidence would dissuade someone
1007000	1010000	of what they believe, then they don't have a rational belief.
1010000	1013000	They have a religious ideology.
1013000	1017000	Yeah, yeah, that's Jonathan Swift beautifully put it
1017000	1019000	as if you can't reason somebody out for a position
1019000	1021000	they weren't reasoned into.
1023000	1025000	Yeah, of course.
1025000	1028000	I mean, you're dealing with dogma with many people today.
1028000	1030000	It's just they don't know which faith they belong to.
1030000	1032000	But it's dogma for sure.
1032000	1036000	I just am not very interested in their views
1036000	1038000	because I think they can't defend them.
1038000	1041000	If you can't defend your views, I'm not very interested in them
1041000	1043000	because I don't find them persuasive.
1044000	1048000	I asked Sam this about whether or not...
1048000	1050000	Obviously, whatever, 10, 15 years ago,
1050000	1052000	who's a big part of the New Atheist movement
1052000	1054000	and I guess you were tangentially...
1054000	1056000	I was a little bit of a whipper snapper.
1056000	1058000	I was a whipper snapper New Atheist.
1058000	1059000	You were an orbiter.
1059000	1062000	I was a short trousers New Atheist.
1062000	1064000	Okay.
1064000	1067000	But, you know, your book, The Madness of Crowds,
1067000	1069000	talks about the collapse of grand narratives.
1069000	1072000	One of the biggest collapses of grand narratives was religion.
1072000	1074000	So I asked Sam whether or not looking back,
1074000	1076000	he believed that his deconstruction of religion
1076000	1079000	was on balance and net good or a net negative.
1079000	1081000	What did he say?
1081000	1087000	He managed to evade being too committal, either way, I think.
1087000	1089000	But what do you think?
1089000	1092000	Well, I think it's like a lot of things that you deconstruct.
1093000	1096000	You only know afterwards
1096000	1098000	whether or not it's something you could have put back together.
1098000	1100000	It's like children with bicycles.
1100000	1101000	Very fine at taking them apart.
1101000	1103000	Very bad at putting them back together.
1103000	1106000	Not comparing Sam to a child.
1106000	1107000	But I mean, I just...
1107000	1108000	I think that is...
1108000	1110000	If it's something you notice only once you've taken it apart,
1110000	1111000	once you can't reconstruct it,
1111000	1114000	you'd realize what function it might have performed.
1114000	1117000	I said to Sam on stage a few years ago
1117000	1121000	that I thought that it would all be fine
1121000	1126000	if most atheists were as rational and level-headed as Sam.
1126000	1129000	But it's not Sam Harris all the way down.
1129000	1132000	It's like Sam Harris followed by total mentalists
1132000	1138000	and who just will not reason or rationalize anything
1138000	1142000	and are just screaming harpies of insanity.
1142000	1144000	So that's a shame.
1146000	1150000	But yes, I mean, I think that that whole thing works for some people,
1150000	1151000	but obviously it doesn't work for others.
1151000	1153000	I mean, religion is...
1153000	1156000	You know, Schopenhauer, among others,
1156000	1161000	saw it was religion was philosophy for the masses.
1161000	1164000	Absent religion completely.
1164000	1166000	There's several lots of options of what will happen.
1166000	1170000	One is that the general public
1170000	1174000	lose the overarching framework of their lives
1174000	1176000	and have nothing to replace it with.
1176000	1179000	And another one is that they do replace it with other things,
1179000	1181000	which are new religions which crop up all the time.
1181000	1184000	We have the religion of the body negativity movement.
1184000	1187000	You know, we have the religion of trans.
1187000	1189000	We have the religion of gender.
1189000	1192000	We have the religion of race and all these things
1192000	1194000	have just stepped into this void.
1194000	1198000	And they're all dogmatic things with their founding texts.
1198000	1203000	They've all got their own catechisms of a kind.
1203000	1205000	Priests have priests.
1205000	1207000	They have excommunication rights.
1207000	1211000	And my only observation really would be on that
1211000	1213000	is that I preferred the old gods.
1213000	1216000	You know, I preferred the old priesthood, funnily enough,
1216000	1219000	partly because we knew its flaws.
1219000	1224000	And the sweet point where you see the flaws of religious belief
1224000	1230000	but can still live through it is one even I can,
1230000	1232000	where I can especially feel nostalgic for
1232000	1235000	because I don't like the new priesthood.
1235000	1241000	I find them as corrupt as any priesthood in history
1241000	1247000	with the negative attribute that not everyone's woken up to them yet.
1247000	1250000	I mean, do we have in our culture an equivalent,
1250000	1254000	for instance, of the meme of the pedophile priest?
1254000	1256000	I don't think we do.
1256000	1260000	I mean, for instance, I would love it if the sort of adults
1260000	1264000	who push gender dysmorphia stuff on children
1264000	1266000	were regarded as the equivalent of pedophile priests.
1266000	1268000	I think that'd be fine.
1268000	1271000	But it doesn't come with that yet.
1271000	1275000	It's like the Catholic Church in Boston circa 1950.
1275000	1277000	The priests are still fiddling with the kids
1277000	1279000	but no one wants to talk about it.
1279000	1281000	So...
1294000	1297000	On the planet, they're the only 100% stress-free,
1297000	1300000	wild harvested venison that you can get.
1300000	1302000	Here's my super secret hack.
1302000	1304000	If you are sick of buying meat that always goes off,
1304000	1307000	put it in the freezer from frozen, salt both sides of it,
1307000	1310000	put it in an air fryer for 10 to 12 minutes each side,
1310000	1313000	and you have a perfectly cooked steak from frozen
1313000	1316000	that will never go off because it's going from freezer to mouth
1316000	1318000	in the space of 25 minutes.
1318000	1319000	It's a complete game changer.
1319000	1321000	All of their cuts are spectacular
1321000	1323000	and you can get them frozen, delivered to your door.
1323000	1326000	But their venison sticks are my favorite while I've been on the road.
1326000	1328000	You can get the healthiest red meat on the planet
1328000	1330000	delivered directly to your door
1330000	1333000	and get 20% off by going to the link in the description below
1333000	1336000	or heading to mowinuivenison.com
1336000	1338000	slash modernwisdom
1338000	1340000	and using the code modernwisdom at checkout.
1340000	1343000	That's M-A-U-I-N-U-I
1343000	1345000	venison.com slash modernwisdom
1345000	1347000	and modernwisdom at checkout.
1347000	1350000	It makes me think as we were talking earlier on
1350000	1354000	about some of the ways in which
1354000	1356000	lots of decisions need to be made
1356000	1358000	and you don't know how the outcomes are going to occur
1358000	1361000	that there are no solutions, only trade-offs.
1361000	1364000	I keep coming back to that in my personal life as well
1364000	1367000	but thinking about what people want to optimize for
1367000	1369000	in their existence,
1369000	1371000	there are no solutions ultimately
1371000	1373000	and you have to give up certain things.
1373000	1375000	You don't have to give up everything.
1375000	1378000	Well, no, there's certainly better solutions,
1378000	1382000	but the world is trying to maximize everything.
1382000	1386000	It goes back to the shallow pond of empathy
1386000	1391000	that accepting that trade-offs are an inevitability
1391000	1394000	doesn't fit into that paradigm.
1394000	1398000	We will always optimize for what feels most pleasurable
1398000	1401000	or empathetic in the short term.
1401000	1403000	I don't know. I don't feel that.
1403000	1406000	That's how it plays out, I think.
1406000	1409000	For a lot of people, if they have no character.
1409000	1412000	What do you optimize for?
1412000	1414000	I try to optimize for peace.
1414000	1416000	That seems to be the thing that for me,
1416000	1418000	in my personal life, I try to do.
1418000	1420000	If the price is my sanity, the cost is too high
1420000	1422000	no matter what it is.
1422000	1426000	I continually throw that rule out of the window all the time.
1426000	1428000	That's what I try and aim for.
1428000	1431000	I love the peace in your private life.
1431000	1432000	I try.
1432000	1434000	It reminds me of Lady Bracknell's line about the general
1434000	1436000	at the end of the importance of being earnest.
1436000	1438000	She says, the general was essentially a man of peace
1438000	1440000	except in his domestic life.
1444000	1446000	But you're the other way around.
1446000	1449000	You're a man of peace in your domestic life.
1449000	1450000	Except for my private life.
1450000	1452000	Maybe what I generally am.
1452000	1454000	You're a highly agreeable person.
1454000	1459000	I try as best I can to keep a lid on it.
1459000	1460000	Yeah.
1460000	1465000	This lack of meaning and people's desire there.
1465000	1468000	Absolutely fervent desire to try and fill that hole
1468000	1471000	with as many things as they can.
1471000	1473000	Like Lizzo.
1473000	1475000	Like Lizzo, indeed.
1475000	1478000	Did you see the stories that came out about Lizzo?
1478000	1479000	Oh, it was wonderful.
1479000	1480000	About her Amsterdam.
1480000	1482000	My favorite story of the year.
1482000	1483000	Long way.
1483000	1485000	For the people that don't know,
1485000	1488000	Lizzo was on tour in Amsterdam.
1488000	1491000	Took her backup dances to the Red Light District.
1491000	1492000	Yes.
1492000	1494000	And made the backup dancers,
1494000	1497000	some of the backup dancers eat bananas out of the vaginas
1497000	1499000	of Amsterdamian strippers.
1499000	1501000	My view is what happened here was that Lizzo
1501000	1504000	thought you could outsource the eating
1504000	1506000	of your five fruit and veggie day.
1506000	1510000	To the vagina of the stripper?
1510000	1512000	She's so reluctant to eat healthfully.
1512000	1515000	She even outsources the five fruit and veggie day.
1515000	1517000	That's my view.
1517000	1523000	Well, it seems to me that both Lizzo,
1523000	1526000	Ellen DeGeneres, Jimmy Kimmel,
1526000	1528000	all of these people who up front.
1528000	1529000	Oh, isn't it wonderful?
1529000	1531000	It's so great.
1531000	1533000	It's always nice.
1533000	1535000	Not the Lizzo look nice,
1535000	1538000	but the squeaky clean Ellen DeGeneres thing,
1538000	1540000	just dancing.
1540000	1543000	And of course, they're horrible in real life.
1543000	1544000	Of course.
1544000	1546000	It's a sort of rule that, by the way,
1546000	1548000	one of the biggest public figures is that the ones
1548000	1551000	who are most sort of sweetie-sweetie in public
1551000	1553000	tend to be the nastiest in private.
1553000	1555000	Sometimes the opposite can be true.
1555000	1558000	Some people who have thought to have a very hard edge in public
1558000	1560000	can actually be lovely, lovely people in private.
1560000	1562000	Margaret Thatcher was a good example.
1562000	1564000	Very, very nice to people around her,
1564000	1566000	but could make tough decisions.
1566000	1568000	To me, it's a counter signal.
1568000	1570000	If I see someone doing the Lizzo thing
1570000	1572000	of I am so body positivity,
1572000	1574000	it becomes their identity
1574000	1576000	because they're a flaming sword,
1576000	1578000	card carrying,
1578000	1580000	paragon of whatever this thing is.
1580000	1582000	Well, it's also a bit like
1584000	1586000	the Jimmy Savile,
1586000	1588000	the hospital,
1588000	1590000	what was it called? It still goes,
1590000	1592000	but there was a hospital for children
1592000	1594000	that he raised money for all the time.
1594000	1596000	And whenever anyone would try to do an investigation,
1596000	1598000	Savile would go,
1598000	1600000	it's going to hurt the hospital for kids.
1600000	1602000	Are you sure you want to run that story?
1602000	1604000	That's going to hurt the hospital.
1604000	1606000	So there are lots of people in our own age
1606000	1608000	who have a thing like that.
1608000	1610000	They build the equivalent of the Jimmy Savile
1610000	1612000	Children's Hospital facade up
1612000	1614000	in order to protect themselves.
1614000	1616000	Are you saying that Lizzo's work
1616000	1618000	with the body positivity movement
1618000	1620000	is in a case to try and effectively
1620000	1622000	put a wall of large
1622000	1624000	bodied people in front of it?
1624000	1626000	A very difficult wall to get over.
1626000	1628000	I think it's probably easy to get over.
1628000	1630000	Getting around it might be more difficult.
1630000	1632000	Yeah, I got into a car and it ran out of gas.
1632000	1634000	So,
1634000	1636000	I had this idea about
1636000	1638000	why
1638000	1640000	certain women
1640000	1642000	are very pro body positivity movement.
1642000	1644000	And I was listening to Bill Burr
1644000	1646000	do a live show,
1646000	1648000	and he said,
1648000	1650000	ladies, if you could only support
1650000	1652000	the WNBA the way that you support
1652000	1654000	a fat chick
1654000	1656000	who is gaining weight
1656000	1658000	and no longer a threat to you,
1658000	1660000	there are more numbers than the NBA is.
1660000	1662000	And I realized that
1662000	1664000	some non-zero number
1664000	1666000	of women may deep down
1666000	1668000	in their darker moments realize
1668000	1670000	that they don't discourage
1670000	1672000	some of their friends from
1672000	1674000	gaining weight because
1674000	1676000	they can eat themselves out of their
1676000	1678000	intersexual competition for potential partners.
1678000	1680000	It's always welcome on men like that as well.
1680000	1682000	How do we play that game?
1684000	1686000	I mean, this is going to show a low side of my character.
1686000	1688000	But you can't say always that you're sad
1688000	1690000	if
1690000	1692000	somebody you're not very close to, but you knew
1692000	1694000	and you see them after some years and then
1694000	1696000	they're fat.
1696000	1698000	I mean, you can't say there isn't a slight sort of
1698000	1700000	you'll never guess
1700000	1702000	because you've become fat.
1702000	1704000	There are different versions of that with men, I think.
1704000	1706000	And I think men can be
1706000	1708000	complicit in that as well.
1708000	1710000	You know, the thrill
1710000	1712000	would offend bolds early.
1712000	1714000	I think that's very common.
1714000	1716000	Well, there'll be a German word for that.
1716000	1718000	Of course.
1718000	1720000	For the scalp.
1720000	1722000	Yeah.
1722000	1724000	I think lots of people do that.
1724000	1726000	But it's a pretty bad thing to encourage among people.
1726000	1728000	But yeah, I think it is part of the competition
1728000	1730000	taking out of the competition for sure.
1730000	1732000	I was thinking as well about how
1732000	1734000	material conditions
1734000	1736000	you were saying before
1736000	1738000	people's parents
1738000	1740000	maybe had it better in some ways, but also
1740000	1742000	would have had it way worse.
1742000	1744000	Material conditions
1744000	1746000	often don't impact
1746000	1748000	people's demeanors in the way that they might have predicted.
1748000	1750000	Like, rich people
1750000	1752000	can be bitter idiots
1752000	1754000	and poor people can be grateful heroes.
1754000	1756000	Although, as George Orwell said, by the age of 50
1756000	1758000	every man gets the face he deserves.
1758000	1760000	What do you mean by that?
1760000	1762000	I think that's actually true.
1762000	1764000	I think there's a certain age, it might not be 50 now,
1764000	1766000	but it's a certain age where you do show your life
1766000	1768000	on your face.
1768000	1770000	Oh yeah, I mean, for instance, somebody
1770000	1772000	is very profoundly depressed
1772000	1774000	for a long time
1774000	1776000	that writes itself across the face.
1776000	1778000	It writes itself in their eyes, I think.
1780000	1782000	Particularly unhappiness
1782000	1784000	writes itself on somebody's face.
1784000	1786000	Joy does as well.
1786000	1788000	If somebody smiles a lot, they have laugh lines.
1790000	1792000	Yes, there's a great truth in it.
1792000	1794000	We know that
1794000	1796000	because we judge people by
1796000	1798000	their faces, by the way they interact with us
1798000	1800000	by the way they look at us.
1800000	1802000	It's perfectly sensible.
1804000	1806000	I've found a quote the other day that said
1806000	1808000	people with a low self-esteem will always
1808000	1810000	find a way to be miserable.
1810000	1812000	And it made me think that
1812000	1814000	material conditions a lot of the time are what?
1814000	1816000	Young people, but many people
1816000	1818000	lay at the feet of their
1818000	1820000	despondency or their nihilism
1820000	1822000	or their critical nature
1822000	1824000	or whatever it might be.
1824000	1826000	And I've seen enough of my friends
1826000	1828000	and friends
1828000	1830000	vacillate through
1830000	1832000	varying levels of
1832000	1834000	affluence or
1834000	1836000	relationship or singletonness or whatever.
1836000	1838000	And one of the things
1838000	1840000	sometimes it impacts the way that they show up.
1840000	1842000	But many times they are the common denominator
1842000	1844000	between all of those situations.
1844000	1846000	And the material conditions don't actually impact
1846000	1848000	the way that they show up all that much.
1848000	1850000	Well, there's a problem of analyzing this
1850000	1852000	which is that anyone who's successful
1852000	1854000	inevitably looks at their own path
1854000	1856000	to some extent pre-ordained.
1856000	1858000	I mean, almost.
1858000	1860000	I mean, there are some people with wild luck.
1860000	1862000	But most people,
1862000	1864000	a lot of people, let me say, who are successful
1864000	1866000	look back and they think, well, I don't understand
1866000	1868000	this person who hasn't made it to the same
1868000	1870000	rung of the ladder as I have. Why didn't they work hard?
1870000	1872000	There's a sort of
1872000	1874000	callousness actually that can creep in there.
1876000	1878000	But equally, people are
1878000	1880000	to a great extent masters their own fate.
1880000	1882000	And it's a very hard one
1882000	1884000	to analyze that, as I said, because the outriders
1884000	1886000	skew the whole statistics.
1886000	1888000	I mean, the outrider who does very well,
1888000	1890000	not everyone can do
1890000	1892000	what he or she has done.
1892000	1894000	But he or she is likely to think
1894000	1896000	they could have done.
1896000	1898000	Well, you retroactively, lots of people that achieve success
1898000	1900000	look back at the route that was
1900000	1902000	particularly designed by them,
1902000	1904000	for them to achieve the very specific
1904000	1906000	type of success that they managed to get.
1906000	1908000	And then retrofit that as a universal law
1908000	1910000	that anybody else could follow.
1910000	1912000	One of the things I've realized is I've spent
1912000	1914000	more time digging into personal growth
1914000	1916000	and self-development and all of that stuff.
1916000	1918000	So much of it is post-hoc rationalization
1918000	1920000	about one person's very
1920000	1922000	idiosyncratic solution for this thing.
1922000	1924000	And they say, these are the universal
1924000	1926000	principles of X, Y and Z.
1926000	1928000	And you go, no, they're not.
1928000	1930000	They're highly personal.
1930000	1932000	It's your personality just spun up
1932000	1934000	and tuned up to 11.
1934000	1936000	Yeah, I mean, most successful
1936000	1938000	people I've ever met have some
1938000	1940000	story of their own
1940000	1942000	growth which
1942000	1944000	is both inspiring
1944000	1946000	and not replicable
1946000	1948000	because they're unusual people.
1948000	1950000	Well, what's the alternative, as you said before?
1950000	1952000	Like, you have to lay the agency at your
1952000	1954000	own feet because if you were to
1954000	1956000	perhaps admit the truth, which is
1956000	1958000	I was in the right place at the right time.
1958000	1960000	Well, that can be the case.
1960000	1962000	Not many people say that, but some do.
1962000	1964000	Yeah, if you're in Britain in the 80s,
1964000	1966000	for instance, it's a good time to make money.
1966000	1968000	Easier, better
1968000	1970000	than today.
1970000	1972000	Some people will say, yeah, it was a great place at the right time.
1972000	1974000	But most people do sort of
1974000	1976000	vaguely think they've made it,
1976000	1978000	it was sort of preordained.
1978000	1980000	I will do that to some extent.
1980000	1982000	I often describe myself as being lucky
1982000	1984000	and then need somebody to remind me
1984000	1986000	of how hard I've worked.
1986000	1988000	Yeah.
1988000	1990000	I had a friend who joined
1990000	1992000	Goldman Sachs in 1998
1992000	1994000	and he said he had
1994000	1996000	an absolute golden period
1996000	1998000	for about 10 years.
1998000	2000000	Yeah, a little bit less.
2000000	2002000	He said it was already starting to
2002000	2004000	wind down. Before Lehman, brother.
2004000	2006000	Yeah.
2006000	2008000	Some of that was to do with DEI, a very early
2008000	2010000	instantiation of DEI. That's right.
2010000	2012000	Yes, there's several books that make that clear
2012000	2014000	in the subtext, yeah. Several books
2014000	2016000	that make it clear about some of the hiring processes going on.
2016000	2018000	Yeah, 2006, he was already seeing it.
2018000	2020000	But he told me
2020000	2022000	he made a trade
2022000	2024000	on 9-11.
2024000	2026000	He made a very
2026000	2028000	particular trade
2028000	2030000	and bypassed all of the
2030000	2032000	security
2032000	2034000	concerns, the limits
2034000	2036000	on everything and
2036000	2038000	the pit boss or whatever. He's just some young
2038000	2040000	dude. He's been there for two years, right? Out of
2040000	2042000	whatever university or something. What did his boss think
2042000	2044000	of the trade? Came over and said, like,
2044000	2046000	what the fuck are you
2046000	2048000	doing? And he said, look
2048000	2050000	at this. If this, then that. If this, then that.
2050000	2052000	Ran it all the way down. He said, this is the outcome.
2052000	2054000	This is what's going to happen. And he's like,
2054000	2056000	we would like, I don't know what.
2056000	2058000	So first off, he was concerned that it was going to
2058000	2060000	go wrong. And then he made
2060000	2062000	the most
2062000	2064000	ungodly amount of money in the space of three hours.
2064000	2066000	And then all the markets shut for 10
2066000	2068000	days from September 12th.
2068000	2070000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2070000	2072000	And the only
2072000	2074000	organization that had spare capital
2074000	2076000	was Goldman because of this
2076000	2078000	particular trade. Wow.
2078000	2080000	He was basically told
2080000	2082000	we may need to cut this. I'll check with him.
2082000	2084000	He was basically told,
2084000	2086000	go home. Don't tell anybody.
2086000	2088000	Yeah, of course. That you made this. He shorted
2088000	2090000	the market. Yeah, I mean, it was
2090000	2092000	widely thought of 9-11 that because
2092000	2094000	the stock market tanked, of course, immediately
2094000	2096000	and we didn't know if there's going to be a world war, if this was
2096000	2098000	a world war.
2098000	2100000	And it was regarded very
2100000	2102000	swiftly as actually being the duty
2102000	2104000	of Wall Street to
2104000	2106000	not do that.
2106000	2108000	But Bush came back. You remember he did that
2108000	2110000	ground zero announcement.
2110000	2112000	And that was as much
2112000	2114000	for the stock market
2114000	2116000	as it was for the fucking popular.
2116000	2118000	Yeah, absolutely. Well, yes, because
2118000	2120000	stock market collapses. I mean, many, many more
2120000	2122000	Americans, I can't remember the percentage,
2122000	2124000	are invested in the stock market than in Britain.
2124000	2126000	I mean, like three times more or something
2126000	2128000	Americans. With 401K.
2128000	2130000	Yeah, more than 50% of the population
2130000	2132000	in America has some
2132000	2134000	investment in the stock market. So it's
2134000	2136000	different from in the UK where
2136000	2138000	when the pound was shorted in the 1990s
2138000	2140000	by
2140000	2142000	Soros and others,
2142000	2144000	they
2144000	2146000	a lot of British people are not that sympathetic because
2146000	2148000	they don't see themselves as being involved
2148000	2150000	in the stock market, which of course they are, they just
2150000	2152000	don't know it. You mentioned
2152000	2154000	George Orwell, the telegraph
2154000	2156000	recently spoke about his
2156000	2158000	wife's biography or autobiography.
2158000	2160000	Oh, there's a new biography of Sonia Orwell, yeah.
2160000	2162000	George Orwell was sadistic,
2162000	2164000	misogynistic, homophobic and sometimes
2164000	2166000	violent. Biographer of the legendary
2166000	2168000	writer's wife says, darkness
2168000	2170000	that runs through 1984
2170000	2172000	is a reflection of his soul.
2172000	2174000	Should we unperson, George?
2174000	2176000	Well, it would be the obvious
2176000	2178000	end point to the full circle.
2178000	2180000	Full circle.
2182000	2184000	Yeah, this is just a way for
2184000	2186000	the author to get publicity is to repeat
2186000	2188000	things everyone knew. I mean,
2188000	2190000	George Orwell held the views
2190000	2192000	of his time about gay men.
2192000	2194000	For instance, we know he was a little bit homophobic,
2194000	2196000	but it was the 1940s,
2196000	2198000	you know,
2198000	2200000	Nancy Boys and so on, as he would have called him.
2200000	2202000	Were not,
2202000	2204000	you know, people weren't
2204000	2206000	like a 1990s
2206000	2208000	taxi driver's insult that they've thrown out.
2208000	2210000	No, it was a sort of word that Orwell
2210000	2212000	and people of his generation would use,
2212000	2214000	you know, fairies or something.
2214000	2216000	And he does in some of his letters and some of his articles.
2216000	2218000	But I mean, so fucking what?
2218000	2220000	I don't care.
2220000	2222000	I mean,
2222000	2224000	was he sadistic probably?
2224000	2226000	In some ways,
2226000	2228000	sometimes,
2228000	2230000	was, could he be cruel and nasty
2230000	2232000	probably being a human being?
2232000	2234000	I just think that the
2234000	2236000	absurdity of our age of judging people
2236000	2238000	and passing, well, you know, just, just
2238000	2240000	wait till people do that to you.
2240000	2242000	Yeah. You know, wait, wait till somebody
2242000	2244000	weighs up your own
2244000	2246000	life in the balance and finds
2246000	2248000	you wanting, you know.
2248000	2250000	I mean, I think it's preposterous.
2250000	2252000	Human beings are what we are.
2252000	2254000	Being amazed
2254000	2256000	us in the past.
2256000	2258000	There's always just an expression of our own vanity
2258000	2260000	and thinking we've got past all that.
2260000	2262000	It's like the way, if a
2262000	2264000	friend of mine was saying to me the other day when I was at Oxford,
2264000	2266000	if you want to get a grant
2266000	2268000	to study these days, say in English,
2268000	2270000	and you would choose
2270000	2272000	Shakespeare as your
2272000	2274000	subject of study, which is sort of unusual
2274000	2276000	these days, you would,
2276000	2278000	you would, for instance, have to
2278000	2280000	find Shakespeare guilty of, you know,
2280000	2282000	racism, colonialist thinking
2282000	2284000	and so on. And it doesn't seem to strike
2284000	2286000	these people that actually their job is not
2286000	2288000	to judge Shakespeare. Shakespeare judges
2288000	2290000	us.
2290000	2292000	And he might find us wanting.
2292000	2294000	How so?
2294000	2296000	Well, he gives us visions of
2296000	2298000	the universe and our place
2298000	2300000	in it, which it would do us well to listen
2300000	2302000	to.
2302000	2304000	And that might include
2304000	2306000	exposing human follies,
2306000	2308000	human weakness, human pride,
2308000	2310000	human sin, human lust,
2310000	2312000	the tendency to
2312000	2314000	do evil in the name of doing good
2314000	2316000	or think you're doing good and do great harm.
2316000	2318000	So much more.
2318000	2320000	All of this
2320000	2322000	is in Shakespeare's work and his characters
2322000	2324000	and the things he created
2324000	2326000	in his mind and his work.
2326000	2328000	I think that if you look
2328000	2330000	at a panoply of a vision like
2330000	2332000	that, you should think, I wonder
2332000	2334000	what he's telling us. Rather
2334000	2336000	than I wonder how I can judge him.
2336000	2338000	What's the point of the letter?
2338000	2340000	It's so boring.
2340000	2342000	Human being from the past, inhuman
2342000	2344000	being in the past, shocker.
2346000	2348000	Has it always been this way? Has it always been
2348000	2350000	people of the
2350000	2352000	present judging people of yesterday by the
2352000	2354000	standards of today?
2354000	2356000	Well, most people didn't
2356000	2358000	have time in the past to engage in that.
2358000	2360000	Too busy trying to put food on the table.
2362000	2364000	Surviving past the age of 25.
2368000	2370000	But what it is in our
2370000	2372000	current society is there's a very strange
2374000	2376000	lack of respect for wisdom.
2376000	2378000	Henry Kissinger said this in the early years
2378000	2380000	of the internet. He said all the knowledge
2380000	2382000	is there, but where's the wisdom?
2382000	2384000	People might not like me quoting Dr.
2384000	2386000	Kissinger in that regard, but
2386000	2388000	again, he knows a lot more than
2388000	2390000	most of his critics.
2390000	2392000	I do think that's
2392000	2394000	a strict oddity of the age.
2394000	2396000	I think the oddity, the vanity of trying to judge
2396000	2398000	everyone from the past by our current standards
2398000	2400000	is just absurd.
2400000	2402000	You think you know more than Shakespeare?
2402000	2404000	You think you know more than Orwell?
2404000	2406000	These are minnows
2406000	2408000	snapping
2408000	2410000	giants. I don't care
2410000	2412000	for them.
2412000	2414000	One
2414000	2416000	potentially unfortunate situation is
2416000	2418000	that women's mental health
2418000	2420000	is in part down to
2420000	2422000	misogynistic songs.
2422000	2424000	When BTS lead singer Young Cook
2424000	2426000	changed to a more misogynistic
2426000	2428000	music, a disturbing trend followed.
2428000	2430000	A psychiatrist's point of view
2430000	2432000	on BTS' Young Cook and the messages
2432000	2434000	of pop music.
2434000	2436000	Early in their teen career, BTS took
2436000	2438000	a deliberate stance to refrain from
2438000	2440000	objectifying or sexualizing women.
2440000	2442000	Despite going against a music industry norm,
2442000	2444000	BTS achieved huge success.
2444000	2446000	Now, as part of his solo launch,
2446000	2448000	different imagery has surfaced
2448000	2450000	in Young Cook songs.
2450000	2452000	They include a woman telling her man
2452000	2454000	that she will be your fantasy
2454000	2456000	and swallow your pride
2456000	2458000	to make him never think about cheating.
2458000	2460000	Lyrics that identify...
2460000	2462000	You said swallow your pride
2462000	2464000	in a particularly suggestive way.
2464000	2466000	I've got more to go here.
2466000	2468000	Lyrics that identify women
2468000	2470000	as those hoes over there
2470000	2472000	with a male rapper telling his female partner,
2472000	2474000	I wanked before you came
2474000	2476000	so that I can fuck you longer.
2476000	2478000	Of course, in reality, Young Cook songs
2478000	2480000	are part of the course, or even tame.
2480000	2482000	Does that work, by the way, what you just described?
2482000	2484000	You've never
2484000	2486000	increased your stamina by
2486000	2488000	having a warm-up?
2488000	2490000	I thought the lyrics were more likely.
2490000	2492000	I did that before you came and I just let you go to bed.
2494000	2496000	I kind of got a lie down.
2496000	2498000	I did that before you came and that's why I texted
2498000	2500000	saying I'm not so fussed about you.
2500000	2502000	I don't have a quick dinner now.
2502000	2504000	One of my friends had
2504000	2506000	a rubric for this that was masturbate
2506000	2508000	before you evaluate.
2508000	2510000	Oh, well, that's true.
2510000	2512000	That can be sensible advice.
2512000	2514000	I'm not sure if I liked you or I was just horny.
2514000	2516000	But no, girls, mental health...
2516000	2518000	You were reading out these charming lyrics.
2518000	2520000	Those hoes over there I wanked
2520000	2522000	before you came so that I can fuck you longer.
2524000	2526000	Well,
2526000	2528000	where to start?
2528000	2530000	Downstream from K-pop is a litany of female mental health problems.
2530000	2532000	That's what I'm saying.
2532000	2534000	There's a problem here, isn't there?
2534000	2536000	Because on the one hand, popular culture does have
2536000	2538000	a massive impact on the way we see the world.
2538000	2540000	I was at a gym recently
2540000	2542000	where I actually asked
2542000	2544000	the gym staff to turn off the music
2544000	2546000	because it was a load of
2546000	2548000	rap, a very unpleasant rap,
2548000	2550000	with repeated use of the N-word in it.
2550000	2552000	Obviously, it was a black rapper or so I was assuming.
2552000	2554000	Right.
2554000	2556000	Do you find yourself mouthing along to the lyrics
2556000	2558000	and not worried about it?
2558000	2560000	That's right.
2560000	2562000	What problem could possibly emerge
2562000	2564000	from singing along?
2564000	2566000	Mate, just to interject there,
2566000	2568000	someone got cancelled on TikTok
2568000	2570000	for mouthing the N-word along to a song.
2570000	2572000	Right.
2572000	2574000	It's possible.
2574000	2576000	It's no longer the sound of the word,
2576000	2578000	it's the mouth shape
2578000	2580000	that that word engenders.
2580000	2582000	Well, we know that it's a magical word
2582000	2584000	in our time, which even the speaking
2584000	2586000	of suddenly summons up the demons of
2586000	2588000	the past. Lord Voldemort, yeah.
2588000	2590000	Very, very strange.
2590000	2592000	But, no, I just said to the gym staff,
2592000	2594000	I just don't want to hear it because I don't want
2594000	2596000	I just don't want it in the background
2596000	2598000	of my life, you know.
2598000	2600000	Was it that gym that we trained at?
2600000	2602000	We can discuss this another time.
2602000	2604000	But anyway.
2604000	2606000	No, I just don't like, I have certain things I don't want
2606000	2608000	on my ears and that's one actually.
2608000	2610000	I have no interest in hearing the word
2610000	2612000	as a banned word. So why would I want it
2612000	2614000	in my mental background?
2614000	2616000	Yeah.
2616000	2618000	But anyway, the point is, of course
2618000	2620000	popular culture has a huge impact on people.
2620000	2622000	It has a huge impact on the way in which people see themselves.
2622000	2624000	It does. It does.
2624000	2626000	At the same time, you can overstate it.
2626000	2628000	You know, somebody is not generally unhappy
2628000	2630000	just because of the popular culture.
2630000	2632000	Apart from anything else because you can easily step out of it
2632000	2634000	as I try to do.
2634000	2636000	And, you know,
2636000	2638000	be a part of your time but not be its creature
2638000	2640000	that says.
2640000	2642000	And
2642000	2644000	so no, I think it's a sort of
2644000	2646000	weak excuse for unhappiness.
2646000	2648000	The popular culture happens not to be to your taste
2648000	2650000	or avoid it. Get out.
2650000	2652000	Look up from the screen.
2652000	2654000	When is cancel culture going to come for
2654000	2656000	rap lyrics?
2656000	2658000	Because it seems to me that, you know, it's worth fighting
2658000	2660000	against the misogyny of
2660000	2662000	air conditioning temperatures in offices
2662000	2664000	that are conditioned
2664000	2666000	to the male body temperature as opposed to
2666000	2668000	the female body temperature or
2668000	2670000	I mean the
2670000	2672000	the levity of the era
2672000	2674000	is just astonishing to me.
2674000	2676000	You know, lots of people
2676000	2678000	attribute to me this quote that I was not quite
2678000	2680000	right. I don't think it's quite from me but
2680000	2682000	that we'll be talking about gender pronouns
2682000	2684000	when the barbarians break in.
2684000	2686000	But I've said something like it
2686000	2688000	quite a few times but I mean
2688000	2690000	you know
2690000	2692000	gender norms and air conditioning
2692000	2694000	it's the sort of thing that you would be discussing
2694000	2696000	just before you will get
2696000	2698000	you know machetted.
2698000	2700000	I'm totally serious about this.
2700000	2702000	It's
2702000	2704000	sometimes it's like
2704000	2706000	one of the things that actually
2706000	2708000	genuinely shocked me in recent weeks
2708000	2710000	particularly after Hamas massacre in Israel
2710000	2712000	was you know and
2712000	2714000	something which I do think at some point when it's
2714000	2716000	all died down a bit
2716000	2718000	might be a moment
2718000	2720000	of
2720000	2722000	I've got to say this carefully
2722000	2724000	but a moment of
2724000	2726000	seriousness which is
2726000	2728000	you know
2728000	2730000	take the music festival within a few miles
2730000	2732000	of the Gaza border that Hamas attacked
2732000	2734000	all the young people there
2734000	2736000	were at this sort of peace rave
2736000	2738000	and
2738000	2740000	this isn't in any way to victim blame
2740000	2742000	these are people just
2742000	2744000	wanting to dance
2744000	2746000	and
2746000	2748000	dance into the early morning and
2748000	2750000	I think it was called the peace rave
2750000	2752000	the peace and love rave something like that
2754000	2756000	and then this hideous
2756000	2758000	other world broke into
2758000	2760000	them and to their lives and ended the lives
2760000	2762000	of hundreds of them.
2762000	2764000	There's something
2764000	2766000	haunting about this I find because it's
2766000	2768000	especially haunting because
2768000	2770000	it sort of demonstrates that
2770000	2772000	your slogans and your attitudes
2772000	2774000	only go so far
2774000	2776000	and they can't keep out
2776000	2778000	some of the things that are lurking at the edges
2780000	2782000	and I think that when I hear
2782000	2784000	people whining about
2784000	2786000	minor things
2786000	2788000	if you have any idea
2788000	2790000	of the world out there
2790000	2792000	if you had any idea of the things that was lurking
2792000	2794000	you couldn't possibly
2794000	2796000	be complaining about this
2796000	2798000	How do you think
2798000	2800000	Gaze for Gaza will get on long term?
2800000	2802000	Well the joke at the moment is that there aren't enough tall
2802000	2804000	buildings in Gaza to throw Gaze for Gaza
2804000	2806000	off
2806000	2808000	but
2808000	2810000	I mean these people
2810000	2812000	I've said very often
2812000	2814000	they're part of the same phenomenon as
2814000	2816000	turkeys for Christmas and chickens for KFC
2816000	2818000	I mean
2818000	2820000	I'm fed up with these infringe
2820000	2822000	idiot cases
2822000	2824000	they're so mentally defective
2824000	2826000	for these people
2826000	2828000	and incredibly narcissistic
2830000	2832000	I can be queer and also celebrate
2832000	2834000	so no you fucking can't fuck off
2838000	2840000	I can both argue for a two state solution
2840000	2842000	and also celebrate queerness and also not let myself down
2842000	2844000	no you can't
2844000	2846000	no you can't
2846000	2848000	you can't do all those things at some point you've got to choose
2848000	2850000	I've got a video to show you
2850000	2852000	let me show you this video
2852000	2854000	Can someone please explain to me
2854000	2856000	what this means
2856000	2858000	what does reproductive justice
2858000	2860000	mean
2860000	2862000	free Palestine
2862000	2864000	what does that even mean
2864000	2866000	like what does it mean
2866000	2868000	I'm pretty sure
2868000	2870000	abortions are illegal
2870000	2872000	in Palestine
2872000	2874000	unless it's like a super medical emergency
2874000	2876000	and the mother will die
2876000	2878000	from what I understand actually a lot of Palestinians
2878000	2880000	have to go to Israel
2880000	2882000	to get the abortions
2882000	2884000	they want so what does this mean
2884000	2886000	what
2886000	2888000	it's such a huge sign
2888000	2890000	there's
2890000	2892000	five people holding this thing
2892000	2894000	it's massive
2894000	2896000	that's very good
2896000	2898000	that's Danny the other half of Ryan
2898000	2900000	who wasn't there the day that you
2900000	2902000	came
2902000	2904000	reproductive justice means free Palestine
2904000	2906000	what do you think
2906000	2908000	this is just
2908000	2910000	incredibly ignorant young people in America
2910000	2912000	who have been taught
2912000	2914000	this weird
2914000	2916000	version of the world where all oppressions
2916000	2918000	are taken into lock
2918000	2920000	you're either the majority or the minority
2920000	2922000	for minority rights and issues
2922000	2924000	or for majority rights and issues
2924000	2926000	and all minority rights and issues
2926000	2928000	intersect and overlap
2928000	2930000	so that if you're queer somehow
2930000	2932000	no it's not even that
2932000	2934000	these ignoramuses
2934000	2936000	who couldn't point to the river Jordan
2936000	2938000	if you showed it to them on a map
2938000	2940000	walk along the streets of America
2940000	2942000	shout you know from the river to the sea
2942000	2944000	Palestine will be free because I think the Palestinians
2944000	2946000	where they've mapped a very
2946000	2948000	specific version
2948000	2950000	of American racial politics
2950000	2952000	onto everything else in the world
2952000	2954000	it's the same thing people who talk about
2954000	2956000	colonizers
2956000	2958000	there's this language
2958000	2960000	of colonizers
2960000	2962000	apartheid all this stuff
2962000	2964000	and
2964000	2966000	they've just tried to map it everywhere
2966000	2968000	actually it's highly selectively
2968000	2970000	highly selectively
2970000	2972000	the people who are talking about
2972000	2974000	colonizers
2974000	2976000	when I saw that
2976000	2978000	the other day on the streets of London
2978000	2980000	I thought yes if only there was a name
2980000	2982000	for large numbers of people who came from outside
2982000	2984000	to a country
2984000	2986000	and if only we could identify
2986000	2988000	what they might be called in Britain
2988000	2990000	oh it would be immigrants wouldn't it
2990000	2992000	do you want to call immigrants colonizers
2992000	2994000	in Britain
2994000	2996000	you sure you want to follow this logical conclusion
2996000	2998000	talk about indigenous peoples
2998000	3000000	oh okay great anyway you don't want to apply that
3000000	3002000	might there be a country
3002000	3004000	or a continent say oh Europe
3004000	3006000	where you don't want to start talking about the indigenous peoples
3006000	3008000	I notice that people don't
3008000	3010000	but if you do want to
3012000	3014000	welcome to hell
3014000	3016000	so
3016000	3018000	no all it is happening is a very selective mapping
3018000	3020000	of a particular interpretation of the world
3020000	3022000	that very
3022000	3024000	dumb people in America have tried to
3024000	3026000	put on certain selective other cases
3026000	3028000	and it doesn't work
3028000	3030000	but
3030000	3032000	may they never find out
3032000	3034000	how much it doesn't work
3034000	3036000	may they never find out
3038000	3040000	I wish them bliss
3040000	3042000	in their ignorance because if their
3042000	3044000	ignorance ever gets popped it will be
3044000	3046000	as brutal a day as can be imagined
3046000	3048000	I've been thinking
3048000	3050000	for a good while about how
3050000	3052000	hypocrisy is a purpose
3052000	3054000	built tool for the internet to use
3054000	3056000	it's like catnip for the internet
3056000	3058000	it's the thing because
3058000	3060000	the reason it's so purpose built
3060000	3062000	it's like one of those
3062000	3064000	can you spot the difference competitions on a touch screen
3064000	3066000	iPad this is what's on the left this is what's on the right
3066000	3068000	and what you have is here's something that someone once said
3068000	3070000	or a position that they used to hold
3070000	3072000	and here is what they hold now
3072000	3074000	or here is what they do in their real life
3074000	3076000	here is whatever and it's kind of what
3076000	3078000	you're identifying here that you have
3078000	3080000	a worldview which is self-contradictory
3080000	3082000	you're just using different words for one thing
3082000	3084000	that is almost exactly the same for another thing
3084000	3086000	and then complaining about this one
3086000	3088000	saying don't look over here
3088000	3090000	don't look over here yeah
3090000	3092000	everyone is inconsistent to some extent
3092000	3094000	and I don't think by the way
3094000	3096000	I mean on hypocrisy
3096000	3098000	for instance
3098000	3100000	I can see a scenario where somebody might say
3100000	3102000	oh Douglas you're hypocritical on this
3102000	3104000	particular question I might say well
3104000	3106000	there are some things I think are even more important
3106000	3108000	than not being a hypocrite such as
3108000	3110000	I don't know surviving
3110000	3112000	the worst thing about him is his hypocrisy
3112000	3114000	hypocrisy
3114000	3116000	there's a weird
3116000	3118000	hypocrisy is the easiest one to catch people on
3118000	3120000	is the truth of that
3120000	3122000	it's the easiest one to spot
3122000	3124000	you just
3124000	3126000	and they do it
3126000	3128000	as you say on this is what this person said
3128000	3130000	20 years ago this is what they say now
3130000	3132000	get human being in growing up
3132000	3134000	shocker
3134000	3136000	people
3136000	3138000	are allowed to evolve
3138000	3140000	they change their minds
3140000	3142000	it would be rather boring to say the same thing
3142000	3144000	and think the same thing only for
3144000	3146000	70 years
3146000	3148000	but yeah people find
3148000	3150000	hypocrisy very easy to see
3150000	3152000	and it's about the only vice you can really catch somebody on
3152000	3154000	I think
3154000	3156000	because if you say one thing publicly
3156000	3158000	and do another thing privately
3158000	3160000	it's about the only one that people are really confident on
3160000	3162000	or most other
3162000	3164000	moral judgments are better or worse
3164000	3166000	of sort of ebbed away but people still
3166000	3168000	are able to judge hypocrisy
3168000	3170000	but
3170000	3172000	I think
3172000	3174000	there are worse things
3174000	3176000	I think not standing up for your
3176000	3178000	loved ones not standing up for your country
3178000	3180000	not standing up for
3180000	3182000	yourselves in the face of
3182000	3184000	horrible opposition
3184000	3186000	from within without probably worse than hypocrisy
3186000	3188000	I heard you say recently you don't have to agree
3188000	3190000	with everyone's principle to respect the principle
3190000	3192000	they're sticking to
3192000	3194000	did I say that? yeah sounds good
3194000	3196000	I didn't know I said that but yeah
3196000	3198000	but the reason that I like that
3198000	3200000	is
3200000	3202000	I think it shows
3202000	3204000	why
3206000	3208000	the bravery conversation
3208000	3210000	or standing up for something that you believe in
3210000	3212000	is something that is a pride
3212000	3214000	at least then if someone is prepared to stand up for
3214000	3216000	whatever their beliefs are
3216000	3218000	that you can assume they're telling the truth
3218000	3220000	especially if they pay a high price for it
3220000	3222000	it's one of the reasons why I have
3222000	3224000	a good amount of faith that Sam believes
3224000	3226000	the things that he says
3226000	3228000	why would he not? he pays an unbelievably
3228000	3230000	high price to continue to flip flop
3230000	3232000	from one tribe to another tribe
3232000	3234000	to another tribe
3234000	3236000	I don't think it's an unbelievably high price but a price
3236000	3238000	relatively high price
3238000	3240000	I mean very early
3240000	3242000	in some people's careers or when people first make it
3242000	3244000	to public notice people say things like
3244000	3246000	do you really believe what you say
3246000	3248000	the answer to which for most people
3248000	3250000	is or ought to be well why would I say it
3250000	3252000	if I didn't believe it
3252000	3254000	there are people who obviously do say stuff
3254000	3256000	for lolls
3256000	3258000	or clicks or monetary purpose
3258000	3260000	but at a certain point
3260000	3262000	you've got to accept that the person thinks what they think
3262000	3264000	and you know
3264000	3266000	respect them for it or at least do them the decency
3266000	3268000	of believing that they mean it
3268000	3270000	and I think that even on people I disagree with
3270000	3272000	wildly I mean it's such a boring argument
3272000	3274000	that one some people use it particularly on the left
3274000	3276000	I wonder if they actually even believe it
3276000	3278000	I think they don't I think they're just doing it for money
3278000	3280000	well that's an easier way to try to ignore them
3280000	3282000	than actually trying to contend with the possibility
3282000	3284000	of what they're saying is something they mean
3284000	3286000	and believe and trying to work out if there's anything in it
3286000	3288000	much easier to say the person's
3288000	3290000	only doing it because they're paid or something
3290000	3292000	yeah that's the
3292000	3294000	shill grifter accusation
3294000	3296000	very boring accusation
3296000	3298000	I don't doubt there are some people who that is the case with
3298000	3300000	but way fewer than
3300000	3302000	way fewer than people think
3302000	3304000	Michael Malis has a hierarchy
3304000	3306000	of different
3306000	3308000	I think it's like the hierarchy of grifters
3308000	3310000	if you say Michael Malis my face immediately
3310000	3312000	sort of starts to smile
3312000	3314000	it's terrible
3314000	3316000	one of the it's like
3316000	3318000	industry plant
3318000	3320000	paid opposition
3320000	3322000	it goes all the way up
3322000	3324000	and he said that he descended recently
3324000	3326000	he's not quite at paid opposition but I think he's industry plant now
3326000	3328000	I think Lex Friedman is
3328000	3330000	paid opposition
3330000	3332000	his paid is different from
3332000	3334000	controlled opposition
3334000	3336000	maybe it's controlled opposition I don't fucking know
3336000	3338000	these are such weird
3338000	3340000	terms that are cropped up in our area
3340000	3342000	again I think they're sort of low
3342000	3344000	resolution explanations
3344000	3346000	really really low resolution
3346000	3348000	explanations for things
3348000	3350000	whenever I hear somebody describe things as that
3350000	3352000	I always sort of know you're not dealing with somebody who actually understands the world
3352000	3354000	do you find there's a
3354000	3356000	definitely a trend of
3356000	3358000	conspiratorial thinking
3358000	3360000	conspiracism
3360000	3362000	much stronger in our adopted
3362000	3364000	homeland than it is in the UK
3364000	3366000	yes that's true
3366000	3368000	what do you think
3368000	3370000	are you
3370000	3372000	how conspiracy-pilled are you
3372000	3374000	do you see
3374000	3376000	I mean it's
3376000	3378000	this is the moment when people say
3378000	3380000	ahhh controlled opposition
3380000	3382000	hahahaha
3382000	3384000	this is me allowing you to graduate
3384000	3386000	I think I talked about this on the boys cast
3386000	3388000	that's right
3388000	3390000	briefly and
3390000	3392000	various people wrote to me saying ah there you go
3392000	3394000	that's proof that you're paid
3394000	3396000	you're glowing as it's called
3396000	3398000	you heard you're glowing
3398000	3400000	so
3400000	3402000	tell me if I'm wrong with this Mark
3402000	3404000	you're the resident glow expert
3404000	3406000	but you're glowing
3406000	3408000	means you're like a
3408000	3410000	planted
3410000	3412000	person who's saying
3412000	3414000	something that is outing there
3414000	3416000	like
3418000	3420000	it's an intelligence operation
3420000	3422000	that's breached the surface and people can see it
3422000	3424000	they comment on tiktok saying
3424000	3426000	you're glowing
3426000	3428000	the people that alleged to be FBI
3428000	3430000	who are at certain protests
3430000	3432000	or wearing chinos and t-shirts
3432000	3434000	yeah
3434000	3436000	so you're conspiratorial
3436000	3438000	the thing with conspiracy theories is very difficult
3438000	3440000	in our era because some of the conspiracies are true
3440000	3442000	of course have come true
3442000	3444000	well known to be true
3444000	3446000	lab leak conspiracy
3446000	3448000	theory probably true
3448000	3450000	they shouldn't have ever called
3450000	3452000	nobody should ever have called it a conspiracy theory
3452000	3454000	because it wasn't a conspiracy theory
3454000	3456000	it was one of a set of hypotheticals
3456000	3458000	to explain what happened
3458000	3460000	with covid
3460000	3462000	so a lot of things get called
3462000	3464000	conspiracy which are not
3464000	3466000	they're just hypotheses
3466000	3468000	that should be allowed to remain on the table
3468000	3470000	and that makes a certain type of person increasingly prone
3470000	3472000	to believe
3472000	3474000	that everything that's called a conspiracy theory
3474000	3476000	is not a conspiracy theory
3476000	3478000	and before you know it you get
3478000	3480000	sanish individuals thinking
3480000	3482000	that the moon landings were a conspiracy
3482000	3484000	that we didn't land on the moon
3484000	3486000	the American didn't land on the moon
3486000	3488000	I don't know whether the people who now claim that
3488000	3490000	believe that the Russians also faked it
3490000	3492000	it's an interesting question to ask them
3492000	3494000	do you think that the soviets
3494000	3496000	were capable of getting to the moon but the Americans were not
3496000	3498000	the Americans set up
3498000	3500000	like a blow fan
3500000	3502000	and a flag on a dodgy
3502000	3504000	papier-mache set
3504000	3506000	to make it or did the Soviets and Americans both agree
3506000	3508000	to pretend to have gone to the moon but not really
3508000	3510000	have gone
3510000	3512000	none of it makes sense to my mind
3512000	3514000	but I have noticed
3514000	3516000	and it's actually all the literature that demonstrates
3516000	3518000	that there's certain types of mental
3518000	3520000	problems
3520000	3522000	that people have that make them
3522000	3524000	disproportionately likely to believe conspiracy theories
3524000	3526000	on
3526000	3528000	mass
3528000	3530000	and one of them is paranoia
3530000	3532000	the more paranoid a person is
3532000	3534000	more likely to believe that sort of thing
3534000	3536000	and that's the observation in my own life
3536000	3538000	I've known a number of people who've gone into the world
3538000	3540000	of conspiracy and not come out
3540000	3542000	and they are all people who have suffered
3542000	3544000	paranoid episodes in their lives
3544000	3546000	which adds up
3546000	3548000	so fear and genders
3548000	3550000	as I say
3550000	3552000	it's a sort of low resolution explanation
3552000	3554000	for complex phenomena
3554000	3556000	and I think
3556000	3558000	it's also that
3558000	3560000	conspiracy theories come about and are used
3560000	3562000	by people who
3562000	3564000	and this isn't an original point many people have made
3564000	3566000	the claims about them
3566000	3568000	are made by and large
3568000	3570000	by people who
3570000	3572000	don't understand how unbelievably
3572000	3574000	chaotic the world actually is
3574000	3576000	or can't face it
3578000	3580000	so
3580000	3582000	they can't face the fact that
3582000	3584000	yeah somebody you followed in the newspapers every day
3584000	3586000	all of your life did actually just die in a
3586000	3588000	freak car crash because the driver was drunk
3588000	3590000	they can't bear the idea
3590000	3592000	the world can't be that cruel
3592000	3594000	it can't be that random
3594000	3596000	you want a bed
3596000	3598000	it's got to be coordination it can't be coincident
3598000	3600000	exactly
3600000	3602000	so people who can't cope
3602000	3604000	with the wild frivolity of the roulette
3604000	3606000	table of our lives
3606000	3608000	um
3608000	3610000	always go to the there must be somebody behind it
3610000	3612000	there must be somebody who's controlling all this
3612000	3614000	you're joking nobody's controlling this
3614000	3616000	if anyone's controlling the damn thing I'd want to know by now
3616000	3618000	but of course they're not
3618000	3620000	so it's a very unsatisfactory
3620000	3622000	place to arrive at in your life
3622000	3624000	and by the way
3624000	3626000	my own observation is not very good for people personally
3626000	3628000	because they start to lose agency
3628000	3630000	themselves
3630000	3632000	I'm at the mercy of the world
3632000	3634000	and the real answer is
3634000	3636000	the world doesn't care
3636000	3638000	doesn't even know that you exist
3638000	3640000	it is deaf to you
3640000	3642000	the ability
3642000	3644000	for people to hold two conflicting thoughts
3644000	3646000	in their mind at the same time is supposed to be the mark
3646000	3648000	of sophisticated thinking
3648000	3650000	but it does show up here
3650000	3652000	which is the government is both
3652000	3654000	so useless that they can't get anything right
3654000	3656000	and so sophisticated that they're able to coordinate these
3656000	3658000	oh that's masses of versions the Arab world
3658000	3660000	is filled with that the Muslim world
3660000	3662000	is filled with that things like
3662000	3664000	I've noticed this repeated on my travels things like
3664000	3666000	um 9-11
3666000	3668000	was an inside job of the Americans
3668000	3670000	to allow the Jews out of the World Trade Center
3670000	3672000	and also yay 9-11
3672000	3674000	good for Osama bin Laden
3674000	3676000	they can do both
3676000	3678000	uh there's a somebody I
3678000	3680000	knew interviewed the father
3680000	3682000	of um
3682000	3684000	the main 9-11 hijacker
3684000	3686000	his name's gone out of my mind I don't care
3686000	3688000	he must he should be forgotten but
3688000	3690000	interviewed the father in Jordan
3690000	3692000	and he was simultaneously capable
3692000	3694000	of holding in his head that his son was a great
3694000	3696000	Shahid Amater for Islam
3696000	3698000	and that 9-11
3698000	3700000	was an inside job of the Americans
3700000	3702000	well what the fuck
3702000	3704000	like choose
3704000	3706000	it's I mean
3706000	3708000	do you think your son was an agent of the FBI
3708000	3710000	and also a
3710000	3712000	martyr like hey
3712000	3714000	people do this the Muslim world is particularly
3714000	3716000	prone to conspiratorial thinking
3716000	3718000	because it's a
3718000	3720000	source of flattery to itself
3720000	3722000	to explain why they have
3722000	3724000	created so few successful societies
3726000	3728000	and Bernard Lewis made this point many years
3728000	3730000	ago that the problem in the Muslim
3730000	3732000	world is that there's a they have to
3732000	3734000	find explanations because
3734000	3736000	if you're given the revelations of Muhammad
3736000	3738000	and you're told it's the last revelation ever from God
3738000	3740000	and that you are the people who have
3740000	3742000	received this revelation and everything's
3742000	3744000	going to go great for you because you've got the revelation
3744000	3746000	and then like the Jews you have one
3746000	3748000	country that does much better than any of your
3748000	3750000	countries and you know you
3750000	3752000	can't get the economy of
3752000	3754000	most of your country going at all and you can't
3754000	3756000	provide for most of your citizenry and nobody
3756000	3758000	is coming up the ladder and the economies
3758000	3760000	in the dust and all this you've got to
3760000	3762000	find an explanation for it because like what
3762000	3764000	we were given the revelation and
3764000	3766000	they're doing much better
3766000	3768000	there's massive
3768000	3770000	things like that that sit underneath the
3770000	3772000	movements of our time which
3772000	3774000	maybe billions of
3774000	3776000	people on the planet believe
3776000	3778000	and they believe them because it flatters themselves
3778000	3780000	it flatters the governments
3780000	3782000	who aspire to run these countries
3782000	3784000	or claim to run these countries
3784000	3786000	um yeah
3786000	3788000	billions of people believe this
3788000	3790000	shit. I was thinking
3790000	3792000	about
3792000	3794000	the extremist world view beliefs
3794000	3796000	largely in the west but
3796000	3798000	I guess everywhere and I was wondering
3798000	3800000	whether
3800000	3802000	we have finally moved beyond peak woke
3802000	3804000	and a study came up
3804000	3806000	recently that was kind of interesting
3806000	3808000	researchers from change research
3808000	3810000	polled over a thousand registered US
3810000	3812000	voters from 18 to 34
3812000	3814000	a majority of both women and men
3814000	3816000	consider far rightism and far leftism
3816000	3818000	to be red flags in a potential partner
3818000	3820000	76% of women and 59% of men
3820000	3822000	consider identifying as a MAGA Republican
3822000	3824000	to be a large turnoff
3824000	3826000	64% of men and 55% of women
3826000	3828000	say they'd also swipe left on someone
3828000	3830000	identifying as a communist
3830000	3832000	55% of women
3832000	3834000	64% of men and 55% of women
3834000	3836000	swipe left on a communist that's a no
3836000	3838000	55% of men said that listening
3838000	3840000	to Joe Rogan was a red flag
3840000	3842000	41% of men
3842000	3844000	said the same for a woman
3844000	3846000	being into astrology
3846000	3848000	oh well that's now you're going with that one
3848000	3850000	if somebody says what's your start sign
3850000	3852000	date over
3852000	3854000	there's a really famous
3854000	3856000	meme where
3856000	3858000	it's on iMessage and the
3858000	3860000	text says
3860000	3862000	mum
3862000	3864000	what time was I born at
3864000	3866000	and the reply from mum says
3866000	3868000	stay the fuck away from that girl
3868000	3870000	the heart
3870000	3872000	sinks when it comes up
3872000	3874000	it's a question
3874000	3876000	for shame
3876000	3878000	33% of men
3878000	3880000	said
3880000	3882000	for Black Lives Matter it was a red flag
3882000	3884000	if they say Black Lives Matter 14% of women
3884000	3886000	53% of women said
3886000	3888000	it was a red flag if they refused
3888000	3890000	to see the Barbie movie
3890000	3892000	31% of men
3892000	3894000	58% of women
3894000	3896000	red flag if they say there are only
3896000	3898000	32 genders
3898000	3900000	34% of men
3900000	3902000	54% of women thought they identify as a
3902000	3904000	conservative
3904000	3906000	33% of men for they identify as a liberal
3906000	3908000	so next time you're vibing with someone
3908000	3910000	maybe save the podcast recommendations
3910000	3912000	and daily horoscopes for the second date
3912000	3914000	55% of women
3914000	3916000	say that listening to Joe Rogan was a red flag
3916000	3918000	I wonder if the species has any
3918000	3920000	future
3920000	3922000	because they can't listen to Joe Rogan
3922000	3924000	or anything else
3924000	3926000	these people are wiping out
3926000	3928000	very significant numbers
3928000	3930000	of potential future partners
3932000	3934000	how weird
3934000	3936000	Joe turning up in that
3936000	3938000	that's amazing
3938000	3940000	what happened to all the good old people
3940000	3942000	who used to say I don't have an opinion on that
3942000	3944000	what happened to those guys
3944000	3946000	I got pulled in
3946000	3948000	a good bit recently
3948000	3950000	on the internet for
3950000	3952000	not commenting on the recent
3952000	3954000	socio-political
3954000	3956000	furor that's happening in the Middle East
3956000	3958000	and I quoted you
3958000	3960000	pseudonymously
3960000	3962000	and said
3962000	3964000	I'm trying to make a habit of something which is very rare on the internet
3964000	3966000	to not comment on something which I know nothing about
3966000	3968000	it's a very good rule
3968000	3970000	and yet
3970000	3972000	it's the rarest
3972000	3974000	thing of all
3974000	3976000	people care about my
3976000	3978000	insights into health
3978000	3980000	and fitness
3980000	3982000	my learnings about
3982000	3984000	social psychology
3984000	3986000	why shouldn't my fiscal advice
3986000	3988000	be important
3988000	3990000	why shouldn't my views on immigration
3990000	3992000	it's much to be avoided that
3992000	3994000	I mean in the end
3994000	3996000	you make much less of a dick of yourself
3996000	3998000	if you don't start talking about everything
3998000	4000000	there's
4000000	4002000	I mean
4002000	4004000	somebody recently
4004000	4006000	sent me an article
4006000	4008000	a relatively well known person
4008000	4010000	published about the Middle East
4010000	4012000	and near the opening said
4012000	4014000	I don't really know much
4014000	4016000	about the Middle East
4016000	4018000	but this is
4018000	4020000	in that case don't speak
4020000	4022000	don't speak and say but
4022000	4024000	if you don't know
4024000	4026000	just agree not to do it
4026000	4028000	that's one reason
4028000	4030000	why there's a lot of
4030000	4032000	television these days in the UK
4032000	4034000	where you can be invited on
4034000	4036000	to debate
4036000	4038000	the total ignoramus who's only there
4038000	4040000	for balance
4040000	4042000	for off-comrelated balance
4042000	4044000	and I just can't do that stuff anymore
4044000	4046000	it's too
4046000	4048000	demeaning
4048000	4050000	that if there's a subject you know about
4050000	4052000	a war that you've covered
4052000	4054000	or covered many times
4054000	4056000	as in my case with Israel
4056000	4058000	Hamas wars
4058000	4060000	and Israel Hezbollah wars
4060000	4062000	I just can't be sitting there
4062000	4064000	with somebody
4064000	4066000	in a basic way but there's a lot of
4066000	4068000	women
4068000	4070000	who are currently invited on things for balance
4070000	4072000	firstly because they're women
4072000	4074000	secondly because they provide usually a left-wing perspective
4074000	4076000	and that's needed if it's me
4076000	4078000	that's on as well
4078000	4080000	and you know I just is so depressing
4080000	4082000	to give your informed opinion
4082000	4084000	about something you've seen and reported on first hand
4084000	4086000	and then they go to the other person
4086000	4088000	and they go well like
4088000	4090000	I think it's
4090000	4092000	why don't I just at home
4092000	4094000	why I could be doing
4094000	4096000	anything else
4096000	4098000	and I've got to listen to somebody who doesn't know
4098000	4100000	what they're talking about whisk up an opinion
4100000	4102000	live on air
4102000	4104000	it's so depressing
4104000	4106000	but masses of people are like that and it's just
4106000	4108000	yeah
4108000	4110000	if you don't know about it don't talk about it
4110000	4112000	it's a very good law of thumb or try it out in private
4112000	4114000	with friends and mates and like
4114000	4116000	try to learn something read a book
4116000	4118000	are we morally obliged to
4118000	4120000	have a take on everything
4120000	4122000	no
4122000	4124000	no
4124000	4126000	most people's opinion doesn't matter
4126000	4128000	I mean it just doesn't
4128000	4130000	and I also think
4130000	4132000	the people who spend their time online
4132000	4134000	broadly speaking
4134000	4136000	trying to broadcast out their opinions on things
4136000	4138000	should be told more often
4138000	4140000	doesn't matter
4140000	4142000	doesn't matter what you think
4142000	4144000	I mean one of my rules on
4144000	4146000	on any war
4146000	4148000	is
4148000	4150000	to write a try to give advice to a government
4150000	4152000	you know
4152000	4154000	this is what the Israelis must do
4154000	4156000	this is what the Ukrainians must do
4156000	4158000	I need to listen to you
4158000	4160000	I mean
4160000	4162000	first of all you don't live in the country
4162000	4164000	unless you live in a country
4164000	4166000	be pretty damn sure
4166000	4168000	you should be a bit humble
4168000	4170000	about telling other people about
4170000	4172000	their lives
4172000	4174000	and also like who made you
4174000	4176000	the tactician
4176000	4178000	on everything
4178000	4180000	well it was the same as Covid
4180000	4182000	everyone became a virology or epidemiology expert
4182000	4184000	and then they became a withdrawal from
4184000	4186000	Afghanistan expert
4186000	4188000	and then they became a Ukraine expert
4188000	4190000	and now they're all Middle East experts
4190000	4192000	and I just think
4192000	4194000	it should be regarded as a massive red flag
4194000	4196000	that the person in question is
4196000	4198000	normally what's happened is they've downloaded
4198000	4200000	the set of opinions they believe that their tribe
4200000	4202000	should have
4202000	4204000	and that's why the morons marching in London
4204000	4206000	with the exception of the Muslims who just whipped up all the time
4206000	4208000	by the fact that the Jews do anything
4208000	4210000	Muslims don't care about other Muslims
4210000	4212000	Arabs don't care about other Arabs
4212000	4214000	nobody cares about the Palestinians
4214000	4216000	nobody cares about them
4216000	4218000	can't tell you how little they care about them
4218000	4220000	Jordanians loathe them
4220000	4222000	the Egyptians loathe them
4222000	4224000	the Lebanese loathe them
4224000	4226000	they've done nothing for the Palestinians
4226000	4228000	for 70 years
4228000	4230000	and yet
4230000	4232000	whenever the Israelis do anything
4232000	4234000	more Muslims across the west come out on the streets
4234000	4236000	because they hate the Jews
4236000	4238000	and you know
4238000	4240000	hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in Yemen
4240000	4242000	not a peep
4242000	4244000	on the streets of Britain and other places
4244000	4246000	certainly not big protests
4246000	4248000	Bashar al-Assad has killed more Muslims
4248000	4250000	in the last 10 years
4250000	4252000	then everybody on every side killed
4252000	4254000	in every war involving Israel
4254000	4256000	since 1948 including the war of independence
4256000	4258000	nobody cares
4258000	4260000	the Muslims don't come out on the streets
4260000	4262000	they don't care
4262000	4264000	the only thing they care about
4264000	4266000	is the hatred of the Jews
4266000	4268000	and it motivates them like nothing else
4268000	4270000	because it hits at the core of their self-esteem
4270000	4272000	they can't bear it
4272000	4274000	and so that one is
4274000	4276000	very interesting to me
4276000	4278000	but
4278000	4280000	there are these fellow travelers
4280000	4282000	who go along with them
4282000	4284000	who have downloaded as I say
4284000	4286000	a sort of pathetic American interpretation
4286000	4288000	of colonization
4288000	4290000	called justice, reproductive rights
4290000	4292000	and try to map everything on
4292000	4294000	and
4294000	4296000	my friend's got a theory called
4296000	4298000	Gwinda's theory of bespoke bullshit
4298000	4300000	many don't have an opinion
4300000	4302000	until they're asked for it
4302000	4304000	at which point they cobble together a viewpoint
4304000	4306000	from women half remembered hearsay
4306000	4308000	before deciding that this two minute
4308000	4310000	two minute old makeshift opinion
4310000	4312000	will be their new hill to die on
4312000	4314000	that's very good
4314000	4316000	my friend Freddie Gray at the Spectator
4316000	4318000	he says each time a new big thing emerges
4318000	4320000	which is the Bluffer's Guide
4320000	4322000	to whatever
4322000	4324000	and it usually involves
4324000	4326000	saying things like
4326000	4328000	well they better get this done before the brutal
4328000	4330000	Afghan winter kicks in
4332000	4334000	who made you an expert on like
4334000	4336000	meteorology in Afghanistan
4336000	4338000	like what?
4338000	4340000	the Ukrainians have got to make this advance
4340000	4342000	before the dreaded Ukrainian May
4342000	4344000	and I just
4344000	4346000	I mean I tried
4346000	4348000	the Bluffer's Guide
4348000	4350000	I try for instance never to write
4350000	4352000	about any foreign policy issue
4352000	4354000	if it's about a country I've not visited
4354000	4356000	preferably visited multiple times
4356000	4358000	I just
4358000	4360000	I can't bring myself to do it
4360000	4362000	I find it too embarrassing
4362000	4364000	it's so interesting when you talk about
4364000	4366000	knowing
4366000	4368000	one opinion that a person holds
4368000	4370000	and from that one opinion being able to accurately predict
4370000	4372000	everything else that they believe
4372000	4374000	that mono thinking
4374000	4376000	just proves that you're not a serious thinker
4376000	4378000	well I just
4378000	4380000	it's fairly obvious if for instance you say
4380000	4382000	what's the problem with the big bearded guy
4382000	4384000	winning the women's weightlifting
4384000	4386000	I go okay I know all of your other opinions as well
4386000	4388000	and to be fair
4388000	4390000	that probably works the other way around as well to a great extent
4390000	4392000	the interesting thing with
4392000	4394000	most people is where they're slightly out of sorts
4394000	4396000	with their own political side
4396000	4398000	well that's exactly the point
4398000	4400000	that
4400000	4402000	if it's been a long time since
4402000	4404000	you were surprised
4404000	4406000	by the opinion of your favorite
4406000	4408000	thinker or writer or commentator
4408000	4410000	or whatever it is
4410000	4412000	that's probably a reliable signal
4412000	4414000	that they're not really thinking for themselves
4414000	4416000	if you're just permanently
4416000	4418000	it's like an old leather pair of shoes
4418000	4420000	here we go again
4420000	4422000	the covid things happened and I can already predict
4422000	4424000	such and such is
4424000	4426000	opinion on it
4426000	4428000	every single time
4428000	4430000	you know the idiosyncrasies of this person's
4430000	4432000	very very particular
4432000	4434000	worldview
4434000	4436000	well that's because it's not theirs
4436000	4438000	yeah of course it's everybody else's
4438000	4440000	it's outsourced thinking
4440000	4442000	and what's really sad about that is that
4442000	4444000	it means that you're not really living your life
4444000	4446000	I mean you're living a
4446000	4448000	pastiche of
4448000	4450000	a prescribed set of opinions
4450000	4452000	that's so sad, I mean it's so sad
4452000	4454000	the wasted energies and wasted lives
4454000	4456000	of people who've just
4456000	4458000	excluded a set of opinions and they're just
4458000	4460000	running them
4460000	4462000	well that's not your life, it's just someone else's life
4462000	4464000	you're just replaying
4464000	4466000	what was that quote you told me about
4466000	4468000	being shunted to the side of the road of your own
4468000	4470000	it's a Philip Larkin quote
4470000	4472000	from a poem of his, yeah it's a description
4472000	4474000	of a couple and he says that something is
4474000	4476000	pushing them to the side of their own lives
4476000	4478000	it's a beautiful line
4478000	4480000	terrifying line, horrifying line
4480000	4482000	should make everyone
4482000	4484000	judge for themselves
4484000	4486000	oh well it means
4486000	4488000	that there's a life that you
4488000	4490000	hoped to live
4490000	4492000	you saw yourself living
4492000	4494000	and you got pushed to the side
4494000	4496000	of it and ended up not living that life
4496000	4498000	I think
4498000	4500000	a large number of people have that
4500000	4502000	almost all unhappy people I've met
4502000	4504000	have that feeling to some extent
4504000	4506000	and then you've got a
4506000	4508000	choice of poisons, one of which is to
4508000	4510000	choose the poison of
4510000	4512000	other people held me back
4512000	4514000	another is to face up to the fact
4514000	4516000	that you're in some way a coward
4516000	4518000	or a victim of
4518000	4520000	circumstance or something else
4520000	4522000	but I think a lot, I mean
4522000	4524000	you know one thing that young people
4524000	4526000	can be encouraged to do is to set out
4526000	4528000	the sort of life they would like to live
4528000	4530000	imagine the sort of life they would like to live and the name for it
4530000	4532000	and
4532000	4534000	working it out is sometimes difficult, sometimes not
4534000	4536000	but if you do
4536000	4538000	have that image of your life that you think
4538000	4540000	it should be lived and you end up
4540000	4542000	not living it, that is
4542000	4544000	particularly if you can feel yourself slowly being pushed away from it
4544000	4546000	I think that's a
4546000	4548000	terrible, terrible feeling
4548000	4550000	it's like watching your own demise
4550000	4552000	occur second by second
4552000	4554000	fortunately I've never felt it but I definitely fear it
4554000	4556000	where do you go
4556000	4558000	to find
4558000	4560000	or to avoid cowardice or to find
4560000	4562000	resilience or
4562000	4564000	bravery because a lot of the time
4564000	4566000	the easier path is easier
4566000	4568000	and it's the one that's got the least resistance
4568000	4570000	surround yourself with courageous people
4570000	4572000	surround yourself
4572000	4574000	with brave people
4574000	4576000	and that can be
4576000	4578000	bravery of all sorts of different kinds
4578000	4580000	when I turned 40
4580000	4582000	I had a dinner
4582000	4584000	which I think you weren't invited to
4584000	4586000	but it's only because you weren't in town
4586000	4588000	if I remember rightly but
4588000	4590000	I did get a lot of my favourite people in the room
4590000	4592000	at least and it was interesting that
4592000	4594000	a friend
4594000	4596000	made a speech in which he said it's striking
4596000	4598000	the names of the people around the table
4598000	4600000	but some of whom will be familiar to listeners
4600000	4602000	but a friend of mine gave a very touching
4602000	4604000	speech I was very moved by
4604000	4606000	how noticeable it was that Douglas surrounded himself
4606000	4608000	with courageous people
4608000	4610000	and it was from a very wide array
4610000	4612000	of bits of the world
4612000	4614000	and different disciplines and so on and I was really touched by that
4614000	4616000	because I hadn't particularly noticed that I'd done it
4618000	4620000	but then I realized I sort of had
4620000	4622000	that actually yes I had
4622000	4624000	a massive subconsciously but maybe now consciously
4624000	4626000	I wanted to be around courageous people
4626000	4628000	because I think that courage is something that rubs off on other people
4628000	4630000	I think it's enormously
4630000	4632000	to be desired
4632000	4634000	to be around courageous people
4634000	4636000	and there might be different types of courage
4636000	4638000	some of it physical, some of it
4638000	4640000	mental
4640000	4642000	so
4642000	4644000	that's one thing, surround yourself with courageous people
4644000	4646000	or at least not cowards
4646000	4648000	not cretins, not the sort of people who just
4648000	4650000	say the same things that everyone's meant to say
4650000	4652000	and so on. There's as many ways people
4652000	4654000	can get out of this non-life
4654000	4656000	that they are being shunted into
4656000	4658000	one of my friends
4658000	4660000	it wasn't a friend at the time
4660000	4662000	I just met him for the first time but someone that had been
4662000	4664000	interested in for a good while
4664000	4666000	I met in Austin a while ago
4666000	4668000	and
4668000	4670000	he'd had an interesting story and he'd
4670000	4672000	faced a cancellation over the last few years
4672000	4674000	and he'd sort of told me the
4674000	4676000	story and he said
4676000	4678000	he sat on some rooftop
4678000	4680000	later
4680000	4682000	late at night talking about this thing
4682000	4684000	and he was regaling me with the story
4684000	4686000	and he said throughout my entire life I thought I was a hard man
4686000	4688000	I like to
4688000	4690000	do man things and surround myself with masculine
4690000	4692000	people and I was into
4692000	4694000	guns and shooting and fitness
4694000	4696000	and friends with navy seals and all the rest of it
4696000	4698000	and he said my entire life I was scared that I was a coward
4700000	4702000	terrified that I was a coward
4702000	4704000	and he said
4704000	4706000	in my darker moments
4706000	4708000	I could always hear my better self
4708000	4710000	clearing his throat in the room next door
4710000	4712000	beautiful
4712000	4714000	and then this cancellation thing came along
4714000	4716000	and he said
4716000	4718000	even the people that do really hard things
4718000	4720000	hard intellectual work
4720000	4722000	hard training work, hard physical work
4722000	4724000	all the rest of it
4724000	4726000	there's a difference in the kind of difficulty
4726000	4728000	that they do because it's elected
4728000	4730000	you've chosen to do the hard
4730000	4732000	workout but when
4732000	4734000	the entire world comes to bear
4734000	4736000	on you
4736000	4738000	in a way that feels like chaos and catastrophe
4738000	4740000	whipped up into a whirlwind
4740000	4742000	and he said
4742000	4744000	yeah I
4744000	4746000	that was a genuine test
4746000	4748000	and he was
4748000	4750000	very grateful he said my better self
4750000	4752000	stopped his coughing and
4752000	4754000	kicked the door in and came to help
4754000	4756000	but just
4756000	4758000	I could always hear my better self clearing
4758000	4760000	his throat in the room next door
4760000	4762000	the thing with that is
4762000	4764000	the difference between
4764000	4766000	situations
4766000	4768000	you find yourself in that are dangerous
4768000	4770000	through choice and
4770000	4772000	ones that you've
4772000	4774000	been thrust into
4774000	4776000	and you probably know
4776000	4778000	that the consequence of being
4778000	4780000	thrust into a dangerous situation is much more
4780000	4782000	likely to lead to
4782000	4784000	PTSD and things like that
4784000	4786000	than
4786000	4788000	if you choose to
4788000	4790000	and
4790000	4792000	I've been fortunate in my life the most
4792000	4794000	dangerous situations I've been in have been ones I've chosen
4794000	4796000	to be in
4796000	4798000	and that's very different
4800000	4802000	but yes I'm glad he found
4802000	4804000	out that he was more
4804000	4806000	courageous than he feared
4806000	4808000	think about that what a beautiful line
4808000	4810000	to be more courageous than you feared
4810000	4812000	you were
4812000	4814000	almost this war
4814000	4816000	against yourself
4816000	4818000	this fear of your own
4818000	4820000	nature
4820000	4822000	I mean there's a horrible example I sometimes use
4822000	4824000	but I mean
4824000	4826000	if you're ever mugged
4826000	4828000	for your wallet let alone you're mugged with
4828000	4830000	somebody else let alone if you're mugged with a girl
4830000	4832000	that you were with or looking after and you just handed it over
4832000	4834000	there's like there's several reasons
4834000	4836000	that it's worth handing over the wallet for
4836000	4838000	one of which is like
4838000	4840000	why do I need to risk getting shot for like
4840000	4842000	or stabbed for a hundred
4842000	4844000	bucks and a
4844000	4846000	few phone calls to the bank
4846000	4848000	so that's like the reason
4848000	4850000	to hand over the wallet
4852000	4854000	the reason not to hand over the wallet
4856000	4858000	is are you sure that you're not going
4858000	4860000	to spend the succeeding weeks
4860000	4862000	dreaming dreams of pornographic violence
4862000	4864000	against your attacker
4864000	4866000	and thinking
4866000	4868000	thinking of how you're going to torture him
4868000	4870000	if you could get your hands on him and the brutal way
4870000	4872000	in which you would have revenge if you ever
4872000	4874000	find him
4874000	4876000	it might be easy to just get your head kicked in a bit
4876000	4878000	and are you sure you can live with
4878000	4880000	the version of yourself that is you handing over the wallet
4880000	4882000	I said this recently in a piece in New York Post
4882000	4884000	about the people on the New York subway
4884000	4886000	where there's this awful thing you've probably seen
4886000	4888000	where people you know like a woman
4888000	4890000	will be being abused by some maniac
4890000	4892000	fentanyl-addled
4892000	4894000	you know
4894000	4896000	drug addict and
4896000	4898000	people like either look into their phones
4898000	4900000	including men or they will get their phones
4900000	4902000	up and like record
4902000	4904000	and
4904000	4906000	I said Douglass is trying to get people killed
4906000	4908000	and I wasn't obviously but what I was saying was
4908000	4910000	where are the men
4910000	4912000	just like stand up
4912000	4914000	and like confront the guy if he's
4914000	4916000	got a woman by her hair
4916000	4918000	and is parading around the carriage
4918000	4920000	and
4920000	4922000	yeah the backlash was like
4922000	4924000	what do you know
4924000	4926000	these people might get killed if they step in
4926000	4928000	but might say
4928000	4930000	yeah but also
4930000	4932000	maybe we'll have a more civil society
4932000	4934000	if people don't think they can go around
4934000	4936000	and do this stuff without consequence
4936000	4938000	um
4938000	4940000	I'd like to see
4940000	4942000	far more standing up like that
4942000	4944000	I think it's a pathetic position
4944000	4946000	particularly for men to be in to sit there like
4946000	4948000	getting out their mobile phones
4948000	4950000	but you know it's everyone's choice
4950000	4952000	I don't exactly know what I would do
4952000	4954000	in some of the situations I've seen
4954000	4956000	you know read about on the New York subway
4956000	4958000	didn't that guy do a thing
4958000	4960000	and now is he in jail did he get jailed for it
4960000	4962000	he's charged he's coming up
4962000	4964000	for trial
4964000	4966000	this is a
4966000	4968000	Daniel Needy I think
4968000	4970000	former Marine
4970000	4972000	there was a guy on the subway who was
4972000	4974000	clearly off his head on
4974000	4976000	various drugs
4976000	4978000	was very very violent
4978000	4980000	towards people in the carriage
4980000	4982000	some point tore off his top and was like
4982000	4984000	I'm going to kill you or something like this
4984000	4986000	and this Marine at that point stepped in
4986000	4988000	got him into a choke hold
4988000	4990000	was clearly not meaning to do it
4990000	4992000	but the choke hold was too hard
4992000	4994000	and he
4994000	4996000	suffocated the guy and he died at the scene
4996000	4998000	and that man then the ex-Marine
4998000	5000000	is charged with
5000000	5002000	I think murder if not I think
5002000	5004000	manslaughter
5004000	5006000	um and
5006000	5008000	he could face a very significant prison sentence
5008000	5012000	there's a lot of discussion in New York as to whether or not a New York jury would actually convict him
5012000	5014000	where's he being convicted
5014000	5016000	in New York right
5016000	5018000	um because
5018000	5020000	you could say
5020000	5022000	that the guy
5022000	5024000	because there's a racial element like with everything in America
5024000	5026000	uh and because
5026000	5028000	the former Marine was white
5028000	5030000	and the guy off his head
5030000	5032000	uh was black
5032000	5034000	there was an attempt of course to put the
5034000	5036000	racial lens on it
5036000	5038000	and we'll see if a New York jury
5038000	5040000	which will be comprised
5040000	5042000	half or so of women
5042000	5044000	who have been on the subway
5044000	5046000	who have probably had unpleasant interactions
5046000	5048000	um
5048000	5050000	will convict this man for stepping in
5050000	5052000	and genuinely think that he meant to kill the guy
5052000	5054000	or just
5054000	5056000	this was like a good Samaritan act gone wrong
5056000	5058000	but it's
5058000	5060000	it's very salutary that
5060000	5062000	that sort of stuff
5062000	5064000	there was a guy in London about 15 years ago
5064000	5066000	he very much haunted me because
5066000	5068000	the fiance the girlfriend did a victim impact statement
5068000	5070000	that was particularly harrowing
5070000	5072000	that they were on the top of a bus in London
5072000	5074000	a guy on the bus started throwing chips
5074000	5076000	like people's heads
5076000	5078000	and her fiance
5078000	5080000	got up to say look
5080000	5082000	mate lay off and the guy stabbed him
5082000	5084000	he died
5084000	5086000	and that's an account and in
5086000	5088000	the wake of a story like that a lot more people
5088000	5090000	in the society will be craven on the bus
5090000	5092000	because they'll have
5092000	5094000	that example in their head
5094000	5096000	and my fear about this case in the New York Marine case
5096000	5098000	is that he
5098000	5100000	the Marine by doing what
5100000	5102000	he did and it going wrong
5102000	5104000	and the publicity it got will stop other people
5104000	5106000	doing good Samaritan
5106000	5108000	100% will have done while it's pending
5108000	5110000	while it's pending so a lot rides off
5110000	5112000	the verdict
5112000	5114000	that's a lot of pressure
5114000	5116000	and in America with a jury when you're on one of these
5116000	5118000	cases where the society
5118000	5120000	could break out in rioting I'm not sure
5120000	5122000	it will for this guy because the victim wasn't enormously
5122000	5124000	um
5124000	5126000	upstanding as a member of the community and had
5126000	5128000	I don't think it was videoed or at least they didn't see the
5128000	5130000	quite a lot of it was videoed but he'd also
5130000	5132000	had previous things where he had like done
5132000	5134000	a whole litany like a laundry
5134000	5136000	list of times that he'd been
5136000	5138000	arrested for
5138000	5140000	for violent conduct
5140000	5142000	so he won't be that sympathetic
5142000	5144000	a character but then there are quite a lot of
5144000	5146000	unsympathetic characters who get dragged through
5146000	5148000	the the laundry of racial justice
5148000	5150000	stuff in America and become saints
5150000	5152000	I won't name any names
5152000	5154000	but
5154000	5156000	going back to that sort of way you go when you need more
5156000	5158000	resilience thing and the bravery piece
5158000	5160000	what was that C.S.
5160000	5162000	Lewis quote about
5162000	5164000	about the times not being optimal
5164000	5166000	oh yeah what's that
5166000	5168000	oh that's one of my favorite
5168000	5170000	one of my favorite sermons ever given was by C.S. Lewis
5170000	5172000	University church in Oxford in October
5172000	5174000	1939
5174000	5176000	um yes I love that
5176000	5178000	Lewis was a master of prose
5178000	5180000	as well as theological writing and he
5180000	5182000	um he gave this beautiful beautiful
5182000	5184000	sermon in which he said
5184000	5186000	yes he said um you know the conditions
5186000	5188000	are not optimal at the moment
5188000	5190000	um the search for truth and beauty
5190000	5192000	that our species goes through
5192000	5194000	you know is sort of going through such a trial
5194000	5196000	um but he says the point is the conditions
5196000	5198000	never were optimal they never are
5198000	5200000	he says even those periods of history
5200000	5202000	which which seem to be
5202000	5204000	tranquil
5204000	5206000	like the 19th century
5206000	5208000	turn out on closer inspection to be filled with
5208000	5210000	crises, alarms, panics and all the rest of it
5210000	5212000	he says if
5212000	5214000	human if humankind
5214000	5216000	had put off the search for truth and beauty
5216000	5218000	until the conditions were optimal the search would
5218000	5220000	never have begun
5220000	5222000	and the main point he makes
5222000	5224000	is that
5224000	5226000	um there is something wonderful
5226000	5228000	and unusual about human beings
5228000	5230000	and he says that the ants
5230000	5232000	for instance have chosen their own route
5232000	5234000	they've chosen safety and the security of the
5234000	5236000	hive and presumably
5236000	5238000	they have their rewards
5238000	5240000	but as he says he says men are different
5240000	5242000	and
5242000	5244000	he gives this beautiful list
5244000	5246000	I think I can remember it he says
5246000	5248000	they propound mathematical
5248000	5250000	theorems in the league of cells
5250000	5252000	they quote the latest
5252000	5254000	poem whilst advancing on the walls
5254000	5256000	of Quebec
5256000	5258000	make jokes on scaffolds
5258000	5260000	and comb their hair at the
5260000	5262000	gates of Thermopylae
5262000	5264000	this is not
5264000	5266000	panache he says
5266000	5268000	it is our nature
5270000	5272000	fuck that's cool
5272000	5274000	it's true as well in my observation
5274000	5276000	absolutely true
5276000	5278000	well because I've seen people in
5278000	5280000	beleaguered cities many times
5280000	5282000	cities under fire, cities under bombardment
5282000	5284000	cities that are being raised to the ground
5284000	5286000	and um
5286000	5288000	and human life goes on
5288000	5290000	it's an extraordinary thing
5292000	5294000	people continue their studies if they can
5294000	5296000	people continue their family
5296000	5298000	life if they can
5298000	5300000	they
5300000	5302000	they've realized that the conditions
5302000	5304000	will never be optimal
5304000	5306000	they can be better and they can be worse
5306000	5308000	but they're never perfect and I think that the real
5308000	5310000	lesson of what Lewis is saying is
5310000	5312000	and I think it's an important lesson for young people in our time
5312000	5314000	don't put off whatever it is
5314000	5316000	you're meant to do until the situation is
5316000	5318000	optimal
5318000	5320000	don't
5320000	5322000	fail to pursue what it is you think
5322000	5324000	you're meant to pursue in your life until
5324000	5326000	you have total tranquility
5326000	5328000	for instance you know that you have
5328000	5330000	the house or the apartment you would like until
5330000	5332000	you have the relationship you would like until
5332000	5334000	you have the don't put it off until then
5336000	5338000	or until the world is peaceful
5338000	5340000	which will never
5340000	5342000	happen
5342000	5344000	never happen never has happened never will
5344000	5346000	happen
5346000	5348000	don't put it off till then because if you put it off
5348000	5350000	till then it means you'll put it
5350000	5352000	off forever
5352000	5354000	so do whatever you're meant to be doing now
5354000	5356000	start now if you haven't started already and if you started
5356000	5358000	already don't go any slower
5358000	5360000	for God's sake
5360000	5362000	and this is part of
5362000	5364000	the you know the cost of our
5364000	5366000	times I've said this before
5366000	5368000	but part of the cost of our times
5368000	5370000	is the enormous expense of energy
5370000	5372000	on idiotic things that you can do nothing about
5372000	5374000	I think we should say to more people
5374000	5376000	don't howl at the moon
5376000	5378000	don't shake your fists at the skies
5380000	5382000	get on with what you're meant to be doing
5382000	5384000	and that will be
5384000	5386000	different for everybody
5386000	5388000	but I just
5388000	5390000	I'm very
5392000	5394000	well
5394000	5396000	I'm too irritable to
5396000	5398000	put up with
5398000	5400000	going at the slow speed that a lot of people
5400000	5402000	want to make us all go out these days
5402000	5404000	so
5404000	5406000	I
5406000	5408000	want them out of my way
5408000	5410000	yeah I think a lot about
5410000	5412000	the
5412000	5414000	a rise of victimhood culture
5414000	5416000	and it's got no time for
5416000	5418000	it seems to me that
5418000	5420000	an existential crisis is actually a luxurious position
5420000	5422000	to be in because the bottom levels of
5422000	5424000	Maslow's hierarchy of needs have been sorted
5424000	5426000	and
5426000	5428000	victimhood culture is so rampant
5428000	5430000	at the moment because the human
5430000	5432000	systems
5432000	5434000	demand for challenge
5434000	5436000	is outstripping reality's ability to
5436000	5438000	deliver it to it
5438000	5440000	all of the problems, most of the problems
5440000	5442000	that previously would have captured the front of our
5442000	5444000	attention have been moved out of the way
5444000	5446000	absolutely
5446000	5448000	our sensitivity to challenge has now
5448000	5450000	been tuned up
5454000	5456000	I think that's true, by the way
5456000	5458000	I feel sometimes
5458000	5460000	increasingly like I'm just from a different world
5460000	5462000	than the one we're now in
5462000	5464000	certainly a different society
5464000	5466000	I'm sure it was the same with you
5466000	5468000	when you were growing up but the Britain I grew up
5468000	5470000	in was a place which
5470000	5472000	liked resilience
5472000	5474000	I mean we
5474000	5476000	admired resilience
5476000	5478000	we didn't admire people who
5478000	5480000	whined and mulled
5480000	5482000	in fact those are the people you avoided
5482000	5484000	at all costs
5486000	5488000	ah she's a whiner
5488000	5490000	god he's a whiner
5490000	5492000	you know and people said things like
5492000	5494000	you know
5494000	5496000	that's one of my favourites
5496000	5498000	how are you mustn't grumble
5498000	5500000	now I would say well actually I've got
5500000	5502000	stage 4 cancer
5502000	5504000	I'm not sure that's grumbling
5504000	5506000	I know but we talked about it like that
5506000	5508000	people from that generation still say things
5508000	5510000	I've offended that generation who's got cancer at the moment
5510000	5512000	she's like oh so boring
5512000	5514000	so boring
5516000	5518000	everyone I grew up with was like that
5518000	5520000	now you might say there's something unhealthy about that
5520000	5522000	but there's actually something healthy about it too
5524000	5526000	and
5526000	5528000	there's something healthy about
5528000	5530000	assuming that everyone has their troubles
5530000	5532000	and so they don't need you to add yours to their list
5532000	5534000	of things to worry about that day
5534000	5536000	and you know
5536000	5538000	cheer people up and encourage them where you can
5538000	5540000	and so on and so they don't bring them down
5540000	5542000	it's a weird sort of
5542000	5544000	self-fulfilling prophecy of
5544000	5546000	pedestalising victimhood
5546000	5548000	that there is a limitless
5548000	5550000	sky on how much
5550000	5552000	victimhood you can claim
5552000	5554000	whereas if your
5554000	5556000	status and your prestige
5556000	5558000	is downstream from your accomplishments
5558000	5560000	there is a limit
5560000	5562000	on how much you can accomplish because you need to go out
5562000	5564000	and fucking do it
5564000	5566000	reality is going to constrain how
5566000	5568000	much impressive stuff you can go and do
5568000	5570000	but there is a
5570000	5572000	ineffable
5572000	5574000	universe of
5574000	5576000	athlete's foot and my gluten intolerance
5576000	5578000	and my chronic flatulence
5578000	5580000	you know whatever else
5580000	5582000	those are things that you can just continue
5582000	5584000	to accumulate like trinkets
5584000	5586000	I just find
5586000	5588000	those people boring
5588000	5590000	I just don't care for victimhood
5590000	5592000	I think it's
5592000	5594000	an undesirable emotion
5594000	5596000	it's a sign of a rather undesirable
5596000	5598000	person
5598000	5600000	but I don't know
5600000	5602000	why we've given into this
5602000	5604000	I just genuinely, particularly in Britain
5604000	5606000	I'm just baffled by it because it wasn't the country
5606000	5608000	we had
5608000	5610000	when you said your solution for courage was to surround yourself
5610000	5612000	with courageous people
5612000	5614000	if you kind of get this
5614000	5616000	mimetic wave almost
5616000	5618000	moving through where fewer courageous people
5618000	5620000	are around which creates fewer
5620000	5622000	courageous role models which means to
5622000	5624000	yeah, yeah, yeah
5624000	5626000	and you have the thing of men being persuaded
5626000	5628000	to become cringing eunuchs
5628000	5630000	not a good thing
5630000	5632000	well that's another reason why
5632000	5634000	this conversation
5634000	5636000	around the guy in the subway is so interesting
5636000	5638000	because
5638000	5640000	is he
5640000	5642000	really supposed to stand up for the women
5642000	5644000	or is that, is he mansplaining
5644000	5646000	well if he mansplains
5646000	5648000	while he stops a woman
5648000	5650000	being dragged around by her hair
5650000	5652000	well of course the answer to that is
5652000	5654000	there's no such thing as mansplaining
5654000	5656000	or at least it's not very important
5656000	5658000	get on to something more important
5658000	5660000	like women not being assaulted on the subway
5660000	5662000	you know, choose your priorities
5662000	5664000	with the denial of sex differences
5664000	5666000	would lead to the conclusion that
5666000	5668000	that woman can
5668000	5670000	why shouldn't the women stand up
5670000	5672000	why shouldn't they use their upper body weight
5672000	5674000	yes, yeah, to push this
5674000	5676000	fentanyl fuel maniac off this
5676000	5678000	lady well as I say
5678000	5680000	it's a luxury belief that one
5680000	5682000	then it doesn't meet reality very well
5682000	5684000	I'm not sure anyone
5684000	5686000	would be very happy if the men in the carriage
5686000	5688000	said to the women in the carriage
5688000	5690000	go on, go on, your turn
5690000	5692000	yeah, we've had our
5692000	5694000	centuries of patriarchal
5694000	5696000	hierarchy
5696000	5698000	there's one that got my goat recently
5698000	5700000	with them
5700000	5702000	it always happens now
5702000	5704000	whenever anything comes up about conflict
5704000	5706000	Hillary Clinton was one of the worst culprits
5706000	5708000	of doing this but they always say this thing
5708000	5710000	one of the reasons you've got to stop any war
5710000	5712000	once it starts is they say
5712000	5714000	the first victims of war are women
5714000	5716000	they're fucking not
5716000	5718000	the men are men
5718000	5720000	who do most of the fighting and the dying
5720000	5722000	Hillary Clinton's point is
5722000	5724000	well, they're widows and then
5724000	5726000	ah, yeah
5726000	5728000	the poor widows of the men that are dead
5728000	5730000	yeah, actually the British
5730000	5732000	MOD has a thing of
5732000	5734000	there's a special section now
5734000	5736000	dedicated I think thanks to the impressive
5736000	5738000	insight of that military expert Angelina Jolie
5738000	5740000	they have
5740000	5742000	a special bit of the MOD
5742000	5744000	dedicated to women in conflict
5744000	5746000	the suffering of women in conflict
5746000	5748000	why not have a suffering of men in conflict as well
5748000	5750000	such weird priorities our age
5750000	5752000	it's totally unserious
5752000	5754000	this age is so unserious
5754000	5756000	so why you can't help thinking that at some point
5756000	5758000	the maniacs, the barbarians
5758000	5760000	will just break in
5760000	5762000	because we've made ourselves so weak
5762000	5764000	but it's so captivating
5764000	5766000	right, this is what I meant when I said
5766000	5768000	you know, have we progressed beyond peak woke
5768000	5770000	because it seems to me like
5770000	5772000	both the hyper woke
5772000	5774000	and hyper anti woke thing
5774000	5776000	is capturing so much
5776000	5778000	of the attention
5778000	5780000	I'm so bored of these people, they're so ridiculous
5780000	5782000	can't spend any more
5782000	5784000	of my life listening
5784000	5786000	to them, I don't want
5786000	5788000	to listen to the slowest kid in the class
5788000	5790000	I don't want to go at his or her
5790000	5792000	speed, I don't want
5792000	5794000	to talk to somebody so mentally
5794000	5796000	impaired that they think
5796000	5798000	that we are a
5798000	5800000	weirdly hemaphroditic species
5800000	5802000	or that you can
5802000	5804000	that the clown fish
5804000	5806000	is a useful species
5806000	5808000	to interpret behavior
5808000	5810000	of human beings
5810000	5812000	we can't go at this speed
5812000	5814000	no, no
5814000	5816000	20 years ago
5816000	5818000	at the dawn of the internet age
5818000	5820000	we had hoped that we would get so much farther
5820000	5822000	in the 21st century
5822000	5824000	and here we are with this
5824000	5826000	stupid society
5826000	5828000	slowed down by maniacs
5828000	5830000	debating the first thing
5830000	5832000	we knew boy or girl
5832000	5834000	like no
5834000	5836000	not going at that speed
5836000	5838000	Emo Radacanu
5838000	5840000	did an advert for HSBC
5840000	5842000	recently which you may have missed
5842000	5844000	HSBC rewrote
5844000	5846000	three classic fairy tales
5846000	5848000	their book is called
5848000	5850000	fairer tales and it shows that women
5850000	5852000	don't need men at all
5852000	5854000	with financial attitudes shaped as early as 5 years old
5854000	5856000	the new book challenges traditional
5856000	5858000	gender stereotypes, the new book
5858000	5860000	called fairer tales, princesses doing it for themselves
5860000	5862000	reimagines Cinderella
5862000	5864000	sleeping beauty in Rapunzel
5864000	5866000	as successful business women
5866000	5868000	Prince Charming
5868000	5870000	successful business women
5870000	5872000	Prince Charming is a raised as the main character
5872000	5874000	Emo Radacanu
5874000	5876000	read to them, so in the end
5876000	5878000	the princesses didn't need a prince to save them
5878000	5880000	they set up their own businesses
5880000	5882000	saved their money and then spent it very wisely
5882000	5884000	maybe one day you'll buy a tower
5884000	5886000	or set up your own shoe business
5886000	5888000	that's a quote
5888000	5890000	said the tennis player
5890000	5892000	that's the worst
5892000	5894000	I read Meghan Markle's book
5894000	5896000	The Bench
5896000	5898000	and that's worse
5898000	5900000	that's worse
5900000	5902000	wow
5902000	5904000	yeah
5904000	5906000	what an inspiring tale
5906000	5908000	fairer tales
5908000	5910000	princesses doing it for themselves
5910000	5912000	have you seen the
5912000	5914000	South Park episode where
5914000	5916000	Cartman wakes up
5916000	5918000	he has a nightmare
5918000	5920000	you told me about this over lunch yesterday
5920000	5922000	for the people that haven't seen it
5922000	5924000	Cartman has a nightmare
5924000	5926000	he is a diverse black woman
5926000	5928000	his character is recast
5928000	5930000	and all of his friends, Kenny and everyone else
5930000	5932000	are diverse female
5932000	5934000	or trans racial characters
5934000	5936000	and then Cartman wakes up from the nightmare
5936000	5938000	and his mother comes in
5938000	5940000	are you having another dream where
5940000	5942000	once again all my favourite characters
5942000	5944000	in the cartoons have been replaced
5944000	5946000	by definitely diverse women
5948000	5950000	and she goes it's okay Cartman
5950000	5952000	the CEO of Disney
5952000	5954000	isn't hiding under your bed
5954000	5956000	would you check
5956000	5958000	would you check mum
5958000	5960000	okay I checked she's not there
5960000	5962000	I'm worried that she's going to come out again
5962000	5964000	replace all my favourite characters
5964000	5966000	with definitely diverse women
5966000	5968000	I love those guys god they keep doing it
5968000	5970000	yeah I mean it's the same thing with
5970000	5972000	there was a rather unappealing
5972000	5974000	young woman who
5974000	5976000	was meant to be playing
5976000	5978000	Snow White and the new Disney Snow White
5978000	5980000	Rachel Ziegler
5980000	5982000	no no no somebody else
5982000	5984000	is it?
5984000	5986000	she said
5986000	5988000	Prince Charming wasn't a prince he was a stalker
5988000	5990000	yeah and she didn't need
5990000	5992000	Prince Charming to discover
5992000	5994000	that she could be the woman she could be
5994000	5996000	I mean this is like
5996000	5998000	sub Barack Obama
5998000	6000000	circa 2007
6000000	6002000	the princess is the person
6002000	6004000	she's been waiting for
6004000	6006000	your sister's keeper
6008000	6010000	why don't they invent new
6010000	6012000	that's what I can never understand with that
6012000	6014000	why don't they just invent new tales instead of
6014000	6016000	screwing up every existing tale that's loved
6016000	6018000	make your boring movie about
6018000	6020000	an inspirational tale
6020000	6022000	of a woman who wants to start a business
6022000	6024000	and then does and has some success
6024000	6026000	I mean okay
6026000	6028000	make that intro film
6028000	6030000	and Ram Sack and Rapal
6030000	6032000	pillage all of the storehouse
6032000	6034000	of stories that people liked
6034000	6036000	Brett Cooper's playing Snow White for Daily Wide
6036000	6038000	did you see that announcement?
6038000	6040000	what? you don't seen this
6040000	6042000	let me tell you
6042000	6044000	Jeremy Boring and Ben Shapiro
6044000	6046000	are doing their own live action remake of Snow White
6046000	6048000	with Brett Cooper
6048000	6050000	as Snow White
6050000	6052000	because she's
6052000	6054000	like West End trained
6054000	6056000	supposedly a very well trained actor
6056000	6058000	who can sing apparently
6058000	6060000	like the triple threat podcast act sing
6060000	6062000	and they announced it
6062000	6064000	the other week it's going to be coming out next year
6064000	6066000	god I hope they'd slay Disney
6066000	6068000	there's a rumor
6068000	6070000	that Disney has had to
6070000	6072000	reshoot a ton of scenes
6072000	6074000	including all of the dwarf
6074000	6076000	scenes because originally the dwarves weren't dwarves
6076000	6078000	they were
6078000	6080000	like a multi-racial
6080000	6082000	just group of different people
6082000	6084000	they were diverse ethnic women
6084000	6086000	it was the southern
6086000	6088000	thing again
6088000	6090000	but apparently
6090000	6092000	this is just a rumor but apparently they've reshot it
6092000	6094000	all of the scenes with the dwarves
6094000	6096000	to CGI actual dwarfs
6096000	6098000	so they've gone full
6098000	6100000	yeah because I know that there was
6100000	6102000	a revolt of the dwarves
6102000	6104000	which is something you don't hear every day
6104000	6106000	there was a revolt of the dwarves because
6106000	6108000	of course dwarf actors who have
6108000	6110000	their equity cards
6110000	6112000	are annoyed because there's not many dead
6112000	6114000	dwarves
6114000	6116000	you'd have presumed that there should have at least been seven
6116000	6118000	plus a stunt
6118000	6120000	actor
6120000	6122000	one to do all seven
6122000	6124000	stunts
6124000	6126000	well you could have 14 I guess it depends how
6126000	6128000	demanding the acting
6128000	6130000	how much logistics you want to spread around the dwarf actor community
6130000	6132000	but the point is that there actually was
6132000	6134000	apparently a rebellion about this because these are some of the few
6134000	6136000	dead cert roles we've got
6136000	6138000	is this not the same
6138000	6140000	the people who didn't cast that
6140000	6142000	people that would say we can only have a gay actor
6142000	6144000	playing a gay man and we can only have a black actor
6144000	6146000	playing a black man and we can only have
6146000	6148000	those people are such
6148000	6150000	I won't use the word
6150000	6152000	yeah I mean that again
6152000	6154000	we haven't got time to go at the pace of these people
6154000	6156000	acting is
6156000	6158000	pretending to be other people
6158000	6160000	people will be shocked
6160000	6162000	that most people who play Hamlet are not
6162000	6164000	themselves members of the Danish royal family
6166000	6168000	welcome to the world of make believe
6168000	6170000	a charity shop
6170000	6172000	in Swansea asked people not
6172000	6174000	to donate sex toys
6174000	6176000	Barnardo's customers have been asked
6176000	6178000	to refrain from donating used and unused
6178000	6180000	marital aids as they
6180000	6182000	aren't quite the sort of toys we're
6182000	6184000	looking for
6184000	6186000	when they say we want like
6186000	6188000	your old books, your old toys, they didn't mean
6188000	6190000	sex toys
6190000	6192000	I think that's a perfectly good policy for a second
6192000	6194000	hand shop
6194000	6196000	customers were reminded of the core rifling through the second
6196000	6198000	door
6198000	6200000	you don't
6200000	6202000	what have they got in here
6208000	6210000	is there a dressing room
6210000	6212000	customers were also reminded
6212000	6214000	that the branch had CCTV
6214000	6216000	so that these items can be traced back
6216000	6218000	to the original owners
6218000	6220000	oh
6220000	6222000	that means that you
6222000	6224000	there's like a
6224000	6226000	what's he called that thing in Australia
6226000	6228000	the boomerang
6228000	6230000	that's a boomerang effect
6230000	6232000	then it's back on your doorstep
6232000	6234000	the next morning
6234000	6236000	why can't I get rid of this thing
6236000	6238000	get it over the hedge
6238000	6240000	but he keeps landing in Barnardo's
6242000	6244000	it's a dildo that will never die
6246000	6248000	thank you for that story
6248000	6250000	is there a lesson we can take
6250000	6252000	from this
6252000	6254000	I think just be careful where you put your dildos
6254000	6256000	there's a moral of the story
6256000	6258000	never leave your dildo in Barnardo's
6258000	6260000	definitely not in the bargain bin
6260000	6262000	school in Lafayette
6262000	6264000	has refused to celebrate Halloween
6264000	6266000	because it isn't inclusive while going
6266000	6268000	all out for LGBT plus history month
6268000	6270000	is there much history
6270000	6272000	with LGBT
6272000	6274000	plus gay history
6274000	6276000	I mean there are lots of gay people in history
6276000	6278000	and there is that
6278000	6280000	but it's also what we used to call history
6282000	6284000	there isn't much
6284000	6286000	tea history
6286000	6288000	there's
6288000	6290000	bee history
6290000	6292000	I mean there are sort of I'm a bit skeptical
6292000	6294000	about bisexuality but
6294000	6296000	there's a bit of bisexuality in history of course
6298000	6300000	but I mean again these people are such
6300000	6302000	ignorant nurses they never know anything
6302000	6304000	I can't tell you Chris I mean I have to deal with some of this shit
6304000	6306000	and
6306000	6308000	they just don't know anything and they keep
6308000	6310000	it's like the Orwell thing
6310000	6312000	they're so called discoveries as if people didn't know them before
6312000	6314000	and
6314000	6316000	everybody knew most of the stuff that they are trying to bring out
6316000	6318000	and it's just very tedious
6318000	6320000	and again
6320000	6322000	what's happened to the mainstream
6322000	6324000	thing of it why aren't we concentrating on big
6324000	6326000	subjects big authors big historical issues
6328000	6330000	instead of this boring slow
6330000	6332000	pace
6332000	6334000	we're here at ARC
6334000	6336000	and we're going to be attending at some point this week
6336000	6338000	I can't remember
6338000	6340000	the question is something about a better vision for the future
6340000	6342000	a more positive vision for the future
6342000	6344000	a better story
6344000	6346000	sorry John
6346000	6348000	what is your
6348000	6350000	how would
6350000	6352000	how do you think that we can begin to
6352000	6354000	tell a more positive
6354000	6356000	story for the future because it seems to me
6356000	6358000	that much of the
6358000	6360000	proposals
6360000	6362000	are quite easily criticized and often rightly so
6362000	6364000	but
6364000	6366000	there's this sort of zero some view of happiness
6366000	6368000	and growth that somebody else's happiness somehow
6368000	6370000	detracts from mine
6370000	6372000	well that's a particularly British view of course
6372000	6374000	very much yeah yeah yeah
6374000	6376000	that guy's got something is because I've not got it
6376000	6378000	he's taking it from me
6378000	6380000	yeah but what's a more positive vision of the future
6380000	6382000	well one would be that we're not
6382000	6384000	facing imminent apocalypse and
6384000	6386000	catastrophe all the time
6386000	6388000	from every possible direction
6388000	6390000	and particularly not ones that people have whipped up a new generation
6390000	6392000	into a fervour over
6392000	6394000	I mean I think the green apocalyptic
6394000	6396000	thing is particularly damaging to young people
6396000	6398000	I think it's very very bad for their mental health
6398000	6400000	very had very very detrimental
6400000	6402000	to their
6402000	6404000	sense of how they build a future
6404000	6406000	and I think a lot of young people have been lied to
6406000	6408000	about the proximity
6408000	6410000	of
6410000	6412000	global climate catastrophe
6412000	6414000	I mean every time there isn't an actual
6414000	6416000	catastrophe going on in the world
6416000	6418000	our leaders go straight back to the climate catastrophe
6418000	6420000	and the climate crisis
6420000	6422000	they now call it
6422000	6424000	what is happening is not a crisis
6426000	6428000	maybe a problem to be managed
6428000	6430000	but
6430000	6432000	there's a luxury in calling such things a crisis
6432000	6434000	a crisis is like
6434000	6436000	my shoes are on fire
6438000	6440000	that's a crisis
6440000	6442000	not like it's possible that in 40 years
6444000	6446000	we'll need more AC
6446000	6448000	I don't see that as a crisis
6448000	6450000	but
6450000	6452000	so yes
6452000	6454000	I think that in general there are several things that are
6454000	6456000	big stories
6456000	6458000	big narratives of people being spun
6458000	6460000	which are incredibly innovating
6460000	6462000	that is they sap energy out of the society
6462000	6464000	you can feel it
6464000	6466000	the hopelessness if you tell young people
6466000	6468000	they're not going to live into adulthood because they're all going to burn to death
6470000	6472000	the hopelessness of saying
6472000	6474000	you can't change anything
6474000	6476000	or that this is the trajectory we're on
6476000	6478000	one of the other ones in the green stuff
6478000	6480000	is the hopelessness of saying to people
6480000	6482000	effectively
6482000	6484000	you shouldn't leave any footprint on the planet
6484000	6486000	including children
6488000	6490000	and
6490000	6492000	just to put one
6492000	6494000	thing out there about the hopelessness
6494000	6496000	of that
6496000	6498000	there's this new thing that many cities have signed up to
6498000	6500000	including London
6502000	6504000	which is a future in which among other things
6504000	6506000	we will not be allowed to move around
6506000	6508000	very much and we will be allowed a flight
6508000	6510000	perhaps every six years I think it is
6510000	6512000	what's this?
6512000	6514000	what's it called?
6514000	6516000	I'm blanking on the name
6516000	6518000	it's this new proposal for cities in 2030 or something
6518000	6520000	the city car has signed up London to it
6520000	6522000	it's one of these carbon neutral
6522000	6524000	fantasies
6524000	6526000	no fun 2030
6526000	6528000	and one of them is that you won't be allowed
6528000	6530000	to fly more than once every X number of years
6530000	6532000	and of course none of it
6532000	6534000	makes any sense because among other things
6534000	6536000	all that means is
6536000	6538000	apart from the fact that the airline industry is destroyed
6538000	6540000	is that what it means is the cost
6540000	6542000	of an airline ticket will be like
6542000	6544000	40 times higher
6544000	6546000	but
6546000	6548000	so they always assume you can do all of these things
6548000	6550000	and nothing will change
6550000	6552000	amazingly you'll be able to put a rule like that in
6552000	6554000	and you won't destroy the airline industry or whatever
6554000	6556000	but all of it is just so
6556000	6558000	anti-human
6558000	6560000	I mean it is so anti-human
6560000	6562000	the aspiration of human beings
6562000	6564000	should not be
6564000	6566000	to be born fight against
6566000	6568000	the patriarchy leave no carbon
6568000	6570000	footprint and die in the most
6570000	6572000	ethically
6572000	6574000	fine manner
6574000	6576000	preferably taken out at
6576000	6578000	a Swiss clinic
6578000	6580000	you know and then like burnt in a cardboard box
6580000	6582000	it's not a very heroic narrative
6582000	6584000	you know
6584000	6586000	and I think that
6586000	6588000	actually we do orient our lives around
6588000	6590000	stories and around narratives
6590000	6592000	and we should not have
6592000	6594000	the
6594000	6596000	unique narrative that I've just laid out
6596000	6598000	we should have heroic narratives
6598000	6600000	I mean for instance you know the narrative of
6600000	6602000	the of adventure
6602000	6604000	of life being an adventure
6604000	6606000	that you set out
6606000	6608000	on a path and hope
6608000	6610000	you set yourself out on a heroic path
6610000	6612000	or at least an exciting path
6612000	6614000	you know I mean
6614000	6616000	the counterpoint of the one I laid out earlier
6616000	6618000	of the one you know
6618000	6620000	you don't know
6620000	6622000	the account part of the one I laid out earlier
6622000	6624000	which is the you know everything that's going to happen
6624000	6626000	if you go along this path of
6626000	6628000	things other people have persuaded you
6628000	6630000	to say
6630000	6632000	is well you know where you're going
6632000	6634000	you know everything to say
6634000	6636000	and you know kind of what trajectory your life will be on
6638000	6640000	I say well yeah and there's another trajectory as well
6640000	6642000	and it's the one that I
6642000	6644000	and I suspect you
6644000	6646000	we've got ourselves in our life which is I don't know exactly
6648000	6650000	I don't know with that certainty
6650000	6652000	I don't know what'll
6652000	6654000	happen but if I put one foot
6654000	6656000	fairly sure
6656000	6658000	footedly in front of the next
6658000	6660000	and
6660000	6662000	and tread well
6662000	6664000	and
6664000	6666000	orient myself by
6666000	6668000	things like truth
6668000	6670000	sure I don't have the certainty
6670000	6672000	but
6672000	6674000	it's an adventure
6674000	6676000	and it's my adventure
6676000	6678000	your adventure
6678000	6680000	you actually own it and then
6680000	6682000	fancy that you'll actually have your life
6682000	6684000	you can feel proud of what you got to
6684000	6686000	right because you weren't being ventriloquized
6686000	6688000	by somebody else's
6688000	6690000	you didn't spend your life saying things you don't know
6690000	6692000	or mean or believe
6692000	6694000	or just
6694000	6696000	repeating like a parrot
6696000	6698000	in order to keep in
6698000	6700000	with a group of people
6700000	6702000	you shouldn't seek the affirmation
6702000	6704000	from
6704000	6706000	you will live your life
6706000	6708000	remember that the outcomes that most people get
6708000	6710000	are ones that you don't want in any case
6710000	6712000	the average American is
6712000	6714000	obese, divorced and with less than 1k in the bank
6714000	6716000	so
6716000	6718000	doing what everybody else does
6718000	6720000	sounds like a very surefire
6720000	6722000	strategy but the outcomes
6722000	6724000	are ones that you don't want
6724000	6726000	and that can be the case
6726000	6728000	with financially successful people
6728000	6730000	I mean it can be the case
6730000	6732000	with people I often say that
6732000	6734000	people who go into professions which they don't like
6734000	6736000	and again it's interesting
6736000	6738000	some of them are
6738000	6740000	there are ones that people apologize for as you talk to them
6740000	6742000	you notice that
6742000	6744000	normally these days one of the biggest self-deprecating
6744000	6746000	professions is lawyers
6746000	6748000	you say to somebody what are you doing
6748000	6750000	I'm a lawyer
6750000	6752000	why that
6752000	6754000	five years in full-time education
6754000	6756000	three years in developing
6756000	6758000	and normally it's like they think oh well it's not very
6758000	6760000	interesting or something but I think
6760000	6762000	why wouldn't you do something where you went I am a lawyer
6762000	6764000	it's fantastic I love
6764000	6766000	doing this
6766000	6768000	that's British lawyers again for you
6768000	6770000	I've seen Americans do that as well
6770000	6772000	my point is they're financially
6772000	6774000	well rewarded
6774000	6776000	and there's rules you can follow
6776000	6778000	on that
6778000	6780000	there are ones I don't understand
6780000	6782000	if you are doing a job
6782000	6784000	that pays you well
6784000	6786000	and allows you to provide you for your loved ones
6786000	6788000	that's worth doing
6788000	6790000	even if it's not your optimal role
6792000	6794000	doing a role that you don't much care for
6794000	6796000	and you're not providing for other people
6798000	6800000	and you don't see any particular purposes
6800000	6802000	that's probably not a good idea
6802000	6804000	or you could go
6804000	6806000	you know that there are other options and other routes open to you
6806000	6808000	that would allow you to also provide for the family
6808000	6810000	or the
6810000	6812000	the bravery narrative is definitely
6812000	6814000	one that I think is lacking
6816000	6818000	and this risk aversion that we have
6818000	6820000	this young people
6820000	6822000	getting their driver's licenses later than ever
6822000	6824000	most commonly living arrangement
6824000	6826000	for men under the age of 35 is still living at home
6826000	6828000	with their parents
6828000	6830000	such an awful stat
6830000	6832000	people going into full-time employment later than ever
6832000	6834000	and I think about you know when we were
6834000	6836000	actually no you are the worst person to talk about this
6836000	6838000	you told me you didn't get your driver's license until some
6838000	6840000	ungodly age
6840000	6842000	but most people
6842000	6844000	couldn't wait
6844000	6846000	they manifest similarly
6846000	6848000	most people
6848000	6850000	17 years old in the UK, driver's license
6850000	6852000	I want to be free, I want to be liberated
6852000	6854000	I don't want to have to be asking mum and dad for lifts
6854000	6856000	etc etc
6858000	6860000	there's not a narrative of
6860000	6862000	adventure
6862000	6864000	I think that is important
6864000	6866000	if you don't have a narrative of adventure
6866000	6868000	and success
6868000	6870000	and an idea of what that looks like
6870000	6872000	you know you are disproportionately likely
6872000	6874000	to live a
6874000	6876000	more miserable life
6878000	6880000	I think probably both of us
6880000	6882000	to some extent have worked
6882000	6884000	our way out as we've
6884000	6886000	done it and
6886000	6888000	you know trodden a path
6888000	6890000	is not completely clear
6890000	6892000	and if you said to me what are you going to do in 10 years
6892000	6894000	I couldn't particularly tell you
6894000	6896000	roughly what I'd like to do
6896000	6898000	but it's not entirely clear
6898000	6900000	it might be if I was in
6900000	6902000	a corporate law firm and hoping to make partner
6902000	6904000	or something like that but
6904000	6906000	the lack of
6906000	6908000	clarity on it
6908000	6910000	should be energizing
6910000	6912000	I'd have thought
6912000	6914000	that's what's exciting about it
6914000	6916000	also for
6916000	6918000	the desire for certainty
6918000	6920000	which is also exactly where the conspiracism comes from
6920000	6922000	because it removes
6922000	6924000	random chance from the world
6924000	6926000	and makes everything coordinated
6926000	6928000	rather than coincidental
6928000	6930000	that desire for certainty
6930000	6932000	really dissuades
6932000	6934000	people from going and doing something
6934000	6936000	which has potentially
6936000	6938000	outsized outcomes
6938000	6940000	look at what happens the narrative of
6940000	6942000	leaving home
6942000	6944000	or leaving the village or leaving the town
6946000	6948000	there's every reason
6948000	6950000	not to go
6950000	6952000	because if you go
6952000	6954000	you
6954000	6956000	risk a lot of things
6956000	6958000	one of them is failing
6958000	6960000	and
6960000	6962000	if you go
6962000	6964000	and you fail
6964000	6966000	then you have to go back
6966000	6968000	to where you were from
6968000	6970000	with your tail between your legs
6970000	6972000	and then you can console yourself
6972000	6974000	that you tried it but it didn't work
6974000	6976000	a lot of people
6976000	6978000	even make the try
6978000	6980000	because they think it won't work
6980000	6982000	so they never leave
6982000	6984000	and
6984000	6986000	other people go and they finally make it to the city
6986000	6988000	and that's as a story as old as our species
6988000	6990000	they finally make it to the city or large gathering place
6990000	6992000	and they make it there
6992000	6994000	you know
6994000	6996000	and one of the reasons why New York is a thrilling city
6996000	6998000	is it's filled with people making it
6998000	7000000	you know
7000000	7002000	I mean plenty of people
7002000	7004000	who will fail
7004000	7006000	it's very harsh in a way
7006000	7008000	because
7008000	7010000	the two are so close together
7010000	7012000	a millionaires blocks
7012000	7014000	will have
7014000	7016000	a veteran with a sign
7016000	7018000	lying on the street
7018000	7020000	outside
7020000	7022000	and then you get
7022000	7024000	that simultaneous thing of success
7024000	7026000	and the
7026000	7028000	mirror of it
7028000	7030000	of desperate failure
7030000	7032000	I don't mean that a judgmental
7032000	7034000	in the case of the Vefa but desperate
7034000	7036000	your life
7036000	7038000	very close to each other
7038000	7040000	and I suspect that both of these things
7040000	7042000	fire up New Yorkers all the time
7042000	7044000	yeah well you're getting to see how far you could
7044000	7046000	go and how far you could fall
7046000	7048000	shown in front of you all the time
7048000	7050000	there's an interesting study
7050000	7052000	by Candice Blake in Australia
7052000	7054000	that looked at
7054000	7056000	wealth inequality
7056000	7058000	and local ecologies positively
7058000	7060000	predicting
7060000	7062000	self
7062000	7064000	sexualization
7064000	7066000	of women in online dating profiles
7066000	7068000	so I think I followed that
7068000	7070000	if
7070000	7072000	there is high wealth inequality
7072000	7074000	women both see the sort of
7074000	7076000	partner they could get in their wildest dreams
7076000	7078000	under their worst nightmares
7078000	7080000	and it positively predicts
7080000	7082000	more sexualized images
7082000	7084000	in online dating profiles and social media
7084000	7086000	and her
7086000	7088000	argument was that
7088000	7090000	it
7090000	7092000	amps up
7092000	7094000	a woman's
7094000	7096000	competitive edge in terms of finding
7096000	7098000	a partner that they think would be able to
7098000	7100000	ensure they don't end
7100000	7102000	up
7102000	7104000	down at the bottom end of the inequality distribution
7104000	7106000	and instead they end up
7106000	7108000	in the clouds where they've seen people's
7108000	7110000	outcomes occurring
7110000	7112000	well of course there are also people who fake it
7114000	7116000	well that's the effective way to play the game
7116000	7118000	I was once in India
7118000	7120000	and I had a guide
7120000	7122000	who I got talking to and I said
7122000	7124000	I said
7124000	7126000	we were talking about how
7126000	7128000	easy or otherwise dating was
7128000	7130000	in the outskirts of Delhi
7130000	7132000	which means the slums and he said
7132000	7134000	the trick is
7134000	7136000	he did describe it as a trick
7136000	7138000	if you meet a girl you like
7138000	7140000	you go for a date with her but you borrow your friend's shoes
7140000	7142000	for instance
7142000	7144000	there will be a friend who has a pair of trainers
7144000	7146000	and you borrow his shoes
7146000	7148000	for the date and then like another time
7148000	7150000	you might borrow a friend's motorbike
7150000	7152000	so like the pool of men
7152000	7154000	helps like swap
7154000	7156000	right okay and the idea is
7156000	7158000	they have one good dating outfit and vehicle
7158000	7160000	between ten people yes and he said
7160000	7162000	the idea was that you get the woman to say she loves you
7162000	7164000	and she'll marry you and then
7164000	7166000	you do the reveal it was somebody else's shoes
7166000	7168000	your shit shoes yeah
7168000	7170000	which I thought was both
7170000	7172000	horrific
7172000	7174000	admirable he told it to me like that
7174000	7176000	and horribly
7176000	7178000	recognizable
7178000	7180000	think of all the people who splash
7180000	7182000	around money in restaurants and things
7182000	7184000	you don't really have it at all
7184000	7186000	pretend to live above their means or do live above their means
7186000	7188000	it's all to try
7188000	7190000	to entrap a mate
7190000	7192000	I think people do a lot for sex
7192000	7194000	yeah I know I've seen
7194000	7196000	Douglas Murray ladies and gentlemen
7196000	7198000	Douglas I really appreciate you

7204000	7206000	I'm going to a couple of war zones and we'll
7206000	7208000	report back
