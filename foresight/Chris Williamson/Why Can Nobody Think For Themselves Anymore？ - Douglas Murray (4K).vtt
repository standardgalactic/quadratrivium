00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
You've spent a lot of time studying history and writing about current events at the moment.

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
How would you rate your predictive ability given the current state of the world?

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
Were the things that you foresaw coming or things that you've been particularly surprised by?

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Well, nobody gets to predict with 100% accuracy anything because among other things,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
all the time things happen that you could never have seen coming.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
I could never have seen COVID coming. I just didn't.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
So whenever anyone boasts about their predictive capabilities,

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
I always think you have to deal with a certain amount of humility

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
because things happen all the time you couldn't see.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
You can only see around the bend of the road you're coming to.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
You can't see around the corner.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Yeah, I mean, some things I've written about for years,

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
particularly in my book, The Strange Death of Europe that came out in 2017,

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
which I think are sadly coming to fruition.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
And I say sadly because people think that if you've predicted something and got it right,

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
you would feel any pleasure.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
And that would only be if the thing you were predicting was something you looked forward to.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
And what I was predicting was something I was dreading.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
And that was the transformation of our country of birth

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
and many other countries in the West due to demographic change.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
And I mean, every day now, pretty much somebody says to me,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
gosh, I used to think what you were saying.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
The Strange Death of Europe was a bit out there and now I realize you were right.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
But it gives me no pleasure for them to say that.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Because I always sort of think, well, if you'd have agreed back then,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
some things might not have happened.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
But as Mark Stein said, demographics is destiny.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
So it's one of the things you can predict with the most ease.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
Did you have Victoria's Secrets plan to bring sexy back on your 2023 bingo card?

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Why are Victoria's Secrets bringing sexy back?

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
After experimenting with 300-pound mannequins, plus-sized models, disabled models, trans models,

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
a male model and a 38-year-old football player,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Victoria's Secrets have made the controversial decision to switch strategy

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
and start using hot women to model their underwear again.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
That makes commercial sense to my mind.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm always amazed that advertising executives find it complex, this stuff.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
All you need to do is stick sexy guys on stuff and stick sexy girls on stuff

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
and sell all the merchandisers, which pretty much writes itself.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
Yeah, I'm not particularly surprised that if you stick Lizzo in a bikini,

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
it's not as appealing as a bit of sales merchandise.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
But, you know, live and learn, I suppose?

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
One of my friends owns a very big clothing company

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
and for a while they tried plus-sized models, mostly for women.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
There's not much of a body positivity movement for men.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
No, not like a beer gut movement.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
The skinny fat revolution.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
And he said, we've split tested this into oblivion, big girls don't sell clothes.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
So when you see that, when you see a company, you know,

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
and some are making double plus-sized dildos or whatever,

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
the company is actively hurting their top line and bottom line

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
to be able to send the right message.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
And that's all well and good.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
Up until some shareholder meeting where some 70s year old guy

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
looks at the far right column of an Excel sheet and goes,

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
what the fuck's this?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Yes.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And they go, no, you don't understand.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
It's this really cool new movement.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
It's very progressive.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
And he goes, I don't care.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
I want more money than we had last year

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
and this is less money than we had last year.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Yeah, I mean, I suppose it all starts off from a good place

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
like some or many things.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
But look, if you, you might agree that, you know,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
it's not a good thing to sell anorexic looking models

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
to young women.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
And that's, yeah, okay, let's all agree on that.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
But you can, you can stop somewhere before morbidly obese.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
You know, that's where the whole thing goes wrong

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
with body positivity thing.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Plus there's a place where the body positivity shouldn't occur.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
It should be, I mean, if somebody is so morbidly obese

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
that they're at significant risk of heart failure,

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
you shouldn't celebrate them.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
You should say, hang on a minute, steady on the donuts.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
But they don't say that.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
They just, they run all the way.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I wish that you could just have sort of healthy looking women

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
on the ads and just draw the line there.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
But as ever, they sort of don't know where the line is

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
until you just say something wrenches them back.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
And I think wrenches them back is normally,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
as you say, the bottom line.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah, I have been thinking about this sort of performative

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
empathy point for a while.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Got this idea, I need to meme it better.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
But I think something like short term empathy

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
or the shallow pond of empathy, I've been thinking about

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
what is most popular in culture at the moment

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
is something that optimizes for its immediacy

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
to signal that you are a good guy or good girl.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Right.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
Even if that's at the expense of the ultimate outcome

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
for the person.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
So let's say you're able to do something giving the child ice cream.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
It may be what it wants right now.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
It may be bad for it long term.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
But if you're the ice cream promoter for the young children,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
you will be seen as a good person.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
And if you're the person who's saying, hang on a second,

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
that's not what you want long term.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Maybe responsibility in Peterson language.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Maybe not casual sex in Louise Perry language.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Maybe not as much food as you want in body positivity language.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
You're seen as bigoted or judgmental or whatever.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Because there's no countervailing force in the culture.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
The unlimited empathy, people have run a long way very fast

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
because as you say, there's a short term gain to be seen

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
to be being empathetic.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Let's celebrate yourself.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
But ordinarily you would have some other counterforce in the society

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
and different forces have provided that in history,

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
including the church.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
But if there is no counterforce to say, for instance,

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
long term gratification, better than short term or whatever,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
then yeah.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
And that's a sort of unappealing position in our society now.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
There's plenty of room for people to be in that space.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
But you're still on the defensive.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
We're still in a society where effectively to own an ice cream truck

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
in the sort of language of a child would seem to be a great thing

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
to have the short term thing.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Yeah.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Not many people want that role.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
It's sort of uncool in some way.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
It might become cool at some point in the future

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
when more people realize that the short term gratification thing

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
was leading to diabetes or whatever.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
It's the same as one of the justifications, I think,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
for why people aren't having children,

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
that upfront children, you just see a very, very large cost

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
on all of the joy and stuff.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
What the economists put it is that the child tax,

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
the amount of money you have less if you have a child,

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
weird way around to look at the future of the species, isn't it?

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
If only I died with more money in my bank account.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Life of regret.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Death of regret, perhaps.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
Well, it's kind of the, as well, the Mexican fisherman story.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Are you familiar with that?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
The parable of the Mexican fisherman?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
No, I don't think I am.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
This is cool. You'll like this.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
So an American businessman goes on holiday to Mexico.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
And while he's there.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
It's a true story.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
It's a parable, though.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Got it.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Fucking hell.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
He goes on holiday.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
He gets taken out fishing by a local Mexican.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
And he asks the Mexican how he spends his time.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
The Mexican says, I fish a little on the morning.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
I catch enough for my family.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
We go back.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
We cook.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
We laugh around the fire.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
And I spend time with my children.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
And the American businessman goes, that's stupid.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Here's a better idea.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
What you should do is actually spend most of your day fishing.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
And then with the surplus fish, you could sell them at the market.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And the Mexican fisherman says, why would I do that?

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
So, well, once you've got the additional money,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
you could start to employ some of your friends.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
And they could come out fishing with you, too.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
And you could catch more fish, which you could sell at the market for more money.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
He says, why would I do that?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
He says, well, once you've done that,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
you would be able to incorporate an America

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
and you would maybe be able to start a canning factory

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
so that you could own the entire production process

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
and you could then sell the company for a lot of money.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
He said, why would I do that?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
He said, because once you've done that,

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
you'd be able to fish a little on the morning

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
and then go back and spend time with your children around the fire.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Very good.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
And I often think about that as a much more direct route to happiness.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
You know?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Well, that's the classic thing that the place you end up

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
is the place you started from.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
There are lots of reasons why people aren't having children.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
And a lot of them are simple economic things.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I mean, all of the western countries

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
that have terrible replacement birth rate figures

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
are because of very easy things to solve,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
like cost of housing and things like that.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
It's not hard to build affordable housing.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
They've proved to be incapable of doing so.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
So young people wanting to both get on the property ladder

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
and start a family think they have to do either or.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And they're not entirely wrong,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
but that's something that governments could have sorted out

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
and none of them do.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
They're so hopeless at it and they have been for years

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
under consecutive governments.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
They never build enough housing so young people don't see a future,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
don't feel hopeless and then don't have kids

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
and then everyone wonders why there's a demographic crisis.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Intergenerational competition theory

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
is something I learned about a couple of weeks ago.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
You familiar with this?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I didn't know about it before, but it makes complete sense.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
There was always this talk of millennials

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
are the first generation to have done worse than their parents.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Well, they're not the first in a while.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
First in two generations.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
And it seems like millennials actually probably

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
just about managed to get over on average.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
But Gen Z materially,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
difficulty in getting on the property ladder,

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
the most common living arrangement for men under 35

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
is still at home with their parents.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
And yeah, it bakes in this sort of

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
intergenerational competitiveness

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
and a dissatisfaction when you look at where your parents were

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
and this felt sense that your parents got advantages

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
that you never did.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Which is usually not true.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I mean, they didn't suffer inflation at the same rate.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
They suffered very high taxation in the post-war period.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
We haven't had taxation as the levels it was at

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
in the 1960s and 70s, for instance, in the UK.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
There was a time when people were top rate

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
taxpayers were paying 99% tax.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
A friend who once in that period paid over 100% tax one year

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
for reasons he could still lock.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
How's that possible?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
It will be back tax and that sort of thing.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
So, I mean, there's a tendency,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
particularly among millennials and after,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
to think that their parents had it very easy.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
And my experience of people from that generation,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
the boomer generation, it didn't feel easy at the time.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
And yeah, there were certain things getting on the property

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
housing ladder was a little bit easier than it is,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
or significantly easier.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Once you have, what is it, five times average earnings

11:27.000 --> 11:33.000
being inadequate to get to the average property price,

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
you see the split go on.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
But you always have to factor.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I mean, if you say, you know, the millennial,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
the first ones or Gen Z were the first ones

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
who said whoever to have a better standard of living,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
you have to bake in things like,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
oh yeah, well, they had a world war, you know.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
So, that's quite a big PS.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Well, there's a big footnote.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
So, yeah, everyone has their challenges.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
I just don't see why once you've identified them

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
and know the way out of them, you don't do them.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
I was talking to mutual friend Eric Weinstein about this.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I also spoke to Sam about this.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I've spoken to a bunch of people.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
Why in your opinion do you think everybody struggles

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
to agree on the truth now?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Oh, that's quite straightforward.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
We can't agree on what's happened.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
So, broadly speaking, an event happens now

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
and some people believe it has happened

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
and other people think it hasn't.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
I mean, we've been through a number of deranging years

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
since we first spoke in which, for instance,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
you know, they say there's been a global pandemic

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
which some people believe was something

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
which killed millions and millions of people

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
in their own country and think they were just about saved

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
from dying themselves.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
And other people think it was a fake

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
and other people think we just massively overreacted

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
and other people think it was all planned

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
and nobody agrees what happened.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
That's just to take one example.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
In America, you have obviously the fact

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
that nobody agrees who won an election.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
That's a problem.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
And so you just have basic things.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Nobody can agree on it. It just happened.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I always say in America, you know,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
it would be nice if we could just agree

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
that one thing that's just happened happened

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
but then nobody wants to.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
It says you must be a WF shill if you believe that.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
So I think it is the problem.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
And then obviously underneath that is just the problem,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
the fact that the treadmill of social media

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
has totally changed the way in which we communicate,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
the way in which we learn things, absorb things.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
And we don't know what the consequences of that are.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
We're so early into it.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
And it seems to me that among other things,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
it's allowed people to have their own version of recent events,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
recent history, past few days.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
And so when you sit down to talk to somebody,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
you can fairly swiftly work out

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
whether they're somebody who's open to the idea

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
of things that happened having happened

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
or whether or not they will fight you all the way.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
And that just makes everything much harder

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
than it used to be.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And that isn't to sort of particularly pine

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
for the era of a mono narrative.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
If that era ever particularly existed

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
and you read history, not clear that it did.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
But it's just massively worse.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
And news is coming at us at such a pace these days.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
And it's just like, you know, every day feels like,

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
you know, a month's worth of news in the past.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
Things just fly by you so fast

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
that you don't even have time to absorb it

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
before it's happened.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
So I think that's part of the reason.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
And in any case, the whole concept of truth

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
as being a desirable thing in the society

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
seems to have eroded from both the right and the left.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Well, truth, for instance, used to be the basis

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
for a university education

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
and the basis of university inquiry

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
that you sought the truth wherever it led you.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
That was the point of academia, for instance.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Politics was different.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Politics was always about having to find a way around

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
truth and deal with it.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Addressing convenience.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Yeah, address it where you could, but, you know,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
get around it if it was too awkward.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
But inquiry used to be about seeking truth.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
And we've been like that for a couple thousand years or more

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
since the Greeks, certainly.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
And then it changed at some point relatively recently.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
And truth is now not a desirable thing

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
because truth hurts people.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
And it can be mean.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
So it's not only that people have different opinions on things.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
They don't agree that the thing we used to agree on

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
is worth going for.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Well, they have different facts.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
But they don't agree that, I mean, they don't agree

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
that you should just follow truth wherever it takes you.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Because other things are prioritized over truth.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
I still prioritize truth over all things if I can and try to.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
And I think that's the interesting thing about the world

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
is finding out what is true and what is not.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
But other people don't seem to have that same appetite anymore

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
and would rather live in lies,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
which I think is very dangerous for an individual

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
and very dangerous for society.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
In fact, it's dangerous for an individual

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
and lethal in a society, I'd say.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
It's interesting to think about the motivations

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
that people have for not believing something

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
which is already on an unshaky foundation

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
of we can't agree on the thing that we're not believing about.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
And Gwinda, one of my friends has this idea that

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
if no amount of evidence would dissuade someone

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
of what they believe, then they don't have a rational belief.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
They have a religious ideology.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
Yeah, yeah, that's Jonathan Swift beautifully put it

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
as if you can't reason somebody out for a position

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
they weren't reasoned into.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Yeah, of course.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
I mean, you're dealing with dogma with many people today.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
It's just they don't know which faith they belong to.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
But it's dogma for sure.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
I just am not very interested in their views

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
because I think they can't defend them.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
If you can't defend your views, I'm not very interested in them

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
because I don't find them persuasive.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
I asked Sam this about whether or not...

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Obviously, whatever, 10, 15 years ago,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
who's a big part of the New Atheist movement

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
and I guess you were tangentially...

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I was a little bit of a whipper snapper.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I was a whipper snapper New Atheist.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
You were an orbiter.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
I was a short trousers New Atheist.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Okay.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
But, you know, your book, The Madness of Crowds,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
talks about the collapse of grand narratives.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
One of the biggest collapses of grand narratives was religion.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
So I asked Sam whether or not looking back,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
he believed that his deconstruction of religion

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
was on balance and net good or a net negative.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
What did he say?

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
He managed to evade being too committal, either way, I think.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
But what do you think?

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Well, I think it's like a lot of things that you deconstruct.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
You only know afterwards

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
whether or not it's something you could have put back together.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
It's like children with bicycles.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Very fine at taking them apart.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Very bad at putting them back together.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Not comparing Sam to a child.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
But I mean, I just...

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
I think that is...

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
If it's something you notice only once you've taken it apart,

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
once you can't reconstruct it,

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
you'd realize what function it might have performed.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
I said to Sam on stage a few years ago

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
that I thought that it would all be fine

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
if most atheists were as rational and level-headed as Sam.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
But it's not Sam Harris all the way down.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
It's like Sam Harris followed by total mentalists

18:52.000 --> 18:58.000
and who just will not reason or rationalize anything

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
and are just screaming harpies of insanity.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
So that's a shame.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
But yes, I mean, I think that that whole thing works for some people,

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
but obviously it doesn't work for others.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I mean, religion is...

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
You know, Schopenhauer, among others,

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
saw it was religion was philosophy for the masses.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
Absent religion completely.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
There's several lots of options of what will happen.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
One is that the general public

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
lose the overarching framework of their lives

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
and have nothing to replace it with.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
And another one is that they do replace it with other things,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
which are new religions which crop up all the time.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
We have the religion of the body negativity movement.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
You know, we have the religion of trans.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
We have the religion of gender.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
We have the religion of race and all these things

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
have just stepped into this void.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
And they're all dogmatic things with their founding texts.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
They've all got their own catechisms of a kind.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Priests have priests.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
They have excommunication rights.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
And my only observation really would be on that

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
is that I preferred the old gods.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
You know, I preferred the old priesthood, funnily enough,

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
partly because we knew its flaws.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
And the sweet point where you see the flaws of religious belief

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
but can still live through it is one even I can,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
where I can especially feel nostalgic for

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
because I don't like the new priesthood.

20:35.000 --> 20:41.000
I find them as corrupt as any priesthood in history

20:41.000 --> 20:47.000
with the negative attribute that not everyone's woken up to them yet.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
I mean, do we have in our culture an equivalent,

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
for instance, of the meme of the pedophile priest?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I don't think we do.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
I mean, for instance, I would love it if the sort of adults

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
who push gender dysmorphia stuff on children

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
were regarded as the equivalent of pedophile priests.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I think that'd be fine.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
But it doesn't come with that yet.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
It's like the Catholic Church in Boston circa 1950.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
The priests are still fiddling with the kids

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
but no one wants to talk about it.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
So...

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
On the planet, they're the only 100% stress-free,

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
wild harvested venison that you can get.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Here's my super secret hack.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
If you are sick of buying meat that always goes off,

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
put it in the freezer from frozen, salt both sides of it,

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
put it in an air fryer for 10 to 12 minutes each side,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
and you have a perfectly cooked steak from frozen

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
that will never go off because it's going from freezer to mouth

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
in the space of 25 minutes.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
It's a complete game changer.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
All of their cuts are spectacular

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
and you can get them frozen, delivered to your door.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
But their venison sticks are my favorite while I've been on the road.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
You can get the healthiest red meat on the planet

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
delivered directly to your door

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
slash modernwisdom

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
and using the code modernwisdom at checkout.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
That's M-A-U-I-N-U-I

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
venison.com slash modernwisdom

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
and modernwisdom at checkout.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
It makes me think as we were talking earlier on

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
about some of the ways in which

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
lots of decisions need to be made

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
and you don't know how the outcomes are going to occur

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
that there are no solutions, only trade-offs.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
I keep coming back to that in my personal life as well

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
but thinking about what people want to optimize for

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
in their existence,

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
there are no solutions ultimately

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
and you have to give up certain things.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
You don't have to give up everything.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
Well, no, there's certainly better solutions,

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
but the world is trying to maximize everything.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
It goes back to the shallow pond of empathy

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
that accepting that trade-offs are an inevitability

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
doesn't fit into that paradigm.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
We will always optimize for what feels most pleasurable

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
or empathetic in the short term.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I don't know. I don't feel that.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
That's how it plays out, I think.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
For a lot of people, if they have no character.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
What do you optimize for?

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
I try to optimize for peace.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
That seems to be the thing that for me,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
in my personal life, I try to do.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
If the price is my sanity, the cost is too high

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
no matter what it is.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
I continually throw that rule out of the window all the time.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
That's what I try and aim for.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
I love the peace in your private life.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
I try.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
It reminds me of Lady Bracknell's line about the general

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
at the end of the importance of being earnest.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
She says, the general was essentially a man of peace

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
except in his domestic life.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
But you're the other way around.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
You're a man of peace in your domestic life.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Except for my private life.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Maybe what I generally am.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
You're a highly agreeable person.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
I try as best I can to keep a lid on it.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
This lack of meaning and people's desire there.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
Absolutely fervent desire to try and fill that hole

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
with as many things as they can.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Like Lizzo.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Like Lizzo, indeed.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
Did you see the stories that came out about Lizzo?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Oh, it was wonderful.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
About her Amsterdam.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
My favorite story of the year.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Long way.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
For the people that don't know,

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Lizzo was on tour in Amsterdam.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Took her backup dances to the Red Light District.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Yes.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And made the backup dancers,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
some of the backup dancers eat bananas out of the vaginas

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
of Amsterdamian strippers.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
My view is what happened here was that Lizzo

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
thought you could outsource the eating

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
of your five fruit and veggie day.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
To the vagina of the stripper?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
She's so reluctant to eat healthfully.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
She even outsources the five fruit and veggie day.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
That's my view.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
Well, it seems to me that both Lizzo,

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
Ellen DeGeneres, Jimmy Kimmel,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
all of these people who up front.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Oh, isn't it wonderful?

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
It's so great.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
It's always nice.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Not the Lizzo look nice,

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
but the squeaky clean Ellen DeGeneres thing,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
just dancing.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
And of course, they're horrible in real life.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Of course.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
It's a sort of rule that, by the way,

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
one of the biggest public figures is that the ones

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
who are most sort of sweetie-sweetie in public

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
tend to be the nastiest in private.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Sometimes the opposite can be true.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Some people who have thought to have a very hard edge in public

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
can actually be lovely, lovely people in private.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Margaret Thatcher was a good example.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Very, very nice to people around her,

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
but could make tough decisions.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
To me, it's a counter signal.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
If I see someone doing the Lizzo thing

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
of I am so body positivity,

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
it becomes their identity

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
because they're a flaming sword,

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
card carrying,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
paragon of whatever this thing is.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Well, it's also a bit like

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
the Jimmy Savile,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
the hospital,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
what was it called? It still goes,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
but there was a hospital for children

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
that he raised money for all the time.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
And whenever anyone would try to do an investigation,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Savile would go,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
it's going to hurt the hospital for kids.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Are you sure you want to run that story?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
That's going to hurt the hospital.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
So there are lots of people in our own age

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
who have a thing like that.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
They build the equivalent of the Jimmy Savile

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Children's Hospital facade up

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
in order to protect themselves.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Are you saying that Lizzo's work

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
with the body positivity movement

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
is in a case to try and effectively

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
put a wall of large

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
bodied people in front of it?

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
A very difficult wall to get over.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I think it's probably easy to get over.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Getting around it might be more difficult.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Yeah, I got into a car and it ran out of gas.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
So,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I had this idea about

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
why

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
certain women

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
are very pro body positivity movement.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
And I was listening to Bill Burr

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
do a live show,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
and he said,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
ladies, if you could only support

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
the WNBA the way that you support

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
a fat chick

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
who is gaining weight

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
and no longer a threat to you,

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
there are more numbers than the NBA is.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
And I realized that

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
some non-zero number

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
of women may deep down

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
in their darker moments realize

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
that they don't discourage

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
some of their friends from

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
gaining weight because

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
they can eat themselves out of their

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
intersexual competition for potential partners.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
It's always welcome on men like that as well.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
How do we play that game?

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I mean, this is going to show a low side of my character.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
But you can't say always that you're sad

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
if

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
somebody you're not very close to, but you knew

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
and you see them after some years and then

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
they're fat.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I mean, you can't say there isn't a slight sort of

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
you'll never guess

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
because you've become fat.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
There are different versions of that with men, I think.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
And I think men can be

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
complicit in that as well.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
You know, the thrill

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
would offend bolds early.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I think that's very common.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Well, there'll be a German word for that.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Of course.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
For the scalp.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Yeah.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I think lots of people do that.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
But it's a pretty bad thing to encourage among people.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
But yeah, I think it is part of the competition

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
taking out of the competition for sure.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
I was thinking as well about how

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
material conditions

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
you were saying before

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
people's parents

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
maybe had it better in some ways, but also

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
would have had it way worse.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Material conditions

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
often don't impact

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
people's demeanors in the way that they might have predicted.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Like, rich people

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
can be bitter idiots

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
and poor people can be grateful heroes.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Although, as George Orwell said, by the age of 50

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
every man gets the face he deserves.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
What do you mean by that?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I think that's actually true.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I think there's a certain age, it might not be 50 now,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
but it's a certain age where you do show your life

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
on your face.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Oh yeah, I mean, for instance, somebody

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
is very profoundly depressed

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
for a long time

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
that writes itself across the face.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
It writes itself in their eyes, I think.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Particularly unhappiness

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
writes itself on somebody's face.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Joy does as well.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
If somebody smiles a lot, they have laugh lines.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Yes, there's a great truth in it.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
We know that

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
because we judge people by

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
their faces, by the way they interact with us

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
by the way they look at us.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
It's perfectly sensible.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
I've found a quote the other day that said

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
people with a low self-esteem will always

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
find a way to be miserable.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
And it made me think that

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
material conditions a lot of the time are what?

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Young people, but many people

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
lay at the feet of their

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
despondency or their nihilism

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
or their critical nature

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
or whatever it might be.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
And I've seen enough of my friends

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
and friends

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
vacillate through

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
varying levels of

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
affluence or

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
relationship or singletonness or whatever.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
And one of the things

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
sometimes it impacts the way that they show up.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
But many times they are the common denominator

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
between all of those situations.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
And the material conditions don't actually impact

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
the way that they show up all that much.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Well, there's a problem of analyzing this

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
which is that anyone who's successful

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
inevitably looks at their own path

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
to some extent pre-ordained.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I mean, almost.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I mean, there are some people with wild luck.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
But most people,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
a lot of people, let me say, who are successful

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
look back and they think, well, I don't understand

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
this person who hasn't made it to the same

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
rung of the ladder as I have. Why didn't they work hard?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
There's a sort of

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
callousness actually that can creep in there.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
But equally, people are

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
to a great extent masters their own fate.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And it's a very hard one

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
to analyze that, as I said, because the outriders

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
skew the whole statistics.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I mean, the outrider who does very well,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
not everyone can do

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
what he or she has done.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
But he or she is likely to think

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
they could have done.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Well, you retroactively, lots of people that achieve success

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
look back at the route that was

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
particularly designed by them,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
for them to achieve the very specific

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
type of success that they managed to get.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
And then retrofit that as a universal law

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
that anybody else could follow.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
One of the things I've realized is I've spent

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
more time digging into personal growth

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
and self-development and all of that stuff.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
So much of it is post-hoc rationalization

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
about one person's very

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
idiosyncratic solution for this thing.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
And they say, these are the universal

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
principles of X, Y and Z.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
And you go, no, they're not.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
They're highly personal.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
It's your personality just spun up

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
and tuned up to 11.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Yeah, I mean, most successful

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
people I've ever met have some

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
story of their own

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
growth which

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
is both inspiring

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
and not replicable

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
because they're unusual people.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Well, what's the alternative, as you said before?

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Like, you have to lay the agency at your

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
own feet because if you were to

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
perhaps admit the truth, which is

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
I was in the right place at the right time.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Well, that can be the case.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Not many people say that, but some do.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Yeah, if you're in Britain in the 80s,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
for instance, it's a good time to make money.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Easier, better

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
than today.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Some people will say, yeah, it was a great place at the right time.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
But most people do sort of

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
vaguely think they've made it,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
it was sort of preordained.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I will do that to some extent.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I often describe myself as being lucky

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
and then need somebody to remind me

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
of how hard I've worked.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Yeah.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
I had a friend who joined

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Goldman Sachs in 1998

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
and he said he had

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
an absolute golden period

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
for about 10 years.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Yeah, a little bit less.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
He said it was already starting to

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
wind down. Before Lehman, brother.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Yeah.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Some of that was to do with DEI, a very early

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
instantiation of DEI. That's right.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Yes, there's several books that make that clear

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
in the subtext, yeah. Several books

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
that make it clear about some of the hiring processes going on.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Yeah, 2006, he was already seeing it.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
But he told me

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
he made a trade

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
on 9-11.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
He made a very

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
particular trade

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
and bypassed all of the

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
security

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
concerns, the limits

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
on everything and

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
the pit boss or whatever. He's just some young

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
dude. He's been there for two years, right? Out of

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
whatever university or something. What did his boss think

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
of the trade? Came over and said, like,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
what the fuck are you

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
doing? And he said, look

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
at this. If this, then that. If this, then that.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Ran it all the way down. He said, this is the outcome.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
This is what's going to happen. And he's like,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
we would like, I don't know what.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
So first off, he was concerned that it was going to

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
go wrong. And then he made

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
the most

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
ungodly amount of money in the space of three hours.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
And then all the markets shut for 10

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
days from September 12th.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
And the only

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
organization that had spare capital

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
was Goldman because of this

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
particular trade. Wow.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
He was basically told

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
we may need to cut this. I'll check with him.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
He was basically told,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
go home. Don't tell anybody.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Yeah, of course. That you made this. He shorted

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
the market. Yeah, I mean, it was

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
widely thought of 9-11 that because

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
the stock market tanked, of course, immediately

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
and we didn't know if there's going to be a world war, if this was

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
a world war.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
And it was regarded very

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
swiftly as actually being the duty

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
of Wall Street to

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
not do that.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
But Bush came back. You remember he did that

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
ground zero announcement.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
And that was as much

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
for the stock market

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
as it was for the fucking popular.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Yeah, absolutely. Well, yes, because

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
stock market collapses. I mean, many, many more

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Americans, I can't remember the percentage,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
are invested in the stock market than in Britain.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
I mean, like three times more or something

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Americans. With 401K.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Yeah, more than 50% of the population

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
in America has some

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
investment in the stock market. So it's

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
different from in the UK where

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
when the pound was shorted in the 1990s

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
by

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Soros and others,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
they

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
a lot of British people are not that sympathetic because

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
they don't see themselves as being involved

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
in the stock market, which of course they are, they just

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
don't know it. You mentioned

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
George Orwell, the telegraph

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
recently spoke about his

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
wife's biography or autobiography.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Oh, there's a new biography of Sonia Orwell, yeah.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
George Orwell was sadistic,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
misogynistic, homophobic and sometimes

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
violent. Biographer of the legendary

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
writer's wife says, darkness

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
that runs through 1984

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
is a reflection of his soul.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Should we unperson, George?

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Well, it would be the obvious

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
end point to the full circle.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Full circle.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Yeah, this is just a way for

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
the author to get publicity is to repeat

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
things everyone knew. I mean,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
George Orwell held the views

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
of his time about gay men.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
For instance, we know he was a little bit homophobic,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
but it was the 1940s,

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
you know,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Nancy Boys and so on, as he would have called him.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Were not,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
you know, people weren't

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
like a 1990s

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
taxi driver's insult that they've thrown out.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
No, it was a sort of word that Orwell

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
and people of his generation would use,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
you know, fairies or something.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
And he does in some of his letters and some of his articles.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
But I mean, so fucking what?

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I don't care.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
I mean,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
was he sadistic probably?

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
In some ways,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
sometimes,

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
was, could he be cruel and nasty

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
probably being a human being?

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I just think that the

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
absurdity of our age of judging people

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
and passing, well, you know, just, just

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
wait till people do that to you.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Yeah. You know, wait, wait till somebody

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
weighs up your own

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
life in the balance and finds

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
you wanting, you know.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I mean, I think it's preposterous.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Human beings are what we are.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Being amazed

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
us in the past.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
There's always just an expression of our own vanity

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
and thinking we've got past all that.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
It's like the way, if a

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
friend of mine was saying to me the other day when I was at Oxford,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
if you want to get a grant

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
to study these days, say in English,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
and you would choose

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Shakespeare as your

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
subject of study, which is sort of unusual

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
these days, you would,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
you would, for instance, have to

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
find Shakespeare guilty of, you know,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
racism, colonialist thinking

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
and so on. And it doesn't seem to strike

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
these people that actually their job is not

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
to judge Shakespeare. Shakespeare judges

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
us.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
And he might find us wanting.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
How so?

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Well, he gives us visions of

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
the universe and our place

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
in it, which it would do us well to listen

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
to.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
And that might include

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
exposing human follies,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
human weakness, human pride,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
human sin, human lust,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
the tendency to

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
do evil in the name of doing good

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
or think you're doing good and do great harm.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
So much more.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
All of this

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
is in Shakespeare's work and his characters

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
and the things he created

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
in his mind and his work.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I think that if you look

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
at a panoply of a vision like

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
that, you should think, I wonder

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
what he's telling us. Rather

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
than I wonder how I can judge him.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
What's the point of the letter?

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
It's so boring.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Human being from the past, inhuman

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
being in the past, shocker.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Has it always been this way? Has it always been

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
people of the

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
present judging people of yesterday by the

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
standards of today?

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Well, most people didn't

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
have time in the past to engage in that.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Too busy trying to put food on the table.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Surviving past the age of 25.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
But what it is in our

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
current society is there's a very strange

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
lack of respect for wisdom.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Henry Kissinger said this in the early years

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
of the internet. He said all the knowledge

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
is there, but where's the wisdom?

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
People might not like me quoting Dr.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Kissinger in that regard, but

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
again, he knows a lot more than

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
most of his critics.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
I do think that's

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
a strict oddity of the age.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I think the oddity, the vanity of trying to judge

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
everyone from the past by our current standards

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
is just absurd.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
You think you know more than Shakespeare?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
You think you know more than Orwell?

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
These are minnows

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
snapping

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
giants. I don't care

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
for them.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
One

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
potentially unfortunate situation is

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
that women's mental health

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
is in part down to

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
misogynistic songs.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
When BTS lead singer Young Cook

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
changed to a more misogynistic

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
music, a disturbing trend followed.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
A psychiatrist's point of view

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
on BTS' Young Cook and the messages

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
of pop music.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Early in their teen career, BTS took

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
a deliberate stance to refrain from

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
objectifying or sexualizing women.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Despite going against a music industry norm,

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
BTS achieved huge success.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Now, as part of his solo launch,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
different imagery has surfaced

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
in Young Cook songs.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
They include a woman telling her man

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
that she will be your fantasy

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
and swallow your pride

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
to make him never think about cheating.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Lyrics that identify...

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
You said swallow your pride

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
in a particularly suggestive way.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
I've got more to go here.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Lyrics that identify women

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
as those hoes over there

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
with a male rapper telling his female partner,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
I wanked before you came

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
so that I can fuck you longer.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Of course, in reality, Young Cook songs

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
are part of the course, or even tame.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Does that work, by the way, what you just described?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
You've never

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
increased your stamina by

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
having a warm-up?

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
I thought the lyrics were more likely.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
I did that before you came and I just let you go to bed.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I kind of got a lie down.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I did that before you came and that's why I texted

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
saying I'm not so fussed about you.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I don't have a quick dinner now.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
One of my friends had

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
a rubric for this that was masturbate

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
before you evaluate.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Oh, well, that's true.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
That can be sensible advice.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
I'm not sure if I liked you or I was just horny.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
But no, girls, mental health...

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
You were reading out these charming lyrics.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Those hoes over there I wanked

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
before you came so that I can fuck you longer.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Well,

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
where to start?

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Downstream from K-pop is a litany of female mental health problems.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
That's what I'm saying.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
There's a problem here, isn't there?

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Because on the one hand, popular culture does have

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
a massive impact on the way we see the world.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
I was at a gym recently

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
where I actually asked

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
the gym staff to turn off the music

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
because it was a load of

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
rap, a very unpleasant rap,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
with repeated use of the N-word in it.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Obviously, it was a black rapper or so I was assuming.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Right.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Do you find yourself mouthing along to the lyrics

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
and not worried about it?

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
That's right.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
What problem could possibly emerge

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
from singing along?

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Mate, just to interject there,

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
someone got cancelled on TikTok

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
for mouthing the N-word along to a song.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Right.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
It's possible.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
It's no longer the sound of the word,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
it's the mouth shape

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
that that word engenders.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Well, we know that it's a magical word

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
in our time, which even the speaking

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
of suddenly summons up the demons of

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
the past. Lord Voldemort, yeah.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Very, very strange.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
But, no, I just said to the gym staff,

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
I just don't want to hear it because I don't want

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I just don't want it in the background

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
of my life, you know.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Was it that gym that we trained at?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
We can discuss this another time.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
But anyway.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
No, I just don't like, I have certain things I don't want

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
on my ears and that's one actually.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
I have no interest in hearing the word

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
as a banned word. So why would I want it

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
in my mental background?

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Yeah.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
But anyway, the point is, of course

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
popular culture has a huge impact on people.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
It has a huge impact on the way in which people see themselves.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
It does. It does.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
At the same time, you can overstate it.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
You know, somebody is not generally unhappy

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
just because of the popular culture.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Apart from anything else because you can easily step out of it

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
as I try to do.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
And, you know,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
be a part of your time but not be its creature

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
that says.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
And

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
so no, I think it's a sort of

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
weak excuse for unhappiness.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
The popular culture happens not to be to your taste

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
or avoid it. Get out.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Look up from the screen.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
When is cancel culture going to come for

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
rap lyrics?

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Because it seems to me that, you know, it's worth fighting

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
against the misogyny of

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
air conditioning temperatures in offices

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
that are conditioned

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
to the male body temperature as opposed to

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
the female body temperature or

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
I mean the

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
the levity of the era

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
is just astonishing to me.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
You know, lots of people

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
attribute to me this quote that I was not quite

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
right. I don't think it's quite from me but

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
that we'll be talking about gender pronouns

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
when the barbarians break in.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
But I've said something like it

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
quite a few times but I mean

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
you know

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
gender norms and air conditioning

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
it's the sort of thing that you would be discussing

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
just before you will get

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
you know machetted.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
I'm totally serious about this.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
It's

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
sometimes it's like

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
one of the things that actually

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
genuinely shocked me in recent weeks

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
particularly after Hamas massacre in Israel

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
was you know and

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
something which I do think at some point when it's

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
all died down a bit

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
might be a moment

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
of

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I've got to say this carefully

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
but a moment of

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
seriousness which is

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
you know

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
take the music festival within a few miles

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
of the Gaza border that Hamas attacked

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
all the young people there

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
were at this sort of peace rave

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
and

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
this isn't in any way to victim blame

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
these are people just

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
wanting to dance

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
and

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
dance into the early morning and

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I think it was called the peace rave

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
the peace and love rave something like that

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
and then this hideous

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
other world broke into

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
them and to their lives and ended the lives

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
of hundreds of them.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
There's something

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
haunting about this I find because it's

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
especially haunting because

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
it sort of demonstrates that

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
your slogans and your attitudes

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
only go so far

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
and they can't keep out

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
some of the things that are lurking at the edges

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
and I think that when I hear

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
people whining about

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
minor things

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
if you have any idea

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
of the world out there

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
if you had any idea of the things that was lurking

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
you couldn't possibly

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
be complaining about this

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
How do you think

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Gaze for Gaza will get on long term?

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Well the joke at the moment is that there aren't enough tall

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
buildings in Gaza to throw Gaze for Gaza

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
off

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
but

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I mean these people

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I've said very often

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
they're part of the same phenomenon as

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
turkeys for Christmas and chickens for KFC

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I mean

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
I'm fed up with these infringe

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
idiot cases

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
they're so mentally defective

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
for these people

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
and incredibly narcissistic

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
I can be queer and also celebrate

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
so no you fucking can't fuck off

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I can both argue for a two state solution

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
and also celebrate queerness and also not let myself down

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
no you can't

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
no you can't

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
you can't do all those things at some point you've got to choose

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I've got a video to show you

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
let me show you this video

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Can someone please explain to me

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
what this means

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
what does reproductive justice

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
mean

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
free Palestine

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
what does that even mean

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
like what does it mean

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
I'm pretty sure

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
abortions are illegal

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
in Palestine

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
unless it's like a super medical emergency

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
and the mother will die

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
from what I understand actually a lot of Palestinians

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
have to go to Israel

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
to get the abortions

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
they want so what does this mean

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
what

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
it's such a huge sign

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
there's

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
five people holding this thing

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
it's massive

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
that's very good

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
that's Danny the other half of Ryan

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
who wasn't there the day that you

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
came

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
reproductive justice means free Palestine

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
what do you think

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
this is just

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
incredibly ignorant young people in America

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
who have been taught

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
this weird

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
version of the world where all oppressions

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
are taken into lock

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
you're either the majority or the minority

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
for minority rights and issues

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
or for majority rights and issues

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
and all minority rights and issues

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
intersect and overlap

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
so that if you're queer somehow

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
no it's not even that

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
these ignoramuses

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
who couldn't point to the river Jordan

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
if you showed it to them on a map

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
walk along the streets of America

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
shout you know from the river to the sea

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Palestine will be free because I think the Palestinians

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
where they've mapped a very

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
specific version

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
of American racial politics

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
onto everything else in the world

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
it's the same thing people who talk about

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
colonizers

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
there's this language

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
of colonizers

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
apartheid all this stuff

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
and

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
they've just tried to map it everywhere

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
actually it's highly selectively

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
highly selectively

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
the people who are talking about

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
colonizers

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
when I saw that

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
the other day on the streets of London

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
I thought yes if only there was a name

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
for large numbers of people who came from outside

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
to a country

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
and if only we could identify

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
what they might be called in Britain

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
oh it would be immigrants wouldn't it

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
do you want to call immigrants colonizers

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
in Britain

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
you sure you want to follow this logical conclusion

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
talk about indigenous peoples

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
oh okay great anyway you don't want to apply that

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
might there be a country

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
or a continent say oh Europe

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
where you don't want to start talking about the indigenous peoples

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
I notice that people don't

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
but if you do want to

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
welcome to hell

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
so

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
no all it is happening is a very selective mapping

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
of a particular interpretation of the world

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
that very

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
dumb people in America have tried to

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
put on certain selective other cases

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
and it doesn't work

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
but

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
may they never find out

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
how much it doesn't work

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
may they never find out

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
I wish them bliss

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
in their ignorance because if their

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
ignorance ever gets popped it will be

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
as brutal a day as can be imagined

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
I've been thinking

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
for a good while about how

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
hypocrisy is a purpose

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
built tool for the internet to use

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
it's like catnip for the internet

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
it's the thing because

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
the reason it's so purpose built

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
it's like one of those

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
can you spot the difference competitions on a touch screen

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
iPad this is what's on the left this is what's on the right

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
and what you have is here's something that someone once said

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
or a position that they used to hold

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
and here is what they hold now

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
or here is what they do in their real life

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
here is whatever and it's kind of what

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
you're identifying here that you have

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
a worldview which is self-contradictory

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
you're just using different words for one thing

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
that is almost exactly the same for another thing

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
and then complaining about this one

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
saying don't look over here

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
don't look over here yeah

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
everyone is inconsistent to some extent

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
and I don't think by the way

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
I mean on hypocrisy

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
for instance

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I can see a scenario where somebody might say

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
oh Douglas you're hypocritical on this

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
particular question I might say well

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
there are some things I think are even more important

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
than not being a hypocrite such as

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
I don't know surviving

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
the worst thing about him is his hypocrisy

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
hypocrisy

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
there's a weird

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
hypocrisy is the easiest one to catch people on

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
is the truth of that

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
it's the easiest one to spot

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
you just

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
and they do it

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
as you say on this is what this person said

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
20 years ago this is what they say now

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
get human being in growing up

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
shocker

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
people

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
are allowed to evolve

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
they change their minds

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
it would be rather boring to say the same thing

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
and think the same thing only for

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
70 years

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
but yeah people find

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
hypocrisy very easy to see

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
and it's about the only vice you can really catch somebody on

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I think

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
because if you say one thing publicly

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
and do another thing privately

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
it's about the only one that people are really confident on

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
or most other

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
moral judgments are better or worse

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
of sort of ebbed away but people still

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
are able to judge hypocrisy

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
but

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
I think

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
there are worse things

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
I think not standing up for your

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
loved ones not standing up for your country

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
not standing up for

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
yourselves in the face of

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
horrible opposition

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
from within without probably worse than hypocrisy

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
I heard you say recently you don't have to agree

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
with everyone's principle to respect the principle

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
they're sticking to

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
did I say that? yeah sounds good

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
I didn't know I said that but yeah

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
but the reason that I like that

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
is

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
I think it shows

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
why

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
the bravery conversation

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
or standing up for something that you believe in

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
is something that is a pride

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
at least then if someone is prepared to stand up for

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
whatever their beliefs are

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
that you can assume they're telling the truth

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
especially if they pay a high price for it

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
it's one of the reasons why I have

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
a good amount of faith that Sam believes

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
the things that he says

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
why would he not? he pays an unbelievably

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
high price to continue to flip flop

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
from one tribe to another tribe

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
to another tribe

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
I don't think it's an unbelievably high price but a price

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
relatively high price

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
I mean very early

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
in some people's careers or when people first make it

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
to public notice people say things like

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
do you really believe what you say

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
the answer to which for most people

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
is or ought to be well why would I say it

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
if I didn't believe it

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
there are people who obviously do say stuff

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
for lolls

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
or clicks or monetary purpose

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
but at a certain point

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
you've got to accept that the person thinks what they think

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
and you know

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
respect them for it or at least do them the decency

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
of believing that they mean it

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
and I think that even on people I disagree with

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
wildly I mean it's such a boring argument

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
that one some people use it particularly on the left

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
I wonder if they actually even believe it

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I think they don't I think they're just doing it for money

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
well that's an easier way to try to ignore them

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
than actually trying to contend with the possibility

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
of what they're saying is something they mean

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
and believe and trying to work out if there's anything in it

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
much easier to say the person's

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
only doing it because they're paid or something

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
yeah that's the

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
shill grifter accusation

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
very boring accusation

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
I don't doubt there are some people who that is the case with

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
but way fewer than

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
way fewer than people think

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Michael Malis has a hierarchy

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
of different

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
I think it's like the hierarchy of grifters

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
if you say Michael Malis my face immediately

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
sort of starts to smile

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
it's terrible

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
one of the it's like

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
industry plant

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
paid opposition

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
it goes all the way up

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
and he said that he descended recently

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
he's not quite at paid opposition but I think he's industry plant now

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
I think Lex Friedman is

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
paid opposition

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
his paid is different from

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
controlled opposition

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
maybe it's controlled opposition I don't fucking know

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
these are such weird

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
terms that are cropped up in our area

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
again I think they're sort of low

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
resolution explanations

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
really really low resolution

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
explanations for things

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
whenever I hear somebody describe things as that

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
I always sort of know you're not dealing with somebody who actually understands the world

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
do you find there's a

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
definitely a trend of

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
conspiratorial thinking

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
conspiracism

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
much stronger in our adopted

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
homeland than it is in the UK

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
yes that's true

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
what do you think

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
are you

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
how conspiracy-pilled are you

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
do you see

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
I mean it's

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
this is the moment when people say

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
ahhh controlled opposition

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
hahahaha

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
this is me allowing you to graduate

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
I think I talked about this on the boys cast

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
that's right

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
briefly and

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
various people wrote to me saying ah there you go

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
that's proof that you're paid

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
you're glowing as it's called

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
you heard you're glowing

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
so

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
tell me if I'm wrong with this Mark

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
you're the resident glow expert

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
but you're glowing

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
means you're like a

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
planted

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
person who's saying

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
something that is outing there

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
like

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
it's an intelligence operation

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
that's breached the surface and people can see it

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
they comment on tiktok saying

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
you're glowing

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
the people that alleged to be FBI

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
who are at certain protests

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
or wearing chinos and t-shirts

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
yeah

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
so you're conspiratorial

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
the thing with conspiracy theories is very difficult

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
in our era because some of the conspiracies are true

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
of course have come true

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
well known to be true

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
lab leak conspiracy

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
theory probably true

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
they shouldn't have ever called

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
nobody should ever have called it a conspiracy theory

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
because it wasn't a conspiracy theory

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
it was one of a set of hypotheticals

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
to explain what happened

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
with covid

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
so a lot of things get called

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
conspiracy which are not

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
they're just hypotheses

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
that should be allowed to remain on the table

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
and that makes a certain type of person increasingly prone

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
to believe

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
that everything that's called a conspiracy theory

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
is not a conspiracy theory

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
and before you know it you get

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
sanish individuals thinking

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
that the moon landings were a conspiracy

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
that we didn't land on the moon

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
the American didn't land on the moon

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
I don't know whether the people who now claim that

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
believe that the Russians also faked it

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
it's an interesting question to ask them

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
do you think that the soviets

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
were capable of getting to the moon but the Americans were not

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
the Americans set up

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
like a blow fan

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
and a flag on a dodgy

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
papier-mache set

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
to make it or did the Soviets and Americans both agree

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
to pretend to have gone to the moon but not really

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
have gone

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
none of it makes sense to my mind

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
but I have noticed

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
and it's actually all the literature that demonstrates

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
that there's certain types of mental

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
problems

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
that people have that make them

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
disproportionately likely to believe conspiracy theories

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
on

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
mass

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
and one of them is paranoia

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
the more paranoid a person is

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
more likely to believe that sort of thing

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
and that's the observation in my own life

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
I've known a number of people who've gone into the world

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
of conspiracy and not come out

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
and they are all people who have suffered

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
paranoid episodes in their lives

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
which adds up

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
so fear and genders

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
as I say

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
it's a sort of low resolution explanation

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
for complex phenomena

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
and I think

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
it's also that

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
conspiracy theories come about and are used

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
by people who

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
and this isn't an original point many people have made

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
the claims about them

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
are made by and large

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
by people who

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
don't understand how unbelievably

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
chaotic the world actually is

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
or can't face it

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
so

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
they can't face the fact that

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
yeah somebody you followed in the newspapers every day

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
all of your life did actually just die in a

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
freak car crash because the driver was drunk

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
they can't bear the idea

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
the world can't be that cruel

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
it can't be that random

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
you want a bed

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
it's got to be coordination it can't be coincident

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
exactly

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
so people who can't cope

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
with the wild frivolity of the roulette

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
table of our lives

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
um

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
always go to the there must be somebody behind it

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
there must be somebody who's controlling all this

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
you're joking nobody's controlling this

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
if anyone's controlling the damn thing I'd want to know by now

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
but of course they're not

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
so it's a very unsatisfactory

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
place to arrive at in your life

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and by the way

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
my own observation is not very good for people personally

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
because they start to lose agency

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
themselves

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I'm at the mercy of the world

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
and the real answer is

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
the world doesn't care

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
doesn't even know that you exist

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
it is deaf to you

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
the ability

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
for people to hold two conflicting thoughts

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
in their mind at the same time is supposed to be the mark

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
of sophisticated thinking

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
but it does show up here

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
which is the government is both

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
so useless that they can't get anything right

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
and so sophisticated that they're able to coordinate these

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
oh that's masses of versions the Arab world

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
is filled with that the Muslim world

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
is filled with that things like

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I've noticed this repeated on my travels things like

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
um 9-11

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
was an inside job of the Americans

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
to allow the Jews out of the World Trade Center

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
and also yay 9-11

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
good for Osama bin Laden

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
they can do both

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
uh there's a somebody I

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
knew interviewed the father

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
of um

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
the main 9-11 hijacker

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
his name's gone out of my mind I don't care

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
he must he should be forgotten but

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
interviewed the father in Jordan

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
and he was simultaneously capable

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
of holding in his head that his son was a great

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Shahid Amater for Islam

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
and that 9-11

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
was an inside job of the Americans

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
well what the fuck

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
like choose

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
it's I mean

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
do you think your son was an agent of the FBI

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
and also a

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
martyr like hey

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
people do this the Muslim world is particularly

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
prone to conspiratorial thinking

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
because it's a

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
source of flattery to itself

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
to explain why they have

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
created so few successful societies

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
and Bernard Lewis made this point many years

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
ago that the problem in the Muslim

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
world is that there's a they have to

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
find explanations because

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
if you're given the revelations of Muhammad

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
and you're told it's the last revelation ever from God

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
and that you are the people who have

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
received this revelation and everything's

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
going to go great for you because you've got the revelation

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
and then like the Jews you have one

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
country that does much better than any of your

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
countries and you know you

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
can't get the economy of

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
most of your country going at all and you can't

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
provide for most of your citizenry and nobody

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
is coming up the ladder and the economies

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
in the dust and all this you've got to

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
find an explanation for it because like what

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
we were given the revelation and

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
they're doing much better

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
there's massive

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
things like that that sit underneath the

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
movements of our time which

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
maybe billions of

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
people on the planet believe

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
and they believe them because it flatters themselves

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
it flatters the governments

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
who aspire to run these countries

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
or claim to run these countries

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
um yeah

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
billions of people believe this

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
shit. I was thinking

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
about

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
the extremist world view beliefs

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
largely in the west but

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I guess everywhere and I was wondering

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
whether

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
we have finally moved beyond peak woke

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
and a study came up

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
recently that was kind of interesting

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
researchers from change research

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
polled over a thousand registered US

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
voters from 18 to 34

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
a majority of both women and men

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
consider far rightism and far leftism

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
to be red flags in a potential partner

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
76% of women and 59% of men

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
consider identifying as a MAGA Republican

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
to be a large turnoff

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
64% of men and 55% of women

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
say they'd also swipe left on someone

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
identifying as a communist

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
55% of women

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
64% of men and 55% of women

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
swipe left on a communist that's a no

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
55% of men said that listening

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
to Joe Rogan was a red flag

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
41% of men

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
said the same for a woman

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
being into astrology

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
oh well that's now you're going with that one

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
if somebody says what's your start sign

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
date over

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
there's a really famous

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
meme where

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
it's on iMessage and the

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
text says

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
mum

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
what time was I born at

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
and the reply from mum says

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
stay the fuck away from that girl

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
the heart

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
sinks when it comes up

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
it's a question

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
for shame

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
33% of men

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
said

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
for Black Lives Matter it was a red flag

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
if they say Black Lives Matter 14% of women

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
53% of women said

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
it was a red flag if they refused

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
to see the Barbie movie

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
31% of men

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
58% of women

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
red flag if they say there are only

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
32 genders

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
34% of men

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
54% of women thought they identify as a

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
conservative

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
33% of men for they identify as a liberal

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
so next time you're vibing with someone

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
maybe save the podcast recommendations

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
and daily horoscopes for the second date

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
55% of women

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
say that listening to Joe Rogan was a red flag

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I wonder if the species has any

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
future

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
because they can't listen to Joe Rogan

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
or anything else

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
these people are wiping out

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
very significant numbers

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
of potential future partners

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
how weird

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Joe turning up in that

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
that's amazing

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
what happened to all the good old people

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
who used to say I don't have an opinion on that

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
what happened to those guys

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I got pulled in

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
a good bit recently

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
on the internet for

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
not commenting on the recent

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
socio-political

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
furor that's happening in the Middle East

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
and I quoted you

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
pseudonymously

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
and said

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I'm trying to make a habit of something which is very rare on the internet

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
to not comment on something which I know nothing about

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
it's a very good rule

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
and yet

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
it's the rarest

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
thing of all

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
people care about my

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
insights into health

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
and fitness

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
my learnings about

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
social psychology

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
why shouldn't my fiscal advice

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
be important

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
why shouldn't my views on immigration

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
it's much to be avoided that

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
I mean in the end

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
you make much less of a dick of yourself

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
if you don't start talking about everything

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
there's

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I mean

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
somebody recently

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
sent me an article

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
a relatively well known person

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
published about the Middle East

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
and near the opening said

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I don't really know much

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
about the Middle East

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
but this is

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
in that case don't speak

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
don't speak and say but

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
if you don't know

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
just agree not to do it

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
that's one reason

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
why there's a lot of

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
television these days in the UK

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
where you can be invited on

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
to debate

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
the total ignoramus who's only there

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
for balance

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
for off-comrelated balance

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
and I just can't do that stuff anymore

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
it's too

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
demeaning

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
that if there's a subject you know about

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
a war that you've covered

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
or covered many times

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
as in my case with Israel

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Hamas wars

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
and Israel Hezbollah wars

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I just can't be sitting there

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
with somebody

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
in a basic way but there's a lot of

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
women

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
who are currently invited on things for balance

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
firstly because they're women

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
secondly because they provide usually a left-wing perspective

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
and that's needed if it's me

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
that's on as well

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
and you know I just is so depressing

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
to give your informed opinion

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
about something you've seen and reported on first hand

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
and then they go to the other person

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
and they go well like

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I think it's

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
why don't I just at home

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
why I could be doing

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
anything else

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
and I've got to listen to somebody who doesn't know

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
what they're talking about whisk up an opinion

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
live on air

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
it's so depressing

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
but masses of people are like that and it's just

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
yeah

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
if you don't know about it don't talk about it

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
it's a very good law of thumb or try it out in private

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
with friends and mates and like

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
try to learn something read a book

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
are we morally obliged to

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
have a take on everything

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
no

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
no

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
most people's opinion doesn't matter

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I mean it just doesn't

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
and I also think

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
the people who spend their time online

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
broadly speaking

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
trying to broadcast out their opinions on things

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
should be told more often

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
doesn't matter

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
doesn't matter what you think

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I mean one of my rules on

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
on any war

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
is

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
to write a try to give advice to a government

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
you know

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
this is what the Israelis must do

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
this is what the Ukrainians must do

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I need to listen to you

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I mean

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
first of all you don't live in the country

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
unless you live in a country

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
be pretty damn sure

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
you should be a bit humble

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
about telling other people about

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
their lives

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
and also like who made you

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
the tactician

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
on everything

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
well it was the same as Covid

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
everyone became a virology or epidemiology expert

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
and then they became a withdrawal from

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Afghanistan expert

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
and then they became a Ukraine expert

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
and now they're all Middle East experts

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
and I just think

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
it should be regarded as a massive red flag

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
that the person in question is

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
normally what's happened is they've downloaded

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
the set of opinions they believe that their tribe

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
should have

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
and that's why the morons marching in London

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
with the exception of the Muslims who just whipped up all the time

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
by the fact that the Jews do anything

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Muslims don't care about other Muslims

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Arabs don't care about other Arabs

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
nobody cares about the Palestinians

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
nobody cares about them

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
can't tell you how little they care about them

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Jordanians loathe them

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
the Egyptians loathe them

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
the Lebanese loathe them

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
they've done nothing for the Palestinians

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
for 70 years

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
and yet

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
whenever the Israelis do anything

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
more Muslims across the west come out on the streets

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
because they hate the Jews

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
and you know

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in Yemen

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
not a peep

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
on the streets of Britain and other places

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
certainly not big protests

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Bashar al-Assad has killed more Muslims

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
in the last 10 years

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
then everybody on every side killed

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
in every war involving Israel

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
since 1948 including the war of independence

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
nobody cares

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
the Muslims don't come out on the streets

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
they don't care

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
the only thing they care about

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
is the hatred of the Jews

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
and it motivates them like nothing else

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
because it hits at the core of their self-esteem

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
they can't bear it

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
and so that one is

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
very interesting to me

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
but

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
there are these fellow travelers

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
who go along with them

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
who have downloaded as I say

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
a sort of pathetic American interpretation

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
of colonization

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
called justice, reproductive rights

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
and try to map everything on

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
and

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
my friend's got a theory called

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Gwinda's theory of bespoke bullshit

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
many don't have an opinion

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
until they're asked for it

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
at which point they cobble together a viewpoint

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
from women half remembered hearsay

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
before deciding that this two minute

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
two minute old makeshift opinion

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
will be their new hill to die on

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
that's very good

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
my friend Freddie Gray at the Spectator

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
he says each time a new big thing emerges

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
which is the Bluffer's Guide

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
to whatever

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
and it usually involves

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
saying things like

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
well they better get this done before the brutal

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Afghan winter kicks in

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
who made you an expert on like

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
meteorology in Afghanistan

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
like what?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
the Ukrainians have got to make this advance

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
before the dreaded Ukrainian May

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
and I just

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I mean I tried

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
the Bluffer's Guide

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
I try for instance never to write

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
about any foreign policy issue

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
if it's about a country I've not visited

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
preferably visited multiple times

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I just

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I can't bring myself to do it

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I find it too embarrassing

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
it's so interesting when you talk about

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
knowing

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
one opinion that a person holds

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
and from that one opinion being able to accurately predict

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
everything else that they believe

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
that mono thinking

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
just proves that you're not a serious thinker

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
well I just

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
it's fairly obvious if for instance you say

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
what's the problem with the big bearded guy

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
winning the women's weightlifting

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
I go okay I know all of your other opinions as well

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
and to be fair

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
that probably works the other way around as well to a great extent

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
the interesting thing with

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
most people is where they're slightly out of sorts

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
with their own political side

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
well that's exactly the point

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
that

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
if it's been a long time since

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
you were surprised

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
by the opinion of your favorite

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
thinker or writer or commentator

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
or whatever it is

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
that's probably a reliable signal

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
that they're not really thinking for themselves

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
if you're just permanently

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
it's like an old leather pair of shoes

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
here we go again

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
the covid things happened and I can already predict

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
such and such is

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
opinion on it

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
every single time

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
you know the idiosyncrasies of this person's

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
very very particular

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
worldview

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
well that's because it's not theirs

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
yeah of course it's everybody else's

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
it's outsourced thinking

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
and what's really sad about that is that

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
it means that you're not really living your life

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I mean you're living a

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
pastiche of

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
a prescribed set of opinions

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
that's so sad, I mean it's so sad

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
the wasted energies and wasted lives

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
of people who've just

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
excluded a set of opinions and they're just

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
running them

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
well that's not your life, it's just someone else's life

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
you're just replaying

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
what was that quote you told me about

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
being shunted to the side of the road of your own

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
it's a Philip Larkin quote

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
from a poem of his, yeah it's a description

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
of a couple and he says that something is

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
pushing them to the side of their own lives

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
it's a beautiful line

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
terrifying line, horrifying line

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
should make everyone

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
judge for themselves

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
oh well it means

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
that there's a life that you

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
hoped to live

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
you saw yourself living

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
and you got pushed to the side

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
of it and ended up not living that life

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I think

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
a large number of people have that

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
almost all unhappy people I've met

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
have that feeling to some extent

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
and then you've got a

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
choice of poisons, one of which is to

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
choose the poison of

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
other people held me back

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
another is to face up to the fact

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
that you're in some way a coward

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
or a victim of

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
circumstance or something else

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
but I think a lot, I mean

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
you know one thing that young people

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
can be encouraged to do is to set out

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
the sort of life they would like to live

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
imagine the sort of life they would like to live and the name for it

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
and

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
working it out is sometimes difficult, sometimes not

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
but if you do

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
have that image of your life that you think

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
it should be lived and you end up

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
not living it, that is

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
particularly if you can feel yourself slowly being pushed away from it

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I think that's a

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
terrible, terrible feeling

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
it's like watching your own demise

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
occur second by second

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
fortunately I've never felt it but I definitely fear it

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
where do you go

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
to find

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
or to avoid cowardice or to find

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
resilience or

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
bravery because a lot of the time

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
the easier path is easier

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
and it's the one that's got the least resistance

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
surround yourself with courageous people

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
surround yourself

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
with brave people

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
and that can be

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
bravery of all sorts of different kinds

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
when I turned 40

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
I had a dinner

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
which I think you weren't invited to

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
but it's only because you weren't in town

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
if I remember rightly but

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I did get a lot of my favourite people in the room

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
at least and it was interesting that

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
a friend

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
made a speech in which he said it's striking

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
the names of the people around the table

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
but some of whom will be familiar to listeners

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
but a friend of mine gave a very touching

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
speech I was very moved by

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
how noticeable it was that Douglas surrounded himself

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
with courageous people

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
and it was from a very wide array

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
of bits of the world

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
and different disciplines and so on and I was really touched by that

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
because I hadn't particularly noticed that I'd done it

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
but then I realized I sort of had

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
that actually yes I had

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
a massive subconsciously but maybe now consciously

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I wanted to be around courageous people

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
because I think that courage is something that rubs off on other people

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I think it's enormously

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
to be desired

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
to be around courageous people

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
and there might be different types of courage

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
some of it physical, some of it

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
mental

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
so

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
that's one thing, surround yourself with courageous people

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
or at least not cowards

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
not cretins, not the sort of people who just

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
say the same things that everyone's meant to say

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
and so on. There's as many ways people

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
can get out of this non-life

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
that they are being shunted into

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
one of my friends

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
it wasn't a friend at the time

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
I just met him for the first time but someone that had been

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
interested in for a good while

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I met in Austin a while ago

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
and

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
he'd had an interesting story and he'd

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
faced a cancellation over the last few years

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
and he'd sort of told me the

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
story and he said

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
he sat on some rooftop

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
later

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
late at night talking about this thing

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and he was regaling me with the story

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
and he said throughout my entire life I thought I was a hard man

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I like to

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
do man things and surround myself with masculine

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
people and I was into

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
guns and shooting and fitness

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
and friends with navy seals and all the rest of it

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
and he said my entire life I was scared that I was a coward

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
terrified that I was a coward

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
and he said

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
in my darker moments

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I could always hear my better self

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
clearing his throat in the room next door

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
beautiful

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
and then this cancellation thing came along

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
and he said

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
even the people that do really hard things

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
hard intellectual work

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
hard training work, hard physical work

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
all the rest of it

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
there's a difference in the kind of difficulty

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
that they do because it's elected

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
you've chosen to do the hard

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
workout but when

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
the entire world comes to bear

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
on you

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
in a way that feels like chaos and catastrophe

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
whipped up into a whirlwind

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
and he said

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
yeah I

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
that was a genuine test

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
and he was

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
very grateful he said my better self

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
stopped his coughing and

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
kicked the door in and came to help

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
but just

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
I could always hear my better self clearing

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
his throat in the room next door

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
the thing with that is

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
the difference between

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
situations

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
you find yourself in that are dangerous

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
through choice and

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
ones that you've

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
been thrust into

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
and you probably know

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
that the consequence of being

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
thrust into a dangerous situation is much more

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
likely to lead to

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
PTSD and things like that

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
than

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
if you choose to

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
and

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
I've been fortunate in my life the most

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
dangerous situations I've been in have been ones I've chosen

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
to be in

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
and that's very different

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
but yes I'm glad he found

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
out that he was more

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
courageous than he feared

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
think about that what a beautiful line

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
to be more courageous than you feared

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
you were

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
almost this war

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
against yourself

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
this fear of your own

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
nature

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
I mean there's a horrible example I sometimes use

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
but I mean

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
if you're ever mugged

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
for your wallet let alone you're mugged with

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
somebody else let alone if you're mugged with a girl

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
that you were with or looking after and you just handed it over

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
there's like there's several reasons

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
that it's worth handing over the wallet for

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
one of which is like

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
why do I need to risk getting shot for like

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
or stabbed for a hundred

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
bucks and a

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
few phone calls to the bank

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
so that's like the reason

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
to hand over the wallet

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
the reason not to hand over the wallet

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
is are you sure that you're not going

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
to spend the succeeding weeks

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
dreaming dreams of pornographic violence

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
against your attacker

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
and thinking

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
thinking of how you're going to torture him

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
if you could get your hands on him and the brutal way

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
in which you would have revenge if you ever

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
find him

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
it might be easy to just get your head kicked in a bit

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
and are you sure you can live with

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
the version of yourself that is you handing over the wallet

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I said this recently in a piece in New York Post

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
about the people on the New York subway

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
where there's this awful thing you've probably seen

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
where people you know like a woman

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
will be being abused by some maniac

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
fentanyl-addled

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
you know

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
drug addict and

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
people like either look into their phones

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
including men or they will get their phones

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
up and like record

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
and

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I said Douglass is trying to get people killed

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
and I wasn't obviously but what I was saying was

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
where are the men

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
just like stand up

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
and like confront the guy if he's

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
got a woman by her hair

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
and is parading around the carriage

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
and

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
yeah the backlash was like

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
what do you know

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
these people might get killed if they step in

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
but might say

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
yeah but also

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
maybe we'll have a more civil society

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
if people don't think they can go around

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
and do this stuff without consequence

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
um

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I'd like to see

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
far more standing up like that

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I think it's a pathetic position

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
particularly for men to be in to sit there like

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
getting out their mobile phones

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
but you know it's everyone's choice

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I don't exactly know what I would do

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
in some of the situations I've seen

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
you know read about on the New York subway

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
didn't that guy do a thing

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
and now is he in jail did he get jailed for it

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
he's charged he's coming up

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
for trial

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
this is a

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Daniel Needy I think

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
former Marine

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
there was a guy on the subway who was

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
clearly off his head on

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
various drugs

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
was very very violent

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
towards people in the carriage

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
some point tore off his top and was like

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I'm going to kill you or something like this

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
and this Marine at that point stepped in

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
got him into a choke hold

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
was clearly not meaning to do it

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
but the choke hold was too hard

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
and he

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
suffocated the guy and he died at the scene

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
and that man then the ex-Marine

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
is charged with

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
I think murder if not I think

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
manslaughter

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
um and

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
he could face a very significant prison sentence

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
there's a lot of discussion in New York as to whether or not a New York jury would actually convict him

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
where's he being convicted

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
in New York right

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
um because

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
you could say

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
that the guy

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
because there's a racial element like with everything in America

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
uh and because

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
the former Marine was white

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
and the guy off his head

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
uh was black

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
there was an attempt of course to put the

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
racial lens on it

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
and we'll see if a New York jury

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
which will be comprised

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
half or so of women

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
who have been on the subway

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
who have probably had unpleasant interactions

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
um

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
will convict this man for stepping in

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
and genuinely think that he meant to kill the guy

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
or just

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
this was like a good Samaritan act gone wrong

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
but it's

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
it's very salutary that

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
that sort of stuff

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
there was a guy in London about 15 years ago

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
he very much haunted me because

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
the fiance the girlfriend did a victim impact statement

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
that was particularly harrowing

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
that they were on the top of a bus in London

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
a guy on the bus started throwing chips

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
like people's heads

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
and her fiance

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
got up to say look

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
mate lay off and the guy stabbed him

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
he died

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
and that's an account and in

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
the wake of a story like that a lot more people

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
in the society will be craven on the bus

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
because they'll have

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
that example in their head

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
and my fear about this case in the New York Marine case

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
is that he

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
the Marine by doing what

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
he did and it going wrong

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
and the publicity it got will stop other people

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
doing good Samaritan

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
100% will have done while it's pending

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
while it's pending so a lot rides off

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
the verdict

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
that's a lot of pressure

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
and in America with a jury when you're on one of these

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
cases where the society

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
could break out in rioting I'm not sure

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
it will for this guy because the victim wasn't enormously

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
um

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
upstanding as a member of the community and had

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
I don't think it was videoed or at least they didn't see the

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
quite a lot of it was videoed but he'd also

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
had previous things where he had like done

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
a whole litany like a laundry

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
list of times that he'd been

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
arrested for

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
for violent conduct

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
so he won't be that sympathetic

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
a character but then there are quite a lot of

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
unsympathetic characters who get dragged through

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
the the laundry of racial justice

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
stuff in America and become saints

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
I won't name any names

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
but

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
going back to that sort of way you go when you need more

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
resilience thing and the bravery piece

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
what was that C.S.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Lewis quote about

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
about the times not being optimal

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
oh yeah what's that

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
oh that's one of my favorite

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
one of my favorite sermons ever given was by C.S. Lewis

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
University church in Oxford in October

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
1939

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
um yes I love that

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Lewis was a master of prose

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
as well as theological writing and he

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
um he gave this beautiful beautiful

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
sermon in which he said

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
yes he said um you know the conditions

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
are not optimal at the moment

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
um the search for truth and beauty

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
that our species goes through

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
you know is sort of going through such a trial

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
um but he says the point is the conditions

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
never were optimal they never are

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
he says even those periods of history

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
which which seem to be

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
tranquil

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
like the 19th century

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
turn out on closer inspection to be filled with

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
crises, alarms, panics and all the rest of it

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
he says if

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
human if humankind

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
had put off the search for truth and beauty

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
until the conditions were optimal the search would

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
never have begun

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
and the main point he makes

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
is that

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
um there is something wonderful

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
and unusual about human beings

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
and he says that the ants

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
for instance have chosen their own route

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
they've chosen safety and the security of the

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
hive and presumably

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
they have their rewards

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
but as he says he says men are different

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
and

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
he gives this beautiful list

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
I think I can remember it he says

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
they propound mathematical

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
theorems in the league of cells

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
they quote the latest

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
poem whilst advancing on the walls

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
of Quebec

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
make jokes on scaffolds

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
and comb their hair at the

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
gates of Thermopylae

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
this is not

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
panache he says

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
it is our nature

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
fuck that's cool

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
it's true as well in my observation

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
absolutely true

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
well because I've seen people in

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
beleaguered cities many times

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
cities under fire, cities under bombardment

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
cities that are being raised to the ground

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
and um

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
and human life goes on

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
it's an extraordinary thing

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
people continue their studies if they can

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
people continue their family

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
life if they can

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
they

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
they've realized that the conditions

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
will never be optimal

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
they can be better and they can be worse

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
but they're never perfect and I think that the real

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
lesson of what Lewis is saying is

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
and I think it's an important lesson for young people in our time

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
don't put off whatever it is

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
you're meant to do until the situation is

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
optimal

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
don't

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
fail to pursue what it is you think

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
you're meant to pursue in your life until

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
you have total tranquility

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
for instance you know that you have

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
the house or the apartment you would like until

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
you have the relationship you would like until

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
you have the don't put it off until then

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
or until the world is peaceful

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
which will never

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
happen

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
never happen never has happened never will

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
happen

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
don't put it off till then because if you put it off

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
till then it means you'll put it

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
off forever

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
so do whatever you're meant to be doing now

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
start now if you haven't started already and if you started

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
already don't go any slower

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
for God's sake

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
and this is part of

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
the you know the cost of our

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
times I've said this before

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
but part of the cost of our times

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
is the enormous expense of energy

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
on idiotic things that you can do nothing about

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I think we should say to more people

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
don't howl at the moon

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
don't shake your fists at the skies

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
get on with what you're meant to be doing

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
and that will be

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
different for everybody

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
but I just

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
I'm very

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
well

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
I'm too irritable to

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
put up with

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
going at the slow speed that a lot of people

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
want to make us all go out these days

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
so

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
want them out of my way

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
yeah I think a lot about

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
the

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
a rise of victimhood culture

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
and it's got no time for

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
it seems to me that

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
an existential crisis is actually a luxurious position

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
to be in because the bottom levels of

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Maslow's hierarchy of needs have been sorted

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
and

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
victimhood culture is so rampant

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
at the moment because the human

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
systems

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
demand for challenge

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
is outstripping reality's ability to

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
deliver it to it

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
all of the problems, most of the problems

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
that previously would have captured the front of our

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
attention have been moved out of the way

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
absolutely

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
our sensitivity to challenge has now

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
been tuned up

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I think that's true, by the way

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I feel sometimes

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
increasingly like I'm just from a different world

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
than the one we're now in

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
certainly a different society

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
I'm sure it was the same with you

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
when you were growing up but the Britain I grew up

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
in was a place which

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
liked resilience

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I mean we

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
admired resilience

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
we didn't admire people who

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
whined and mulled

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
in fact those are the people you avoided

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
at all costs

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
ah she's a whiner

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
god he's a whiner

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
you know and people said things like

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
you know

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
that's one of my favourites

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
how are you mustn't grumble

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
now I would say well actually I've got

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
stage 4 cancer

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
I'm not sure that's grumbling

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
I know but we talked about it like that

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
people from that generation still say things

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I've offended that generation who's got cancer at the moment

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
she's like oh so boring

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
so boring

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
everyone I grew up with was like that

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
now you might say there's something unhealthy about that

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
but there's actually something healthy about it too

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
and

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
there's something healthy about

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
assuming that everyone has their troubles

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
and so they don't need you to add yours to their list

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
of things to worry about that day

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
and you know

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
cheer people up and encourage them where you can

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
and so on and so they don't bring them down

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
it's a weird sort of

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
self-fulfilling prophecy of

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
pedestalising victimhood

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
that there is a limitless

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
sky on how much

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
victimhood you can claim

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
whereas if your

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
status and your prestige

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
is downstream from your accomplishments

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
there is a limit

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
on how much you can accomplish because you need to go out

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
and fucking do it

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
reality is going to constrain how

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
much impressive stuff you can go and do

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
but there is a

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
ineffable

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
universe of

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
athlete's foot and my gluten intolerance

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
and my chronic flatulence

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
you know whatever else

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
those are things that you can just continue

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
to accumulate like trinkets

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I just find

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
those people boring

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
I just don't care for victimhood

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I think it's

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
an undesirable emotion

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
it's a sign of a rather undesirable

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
person

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
but I don't know

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
why we've given into this

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I just genuinely, particularly in Britain

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I'm just baffled by it because it wasn't the country

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
we had

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
when you said your solution for courage was to surround yourself

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
with courageous people

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
if you kind of get this

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
mimetic wave almost

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
moving through where fewer courageous people

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
are around which creates fewer

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
courageous role models which means to

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
yeah, yeah, yeah

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
and you have the thing of men being persuaded

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
to become cringing eunuchs

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
not a good thing

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
well that's another reason why

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
this conversation

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
around the guy in the subway is so interesting

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
because

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
is he

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
really supposed to stand up for the women

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
or is that, is he mansplaining

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
well if he mansplains

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
while he stops a woman

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
being dragged around by her hair

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
well of course the answer to that is

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
there's no such thing as mansplaining

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
or at least it's not very important

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
get on to something more important

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
like women not being assaulted on the subway

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
you know, choose your priorities

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
with the denial of sex differences

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
would lead to the conclusion that

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
that woman can

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
why shouldn't the women stand up

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
why shouldn't they use their upper body weight

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
yes, yeah, to push this

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
fentanyl fuel maniac off this

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
lady well as I say

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
it's a luxury belief that one

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
then it doesn't meet reality very well

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
I'm not sure anyone

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
would be very happy if the men in the carriage

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
said to the women in the carriage

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
go on, go on, your turn

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
yeah, we've had our

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
centuries of patriarchal

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
hierarchy

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
there's one that got my goat recently

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
with them

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
it always happens now

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
whenever anything comes up about conflict

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Hillary Clinton was one of the worst culprits

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
of doing this but they always say this thing

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
one of the reasons you've got to stop any war

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
once it starts is they say

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
the first victims of war are women

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
they're fucking not

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
the men are men

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
who do most of the fighting and the dying

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Hillary Clinton's point is

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
well, they're widows and then

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
ah, yeah

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
the poor widows of the men that are dead

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
yeah, actually the British

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
MOD has a thing of

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
there's a special section now

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
dedicated I think thanks to the impressive

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
insight of that military expert Angelina Jolie

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
they have

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
a special bit of the MOD

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
dedicated to women in conflict

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
the suffering of women in conflict

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
why not have a suffering of men in conflict as well

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
such weird priorities our age

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
it's totally unserious

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
this age is so unserious

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
so why you can't help thinking that at some point

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
the maniacs, the barbarians

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
will just break in

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
because we've made ourselves so weak

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
but it's so captivating

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
right, this is what I meant when I said

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
you know, have we progressed beyond peak woke

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
because it seems to me like

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
both the hyper woke

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
and hyper anti woke thing

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
is capturing so much

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
of the attention

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I'm so bored of these people, they're so ridiculous

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
can't spend any more

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
of my life listening

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
to them, I don't want

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
to listen to the slowest kid in the class

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
I don't want to go at his or her

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
speed, I don't want

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
to talk to somebody so mentally

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
impaired that they think

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
that we are a

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
weirdly hemaphroditic species

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
or that you can

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
that the clown fish

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
is a useful species

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
to interpret behavior

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
of human beings

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
we can't go at this speed

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
no, no

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
20 years ago

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
at the dawn of the internet age

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
we had hoped that we would get so much farther

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
in the 21st century

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
and here we are with this

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
stupid society

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
slowed down by maniacs

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
debating the first thing

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
we knew boy or girl

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
like no

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
not going at that speed

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Emo Radacanu

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
did an advert for HSBC

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
recently which you may have missed

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
HSBC rewrote

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
three classic fairy tales

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
their book is called

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
fairer tales and it shows that women

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
don't need men at all

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
with financial attitudes shaped as early as 5 years old

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
the new book challenges traditional

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
gender stereotypes, the new book

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
called fairer tales, princesses doing it for themselves

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
reimagines Cinderella

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
sleeping beauty in Rapunzel

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
as successful business women

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Prince Charming

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
successful business women

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Prince Charming is a raised as the main character

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Emo Radacanu

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
read to them, so in the end

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
the princesses didn't need a prince to save them

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
they set up their own businesses

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
saved their money and then spent it very wisely

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
maybe one day you'll buy a tower

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
or set up your own shoe business

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
that's a quote

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
said the tennis player

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
that's the worst

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I read Meghan Markle's book

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
The Bench

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
and that's worse

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
that's worse

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
wow

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
yeah

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
what an inspiring tale

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
fairer tales

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
princesses doing it for themselves

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
have you seen the

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
South Park episode where

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Cartman wakes up

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
he has a nightmare

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
you told me about this over lunch yesterday

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
for the people that haven't seen it

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Cartman has a nightmare

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
he is a diverse black woman

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
his character is recast

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
and all of his friends, Kenny and everyone else

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
are diverse female

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
or trans racial characters

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
and then Cartman wakes up from the nightmare

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
and his mother comes in

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
are you having another dream where

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
once again all my favourite characters

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
in the cartoons have been replaced

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
by definitely diverse women

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
and she goes it's okay Cartman

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
the CEO of Disney

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
isn't hiding under your bed

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
would you check

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
would you check mum

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
okay I checked she's not there

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I'm worried that she's going to come out again

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
replace all my favourite characters

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
with definitely diverse women

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
I love those guys god they keep doing it

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
yeah I mean it's the same thing with

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
there was a rather unappealing

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
young woman who

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
was meant to be playing

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Snow White and the new Disney Snow White

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Rachel Ziegler

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
no no no somebody else

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
is it?

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
she said

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Prince Charming wasn't a prince he was a stalker

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
yeah and she didn't need

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Prince Charming to discover

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
that she could be the woman she could be

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
I mean this is like

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
sub Barack Obama

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
circa 2007

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
the princess is the person

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
she's been waiting for

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
your sister's keeper

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
why don't they invent new

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
that's what I can never understand with that

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
why don't they just invent new tales instead of

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
screwing up every existing tale that's loved

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
make your boring movie about

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
an inspirational tale

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
of a woman who wants to start a business

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
and then does and has some success

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I mean okay

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
make that intro film

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
and Ram Sack and Rapal

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
pillage all of the storehouse

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
of stories that people liked

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Brett Cooper's playing Snow White for Daily Wide

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
did you see that announcement?

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
what? you don't seen this

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
let me tell you

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Jeremy Boring and Ben Shapiro

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
are doing their own live action remake of Snow White

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
with Brett Cooper

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
as Snow White

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
because she's

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
like West End trained

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
supposedly a very well trained actor

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
who can sing apparently

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
like the triple threat podcast act sing

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
and they announced it

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
the other week it's going to be coming out next year

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
god I hope they'd slay Disney

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
there's a rumor

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
that Disney has had to

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
reshoot a ton of scenes

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
including all of the dwarf

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
scenes because originally the dwarves weren't dwarves

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
they were

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
like a multi-racial

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
just group of different people

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
they were diverse ethnic women

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
it was the southern

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
thing again

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
but apparently

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
this is just a rumor but apparently they've reshot it

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
all of the scenes with the dwarves

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
to CGI actual dwarfs

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
so they've gone full

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
yeah because I know that there was

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
a revolt of the dwarves

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
which is something you don't hear every day

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
there was a revolt of the dwarves because

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
of course dwarf actors who have

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
their equity cards

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
are annoyed because there's not many dead

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
dwarves

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
you'd have presumed that there should have at least been seven

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
plus a stunt

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
actor

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
one to do all seven

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
stunts

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
well you could have 14 I guess it depends how

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
demanding the acting

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
how much logistics you want to spread around the dwarf actor community

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
but the point is that there actually was

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
apparently a rebellion about this because these are some of the few

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
dead cert roles we've got

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
is this not the same

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
the people who didn't cast that

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
people that would say we can only have a gay actor

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
playing a gay man and we can only have a black actor

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
playing a black man and we can only have

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
those people are such

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
I won't use the word

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
yeah I mean that again

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
we haven't got time to go at the pace of these people

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
acting is

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
pretending to be other people

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
people will be shocked

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
that most people who play Hamlet are not

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
themselves members of the Danish royal family

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
welcome to the world of make believe

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
a charity shop

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
in Swansea asked people not

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
to donate sex toys

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Barnardo's customers have been asked

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
to refrain from donating used and unused

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
marital aids as they

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
aren't quite the sort of toys we're

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
looking for

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
when they say we want like

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
your old books, your old toys, they didn't mean

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
sex toys

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
I think that's a perfectly good policy for a second

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
hand shop

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
customers were reminded of the core rifling through the second

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
door

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
you don't

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
what have they got in here

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
is there a dressing room

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
customers were also reminded

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
that the branch had CCTV

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
so that these items can be traced back

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
to the original owners

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
oh

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
that means that you

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
there's like a

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
what's he called that thing in Australia

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
the boomerang

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
that's a boomerang effect

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
then it's back on your doorstep

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
the next morning

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
why can't I get rid of this thing

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
get it over the hedge

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
but he keeps landing in Barnardo's

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
it's a dildo that will never die

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
thank you for that story

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
is there a lesson we can take

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
from this

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
I think just be careful where you put your dildos

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
there's a moral of the story

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
never leave your dildo in Barnardo's

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
definitely not in the bargain bin

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
school in Lafayette

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
has refused to celebrate Halloween

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
because it isn't inclusive while going

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
all out for LGBT plus history month

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
is there much history

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
with LGBT

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
plus gay history

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
I mean there are lots of gay people in history

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
and there is that

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
but it's also what we used to call history

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
there isn't much

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
tea history

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
there's

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
bee history

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
I mean there are sort of I'm a bit skeptical

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
about bisexuality but

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
there's a bit of bisexuality in history of course

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
but I mean again these people are such

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
ignorant nurses they never know anything

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
I can't tell you Chris I mean I have to deal with some of this shit

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
and

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
they just don't know anything and they keep

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
it's like the Orwell thing

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
they're so called discoveries as if people didn't know them before

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
and

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
everybody knew most of the stuff that they are trying to bring out

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
and it's just very tedious

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
and again

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
what's happened to the mainstream

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
thing of it why aren't we concentrating on big

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
subjects big authors big historical issues

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
instead of this boring slow

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
pace

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
we're here at ARC

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
and we're going to be attending at some point this week

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
I can't remember

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
the question is something about a better vision for the future

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
a more positive vision for the future

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
a better story

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
sorry John

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
what is your

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
how would

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
how do you think that we can begin to

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
tell a more positive

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
story for the future because it seems to me

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
that much of the

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
proposals

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
are quite easily criticized and often rightly so

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
but

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
there's this sort of zero some view of happiness

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
and growth that somebody else's happiness somehow

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
detracts from mine

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
well that's a particularly British view of course

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
very much yeah yeah yeah

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
that guy's got something is because I've not got it

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
he's taking it from me

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
yeah but what's a more positive vision of the future

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
well one would be that we're not

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
facing imminent apocalypse and

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
catastrophe all the time

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
from every possible direction

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
and particularly not ones that people have whipped up a new generation

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
into a fervour over

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
I mean I think the green apocalyptic

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
thing is particularly damaging to young people

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
I think it's very very bad for their mental health

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
very had very very detrimental

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
to their

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
sense of how they build a future

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
and I think a lot of young people have been lied to

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
about the proximity

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
of

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
global climate catastrophe

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
I mean every time there isn't an actual

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
catastrophe going on in the world

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
our leaders go straight back to the climate catastrophe

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
and the climate crisis

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
they now call it

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
what is happening is not a crisis

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
maybe a problem to be managed

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
but

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
there's a luxury in calling such things a crisis

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
a crisis is like

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
my shoes are on fire

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
that's a crisis

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
not like it's possible that in 40 years

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
we'll need more AC

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I don't see that as a crisis

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
but

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
so yes

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
I think that in general there are several things that are

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
big stories

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
big narratives of people being spun

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
which are incredibly innovating

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
that is they sap energy out of the society

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
you can feel it

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
the hopelessness if you tell young people

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
they're not going to live into adulthood because they're all going to burn to death

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
the hopelessness of saying

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
you can't change anything

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
or that this is the trajectory we're on

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
one of the other ones in the green stuff

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
is the hopelessness of saying to people

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
effectively

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
you shouldn't leave any footprint on the planet

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
including children

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
and

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
just to put one

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
thing out there about the hopelessness

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
of that

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
there's this new thing that many cities have signed up to

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
including London

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
which is a future in which among other things

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
we will not be allowed to move around

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
very much and we will be allowed a flight

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
perhaps every six years I think it is

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
what's this?

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
what's it called?

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
I'm blanking on the name

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
it's this new proposal for cities in 2030 or something

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
the city car has signed up London to it

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
it's one of these carbon neutral

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
fantasies

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
no fun 2030

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
and one of them is that you won't be allowed

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
to fly more than once every X number of years

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
and of course none of it

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
makes any sense because among other things

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
all that means is

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
apart from the fact that the airline industry is destroyed

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
is that what it means is the cost

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
of an airline ticket will be like

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
40 times higher

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
but

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
so they always assume you can do all of these things

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
and nothing will change

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
amazingly you'll be able to put a rule like that in

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
and you won't destroy the airline industry or whatever

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
but all of it is just so

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
anti-human

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
I mean it is so anti-human

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
the aspiration of human beings

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
should not be

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
to be born fight against

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
the patriarchy leave no carbon

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
footprint and die in the most

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
ethically

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
fine manner

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
preferably taken out at

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
a Swiss clinic

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
you know and then like burnt in a cardboard box

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
it's not a very heroic narrative

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
you know

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
and I think that

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
actually we do orient our lives around

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
stories and around narratives

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
and we should not have

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
the

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
unique narrative that I've just laid out

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
we should have heroic narratives

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I mean for instance you know the narrative of

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
the of adventure

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
of life being an adventure

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
that you set out

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
on a path and hope

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
you set yourself out on a heroic path

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
or at least an exciting path

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
you know I mean

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
the counterpoint of the one I laid out earlier

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
of the one you know

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
you don't know

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
the account part of the one I laid out earlier

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
which is the you know everything that's going to happen

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
if you go along this path of

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
things other people have persuaded you

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
to say

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
is well you know where you're going

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
you know everything to say

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
and you know kind of what trajectory your life will be on

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
I say well yeah and there's another trajectory as well

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
and it's the one that I

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
and I suspect you

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
we've got ourselves in our life which is I don't know exactly

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
I don't know with that certainty

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
I don't know what'll

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
happen but if I put one foot

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
fairly sure

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
footedly in front of the next

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
and

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
and tread well

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
and

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
orient myself by

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
things like truth

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
sure I don't have the certainty

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
but

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
it's an adventure

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
and it's my adventure

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
your adventure

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
you actually own it and then

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
fancy that you'll actually have your life

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
you can feel proud of what you got to

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
right because you weren't being ventriloquized

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
by somebody else's

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
you didn't spend your life saying things you don't know

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
or mean or believe

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
or just

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
repeating like a parrot

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
in order to keep in

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
with a group of people

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
you shouldn't seek the affirmation

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
from

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
you will live your life

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
remember that the outcomes that most people get

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
are ones that you don't want in any case

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
the average American is

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
obese, divorced and with less than 1k in the bank

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
so

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
doing what everybody else does

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
sounds like a very surefire

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
strategy but the outcomes

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
are ones that you don't want

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
and that can be the case

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
with financially successful people

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
I mean it can be the case

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
with people I often say that

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
people who go into professions which they don't like

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
and again it's interesting

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
some of them are

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
there are ones that people apologize for as you talk to them

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
you notice that

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
normally these days one of the biggest self-deprecating

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
professions is lawyers

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
you say to somebody what are you doing

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
I'm a lawyer

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
why that

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
five years in full-time education

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
three years in developing

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
and normally it's like they think oh well it's not very

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
interesting or something but I think

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
why wouldn't you do something where you went I am a lawyer

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
it's fantastic I love

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
doing this

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
that's British lawyers again for you

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
I've seen Americans do that as well

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
my point is they're financially

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
well rewarded

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
and there's rules you can follow

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
on that

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
there are ones I don't understand

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
if you are doing a job

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
that pays you well

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
and allows you to provide you for your loved ones

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
that's worth doing

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
even if it's not your optimal role

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
doing a role that you don't much care for

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
and you're not providing for other people

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
and you don't see any particular purposes

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
that's probably not a good idea

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
or you could go

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
you know that there are other options and other routes open to you

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
that would allow you to also provide for the family

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
or the

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
the bravery narrative is definitely

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
one that I think is lacking

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
and this risk aversion that we have

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
this young people

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
getting their driver's licenses later than ever

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
most commonly living arrangement

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
for men under the age of 35 is still living at home

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
with their parents

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
such an awful stat

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
people going into full-time employment later than ever

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
and I think about you know when we were

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
actually no you are the worst person to talk about this

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
you told me you didn't get your driver's license until some

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
ungodly age

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
but most people

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
couldn't wait

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
they manifest similarly

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
most people

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
17 years old in the UK, driver's license

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
I want to be free, I want to be liberated

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
I don't want to have to be asking mum and dad for lifts

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
etc etc

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
there's not a narrative of

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
adventure

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
I think that is important

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
if you don't have a narrative of adventure

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
and success

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
and an idea of what that looks like

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
you know you are disproportionately likely

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
to live a

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
more miserable life

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I think probably both of us

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
to some extent have worked

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
our way out as we've

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
done it and

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
you know trodden a path

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
is not completely clear

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
and if you said to me what are you going to do in 10 years

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
I couldn't particularly tell you

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
roughly what I'd like to do

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
but it's not entirely clear

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
it might be if I was in

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
a corporate law firm and hoping to make partner

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
or something like that but

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
the lack of

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
clarity on it

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
should be energizing

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I'd have thought

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
that's what's exciting about it

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
also for

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
the desire for certainty

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
which is also exactly where the conspiracism comes from

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
because it removes

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
random chance from the world

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
and makes everything coordinated

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
rather than coincidental

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
that desire for certainty

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
really dissuades

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
people from going and doing something

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
which has potentially

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
outsized outcomes

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
look at what happens the narrative of

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
leaving home

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
or leaving the village or leaving the town

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
there's every reason

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
not to go

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
because if you go

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
you

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
risk a lot of things

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
one of them is failing

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
and

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
if you go

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
and you fail

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
then you have to go back

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
to where you were from

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
with your tail between your legs

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
and then you can console yourself

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
that you tried it but it didn't work

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
a lot of people

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
even make the try

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
because they think it won't work

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
so they never leave

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
and

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
other people go and they finally make it to the city

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
and that's as a story as old as our species

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
they finally make it to the city or large gathering place

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
and they make it there

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
you know

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
and one of the reasons why New York is a thrilling city

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
is it's filled with people making it

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
you know

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
I mean plenty of people

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
who will fail

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
it's very harsh in a way

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
because

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
the two are so close together

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
a millionaires blocks

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
will have

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
a veteran with a sign

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
lying on the street

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
outside

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
and then you get

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
that simultaneous thing of success

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
and the

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
mirror of it

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
of desperate failure

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
I don't mean that a judgmental

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
in the case of the Vefa but desperate

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
your life

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
very close to each other

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
and I suspect that both of these things

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
fire up New Yorkers all the time

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
yeah well you're getting to see how far you could

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
go and how far you could fall

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
shown in front of you all the time

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
there's an interesting study

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
by Candice Blake in Australia

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
that looked at

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
wealth inequality

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
and local ecologies positively

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
predicting

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
self

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
sexualization

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
of women in online dating profiles

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
so I think I followed that

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
if

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
there is high wealth inequality

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
women both see the sort of

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
partner they could get in their wildest dreams

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
under their worst nightmares

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
and it positively predicts

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
more sexualized images

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
in online dating profiles and social media

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
and her

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
argument was that

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
it

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
amps up

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
a woman's

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
competitive edge in terms of finding

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
a partner that they think would be able to

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
ensure they don't end

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
up

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
down at the bottom end of the inequality distribution

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
and instead they end up

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
in the clouds where they've seen people's

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
outcomes occurring

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
well of course there are also people who fake it

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
well that's the effective way to play the game

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
I was once in India

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
and I had a guide

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
who I got talking to and I said

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
I said

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
we were talking about how

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
easy or otherwise dating was

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
in the outskirts of Delhi

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
which means the slums and he said

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
the trick is

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
he did describe it as a trick

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
if you meet a girl you like

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
you go for a date with her but you borrow your friend's shoes

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
for instance

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
there will be a friend who has a pair of trainers

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
and you borrow his shoes

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
for the date and then like another time

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
you might borrow a friend's motorbike

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
so like the pool of men

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
helps like swap

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
right okay and the idea is

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
they have one good dating outfit and vehicle

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
between ten people yes and he said

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
the idea was that you get the woman to say she loves you

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
and she'll marry you and then

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
you do the reveal it was somebody else's shoes

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
your shit shoes yeah

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
which I thought was both

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
horrific

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
admirable he told it to me like that

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
and horribly

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
recognizable

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
think of all the people who splash

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
around money in restaurants and things

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
you don't really have it at all

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
pretend to live above their means or do live above their means

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
it's all to try

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
to entrap a mate

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
I think people do a lot for sex

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
yeah I know I've seen

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Douglas Murray ladies and gentlemen

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
what's coming up next what can people expect over the next few months

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
I don't know

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
I don't know what I expect over the next few months

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
I'm going to a couple of war zones and we'll

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
