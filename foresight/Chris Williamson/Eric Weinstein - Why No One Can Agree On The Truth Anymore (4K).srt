1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You just came back from your first holiday in quite a while.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, my first holiday of, let's say, three weeks or more in quite a while.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How was that?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Astounding.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Really very good to see what's going on in the rest of the world at this particular moment.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We had previously gone to India in the year to visit family.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This was to go back to Turkey and to go to Portugal, but also to the Azores Islands.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I can't tell you how meaningful it was for me to be back traveling.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Why?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, I mean, partially it's reacquaint.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When you have children and children change your game for about two decades,

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
you have to realize that that's a transient period.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It felt like it was going to go on forever.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This was sort of trying to figure out what is it like to go from traveling in your 20s and 30s with that kids

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to traveling with your kids at the last moment that you still have them at home.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now you're going to have the rest of your life without them again,

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
but you can't go back to backpacking and doing certain other things that were easy for you.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You have to figure out how to rejoin your previous life that has been in progress without you actually.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ending for a long time.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Exactly.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's sabbatical from life almost.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Another thing is that you forget about parts of yourself.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I forgot that I spoke Turkish not well, but I spoke rudimentary Tarzan Turkish 30 years ago.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
To be back in Istanbul and suddenly have words and phrases and things come back

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and be talking to cab drivers and just people in the street seeing the change.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Obviously, there's been an enormous amount of change in Turkey.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Portugal is fascinating seeing certain things at the end of their life cycle.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We were at a synagogue in Bursa where the home of the Ottoman Empire,

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
where they were down to their last 50 people, which is a common enough thing

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
when we visit diaspora Jewish communities at the tail end with the embers still glowing hot

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
but no chance for a rebirth.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Then in the Azores, I was not prepared for the level of beauty that we encountered.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There is a level of beauty that I've only experienced two, maybe three times in my life

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
that sort of leaves you physically sick, like ill.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's so beautiful that your body is the weak link.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You might think that sugar is tasty, but if you were to eat a bag of sugar,

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
you'd probably be sick to your stomach.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I would say this was so much beauty that it was at an almost pathological level

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and more than I think my family could really take in.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We're just so moving.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I've heard you say before about how a lot of the time you don't realize

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the last time you're going to do a thing with a person.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A lot of friends, especially ones that are fathers, have told me the same thing.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The last time that you'll bounce your daughter on your knee.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You don't know when it's going to happen, but it's going to happen.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There's also a really strange realization when you get deeper into adulthood

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and work out that probably by the age of 18 or 20,

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
you've spent 97 or 98% of the time you're going to spend with your parents.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
All that you wanted for the last four years was to be away from them

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and now all that you want is to have a little bit more time and it's all gone

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and you squandered it while it was there.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm on the ethnic program.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We don't believe in this stuff.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
My children don't become adults at the age of 18.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't care about the laws of the United States or the state of California.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I think we do family wrong in the States.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You send them off to college and then you tell them,

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
go follow your dream and they bounce into some locality that you aren't in

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and you don't get the benefit of these very strong families

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
because the market has been so strong in the US for so long.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And the market more or less took over all sorts of duties

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
that were assigned to families historically.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And so the reason that people always say,

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
oh, your families are weak was because our markets were strong, right?

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And so insurance and opportunity,

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
all of these things that could be handed over to the market were.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And as a result, when we find out that the markets are not safe,

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
we realize that we've abandoned the structures that we needed to retreat to

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
that our families are quite small, below replacement rate very often.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And we don't live in the same place.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And so, you know, I married a woman from India

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and I basically carry a lot of Eastern European norms.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And so my feeling is that my children are my children forever.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And I'm not letting go of them.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And this idea that it's your life and you can do what you want

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
is only true up to a point.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You also have a continuity issue.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And this is normal, by the way.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And it may sound weird in an American context,

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
but I think that the world recognizes that we're links in a chain

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and there's a certain amount that you get to do that's just yours

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
because it's your life, but never go full Billy Joel.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Pan-generational housing is something being in Austin,

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
people getting ranches, starting even commune,

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
you know, 10 family mini villages with a bunch of other people.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah.

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's something that I'm seeing occur more and more.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And, you know, in an atomized, like mass solipsism,

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
mass individualism society, this doesn't sound like a bad redress.

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We got to the end of it.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We got to the end of that dream.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And it didn't work.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You've been around a lot of very powerful, very rich people

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
throughout your career.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
No, no, that's not true.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Only relatively recently, only in the last decade and a half.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's quite a while in many people's lives.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What do you think that most normal people would be surprised to know

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
about the powerful and the rich individuals, world views,

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the way that they hold themselves, what is and isn't true?

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
They feel powerless.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's one of the craziest things is that very often you're at a table

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
of people of immeasurable wealth and they're talking about the rich

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
or the hyper-connected.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They don't see themselves in these terms.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Why?

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I think there's different kinds of rich, to be honest.

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think that if, for example, you got rich from, let's say, arms manufacturing,

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
you've been entwined with government your whole life or agriculture,

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
something that's highly regulated that extraction oil and gas.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Those people, I think, have always been close to power.

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
A lot of the dream of tech, for example, was we don't need the government.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We'll just build stuff in our garages and if it's cool, it'll take care of itself.

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And therefore, we're minimally dependent on the traditional ecosystems.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So a lot of tech money felt disenfranchised.

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
They didn't know how to play the game.

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That was both to its credit and a huge danger.

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But I think one of the things that I find very interesting is that when people are

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
not rate-limited by money, they're rate-limited by all sorts of other things.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
They may not want their number to go down.

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So they go from 6 billion to 4 billion would be a huge blow,

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
even though it doesn't seem to impact normal things.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Another thing is that most of them have given up on the retail notion of reality.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Whatever mainstream media, if you have a worldview that allows you to listen

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
to national public radio that then reads the Wall Street Journal

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and The Times and The New Yorker, whatever that point of view is,

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
most of the very powerful rich people I know have checked out at a level that is astounding.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
They don't believe that they can afford to depend on normal institutions.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
How does that show up in their lives?

131
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Weird ways.

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They don't have a regular doctor.

133
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
They have concierge medicine.

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Their fire policy comes with a private fire department that will fight for their home

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
but won't necessarily fight for homes next door unless it's just-

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I didn't know that that was a thing, okay?

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You know, it's not until you travel with some of these people

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that you realize that there's a secret corridor in the airport

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
or a way of getting onto the plane.

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
There's a lot of infrastructure built for a very small number of people.

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
For the most part, they can't figure out what to do with the money.

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's my belief.

143
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If you believe that the world is headed towards an apocalypse,

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
you're very unlikely to want to contribute money

145
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
because that's the only fungible thing you have in an emergency.

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I think that a lot of the sort of apocalyptic thinking of very powerful people

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
is very destructive because they're trying to figure out

148
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
how to survive a mild apocalypse,

149
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
like a six months of your-

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You know, if I have six months of canned goods

151
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and I've got four X Navy SEALs on my property in a remote location in Montana,

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
can I weather the storm with a few diesel generators?

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So if it's a very mild apocalypse, maybe they've got six months' plan.

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But I think that there's a lot of thinking

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
that you should husband your resources because you don't know what's coming

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
given that things are going to have to collapse.

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And I think it's very sad because those are the people who could shore up the system.

158
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's interesting to think about helplessness at the top end of the wealth distribution

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
given that a lot of people feel like they are restricted by their material possessions.

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But it seems like despite there being a lot of abundance,

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
at least monetarily, the scarcity mentality scales all the way up.

162
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It really does.

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And particularly if you've been deprived early in your life,

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
there's something that happens where you're nervous till your dying day

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
that you're going to die under an overpass, right?

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm not kidding.

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
One thing that I highly recommend, people never take me seriously,

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
is a video game called a tower defense game of plants versus zombies.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And plants versus zombies ends in a situation where you win

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
all the things you can inside of the game,

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
but somehow you still have the ability to continue to earn

172
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
even though there's nothing left to purchase.

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And the reason that I find this fascinating is you get to watch your own psychology,

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
which is now that you've given yourself the ability to earn,

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
you can't bring yourself to stop earning even though earning has lost meaning.

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And so if you can't get to that in real life,

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
you can at least get to that inside of plants versus zombies.

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I highly recommend it because you have to give yourself some idea of

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
we have to cross finish lines as they come.

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
If you decide, okay, when I get to $10 million,

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
that's when I can afford to become a philanthropist.

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Then you're going to get there and you're going to realize,

183
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
no, the goals are going to move.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So think about how a waitress sees this.

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Waitresses do philanthropy almost from the beginning.

186
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
They'll overtip somebody who gives them good service and they can't afford it.

187
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And it's sort of a poverty trap when you're at the very low end of the earning spectrum.

188
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But I think there's something to take from that,

189
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
which is practice a little bit of philanthropy and a little bit of kicking your shoes up

190
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and not always deferring taking profit in some sense on your success.

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So make sure that all throughout your life,

192
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
you're treating yourself to some luxury even when you can least afford it

193
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and you're just exhibiting a little bit of goodness

194
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
even though you feel like you desperately need to build yourself up

195
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
because otherwise you'll always push it out.

196
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There's a Morgan Housell quote where he says,

197
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
the best way to win the game is to stop moving the goalposts.

198
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And he's wrote this great book called The Psychology of Money.

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And it's true that most people treat their goals.

200
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Their relationship to their goals is like the horizon that for every step toward it they get,

201
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
it then moves one step further away.

202
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's probably more like the horizon on a spring or on a rubber band.

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Then it gets a little bit closer and then it bonk, it snaps away from you.

204
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And I've been around a lot of people that have got chunks of wealth

205
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and it's a rare thing to see someone who doesn't still have that scarcity mentality

206
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
despite the fact that they've acquired it.

207
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You need to keep the scarcity mentality.

208
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's not a mistake.

209
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The problem is that you also need an abundance mentality

210
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and then you need to selectively access them in different circumstance.

211
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Talk to me about the tension between those two.

212
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Well, it's just this regulated expression idea that we keep trying to find settings where we don't,

213
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
just let me set the air conditioner at 68 and then I'll be happy forever.

214
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
In reality, more or less you need contradictory facilities

215
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and you need to know when to pull one in and let the other out.

216
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And this is the heart thing.

217
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Anybody with multiple children knows that with one kid you're saying,

218
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
you cannot afford to take these risks.

219
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If you jump off something like that and you don't look below, think what you could do.

220
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The other kid needs this.

221
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

222
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Come on.

223
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I've heard your brother say that him and his wife's advice to the children was

224
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
as long as you don't do anything to your eyes,

225
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
you can take the risks that you want.

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes and no.

227
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I mean, there's teeth, there's throats.

228
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Anything somebody who does combat sports knows has to be regularly.

229
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
He's going to try and attack.

230
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Small joints, whatever it is.

231
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There are plenty of ways to get yourself into real trouble.

232
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The key thing that you're trying to use childhoods for is to go through the mistakes

233
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
that are not permanently disfiguring.

234
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's one of the importance of having fathers around.

235
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The importance of rough and tumble play is facilitated almost exclusively by fathers.

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And you learn the limits of your strength.

237
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You learn the limits of your body.

238
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You learn how high of a tree you can jump off

239
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and how high of a tree you can't jump off.

240
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You also learn to lose.

241
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I mean, I really hate some of this winter talk where basically people have no plan to lose.

242
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And then when they actually experience loss,

243
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
they tend to throw everything away to say,

244
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I didn't lose, you know, that's very interesting.

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000

260

You met Jeffrey Epstein once.

261
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Talk to me about what that's like coming face to face with somebody of that caliber.

262
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Whatever that means.

263
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Well, one thing is that there is a physiological reaction that corresponds to this phrase that,

264
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
you know, the hair on the back of my neck stood on end.

265
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Like that's a real physiological feeling.

266
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't know whether the hair actually does that, but it's exactly what it feels like.

267
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You're meeting somebody who is unholy.

268
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And, you know, one of the most interesting things is that he was beckoning into a world

269
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
that didn't seem to exist, but for him as the doormat.

270
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I think that's one of the things that freaked out a lot of these rich people is that he felt rich in a movie

271
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
sense, which is not something that you find among actually rich people.

272
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What do you mean?

273
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Well, a lot of very wealthy people don't own an island.

274
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Islands are really tough to maintain.

275
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm obsessed with islands.

276
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And, you know, in general, I have to be obsessed with islands that have airports run by other people

277
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
because, you know, they have populations on them.

278
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But every rich person starts to wonder, can I afford an island or how many jets?

279
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And if you look at Jeffrey Epstein's wealth, it was beaten, it was like gold beaten into gold foil

280
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
so that it could cover a vast area and leave the impression of a solid gold life.

281
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But it was really probably a mid nine figure fortune that had been used to buy islands and planes,

282
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
which is not what any nine figure person is going to do.

283
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So you had a felt sense and embodied sense of discomfort?

284
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Oh, hell yeah.

285
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And where did that come from?

286
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The fact that he had a lipstick camera pointed at me from an art object that he laid a table

287
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
that was preposterously long and thin with a tablecloth made of an American flag

288
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
to make it look like a coffin so that I would spill my coffee on the flag of my own country.

289
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I mean, the fact that he looked like a mutant Ralph Lauren with this kind of labricious quality

290
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and he's talking all of the science and market stuff and nothing adds up

291
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
and there's an heiress bouncing on his knee to get his boobs to jiggle to see whether it can distract.

292
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I mean, it's like one of these crazy scenes where nothing about it was normal.

293
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There was no trace of a normal world.

294
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That sounds like a script from a movie.

295
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah, I mean, I think part of it, John Travolta is like putting a gun to your head

296
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and forcing you to drink and break a code in a minute.

297
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah, like that part of it.

298
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And then there was some sort of like, you know, remember that story,

299
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
the most dangerous game where a man invites you to his island so he can hunt you.

300
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You know, this was scary and it was meant to be scary.

301
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Sounds menacing.

302
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Well, I think his product was silence.

303
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
People think that his product was sex or finance, but it was silence.

304
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm pretty sure.

305
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What's that mean?

306
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
If you're scary enough, look, rich people can get sex,

307
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
but they can't necessarily get people to shut up afterwards.

308
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So my take on it and my take on it instantly was this is not an actual human.

309
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
This is a construct of someone's.

310
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Someone has created a fake human being called Jeffrey Epstein,

311
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
who's a mysterious currency trading financier with crazy rules

312
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
so that no one would ever invest with him.

313
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And I think that was to keep people from seeking his investment services.

314
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I mean, you know, he's labeled disgraced financier,

315
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
but nobody has a record of trading with him.

316
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He was sitting there.

317
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
He comes into the meeting and he says, you know,

318
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
well, Eric, I was just doing some currency trading.

319
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And I thought about that scene that you sometimes see in as a meme

320
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
with Steve Buscemi with a skateboard over his shoulder.

321
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Hello, fellow financier.

322
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Hello, fellow financial traders.

323
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Exactly.

324
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So I'm thinking you don't really look like a rich guy who trades in markets.

325
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The thing that's interesting that I'm finding myself intrigued by here is

326
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
it takes a moderate amount of cognitive horsepower

327
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,000
to be able to piece together this theater that you sat down at.

328
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Deployed in a nefarious, malicious, manipulative way.

329
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But it's smart.

330
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What do you mean it's smart?

331
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Say more.

332
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's not something that could be done by a simple mind.

333
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You think he did it?

334
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh, he has a team of manipulators?

335
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
No, when I say I think he was a construct, I literally mean that.

336
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I think he was constructed, like fitted with a story.

337
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Oh, so you think he was a plant?

338
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
No, I think he was a construct.

339
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What's that?

340
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Okay, you're going to have to dig in.

341
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I think Jeffrey Epstein, a super genius financier, was not a thing that existed.

342
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Where did the money come from?

343
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You're going to mumble, okay, so that's what you mumble.

344
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But then there's this missing fortune of Robert Maxwell

345
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and this fortune of Jeffrey Epstein that we can't explain.

346
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Are those the same fortune?

347
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The conservation of money principle, that if you have a fortune that's missing

348
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and you have a fortune that can't be explained in there connected by Guillain Maxwell?

349
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't know.

350
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Why is it that no hedge funds, what is it?

351
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
They file form, I forget it, it's 13F.

352
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
There's certain forms that you have to file.

353
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Nobody's ever asked for these things.

354
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Who's his prime broker?

355
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Has somebody gone over the prime brokerage?

356
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What are his trades?

357
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
He would have to move the market if he was doing a yard of euros or Swiss francs

358
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
or who knows what, like a billion, that would move the market.

359
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So there's no way you can fake retroactively a hedge fund of immeasurable size that trades currencies.

360
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I don't think he was a currency trader.

361
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
He told me he was a currency trader.

362
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So when you say a construct, who constructs?

363
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Who's the builder?

364
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I don't know.

365
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I would imagine some version of the intelligence community.

366
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You know, sometimes somebody's cover gets blown.

367
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
We have a very famous unfortunate story of Ellie Cohn with the Mossad,

368
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,000
where Ellie Cohn was an Egyptian Jew who was fitted with a backstory that he was an Argentinian playboy

369
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
who'd made a fortune in Argentina, but was Arabic in origin,

370
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
and then he moves to Damascus and he takes out an apartment where he holds orgies

371
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and becomes the best friend of Hafiz al-Assad, right?

372
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And so that's an example of a story we know.

373
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
We know how the intelligence communities of the world create people who don't really exist.

374
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I know that this is just a one-time thing here that you got to see,

375
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
but the construction of the coffin-looking American flag, the spilling of the coffee,

376
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
this weird power play thing that's going on,

377
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:37,000
that seems, now that you say that it wasn't him even pulling his own strings, perhaps,

378
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
it makes a lot more sense, but even that,

379
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
that degree of sophistication, I learned this from Daniel Schmacktenberger.

380
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
We sat down and he's spent some time with particularly powerful people,

381
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and he told me this really harrowing story of somebody who has both the desire and the means

382
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
to treat themselves like an apex predator against their own kind,

383
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
and they said so.

384
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
They broke the fourth wall about this and said,

385
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
apex predators don't care about the prey, but they saw their own kind as prey.

386
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I asked Daniel, how does it feel to sit opposite somebody who isn't rate limited by the resources,

387
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
who can not only dream to have this,

388
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
plus have the motivation or lack of virtue or integrity to go ahead and consider doing it,

389
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and then has the capacity, the assets to be able to enact it.

390
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It's reminding me, it's giving me this same something.

391
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It feels like it's up on the top of my head.

392
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's giving me some sort of a sense like that.

393
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
This was intended to be terrifying.

394
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It wasn't an accident.

395
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It was intended to be as fascinating as it could possibly be, which it was,

396
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and terrifying at the same time, and it achieved both objectives.

397
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I mean, I was given an opportunity to meet him again.

398
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I didn't know what to do.

399
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I mean, the other thing that I just found really weird is that he knew about my research,

400
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and it turned out that he was connected to my graduate department at Harvard.

401
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So he had a connection to the Harvard Math Department unbeknownst to me.

402
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I don't know when that began.

403
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I know two of the professors he was connected through.

404
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
This is some unholy story.

405
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It has nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein.

406
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
It has to do with whatever this thing was.

407
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
We tripped over a thing.

408
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
We tripped over a structure.

409
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
We named the structure Jeffrey Epstein.

410
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It must be very unfortunate in some regards for whoever it was, if that's true,

411
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
that was in charge of this construction, that it became that people got t-shirts

412
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
with his name printed on them.

413
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
This was already going wrong in the early 2000s.

414
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You see, my sense of this is that this was a pre-internet plan

415
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,000
that lived into the internet age and couldn't survive contact with the internet age.

416
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
What did the internet bring in that didn't allow it to survive?

417
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Eyeballs, discussion.

418
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Level of surveillance.

419
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
There's a claim that nobody cares about Jeffrey Epstein

420
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
because it's this many years later and we've all moved on.

421
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That's completely untrue.

422
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
We know that it's true because if you start talking about Jeffrey Epstein,

423
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
the engagement goes up.

424
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You have these fictions that are put out by mainstream media

425
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
or traditional news desks, which is nobody cares about that story.

426
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You can see from social media that that's not true from the internet.

427
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The internet is constantly providing an ability to check

428
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
whether or not these claims from inside the structure are true.

429
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Jeffrey Epstein is an example of what I called an anti-interesting phenomenon.

430
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
What's that?

431
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Well, an anti-interesting thing is something that would normally be fascinating.

432
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Imagine, for example, you had a story where you could get a Pulitzer Prize for breaking it.

433
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Everybody cares.

434
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You'd sell papers like hotcakes, blah, blah, blah, and nobody wants to report on it.

435
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And it's like right there.

436
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You could just ask the dumbest questions and it would, like,

437
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
New York Times says, disgraced financier.

438
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Well, tell me, did you find his prime broker?

439
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Did you find the forms?

440
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Did you go to his offices in Valard House?

441
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
No, nobody does, ever.

442
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
The story is anti-interesting and it's very different than being uninteresting.

443
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Which would suggest more collusion, more coordination?

444
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Hello?

445
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I mean, see, this is one of the most uncomfortable things.

446
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I think there was a time when mostly when people said collusion or coordination,

447
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
their presumption was, well, that's kind of, that's pretty far out there.

448
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We now know, like post Elon Musk's $44 billion adventure at Twitter,

449
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
that there are these coordinating groups, coordinating social media with the intelligence

450
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
community or with the Department of Homeland Security or with the State Department.

451
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
We now know that we're living in an orchestrated, curated, choreographed world.

452
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And we can't know it officially, but we all know it if we want it out.

453
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Which is hysterical.

454
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Now we have to talk about, well, are you a conspiracy theorist?

455
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Like, I read, I read the Slack messages, I read the emails.

456
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
What are you even talking about now?

457
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Sanbankman Freed currently being recharged with witness tampering as well.

458
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
That to me, fresh charges, releasing, even though he's totally couldn't get in touch with the press,

459
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I think hundreds of phone calls to the press, leaked his ex-girlfriend, allegedly,

460
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
leaked his ex-girlfriend's diary entries, so on and so forth.

461
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And, you know, this is a guy that some of my friends were flown to go and see on his island, his portion of an island.

462
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah, his portion, it's very different.

463
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yeah, okay.

464
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
For very different reasons as well.

465
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
There seems to be, and you hear about it, they believe they're above the law.

466
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
There was this really cool documentary on Netflix called The Murder Dark Murders,

467
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
and it was this small town, big family, lots of money, and the kids ran rampant, right?

468
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Classic like Silver Spoon aristocracy bullshit.

469
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:18,000
But when it gets scaled up this much more, Sanbankman Freed, the biggest alleged financial crime since Bernie Madoff,

470
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
allegedly tampering with witnesses, allegedly leaking his ex-girlfriend's diary entries.

471
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And?

472
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Did the rules not apply to everybody?

473
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Certainly they don't.

474
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Why?

475
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
We stopped prosecuting all sorts of types of people.

476
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
You know, look, we stopped holding hearings.

477
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I grew up in a world where we had the church committee, the pike committee looking at our own intelligence services.

478
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,000
We had Watergate hearings, we had tobacco hearings, we had Iran-Contra hearings.

479
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Do you know how many hearings we need right now?

480
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Where are these things?

481
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It's ridiculous.

482
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
We've got weird stuff about UFOs with people making the craziest allegations.

483
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Look, this is just not normal.

484
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
We're in totally weird uncharted territory.

485
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
What do you make of the recent UAPs, I think, is the new term?

486
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Eric, you need to get up with the times here.

487
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
They're not UFOs anymore.

488
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
That's the old.

489
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I wasn't even in this game when it was UFOs.

490
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay, okay.

491
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So what do you make of the recent UAP stories and attention and response and subsequent response?

492
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'd like to ask you first.

493
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So I had a look at the first whistleblower from about two months ago quite closely with Andy Stumpf,

494
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
who used to have pretty high-level security clearance.

495
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And he explained to me about how unimpressive that particular type of security clearance is, how very common.

496
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Which one?

497
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
This is David.

498
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Yes, David.

499
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
No, not David Fraver.

500
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
No, no, no.

501
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
David Fraver was the tic-tac.

502
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Correct.

503
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
This is Dave Gurush.

504
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yes.

505
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Okay.

506
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Very common level of security clearance, that using that as some sort of, oh, this is a legitimate credential.

507
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It doesn't really wash too much.

508
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That it was second, it was third-hand information mostly, second-hand information kind of.

509
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I heard from a person who saw or who heard.

510
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Right.

511
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It just seemed to me to be rather, on the face of it, unimpressive.

512
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
That release.

513
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I see.

514
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
What did you think?

515
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Well, like I've been telling everybody.

516
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
These are highly conserved stories.

517
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
This is not the only person I've heard this story from.

518
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I've heard this from multiple people.

519
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,000
There are various versions of this secret world which play out as space opera.

520
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Then MJ-12 became the real government that only, even the president couldn't understand.

521
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's like, okay.

522
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:32,000
So that's the weird part about it until you start realizing how sober many of the people are who believe this and who claim to have had direct contact with it.

523
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And then you don't know what to do.

524
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I mean, in other words, whatever this is, there is a thing.

525
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It's not necessarily little green men.

526
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It could be, for example, that they mock up a floating spaceship in a hangar and then they drag people past it and say, whatever you do, do not look to your left or right or you'll be shot.

527
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And then, of course, people look and then like mission accomplished.

528
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Now people will say, oh my God, you have no idea what we, the US has incredible technology.

529
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And then maybe the idea is you've got a cover story.

530
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Maybe you've got your adversary investing in things that don't make any sense.

531
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't know.

532
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But there's not nothing here.

533
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
This is not about mylar balloons and seagulls anymore.

534
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm trying to come up with a word for it, but it's like a, it's like recursive false flags in a way where the goal is not to give or hide truth,

535
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
but to fire hose with information so much that the truth can no longer be discerned.

536
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's a haystack of bullshit to make sure that any needle is very difficult to find.

537
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
It is.

538
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yes.

539
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Bullshit haystacking.

540
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Right.

541
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Yeah.

542
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Okay.

543
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So they haystack the crap out of this thing.

544
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I have no question that there was something that was used to develop US aircraft like the B2 bomber and the SR-71 Blackbird.

545
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So if you see something crazy in the sky, better that you think it's a UFO from outer space than some advanced thing from Lockheed.

546
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I have no question that we use this to deal with things like the Chinese balloon shootdown where we shot down several things in a week and we couldn't recover debris from any of them.

547
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I mean, come on guys.

548
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You know, maybe the idea is that this is a head fake to our adversaries to develop the wrong things and to use their treasure on things that won't work.

549
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Maybe there's a secret program where some of this stuff is actually real and true and we're not allowed to know it because it would be too mind blowing.

550
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Maybe there's a cult inside of our government that has replaced angels with saucer shaped aircraft.

551
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Whatever this thing is, it's being used for many different purposes.

552
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
There's something here.

553
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
We just don't know what, you know, this is the problem.

554
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
The princess can't feel a pee because that would be impossible.

555
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
The princess feels a disturbance and you can't say what the disturbance is.

556
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Maybe it's a golf ball.

557
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Maybe it's a cantaloupe.

558
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Maybe it's a banana.

559
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
But whatever it is, there's something wrong with the mattress.

560
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yeah, it seems to me this firehosing, the goal of uncertainty.

561
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Right.

562
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
How do things muddle out?

563
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Who wins in a muddle is a great question.

564
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
We're not taught to ask.

565
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Sorry to jump in on that.

566
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
No, tell me more.

567
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Always look for who is trying to muddle to win.

568
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Very often you're in a dispute with entrenched status quo.

569
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And somebody will say, well, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.

570
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I'm like, oh, well, who wins if we agree to disagree?

571
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Oh, it's you.

572
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Right?

573
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah.

574
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
This is like an old principle of mine, which is that you can always tell who's guilty by who first declares a time of healing.

575
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Why?

576
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Why is that a razor to use?

577
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh, because if you do something wrong and the public is clamoring for your blood, you say, there's been too much blame and finger pointing on all sides.

578
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
At me.

579
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I think what we need is to come together and declare a time of healing.

580
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
For me.

581
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Right.

582
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So I believe that in general, whoever declares a time of healing is suspect number one.

583
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That's a very nice razor to use.

584
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I wonder about this.

585
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Oh, how would you say?

586
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Epidemic of uncertainty.

587
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Brilliant.

588
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Speaking my language.

589
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And I wonder...

590
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:29,000
How, first off, how as an individual, you are supposed to put up any kind of effective defense to just take some sovereignty being, you know, an agentic individual.

591
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Right.

592
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And secondly, I wonder what the end goal is.

593
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I understand why uncertainty would be useful for manipulation, because if people can't discern truth from untruth, it can be easy to poke them and prod them and float them in particular directions.

594
00:39:48,000 --> 00:40:00,000
But it also seems like, I don't know, kind of also useless as well, that some people, non-insignificant, large cohort of people will just reject it entirely.

595
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Which actually...

596
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
What are they doing?

597
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It actually makes it more chaotic and more unruly.

598
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
So it makes me think, well, maybe if this is the case, if the firehosing is happening.

599
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Right.

600
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It's epidemic of uncertainty.

601
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Maybe the outcomes were predicted but haven't manifest in the way that was intended.

602
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Maybe there's more of a rebellious streak in...

603
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Say more about that.

604
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm trying to understand it.

605
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
That if people who...

606
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
If you make the public very uncertain about most things by overloading them with information, or by even the...

607
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It doesn't even need to be coordination.

608
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It could be a byproduct of having 24-7 access to the entire world's population through Twitter and Instagram stories and blah, blah, blah.

609
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Right.

610
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
There is so much I can no longer discern, even due to a multiplicity of opinions that's not coordinated to be a multiplicity that go in opposite directions.

611
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Right.

612
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
If it was coordinated, the outcomes that are occurring at the moment, a lot of the time don't seem to be happening with people.

613
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Just, oh, roll over.

614
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Tell me exactly what to do.

615
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:06,000
There is a massive, non-insignificant cohort of people that say, I'm checking out and I now no longer trust anybody at all.

616
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Right.

617
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Or anything.

618
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Yes.

619
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And that doesn't seem to be...

620
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
If the goal was ease of control, that doesn't seem to be effective for the person that wanted that or the group that wanted that to be the audience.

621
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
What's the outcome?

622
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:31,000
First of all, I'm really glad to get a question about this as a sea change, which is that our lives have become wall-to-wall uncertainty.

623
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:43,000
We can't discern if the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor today, we would spend 10 years discussing whether it was a false flag, whether it was actually the Japanese, whether there was any attack, whether it was a soundstage,

624
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
whether it was a sigh-up, whether it was a...

625
00:41:51,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Right now, the main institutions of our society have abdicated their role for public-spirited adjudication of what is true based on expertise.

626
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And so what you're seeing is people coming to hate experts and coming to hate institutions because they're realizing that these institutions lie to them at a level that they've never considered unless they were Alex Jones fans to begin with.

627
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And so what you're having is you're having a large number of people waking up to the idea that, yeah, there really are organizations and working groups that determine what you hear from a multiplicity of venues.

628
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It's the same message relentlessly.

629
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Do you think people are overly pattern-matching that now?

630
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Say more about what you mean.

631
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
That they're seeing conspiracy weather isn't because the lack of faith in institutions.

632
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Same person is saying that they see a conspiracy and they see no conspiracy.

633
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:05,000
They have part of their head that remembers that conspiracy theorists are crazy people and they've got part of their brain that remembers that normies who don't believe in conspiracies are crazy people.

634
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And they can't integrate those things, right?

635
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
They cannot figure out how are these things being coordinated?

636
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Am I a crazy person for seeing these patterns?

637
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Am I a crazy person for ignoring them?

638
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
For believing them?

639
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
For when they're unearthed?

640
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:34,000
What you're seeing is a complete destruction of bedrock reality that if you weren't actually physically there, how do we know that these people actually met in a warehouse?

641
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Is this really a table or is it just CGI?

642
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Was it green and we could superimpose wood onto it?

643
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Nobody knows what's true.

644
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And, you know, if you ask me, well, Eric, how are you dealing with this?

645
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I would say I'm failing.

646
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I'm just flat out failing, as are all of you.

647
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I'm just more honest about it.

648
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Some of you have an idea that you've got one lens, which is fix the money, fix the world.

649
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Bitcoin, that's the answer.

650
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Yeah, Bitcoin, rock on.

651
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
But no, that's not the answer.

652
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Or somebody else says, you know, I really think that we just need to be open and tolerant and realize it's a big world and we just have to give people their due.

653
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Well, that doesn't work either.

654
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
You can't just let everything run riot or we have to go back to our institutions.

655
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
With these people at the helm, are you kidding?

656
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
We have to abandon our institution.

657
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Wait, what are you saying?

658
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
We're going to abandon our institutions?

659
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Do you know what that looks like?

660
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Nobody has an answer.

661
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Well, get back to talking to Eric in one minute.

662
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
But first, I need to tell you about Gymshark.

663
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Gymshark make the best training kit on the planet.

664
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
This T-shirt that I've been falling in love with and traveling in for a very long time is phenomenal.

665
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And these shorts, the studio shorts that they make are the best men's training shorts on the planet.

666
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
They have lasted me over a year now.

667
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
They come in amazing colors.

668
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
The length is perfect.

669
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
They're sweat wicking.

670
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
They're lightweight.

671
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
They wash and dry perfectly.

672
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
You don't need that many pairs of shorts as a guy, but the ones that you do have need to be very good.

673
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
So if you need new gym kit, this is where to go.

674
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I highly, highly recommend that you go and check out everything that I use and recommend from Gymshark.

675
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
They've updated my product page with everything that I use and recommend for men and women.

676
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And you can get 10% off everything site-wide with no minimum order.

677
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And they have 30-day free returns worldwide.

678
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
You're sounding an awful lot parallel.

679
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
The conversation is moving in a similar direction to one I had with Sam Harris recently.

680
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I would think it's very different, but I'm happy to hear more.

681
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
He identified on an episode that I did with him not long ago.

682
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,000
The fact that we have lost trust in our institutions and yet abandoning them is also,

683
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
wholesale is also not an option.

684
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Sam also tried to say, I can see the problems on the,

685
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I say I can see the problems on the right and I can see the problems on the left.

686
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And there is a group of people who have allowed their irritation with the left

687
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
to color their thinking to the point that they don't know what to do.

688
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I think Sam is discounting the idea that once people wake up to the,

689
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
to the concept that they were living in an orchestrated Truman show,

690
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
that they did not understand.

691
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
They're not going to have the idea of like, oh, sure.

692
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
The vaccines were a little bit more dangerous.

693
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I don't know.

694
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I don't know.

695
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I don't know.

696
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I don't know.

697
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I don't know.

698
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I don't know.

699
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I don't know.

700
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
The idea of like, oh, sure.

701
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
The vaccines were a little bit more dangerous than claimed and maybe a little bit less effective

702
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
and maybe we knew a little bit more about the lab lead.

703
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It's no way.

704
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
You spat directly in my face and told me not only that it was raining,

705
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
but that I was a crazy person for thinking that you spat directly in my face and you piled

706
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:11,000
up how many Nobel laureates to defend the idea that any inquiry into the origin of this

707
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
virus was racism?

708
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,520
It's like, you're dead to me.

709
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,400
And I think that that's what people are not understanding in the Democratic Party.

710
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:27,200
Increasingly, the basic attitude is whoever this class of people is that crawled into

711
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,200
our elite institutions is just dead.

712
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:34,800
Like, there's nothing Anthony Fauci could say at this moment that I want to hear.

713
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,560
It's not that I don't think that he doesn't know virology or epidemiology.

714
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,120
I know I can't trust him because of the way in which he looked into my eyes.

715
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:50,640
And then, you know, when Stephen Colbert is dancing with syringes singing the vaccine

716
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:57,920
song and Ariana Grande, you know, is in a super highly produced number from like hair

717
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:04,640
spray but converted to vaccines with a giant picture of Anthony Fauci and everybody celebrating

718
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,720
like it's a May Day celebration, I get it.

719
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,160
I live in a completely fake world and I wrote an article about this in 2011 on K-Fabe,

720
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,720
which is the system of lies that undergirds professional wrestling.

721
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:23,760
So now you've woken up to the idea that you've spent your life watching something like Major

722
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:30,320
League Baseball or Premier League Soccer or whatever it is, and it's all fake.

723
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,240
And now you don't know who you are, you don't know what your country is, you don't know

724
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:38,600
what a ballot box is, you have no idea what news is or media, you don't know what a university

725
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:45,240
is actually teaching, you've got people running around who are calling themselves scholars

726
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,480
who publish in scholarly journals and sit in scholarly seats and you can tell what

727
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,080
they're saying is completely wrong and it's directly in their area of expertise.

728
00:48:54,080 --> 00:49:00,600
So the thing about pattern matching that I said was, there are still many people who

729
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:07,280
are scholars, who are in positions of authority inside of high-faluting institutions that presumably

730
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:13,000
do want to do good and do want to deploy their skills in a way that does this, is it

731
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:24,920
a case that every single institution is completely wrong or is this reflexive skepticism being

732
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:30,840
tuned up too highly to the point where there is skepticism about things that don't deserve

733
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,560
it and how do we determine between the two?

734
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,480
Okay, so we have to talk about the institutions that are fighting back.

735
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:45,560
The future which has become X is not on the same standard that the Facebooks are or Google

736
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,800
is, Elon is doing something different.

737
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,560
We can talk about what?

738
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:57,600
The University of Chicago is still fighting, my daughter just graduated from the University

739
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,600
of Chicago.

740
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,600
Congratulations.

741
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,840
I never mentioned where she was while she was there.

742
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,240
It needs support.

743
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,560
We have to support the schools that fought back, for example.

744
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:16,240
I believe Ohio State fought back and there's a school in Oklahoma that fought back and

745
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,760
leading that charge is the University of Chicago.

746
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:24,320
We have organizations like FIRE that promote free speech.

747
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:29,360
We have professors who are taking on some risk like Jonathan Haidt, but we're not seeing

748
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,240
the Noam Chomsky effect where you do amazing research and they have to put up with every

749
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,160
crazy idea that comes through your mind.

750
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,720
That's important.

751
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:47,520
Look up a person named Serge Lang in mathematics and something called the file to understand

752
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:52,320
how dangerous it is to screw with real scholars.

753
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,320
What happens?

754
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,960
Give us the 30,000 foot view.

755
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:02,120
People tried to put Sam Huntington into the National Academy of Sciences who was an architect

756
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:06,440
of the Vietnam War and Serge Lang just said, I look through his papers, I find the following

757
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,800
mathematical statements.

758
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,800
This is not science.

759
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,760
Why is this person in the academy?

760
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,000
Then they fight back.

761
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,160
I fought back with Serge Lang when he was at Harvard where we tried to engage Sam Huntington

762
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,000
on that topic.

763
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
You can't have these dangerous people running around.

764
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,680
That's why all of us are discredited.

765
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:30,360
You haven't noticed this, but like Jordan Peterson is discredited, Sam Harris is discredited,

766
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,560
Joe Rogan is discredited, Brett Weinstein is discredited, Ben Shapiro is discredited,

767
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,680
Barry Weiss is discredited.

768
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,400
Everybody is discredited.

769
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:46,240
Tim Pool referred to it as the IDW's walking corpse phase at the moment.

770
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:52,640
Well, my point is this personal destruction is the coin of the realm.

771
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,520
Some of the personal destruction that you see that looks organic is orchestrated as

772
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,000
well.

773
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,120
We're just in this thing where, in my opinion, what you're looking at is something called

774
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:06,360
de-confliction, but people don't know what that is.

775
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:10,680
De-confliction is supposed to stop what are called blue-on-blue incidences.

776
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,480
Blue-on-blue incidences, you have two branches of government that don't know that they're

777
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,080
operating covertly.

778
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:20,080
Maybe you have an investigative team and an undercover team, and the investigative team

779
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,640
is about to blow the cover thinking that they've got a target, but it's actually an

780
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,640
undercover agent.

781
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,800
What they're supposed to do is they're supposed to check in with these centralized systems

782
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,120
and say, do you have any assets in this arena we're about to move?

783
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,120
Yes, we do.

784
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,120
Oh, okay.

785
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:39,680
They find out, and this is supposed to stop blue-on-blue.

786
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,760
The interesting thing is, even though there are three systems called safety net, RIS safe,

787
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:53,520
and case explorer, you can't use them unless you are an official part of the government.

788
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,280
I called up one of them, had a half an hour conversation before I started asking about

789
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:04,080
Jeffrey Epstein, and then they immediately said this call will be terminated in five seconds.

790
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:09,160
Maybe it was case explorer for South Florida, something like that.

791
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:18,560
What happens when you have a civilian that's not signed up for nondisclosure under no rules?

792
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:23,800
You're an American citizen with full right to free speech, and you stumble on something

793
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,880
that you're not supposed to know about.

794
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,360
That is a deconfliction problem that nobody has ever solved.

795
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,920
The first thing I'd like to throw out is if we have three separate systems to keep the

796
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,880
intelligence community and local police departments from tripping over each other, what do you

797
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:48,880
think we do when ordinary citizens get wind of something amiss that's some super-secret

798
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,160
operation?

799
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,560
My claim is, we discredit them.

800
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:02,440
We pre-bunk them in the language of the GEC, I believe.

801
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:10,680
We're all familiar with debunking misinformation and disinformation.

802
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,000
You've got some disinformation that's spread it around, and we debunk it by giving you

803
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,280
the truth.

804
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,880
What happens when somebody is spreading the truth in a way that is unhelpful to a statecraft

805
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,400
level narrative?

806
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,480
Well, we didn't know what the words were, but we just found out, and it's you pre-bunk

807
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,080
the malinformation.

808
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:37,720
Now, if you didn't grow up knowing what malinformation is, here's a quick refresher.

809
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,600
Malinformation is actual information, but it's harmful.

810
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,600
Right.

811
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,440
The equivalent of politically incorrect incarnation.

812
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:51,600
Well, or you're trying to make sure that there's support for the war in Ukraine, and

813
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:56,560
somebody actually realizes that things are much more desperate than they thought.

814
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:03,600
Well, that would be deleterious to our efforts if the objective is to get Putin to capitulate.

815
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:11,600
Now you have to pre-bunk the malinformation, which means destroy the reputation of the

816
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:18,240
person spreading the information that's countering the official disinformation and misinformation.

817
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,920
I can't work out why anybody's confused and why they're having trouble existing in the

818
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,960
state and school kids.

819
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:31,120
The point is, I've got all of these friends who are pre-bunked malinformers.

820
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,120
That's what a club.

821
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,120
What a club to be in.

822
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,120
That's what I do.

823
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,120
I'm a pre-bunked malinformant.

824
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,120
There's never been a sexier title, actually.

825
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,680
I spread malinformation, and I need to be pre-bunked.

826
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,000
So of course, I'm going to be a grifter.

827
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,160
I'm going to be, I don't know, a charlatan.

828
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,400
I'm going to, well, he's over.

829
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,440
Can we stop trying to make Eric Weinstein a thing?

830
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,440
Blah, blah, blah.

831
00:55:52,480 --> 00:56:00,080
There's giant farms of people in bots that are dedicated to spreading bad feelings about

832
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,200
anybody who's going to contradict narrative.

833
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:07,880
Well, don't forget as well that the coordination doesn't necessarily need to be there because

834
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,280
the incentives align online for...

835
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,800
There's an emergent part.

836
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,840
There's a non-emergent part.

837
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:19,760
I will not agree with anyone who tells me it's all one or all the other, but part of

838
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,680
this is actually coordinated.

839
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,920
Yeah.

840
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:32,480
So, close that loop on the agentic, sovereign individual existing in the world.

841
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,480
Holy fuck.

842
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:39,800
I'm getting bookockied with this total awfulness of information here.

843
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,680
Bookocky just means splattered in Japanese.

844
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,040
That's why it's not a terrible term to use.

845
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,040
Absolutely not.

846
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,040
Thank you.

847
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,920
It's actually been appropriated by the adult industry in a way that I think the Japanese

848
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,920
should reclaim.

849
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:55,000
And Melissa Chen has probably done more to popularize this in intellectual circles than

850
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
anyone else.

851
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,160
So, shout out to Miss Melissa Chen.

852
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,640
Melissa Chen and Bookocky in the same sense and something that we weren't expecting today.

853
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,360
I think there was a period of her life where she would use it in every public appearance.

854
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,360
Just sneak it in.

855
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,360
Right.

856
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,360
Okay.

857
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,360
The Bookocky of the gaps.

858
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:14,400
So, anyway, you have a situation where nobody knows what's going on.

859
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,160
And I don't think Sam is comfortable, by the way, being here.

860
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,360
Like, you're in open water.

861
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,880
And you have all of these instructions about what to do when you're swimming in your land,

862
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,240
which is, you know, try to align yourself with the shore.

863
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,240
Don't fight the current.

864
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,440
And like, that's not where you are.

865
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,920
You're just in open water.

866
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,840
And you're treading water and you don't know whether there are oceanic white tips around

867
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,680
and you don't know whether you can keep this up for much longer.

868
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,520
But there is no land.

869
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:46,080
There's a big difference with Sam.

870
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,080
Go a little deeper.

871
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,360
Make that a little planer for me.

872
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:55,080
You cannot trust Harvard or nature.

873
00:57:55,080 --> 00:58:01,360
You cannot trust the Office of Management and Budget or the Lancet or the Lancet or

874
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,200
the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

875
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:09,280
You cannot trust any newspaper that I'm aware.

876
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:15,960
You cannot trust the CDC or the NIH or the WHO.

877
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:22,880
Now, people will hear that and they'll say, oh my God, Eric, you're spreading distrust

878
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,880
and fear.

879
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,240
It's like, I'm a pastor.

880
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,800
Shoot the messenger all you want.

881
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:33,320
All of those institutions are out of control and we all know it.

882
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,320
And say-

883
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,040
And it's highly out of control?

884
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,040
No.

885
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,040
Mostly out of control.

886
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,280
I did this on trigonometry.

887
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,920
We have this anti-institutional point.

888
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:49,360
How is it that the airlines can't keep my seat clean and can't make sure that I'm able

889
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:55,600
to recline it properly or that the Wi-Fi doesn't go out and then their planes never crash?

890
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,480
So the institutions are functioning and not functioning.

891
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,240
They're lying and telling the truth.

892
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,120
They're getting it done and failing outright over and over again.

893
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:10,120
And it's even worse because if the planes crashed all the time and you'd say, okay,

894
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,360
well, these people are incompetent.

895
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:19,080
But it's like the selective incompetence and madness.

896
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:24,320
And what I think is, is that Sam wanted to treat this as, look, it's pretty annoying

897
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,600
what's going on on the left and it's pretty annoying what's going on with the institutions.

898
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:34,080
But let's not lose sight of the fact, January 6th.

899
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,520
People don't feel that way.

900
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,400
People feel like, wait a minute, I don't know which end is up.

901
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,200
I don't know who's telling me the truth anymore.

902
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,760
I can spot these lies that are so transparent.

903
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,600
And this is the theory of lies as a checksum.

904
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:52,000
So when you get a binary for a computer program that you want to install on your computer,

905
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,200
you want to know, well, is this what came from Microsoft or did somebody adulterate

906
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,200
it?

907
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,400
And when I click on this thing, it's going to install ransomware on my machine.

908
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:06,680
So there's something called a checksum, which is generated by how the program was compiled

909
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:11,160
and it would be almost impossible to come up with a second program that would generate

910
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,160
the same checksum.

911
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,160
Verification.

912
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,160
Yeah.

913
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:20,520
If the checksum is off, I don't install the thing and the checksums are all off.

914
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,400
And that's why people are going crazy.

915
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,520
And that's why, to your earlier point, isn't it interesting that we're not talking about

916
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,160
the level of uncertainty, right?

917
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,560
This is not sustainable.

918
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:36,360
So Sam is 100% correct on a lot of things that people are making fun of him for.

919
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:41,280
And I assume that I will be keel hauled all over Twitter for saying this.

920
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,840
You cannot have a world without institutions.

921
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,320
We're not built for it.

922
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:50,160
We're just, there's no part of you that is prepared to generate all your own electricity

923
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:57,320
and, you know, kill all your own game and get your own clean water.

924
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,960
You need an army.

925
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,480
You need a police department.

926
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:08,720
You can only play frontier, you know, Wild West so long before you realize that modern

927
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,720
life can't be supported this way.

928
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,020
And we can't go with the institutions we have.

929
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:18,280
So we need institutions.

930
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,600
We can't go with these institutions, not because the institutions are wrong, but because the

931
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:28,280
inhabitants are wrong to a person they've been selected for by this ability to lie because

932
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,480
growth evaporated.

933
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,480
That's one of my main rifts.

934
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,240
We don't have to go into it, but basically that in the absence of real growth, everything

935
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,280
turns pathological.

936
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,740
And so it's just heartbreaking to see some of these people saying, look, we've always

937
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,440
known that the institutions were wrong.

938
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,080
We finally have the ability to prove that let's tear them all down.

939
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:49,920
So that's a very popular perspective at the moment.

940
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,680
Other people want to claim, let's cling to the institutions because we know we need them

941
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,280
and we'll look past the fact that they're obviously lying about almost everything of

942
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,440
importance.

943
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,720
That's not really tenable.

944
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:08,120
We can't vote these people out because like Diane Feinstein could beat me easily in a run

945
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,120
for Senate.

946
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:16,040
I don't know why because the machine is stronger than actually the vision we had for democracy.

947
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:24,000
So we've got Mitch McConnell having a temporary ischemic attack on camera.

948
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,960
We've got somebody post-stroke in Pennsylvania having defeated Mehmet Oz.

949
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,360
We've got Diane Feinstein.

950
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:35,280
We've got Nancy Pelosi trading up a storm.

951
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,280
We can't get rid of any of these people.

952
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:44,160
Joe Biden is way too old for this job and has been in government since he was 29 in 1972

953
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,080
when he won his Senate seat.

954
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,080
This is a joke.

955
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,400
It's beyond preposterous.

956
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,720
And by the way, it comes out of not loving your children.

957
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,560
How's that?

958
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:01,560
People who love their children don't drill holes in their children's life raft.

959
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:08,320
And the modern world at post-World War II was a life raft to get us to the next stage.

960
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:19,200
And the number of older people I see liquidating everything so that they can live out their

961
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,680
final days in the same style to which they've become accustomed is impossible in a world

962
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,800
where people love their children.

963
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:32,360
Yeah, I don't think they care.

964
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,320
You familiar with Toby Ord's analogy of the precipice?

965
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,320
No, Toby.

966
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,320
Really cool.

967
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,800
So his book, The Precipice, that everybody should go and read, it's my best primer on

968
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,800
existential risk.

969
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:47,400
Toby Ord's from the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford with Nick Bostrom and he's a colleague

970
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,800
of William McCaskill, long-termism, EA, et cetera.

971
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:58,560
He uses this example of, you can imagine, on a journey, a particular individual getting

972
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:07,400
to a beautiful, lush, abundant meadow would have to take a treacherous mountain path.

973
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:14,880
And along this mountain path, there is a particularly thin, small, steep, sharp, uncertain, unstable

974
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,160
part of it.

975
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,680
That's the precipice.

976
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:22,120
And he talks about, I like to think about it like an hourglass, you have width with

977
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,880
room and then you have a choke point.

978
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,840
And at that choke point, things can get dicey.

979
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:34,360
And it's Toby's contention that if we make it through this precipice, you broaden out

980
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:39,520
and you have the meadow, you are a multi-planetary species, you have redundancy, genetically

981
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:47,000
redundancy, civilizationally, you have overcome some of the limitations of the castoffs from

982
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,280
your energy production and consumption.

983
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:54,480
You don't have value lock-in in a bad way that means that it's despots all the way down

984
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,680
or it's tyrants all the way down.

985
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,000
I assume that I hear you.

986
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Yep.

987
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,640
Where do you think we are?

988
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,000
It feels very precipice.

989
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Yeah, doesn't it?

990
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Yeah.

991
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,920
What's more, as one of the only people who are really seriously hitting this multi-planetary

992
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:17,580
note, there is no interest in this.

993
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,080
From who?

994
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,080
I'm interested.

995
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,080
Are you?

996
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,080
Fuck yeah.

997
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,080
Don't I count, Eric?

998
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,080
All right.

999
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:30,920
Am I not legitimate in the future of this civilization's direction?

1000
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:34,600
What are your best stories for how we become interplanetary?

1001
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,040
I say it because you brought it up.

1002
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,000
Stories or strategies?

1003
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,520
Stories about how we get to be interplanetary.

1004
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:44,200
I'm not sure what you mean by story.

1005
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:54,680
Tell me a story by which we have 10 planets that humans have settled.

1006
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:58,280
If you want to do 10, we're going to have to go to planets that are outside of the solar

1007
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,280
system.

1008
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,280
Right.

1009
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:04,200
There's this one which is really troubling.

1010
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:10,000
Mars is really screwing up this whole story because Elon has gotten everybody focused

1011
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:16,880
on Mars and it's a marginal planet that would be very difficult to get to using chemical

1012
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:23,640
rockets and it's not a stepping stone because once you master Mars, if, if, if, which we're

1013
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:30,240
not going to do, it doesn't really get you anywhere.

1014
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,040
It's just Mars.

1015
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:38,960
So Avi Loeb, new book that recently came out, Interstellar, spoke to him last week about

1016
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:39,960
it.

1017
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:40,960
He asked him about this.

1018
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,360
I said, um, do, will we ever visit other galaxies?

1019
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,560
And he made this cop out answer of saying, well, Andromeda is going to crash into the

1020
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,560
Milky Way.

1021
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,560
I was like, that doesn't count.

1022
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,880
Avi, we can't blend two together and say that we've been there.

1023
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:54,880
Right.

1024
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,240
Um, and he's talking about, uh, interstellar travel, right?

1025
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:03,720
From here to Proxima Santori, pick, pick your other star, right?

1026
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:09,000
They are trying at some point in the not too distant future to do the light sail laser

1027
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,880
pointed added thing.

1028
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:16,560
Maybe we can, and this was me asking him, uh, my conception was generation ships, you

1029
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:22,640
know, you and the next 500 generations of your progeny, you condemn them to be locked

1030
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:29,960
in this tin box and it's group sex and, and plants and CO2 for the next however long until

1031
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,900
you get to Proxima Santori, hope that it's not totally wrecked.

1032
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:42,420
This point was light sail, uh, desktop DNA sequencer, artificial womb, send it out.

1033
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:44,740
You guys are being ridiculous.

1034
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,420
It's, it's a thought.

1035
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:47,420
This is my story.

1036
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:48,420
I know.

1037
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:49,420
This is my story.

1038
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:50,420
Okay.

1039
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:54,180
This is my story and I'm allowed to tell my story, but it's exactly why I wanted it.

1040
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,980
If I could, it just to riff, okay.

1041
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:59,980
It's an innervating story.

1042
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:02,180
What's that?

1043
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:06,300
We're not energized by this story, except for the, except for the group sex and the

1044
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,300
plants, right?

1045
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,300
Yep.

1046
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,900
So the issue is, if we could sprinkle some Bukaki in there, everybody would get on board

1047
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:11,900
a Melissa champ.

1048
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:18,340
Moving, moving, moving at light speed, um, what we're doing is that we're telling people

1049
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:25,620
we've crawled inside our modern theories and our modern theories make our imaginations

1050
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:27,820
our enemy.

1051
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:31,580
We're not excited about the, we don't really believe that we're going to open a wormhole

1052
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:35,860
we don't really believe in multi-generation ships.

1053
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:38,380
We don't believe that we're going to reboot from tardigrades.

1054
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:43,260
We don't believe that we're going to scan all of our synapses and reconstruct the brain,

1055
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:47,260
uh, from the beginning.

1056
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:50,700
Einstein is the problem.

1057
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:59,700
Now I know Avi decently well and Avi for the Galileo project that he's heading up, doesn't

1058
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:03,180
want people to consider new physics.

1059
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:09,700
So whenever I speak at all as somebody affiliated with the Galileo project with wearing that

1060
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,700
hat, I don't think about new physics at all.

1061
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,220
I accept the constraints of the physics we know.

1062
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,220
Yes.

1063
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:16,220
Yes.

1064
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,220
Yes.

1065
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:22,780
When I take that hat off, it's all about new physics.

1066
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:29,380
It's not about new technology using the old physics and the way you can measure whether

1067
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:36,420
people are serious about interplanetary is how much they're focused on new physics.

1068
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:41,220
Anybody who isn't focused on new physics is not serious about interplanetary.

1069
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:45,580
Is this because with the current conception of physics that we have, it's going to be

1070
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,580
essentially impossible for us to go into planetary?

1071
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:48,580
Yeah.

1072
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:50,060
And the word essentially is doing some work there.

1073
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:55,420
And so what you get is you get these innervating workarounds like, oh, if we use time dilation

1074
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:57,460
if we went really fast, then it wouldn't be that fast.

1075
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,500
Can you just explain the word innovating, please?

1076
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,740
Do you mean as an innovation, or is this ER?

1077
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:02,740
No.

1078
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:03,740
Innervating.

1079
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:04,740
What's that?

1080
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:15,120
Means to lessen in potency, to sort of discourage and as long as I have to do things that don't

1081
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:21,060
involve me cruising to new planets and taking in the, oh, it'd be your great, great, great,

1082
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:25,900
great, great, great, great, to the 12,000 power grandchild who actually sees a new planet,

1083
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,260
that's not going to work.

1084
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:30,780
Or you're going to open a wormhole, or you're going to have an Alcubierre drive,

1085
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:36,540
all of these sorts of things discourage us. And we know that we're telling lies about it.

1086
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:40,540
And so we don't work on it. You want to know how to work on this?

1087
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:46,380
We're abandoning the one field that has the chance of making us interplanetary.

1088
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:50,380
And I don't know what to do about it because nobody sees this as the emergency I do.

1089
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:54,060
We'll get back to talking to Eric in one minute, but first I need to tell you about cozy earth.

1090
01:10:54,060 --> 01:11:00,380
Look, we spend one third of our lives asleep. You do not want to spend 33% of your existence

1091
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:05,100
inside of sheets that do not make you feel amazing. Cozy Earth has the best quality

1092
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:09,340
bedding. It's not just about what you sleep on, it is what you sleep under. And the quality of

1093
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:13,180
your sheets make a massive difference to the quality of your sleep. Sleep is the ultimate

1094
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:17,820
game changer and improving your sheets will improve your sleep quality. Cozy Earth is a

1095
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:22,540
premium bedding and loungewear company where they make the best quality bedwear. The products are

1096
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:26,860
made from super soft viscose from highly sustainable bamboo, the temperature regulating, so you'll

1097
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:32,060
sleep cool all year round. Best of all, they've got a 10 year warranty on all of their products.

1098
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:37,420
That's how confident they are that they'll last. You can get an exclusive 35% discount

1101
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,340
Okay, so let me see if I can get the topology of what you've said right.

1102
01:11:54,700 --> 01:12:01,820
The fact that Mars is within reach broadly and chemical rockets.

1103
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:07,740
Correct. Of current technology, of current physics. And we do it. Hooray.

1104
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:11,180
Super hard. We did it. Interplanetary. Right.

1105
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:20,700
But your point is that, well, it seems like that is insufficient and also kind of like a

1106
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:27,500
false duck type scenario where we did it, but we didn't actually do the thing we needed to do.

1107
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:34,220
So we may have even been better off had the nearest closest planet been two light years away.

1108
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:38,460
Assume Mars didn't exist. Correct. And assume that Elon was still the visionary

1109
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:44,940
that we want him to be. And he didn't have a chemical rocket company. I'd like to think

1110
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:50,380
that he would be focused on physics. I would like to think that any of these people would be

1111
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:59,580
focused on physics. Take anybody with 11 figures. What is your allocation to building a life raft

1112
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:05,020
to get humans out of here? You don't, you haven't even thought about it.

1113
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:09,740
Immediately you're going to think technology. Well, what kind of a whole would I need? It's

1114
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:16,860
like, no, you need a blackboard. You need blackboards and physicists who are not afraid

1115
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:22,860
to do physics. Right now we are destroying the fundamental physics community at a rate that

1116
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:26,540
you could not believe. What's happening? Give me the gossip from inside.

1117
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:33,820
For 39 years, we've been dominated by one community's madness. And that community is

1118
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:42,140
called quantum gravity, string theory or M theory. It changed what we were researching.

1119
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:47,180
It's cardinal sin is not about string theory. It's not about quantum gravity. It changed the

1120
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:53,580
questions that defined what it meant to be a fundamental physicist. So if I say to you,

1121
01:13:53,580 --> 01:14:00,620
how many generations of matter are there? I don't know. You don't know that it's three

1122
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:07,500
because we don't talk about that all the time anymore. Or if I say, do you know why is matter

1123
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:12,300
chiral? You wouldn't know about that. Or if I said, what's the nature of the quartic potential

1124
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:16,540
for the Higgs field? Or why is there a Yukawa coupling in one case and a minimal coupling somewhere

1125
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:26,620
else? All of the real physics questions that would cause progress got subtly replaced between

1126
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:35,260
1984 and like 1987. And then we had questions like, how do we quantize gravity? And that became this,

1127
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:42,780
oh, that is the ultimate question. Well, it's not. That's just wrong. This comes out of Bryce

1128
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:48,780
DeWitt. This comes out of a guy who in 1952 went with his wife to the Tata Institute of Fundamental

1129
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:53,180
Research in Bombay, then wrote an essay for something called the Gravity Research Foundation

1130
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:57,340
that was about anti-gravity. And he was supposed to write an essay and then he said, well, to get

1131
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:02,780
anti-gravity, what you'd really need to do is to do quantum gravity. And for 70 years, we've been

1132
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:09,820
trying to do quantum gravity and it's an abject failure. And the physicists at the helm changed

1133
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:15,340
the questions. The official questions should sound something like this. Why are there three

1134
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:19,900
generations of matter? Why is it flavor chiral? What is the nature and the origin of the Higgs

1135
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:27,980
mechanism? Why are we in one comma three dimensions? And what is with SU3 cross SU2 cross U1, which is

1136
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:32,460
a bunch of symmetries? And why does it seem to represent on a 16 dimensional space with the

1137
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:37,020
observed quantum numbers? That may not mean a lot to you. But I guarantee you, if there are

1138
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:42,700
physicists in the audience, they're getting pissed off right now because they allowed their

1139
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:48,780
subject to be dragged away from our real questions for reasons that are unclear and put in the service

1140
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:54,140
of these questions that can't be answered. And we can't even question them 39 years into this

1141
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:59,580
complete train wreck that is the community that could build the life raft. What is so seductive

1142
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:08,780
about quantum everything? Quantum gravity? Yeah. It allows for toy problems so that you can not do

1143
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:16,620
your work on the world that we have. And you can say, well, world that we have is too complicated.

1144
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:21,180
So I created this fake world over here that's not in four dimensions. It's in two dimensions. It's

1145
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:26,140
not in Lorentzian signature. It's in Euclidean signature. It's not the full gauge group. It's

1146
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:32,220
just SU2. And I've changed all the parameters. And then I say, and I've made some minor incremental

1147
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:39,260
progress in that fake world. And then everybody claps. And meanwhile, 10 years later, you don't

1148
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:44,220
even remember what the particles are that are present in the universe. You don't even remember

1149
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:50,700
the standard model of particle theory. And this is a very real effect. Today's physicists, a lot

1150
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:56,380
of the young ones are completely ignorant about the physical world. They could not find the men's

1151
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:07,260
or women's room at CERN if their life depended on it. Yeah, so it seems like a hijacking of attention

1152
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:19,580
and focus from difficult problems to from useful difficult problems to useless or less useful

1153
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:25,580
easier problems. But if you try to talk about the real problems, you can't get engagement. And

1154
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:29,740
they will say it as, well, maybe people just aren't interested in your ideas. I was like,

1155
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:34,460
yeah, but you're not listening to it. So far as I can tell, everybody who comes from outside with

1156
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:41,020
an interesting new idea isn't being listened to. It's not personal. And we also have a responsibility.

1157
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:45,820
This is like, this is a really crazy part. We doomed humanity.

1158
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:52,780
Like Francis Crick, who was a co-discoverer of the three dimensional structure of DNA,

1159
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:59,100
was a physicist. Edward Teller was a physicist. Stanislav Ulam was a geometer.

1160
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:10,300
We doomed humanity on Earth. And then we're treating science as if, oh, it's a series of puzzles.

1161
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:14,620
Well, what do you want to work on today? Well, I don't want to be arrogant. I'll just work on

1162
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:22,860
this tiny little problem. And I'm just thinking like, do you not feel any basic responsibility

1163
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:30,380
after Hiroshima and Nagasaki and COVID? All right. Just how crazy are you?

1164
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:33,740
Is that, you know, we've spoken about the interplanetary

1165
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:40,220
challenge. Right. And the fact that physics needs to make some progress in order to facilitate that

1166
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:45,260
if we're going to do it. Yeah. Is, in your opinion, forgetting the fact that chemical

1167
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:53,340
rockets, limitations, all that sort of stuff, is going into planetary as useful. Is it the

1168
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:58,460
highest priority? The highest priority. You cannot stabilize this place.

1169
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:10,700
Just imagine every communalist dream came true. We turned away from fossil fuels towards a,

1170
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:17,020
the greenest new deal you could possibly imagine. All billionaires realized the errors of their ways

1171
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:23,500
and contributed their money to bring up the poorest of the poor. AI was as beneficial as

1172
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:31,100
it could be and only helped humanity to live its dream. Just go full wild, polyana optimism.

1173
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,700
You still can't stabilize it. Why?

1174
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:43,420
Too many people. Not for long. Say more.

1175
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:47,020
Not for long. Population rates, birth rates at the moment.

1176
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:52,860
We're talking at totally different scales. I'm telling you that with

1177
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:59,260
CRISPR-Cas9, with the Teller ULAM design. IVG.

1178
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:08,460
IVG. You know IVG? IVF, but being able to use from any other, yep.

1179
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:13,500
I was trying to think in a different context.

1180
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:18,060
You are going to have

1181
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:29,900
people, what happens when you distribute the coronavirus because everybody's had it? You've

1182
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:38,540
had it? I got an antibody test and I had it, but never felt it. You have this platform,

1183
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:43,340
this viral platform that's spread all over the world and you have the ability to edit it.

1184
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:49,900
Are you telling me that people aren't going to figure out how to come up with fun viruses and

1185
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:53,420
gain a function projects and people are going to be able to do these,

1186
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:59,340
polymerase chain reaction I think was taught in my daughter's high school?

1187
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:05,020
Are you familiar with Nick Bostrom's balls from the urn analogy?

1188
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:05,820
Yeah, vaguely.

1189
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:09,980
Yeah. For the people that don't know, you can imagine that you have an urn and each time that

1190
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:14,940
you make technological progress, you pick a ball out and you don't know what color. Some are white,

1191
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:20,620
perfectly good. Some are gray, a bit of good, a bit of bad and some are all the way down to

1192
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:26,860
black and black is permanent, unrecoverable collapse. And the unrecoverable bit is important.

1193
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:32,060
And each time we just keep picking out balls.

1194
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:37,980
So my take on it is there's already too much leverage, too much leverage, too little wisdom,

1195
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:38,940
too many people.

1196
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:42,700
What was it that you once said, we are gods, but for the wisdom we're just shitty gods?

1197
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:50,620
I don't know if I said the second part, but I guess when I heard the story about this kid who

1198
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:55,980
scavenged the americium from all of these smoke detectors in Brooklyn and built a self-sustaining

1199
01:21:55,980 --> 01:22:01,820
nuclear reactor from these tiny little radioactive strips, you don't know what people's creativity is.

1200
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:08,620
You know, I found it fascinating when I was growing up that I was the only kid who knew

1201
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:16,780
that gunpowder or black powder was 75% potassium nitrate, 10% sulfur, and 15% carbon.

1202
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:28,700
Like you could just make it, you know? And that's the recipe. And that just blew my mind

1203
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:34,380
the rate limiting step was that people didn't know that potassium nitrate was saltpeter or

1204
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:41,820
where to get it, like meat tenderizer. But mostly we're saved from this stuff because nobody's so

1205
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:47,260
sociopathic and competent that they go for these high leverage attacks. That's going to end.

1206
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:52,380
You know, that was like what happened on 9-11. I always wanted to know why were little kids

1207
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:56,540
allowed to go into the cockpit of a plane? You used to be able to meet the pilot. I remember

1208
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:02,700
doing it. Yeah. So that's where we are now is that we've got all this high leverage stuff

1209
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:06,460
and you're going to see nuclear proliferation. Eventually you're going to get some

1210
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:12,780
desperate backed into a corner who says, well, this is my only move. Well, I mean,

1211
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:20,620
for the nuclear concernists out there, at least what I know, wouldn't that be all of us? Everybody

1212
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:26,300
is concerned, but for the people that are nuclear war is a genuine X risk, permanent

1213
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:33,260
unrecoverable collapse. You can set them all off unless there's like 10 to 100 times more than we

1214
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:40,460
think that we have, which they're very well could be. It seems difficult for it to be permanent

1215
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:45,900
unrecoverable collapse for me as a true, true, true, true X risk. May I say something? Yeah.

1216
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:53,180
This is ridiculous. It's bad enough that it would completely transform life as we know it.

1217
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:58,940
You would agree with that. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's time to get serious about

1218
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:04,380
things we can actually do. And the most interesting thing is that nobody's interested

1219
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:11,740
in interplanetary physics. I've never seen anything like it.

1220
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:17,340
Interplanetary physics would be physics in service of us becoming interplanetary,

1221
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:20,460
or is there something specific about the way that planets figure together?

1222
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:27,020
No, no, no. It's about... Let me give you an analogy that's more than an analogy.

1223
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:35,820
Assume that somebody hands you a physical paper map, an enormous one. And you're trying to navigate

1224
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:40,860
it on this table that we have here. You're starting to do motions like this,

1225
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:46,620
where you're moving the paper across the table to get from Los Angeles to Fresno,

1226
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:50,780
California, if it's at the right scale. And it might take you a long time to do that.

1227
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,340
Okay, but now you have somebody trained on an iPad. What are they going to do?

1228
01:24:57,260 --> 01:25:00,380
Well, they might do that, but that's not the key thing they're going to do.

1229
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:07,900
They're going to do what is called multi-touch gestures. And the one that you're thinking of

1230
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:14,540
should be pinch to zoom. So the most natural way to do this is to treat it not as if it's

1231
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:19,420
a paper map, but a stack of paper maps. And you want to go to the one with a different scale.

1232
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:26,460
If you were doing this on an iPad that was mirroring this, the key point is that the paper map

1233
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:34,620
doesn't have an extra dimension to play with. But the pinch to zoom dimension is a scale dimension.

1234
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:40,060
So imagine what you did instead was you looked at your house, you pinched to zoom out,

1235
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:45,500
you then do this motion or whatever it is to get to your friend's house. And then when you land

1236
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:54,700
there, you expand it again. Imagine that you only know about paper maps, but your adversary has an

1237
01:25:54,700 --> 01:26:01,180
iPad. That's what I'm worried about. We're not looking for pinch to zoom.

1238
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:03,980
What would that be in this?

1239
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:12,860
Well, I claim that there are going to be 10 extra coordinates. And four of them

1240
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:19,100
are pinched to zoom. And six of them are what I would call

1241
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:27,740
shear to tilt. So imagine that you have a copy of a picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa on your

1242
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:34,540
iPad. You should be able to do something in paint, which changes the angle. So if you go

1243
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:38,460
into MS Paint, there's this little thing that allows you to change by a particular angle.

1244
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:45,900
But you could do that as a gesture. So my claim is if you have four dimensions of time

1245
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:54,060
and x, y, and z of space, you have pinched to zoom on all four of those. And then for any two

1246
01:26:54,060 --> 01:27:03,820
dimensions like x and z, you have shear to tilt. So the first are the four rulers. And the next

1247
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:07,980
are the six protractors. And that's something called a symmetric two tensor or a metric,

1248
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:12,700
which Einstein knew all about, but he only chose one through his equations. And he let

1249
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:18,140
all the other ones lie fallow. And my claim is I don't think that's where we are. I think that

1250
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:22,860
interplanetary physics is going to involve moving from what we called spacetime to something called

1251
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:30,940
the observers, which contains pinched to zoom and shear to tilt. And you want to get off this

1252
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:34,460
planet, you're not going to get there using general relativity, and you're not going to get

1253
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:38,460
there using the standard model, it's time to take your pacifier out of your mouth and go back to

1254
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:44,620
doing real physics. I think if we were serious about this, we would be struggling with the physics

1255
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:49,660
of the world in which we live, not toy models, we'd be taking massive risks and listening to people

1256
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:55,820
from various perspectives who haven't failed or have not been invited to fully explain their ideas.

1257
01:27:55,820 --> 01:28:02,540
And we'd be looking for things that would be new, new variables, new ways of working with the world

1258
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:09,180
that allowed us to do things that were previously considered inconceivable. So if you look at 1911,

1259
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:13,980
which is when I think Rutherford first starts talking about the neutron as a hypothesis,

1260
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:24,060
it's 41 years later, we have the hydrogen bomb. We can do incredible things that are not possible

1261
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:32,140
yet, because we don't know the framework. And my claim is, if you imagine somebody used to

1262
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:38,300
paper maps being put on an iPad, and not knowing about multi-touch gestures, that is pretty much

1263
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:43,500
an exact analogy of what happens when you do too much general relativity,

1264
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:48,860
is that you start to think in general relativistic terms as if that's the last word.

1265
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:51,180
Einstein would never have put up with that.

1266
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:54,060
That's a question you've mentioned, Einstein, a couple of times today.

1267
01:28:55,820 --> 01:29:02,140
The most famous physicist of all time. How different do you think the landscape of physics

1268
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:08,140
would be had Einstein lived for another decade? Just how good was he?

1269
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:17,100
He was that good. The rare situation in which the man and the myth are roughly at the right level,

1270
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:24,940
the same level. I don't think you could solve the puzzle of theoretical physics

1271
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:30,300
and a final theory before the mid-1970s. We just didn't know enough.

1272
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:39,180
In particular, quarks in 1968, you needed confirmation, because they're not obvious

1273
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:44,620
in the world. They're stuck inside of protons and neutrons. And if you thought that protons

1274
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:51,180
and neutrons were fundamental, you wouldn't be in contention. I would say that the first time

1275
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:59,500
you could really guess the answer would be around 1975. I don't think Einstein was in the position

1276
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:04,940
to guess the answer. I think he was very caught up in a Romanian framework, which is that you

1277
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:10,140
deal only with length, angle, and the curvature of the space in which you live. There's a more

1278
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:16,220
modern viewpoint on this that he could have understood. I don't know to what extent he

1279
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:23,900
showed any recognition of it, but a lot of his thinking was really well suited for the world

1280
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:29,100
in which he lived, where he could do these thought experiments in his mind about falling

1281
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:38,780
elevators or train cars or whatever. You know, Dirac was every bit Einstein's equal.

1282
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:45,260
We don't know how to interact with Dirac, because Dirac was so strange. Einstein kept

1283
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:50,860
throwing off wisdom at an incredible rate. If you read ideas and opinions or out of my later

1284
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:56,860
years, you have an idea of just what a sage this person was, even when he's screwing things up and

1285
01:30:56,860 --> 01:31:05,580
making mistakes. It's all sage-like. Dirac was the singular human being, and occasionally he says

1286
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:13,100
something about life. I think when he was given a Nobel Prize, I think shared with Schrodinger,

1287
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:19,100
he's given two speeches. He uses his lunchtime speech to talk about the bond market and the

1288
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:28,060
importance of using the toolkit of physics within any sphere that is numbers-based.

1289
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:37,580
We don't really know much about Dirac's views on humanity. We know about his beautiful aesthetic

1290
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:48,300
of the quantum. He gave the quantum poetry. I think that right now, it's up to us. They're

1291
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:54,940
not here right now. It's time to make guesses. I'm very partial to an example which happened

1292
01:31:54,940 --> 01:32:01,100
on the Wheel of Fortune program. Fold this into the cutting edge of physics.

1293
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:08,060
Sure. I'm waiting. Okay. There's a guy named Ken Wilson who's discouraged all modern physicists

1294
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:13,180
from making guesses about the ultimate theory because he taught us that you can only observe

1295
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:17,660
the world at the energy scale that you're at. You and I are in a classical world. We don't see

1296
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:26,700
the quantum. On Wheel of Fortune, there was a puzzle. It said, okay, Fraser expression,

1297
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:32,220
there's one apostrophe in the first word with three letters, and it's a long answer,

1298
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:42,780
and person guesses R, and there are no Rs. Then I think that goes to the next woman.

1299
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:49,020
I think she guesses N. Oh, yes, there's one N, and she says, okay, I'd like to solve.

1300
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:56,220
The host looks at her incredulously like, well, I guess you could try to solve. She says,

1301
01:32:57,260 --> 01:33:02,780
I will always remember this. I've got a good feeling about this, and it was right.

1302
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:10,380
You'd never guess that there was enough information for a solve.

1303
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:17,100
Whatever we have is what we've got. It's time to solve the puzzle.

1304
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:18,540
What would that look like?

1305
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:25,660
Ask somebody else. I try to solve this. I've got a theory, but Peter Wojt has a theory.

1306
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:30,700
I'd like to hear what the string theory think their theory is. I'd like to understand where

1307
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:37,020
asymptotic safety is. Everybody who's got a theory, whether it's David Deutch or Julian Barbour

1308
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:43,500
or Garrett Lisey, needs to come to a conference. Somebody needs to hold a conference and say,

1309
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:48,540
who can solve this puzzle? Let's put the sword in the stone, and let's let everybody try to

1310
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:53,580
pull it out, because now is the time. The idea that we're not doing this and that we're letting

1311
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:58,300
this community that has run itself into the ground continue to adjudicate what is physics,

1312
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:07,180
it's like, you boys haven't really done anything in N years. You're not the arbiters of what is

1313
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:12,860
science and what isn't. You've allowed this madness to creep into your university departments.

1314
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:17,740
You're signing loyalty oaths. I have physics professors telling me that their boss is some

1315
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:24,700
dean who writes to them about what they posted on social media. It's like, no, you're the boss.

1316
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:30,780
You, the professors are the soul of the university. Stop sucking your thumb. Stand up for what it is

1317
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:35,180
that you're supposed to be standing up for, which is excellence and research. Kick the people out

1318
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:40,940
who don't belong there, and invite the people in who do, and let's get on with it. It's just,

1319
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:46,700
I couldn't be more angry about anything else in the world. How can you take the lifeboat community,

1320
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:51,260
the only community that can get us a way out of here and run it into the ground?

1321
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:53,420
I like the term the lifeboat community.

1322
01:34:55,260 --> 01:35:02,700
It's time to save everybody, and we've got huge responsibilities. We carry a lot of responsibility

1323
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:06,300
for getting everybody into this mess, and now we've got to offer everybody a way out.

1324
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:13,740
Yeah, it seems, I don't know. I don't know the inner workings or the machinations of the physics

1325
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:21,180
world, but the first time I ever spoke to Sabine Hossenfelder, she explained to me that physics is

1326
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:27,740
as much about politics as it is about physics. In bad eras, that becomes more true. Sabine's

1327
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:33,660
entire career has taken place inside of the stagnation, and she's like one of these

1328
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:38,300
truth-telling people. I think she's basically truthful. I disagree with a lot of stuff that

1329
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:42,620
I don't like that she, I think she does, which is a disservice to the community,

1330
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:46,380
but she is truthful that this community is off the rails.

1331
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:54,060
Moving from physics to something that you mentioned there, poetry, your cover photo on

1332
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:58,540
Twitter was the first thing that we actually ever connected about long, long, long time ago,

1333
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:04,620
and I'd just been to the Sagrada Familia. So I went for the first time to a wedding,

1334
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:08,780
a friend's wedding that he was holding on the outskirts, and it was very enjoyable.

1335
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:16,620
I had known about this building, I had read about it, I had seen all of the videos,

1336
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:22,140
and it's your cover photo. First off, why? And then secondly, what does it mean to you?

1337
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:28,220
What does this Sagrada Familia mean to you? I'm dying to hear, obviously we know it's important

1338
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:31,500
in my life. I don't know whether it had an importance in yours.

1339
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:39,340
Beyond beauty, no. It has no greater meaning to me than that. But one of the lessons that I did

1340
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:48,540
learn was, there's that quote about humanity will flourish when men plant trees under which

1341
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:52,860
they will never sit, something along those lines. And that's the first time that I've ever seen

1342
01:36:53,820 --> 01:37:02,300
a purely joyful expression, architecturally, artistically, that was created with the intense

1343
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:09,740
intent purpose that that would be the end goal, that this is a, where are we at now,

1344
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:16,220
in construction, 70 years, nearly 100 now? How many? I don't know. But it's a lot.

1345
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:19,740
Still going. Yeah. So it's not done. And I think it's-

1346
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:23,740
And we can't even figure out what his vision is. So we've allowed other people

1347
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:27,580
to put their vision- Step in and- Yeah. Because there's only one of him,

1348
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:32,860
Gaudi. Okay. The ceiling of that thing, to me, is transcendence.

1349
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:45,340
You can't even believe it's real. There are things in this world

1350
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:52,620
that remind you of the transcendent in all of us, that it's possible.

1351
01:37:58,220 --> 01:38:04,940
I can think of particular pieces of music or poems or pieces of architecture. I was just

1352
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:12,860
inside the blue mosque in Istanbul, which is a few feet from Hagia Sophia. And the

1353
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:19,660
interior of these two structures just are mind-blowing. And La Sagrada Familia,

1354
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:21,660
I mean, these are religions that I'm not a part of.

1355
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:30,540
If you're talking about the sacred family and you have a skylights to heaven,

1356
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:36,700
how better to honor the creator, whether the creator exists or not,

1357
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:45,980
than with genius and elegance and grace and humility and arrogance and everything that

1358
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:49,820
went into that ceiling. That ceiling is like nothing else I've ever seen.

1359
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:57,420
And you can touch- Sam Harris is famous for saying that you can either learn how to meditate

1360
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:01,340
or I can give you a few micrograms of the substance and you're gonna have a profound

1361
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:07,180
experience. Well, okay, just getting back from Sao Miguel and the Azores,

1362
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:14,460
you could take LSD or DMT or you could go to Sao Miguel. I mean, it's just crazy

1363
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:21,580
that there is that much beauty on earth. And I guess that space is something that I wanted

1364
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:25,900
people to understand. When I named the show the portal and people did not understand,

1365
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:31,260
it wasn't intended to be a show. It's intended to be a search for the actual portal out of here.

1366
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:39,100
It's an attempt to find pinch to zoom. I believe that we are not doomed here,

1367
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:47,500
but that we have developed this very weird focus on psychology. To challenge Einstein

1368
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:56,140
is almost seen as arrogance. And yet, if Einstein is to survive as a legacy,

1369
01:39:56,940 --> 01:40:03,580
it's only going to be because somebody basically undermined general relativity status as a

1370
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:11,340
fundamental theory because we're not going to make it. And I'm trying to remind people

1371
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:18,780
in a world that now, like you can look up on Twitter, say lone genius theory,

1372
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:22,060
people don't believe in the lone genius theory.

1373
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:30,700
Well, then what was Gaudi? What was Dirac? What was Einstein? What was Yang?

1374
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:38,620
What was Emmy Nerder? Somebody tell me why I have all of these lone geniuses in my life.

1375
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:43,500
And aren't we supposed to be doing that and thinking that that's admirable?

1376
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:52,940
I think we're supposed to be building the theory that can realize that the ceiling

1377
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:58,860
of La Crada Familia is a portal. We're supposed to inspire ourselves with beauty and luxury.

1378
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:04,220
We're not supposed to consume it to pig out for status reasons. We're supposed to get ourselves

1379
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:11,260
into a state where we can dream at an interplanetary level. A lot of the things that we've spoken about

1380
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:17,420
today are to do with cerebral horsepower, cognition, the difficult things that need

1381
01:41:17,420 --> 01:41:21,340
to be done in the head. And yet you're talking here about the transcendent. You're talking about

1382
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:26,620
something which is embodied, which is spiritual by whichever definition of the word you want to use.

1383
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:33,260
Do you find in yourself as somebody who does rely on cerebral horsepower for a lot of the

1384
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:39,420
things that you try to do and presumably takes pride in your ability to have workout problems,

1385
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:46,300
have thoughts? Do you feel attention in yourself between the transcendent, the relinquishing,

1386
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:53,260
the embodied, and the cerebral, the cognitive, the purposeful on that side?

1387
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:59,260
You know, I have a dumb expression which I don't use in public and I'm sure I'll be castigated for it.

1388
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:02,540
Yeah, brilliant. But it's head, heart, and loins.

1389
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:12,060
If it doesn't speak to your head, heart, and your loins, leave it for someone else.

1390
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:14,140
What's that mean? How do you enact that?

1391
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:19,260
You have to try to realize that these things have to be balanced and tempered.

1392
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:26,700
You don't want to live by your heart. Just every time, you know, you see a daffodil blowing its

1393
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:31,180
seeds into the wind, you'll be transported and you'll stop paying your electric bills.

1394
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:36,380
And you don't want to be led around by your loins. That's not going to end well.

1395
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:39,580
And you don't want to be led around by your head, too, because then you'll get yourself

1396
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:43,100
into one of these cul-de-sacs and you won't even realize that you can't think your way out of it.

1397
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:46,060
You were given all of these facilities and motivations.

1398
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:48,460
How do you pull yourself from head to heart?

1399
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:56,220
Well, you brought this guitar.

1400
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:58,300
A Gitalely.

1401
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:58,940
A Gitalely.

1402
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:01,100
It's just on your right. Grab it. Show it to everybody.

1403
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:07,580
So I don't, I do not play the Gitalely.

1404
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:11,100
I don't think anybody actually technically does play the Gitalely.

1405
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,340
It's like a guitar that's too small for your fingers.

1406
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:15,180
Yes. You've got your pixel in it.

1407
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:22,380
So you take some piece of music that actually means something to you, right?

1408
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:28,220
And one thing that I remember hearing when I was growing up was this.

1409
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:42,300
So it's the Asturias of Isaac Albanese. It was originally written for piano.

1410
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:48,780
And you see sort of these things on Ud where you have a tremolo.

1411
01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:52,780
You've got two, two fingers playing the open B string,

1412
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:55,180
and then you've got this melody which is played with the thumb.

1413
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:06,220
So the combination of these things produces this different effect.

1414
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:12,460
I can't really get my fingers in there.

1415
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:17,660
And then I started thinking about, okay, well, that's a great effect.

1416
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:20,860
What if we tried to write and to create using the same idea?

1417
01:44:20,860 --> 01:44:21,420
And I started,

1418
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:24,540
so.

1419
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:51,660
So that's not the same song, but it's using some of the same techniques about

1420
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:56,380
just getting these things to ring out and to get the melody going on the bass line.

1421
01:44:57,180 --> 01:45:01,980
And then you have to forget this. Now, you know, if I was able to play this properly,

1422
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:06,380
and I'm sorry if I'm embarrassing myself, you're trying to do this thing where you're

1423
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:16,460
recognizing that the transcendent lives in particular structures,

1424
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:22,380
that they elicit this feeling, and that we have this opportunity to go back and forth

1425
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:26,460
between the analytic description. If I'm thinking about this, I can't really feel it.

1426
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:31,500
And if I'm feeling it, I can't really figure out how to use it or think about it or compose with it.

1427
01:45:32,140 --> 01:45:38,700
And so, you know, to me, what we're trying to do is we're trying to

1428
01:45:39,020 --> 01:45:49,180
camp and de-camp. Well, that spoke to my head and my loins, but it didn't speak to my heart.

1429
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:56,700
Or that spoke to two out of three. We need ultimately to be fully embodied. And that's a

1430
01:45:56,700 --> 01:46:00,700
challenge. And we have to, we either accept the challenge or we don't accept the challenge.

1431
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:04,460
And we have to go back and forth between these lenses. You can't necessarily

1432
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:10,060
be in the same, you know, if you see your child and you're a physician or surgeon,

1433
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:16,220
you could see your child as a bunch of tissue hooked up to itself, you know? And that's important

1434
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:20,460
if you're hiking and you're in a bad spot, you actually have to do an operation on your child.

1435
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:27,020
But it's a terrible way to put your child to sleep when you're reading a bedtime story.

1436
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:35,660
Is there a, is there a challenge that people are facing at the moment with

1437
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:47,500
an over-reliance on a brain-based economy, an unlimited amount of information at your

1438
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:58,220
fingertips with Wikipedia and chat UPT for them to struggle to find something transcendent when

1439
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:03,340
it can be broken down into its component parts and explained by somebody who understands the child

1440
01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:08,220
as a connection of ligaments, organs and blood vessels as opposed to as the beautiful progeny

1441
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:15,340
of the person looking at them? Well, keep in mind that there are people who can weave poetry

1442
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:20,460
through their description of something very technical. Herman Vile, for example, wrote in a

1443
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:26,860
very Olympian fashion about abstract algebra. He talked about the homosexuality of certain

1444
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:31,340
symbols as filiating with themselves, you know? Completely crazy.

1445
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:32,700
Ultrogyn arithmetic.

1446
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:41,100
And, you know, there are people who just write beautifully. I think that Jim Watson,

1447
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:45,660
who may be a son of a bitch on many fronts, is one of the great writers in the English language

1448
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:52,700
if you read the double helix. It's an incredible narrative from one of the most memorable first

1449
01:47:52,700 --> 01:48:04,620
sentences to the conclusion. We need the Carl Sagan's to animate our head and our hearts

1450
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:10,140
at the same time. Do you think there is an over-reliance on head at the moment?

1451
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:16,140
I'm worried that our head, heart and loins are all disengaged.

1452
01:48:18,620 --> 01:48:21,020
So what do you use if you're not using any of those?

1453
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:22,140
I use them all.

1454
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:24,380
No, but what are the people using who are not using those?

1455
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:29,100
They're not watching what's happening to them. They're being denatured by their phones.

1456
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:35,500
Your phone is not a phone. It is a very, it's an environment.

1457
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:41,500
You know, you pick it up and suddenly you're some place that you don't realize

1458
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:47,180
isn't relative to your physical surroundings. You get very angry that you get a text message

1459
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:52,940
while you're driving and you try responding to it. Well, you're going 45 miles an hour in a

1460
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:59,340
several hundred pound or a thousand pound vehicle. You've lost track of where you are.

1461
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:07,900
Our phone is, you know, and I talk to people about the crisis in pornography.

1462
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:17,580
The only fans movement, the pornographic stuff that you're seeing, people are not getting easily

1463
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:25,980
excited and aroused inside of any kind of context. Like the erotic is taking it on the chin, I think.

1464
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:32,780
I think that's really important to remember that eroticism, for example,

1465
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:38,620
is at least a combination of the loins in the head and it bests the heart as well.

1466
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:46,060
What you're starting to see is people can't actually derive excitement from normal stimuli

1467
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:50,380
that has to do with falling in love or having children or, you know.

1468
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:55,500
So you're talking about an ever-escalating stimulus that people require to get the same

1469
01:49:55,500 --> 01:50:00,700
arousal response. And they can't. Yeah, Mary Harrington calls this one of her three

1470
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:05,020
laws of porno dynamics. It's the law of fap entropy that whatever you start out wanking to

1471
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:14,060
will get progressively more extreme over time. Well, what's the cure for that? Something high end.

1472
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:24,700
You could just try to do it all on loins. Show me something where my psychogenic arousal gets

1473
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:29,740
greater and greater because I've never seen that and holy cow is that far out. Or you could say,

1474
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:34,300
you know, it's more like a cob-douglas utility function. You're going to have to bring this

1475
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:40,060
down to my level. Multiple inputs. In other words, if I could offer you only food or only water,

1476
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:47,100
that would not work. You'd rather, if you have a lot of food, have a little water to complement it

1477
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:51,020
because that water becomes that much more valuable. Or if you have a ton of liquids and you have no

1478
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:55,260
nourishment, you probably want really value a little bit of food. Well, in my opinion,

1479
01:50:55,980 --> 01:51:03,340
part of what we need is we need more things that reward us when we're integrating rather

1480
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:11,180
than when we're extra-mising. Get back to that discussion about technology, not only fracturing

1481
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:17,340
our attention, but also fracturing our experience. There seems to be a wistfulness, not just in the

1482
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:22,700
dating realm, but in the experiential realm for a bygone time where we felt connected to the things

1483
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:30,300
that we do. And it's interesting for someone of my age, I'm 35, so I'm like slap bang in the middle

1484
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:35,580
of the millennials. So I remember a time before ubiquity of iPhones, before internet,

1485
01:51:35,580 --> 01:51:41,100
but there was like there's a whimsy of childhood in any case, and me being able to

1486
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:47,500
tear those two apart is kind of difficult. But I definitely think that when I read history,

1487
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:52,860
when I read Ryan Holiday, for instance, and I think about Zeno Obsidian walking around the

1488
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:59,980
Stoa Poíclei, where I've been, and I'm there, and I think about the degree of connection to the

1489
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:06,380
experience. What is technology and what are our smartphones doing to our ability to connect?

1490
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:10,380
So they're changing our, our wetwear. We're not,

1491
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:19,340
if you can have 12 life-changing experiences in the space of a minute and none of them are yours,

1492
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:22,140
what do you think that's going to do to your mind?

1493
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:29,580
You know, at some point I was in an oculus situation. I was deep underwater in a blue whale

1494
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:36,780
swam past me. Well, none of that actually happened, but it felt like it did. Or you know,

1495
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:44,460
that you can do this nuclear explosion on Henderson Island in oculus. That's just a more immersive

1496
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:55,340
phone. And look, you have to be, you know, that's one of the things about La Sagrada Familia.

1497
01:52:56,060 --> 01:53:01,740
You go in there and it's real. You see the Grand Canyon and it is actually grand.

1498
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:09,820
You know, there's certain things that don't easily live up to their billing. I think I went to

1499
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:16,380
Pamukkalei in Turkey years ago, which Pamukk means cotton and Kalei, I guess, castles. It was a cotton

1500
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:23,180
castles of mineral deposits and they formed these pools. And there weren't enough pools and there

1501
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:27,180
were way too many people. So it was like one of those moments where the tourists have totally

1502
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:33,740
destroyed the natural attraction. Okay, but I went into the blue mosque and it was every bit as

1503
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:36,780
mind-blowing as it was the last time I was there 30 years ago.

1504
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:41,580
It's the same way that I feel every single time I step into the Vatican, every single time.

1505
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:43,980
Every single time. And I've been there three times now.

1506
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:45,100
I've been there three times.

1507
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:52,380
And it's just holy cow. Well, I shouldn't have said that. Anyway, very good. I didn't mean to.

1508
01:53:55,420 --> 01:54:00,540
Yeah, you have to, there have to be things that you actually viscerally relate to that stop you,

1509
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:05,900
like the Bach cello sweets. How many times have I heard the Bach or whole lot of love

1510
01:54:06,860 --> 01:54:13,100
could do it either way? Or you shook me all night long, you know? That's holy. You shook me all night

1511
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:18,300
long is a transcendent song.

1512
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:29,020
It's less transcendent if you see it as part of a 60-second TikTok montage.

1513
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:32,540
No, because the schmah is transcended and that'll fit right in there.

1514
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:39,900
Can't hit that.

1515
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:53,500
That's prayer.

1516
01:55:00,620 --> 01:55:05,500
You know, if that doesn't move you, you need to check into some place.

1517
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:13,420
Those four notes recur in all of these songs that matter. It's basically Mary had a little

1518
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:21,020
lamb with pho thrown in as well. You know, and I bring up this example. My wife was watching

1519
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:25,820
a film. I didn't want to watch it, but some chick flick. And it all hovers around this one scene

1520
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:31,900
where this guy drags this girl into a music store because he can't afford a piano.

1521
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:41,820
He goes, I don't know you, but I want you. Going up to that fourth.

1522
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:51,180
All the more for that. And I was transfixed. I could not continue to do my calculations.

1523
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:56,540
Like, what the hell is this movie? So those four notes is a great place to ground yourself.

1524
01:55:56,540 --> 01:56:02,940
And there's a reason that they work. The second note brings up in your mind the

1525
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:11,260
thing called the fifth, the dominant chord. The first note is spread between the tonic and the

1526
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:15,980
subdominant. The third note belongs to the tonic only and the fourth note only belongs to the

1527
01:56:15,980 --> 01:56:22,060
subdominant. And so this idea that Western harmony revolves around these ideas of the

1528
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:27,260
tonic, the subdominant, the dominant are carried by these notes. So even if you're not playing it

1529
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:35,740
on a chordal instrument, that this pattern of four notes that keeps recurring grabs us because we

1530
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:42,620
know what the chords are behind it. And it's basically Mary had a little lamb or proud Mary,

1531
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:49,020
you know, but that's a great place to start for transcendence. Just check on something really

1532
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:58,540
simple, whether you're feeling it. All and dread to emotions that I miss in my life.

1533
01:56:58,540 --> 01:57:03,820
Same one. So when I look up at the night sky, I get it in equal dosages. Oh, good.

1534
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:08,060
You know, when it's good, I've been out to Joshua Tree, taking an edible,

1535
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:13,740
didn't need the edible at all. That was unnecessary amplification. You know, we're having this

1536
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:20,380
discussion in the middle of the Perseids meteor shower. No. I highly recommend get yourself

1537
01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:24,700
to a place where there's no light pollution and lay on your back right before dawn, you'll have a

1538
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:31,660
blast. Oh, and but the awe and the dread is very much there. Yes. And I don't know, it makes you

1539
01:57:31,660 --> 01:57:38,540
feel insignificant in a way I think that keeps your ego small and helps to recenter your.

1540
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:43,980
Do you want your ego small? Have you been told that was a good thing?

1541
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:48,460
I've been told that it's a good thing. I would say for me,

1542
01:57:52,460 --> 01:57:59,660
remembering finitude and not insignificance, but the

1543
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:07,420
temporary nature of our time here, the vastness of what is going to go on, the things that have

1544
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:14,620
come before the things that will come after the scale. Yeah. I think that it grounds me. I struggle

1545
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:21,500
to get into my head to describe the thing that is almost exclusively in heart and lines. And

1546
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:27,980
it makes me feel good when I do that. And yet I find myself, I've got emails to do.

1547
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:33,100
I heard this term the other day, John Lovell, Warrior Poet Society said the tyranny of the urgent.

1548
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:39,100
And fuck, I love that. The tyranny of the urgent.

1549
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:42,460
You're familiar with this concept of bathos? No.

1550
01:58:43,340 --> 01:58:50,700
The alternation between the transcendent and the mundane and the pressing. We will conquer

1551
01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:59,340
the cosmos, but I have to pick up my dry clean. Yeah, I think that there is that tyranny,

1552
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:05,980
but I also want to just talk about arrogance and humility. I meet too many people who have

1553
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:11,260
one without the other. And I see all these discussions online about so and so has this

1554
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:18,060
beautiful epistemic humility or somebody else's, you know, preposterously arrogant or whatever.

1555
01:59:19,180 --> 01:59:25,580
And I sort of sit and wonder at this discussion. You want both.

1556
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:31,180
What is humility without arrogance?

1557
01:59:33,420 --> 01:59:33,660
Well,

1558
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:40,780
you know who I think actually had this in kind of pretty decent balance that was on display

1559
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:45,660
for the world to see was Khabib Nurmagomedov.

1560
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:52,700
What an unbelievably good example. Right. So tell me how it lands for you.

1561
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:58,140
Khabib is very, very high on a list of people that I would love to speak to.

1562
01:59:58,140 --> 02:00:03,900
And you hear that Khabib? Listen, Khabib, if anybody in Dagestan has got Khabib's email address,

1563
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:08,060
please tell him to get in touch. Okay. This is fascinating to me.

1564
02:00:08,060 --> 02:00:16,300
So the more, I'll do a timeline of it. So Conor McGregor, very seductive,

1565
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:23,260
very obviously seductive, working class, the Irish hate to be told that they're a part of the UK.

1566
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:27,820
They're not, they're near, you know, close enough. It's like an adopted son type thing.

1567
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:35,900
Okay. And I'm thinking God disguised like a savant of war and artistry as he's coming up.

1568
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:42,220
And then he beats Chad Mander's and it's a war as a fight. And then he's crying.

1569
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:48,220
And then he does the other side of it. And he's doing with Ida Potal. He's balancing

1570
02:00:49,020 --> 02:00:57,180
in the middle of maybe Vegas or California somewhere on a walking rail, on a side rail.

1571
02:00:58,140 --> 02:01:02,860
And he's, I think Nate Diaz accused him of playing touch butt with that dork in the park.

1572
02:01:03,740 --> 02:01:07,340
And he's doing handstands and he's got this sort of fluidity to him.

1573
02:01:07,340 --> 02:01:13,580
And then there's this amazing interview that was clipped and put in perfectly of

1574
02:01:14,780 --> 02:01:19,660
a journalist reciting back to Conor what he said before the Aldo fight. And he said,

1575
02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:24,700
at the press conference, I saw his right hand shaking. That was a subtle tell for me.

1576
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:28,300
He's going to overload with that right hand. And when he thinks I will be that I will not,

1577
02:01:28,300 --> 02:01:32,220
I will create gaps within that octagon. He will fall into those gaps. And that is when I will

1578
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:36,540
strike. And then there's a clip of him backstage before he's about to fight.

1579
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:40,300
And he's bouncing backwards and forwards in that sort of long karate stance that he does.

1580
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:44,620
And he steps back and he throws that left hook practicing and they placed it in time

1581
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:50,060
with the fight. Amazing. And it's the same move. And this guy says, you said these things,

1582
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:57,180
recites that thing post fight. How'd you do that? How'd you do that? And Conor talks about if you

1583
02:01:57,180 --> 02:02:01,420
have the bravery enough to speak it and the courage enough to be able to pursue it then.

1584
02:02:01,580 --> 02:02:08,940
And I'm just fucking enthralled by this guy. I got put onto a reality TV show in my 20s

1585
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:14,060
that we had no internet, no contact with friends or family or any sort of news.

1586
02:02:14,060 --> 02:02:17,420
And it turned out that while I was there, I think it was Rafael Dasaños,

1587
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:21,980
it was injured. So I was terrified I was going to miss McGregor's fight,

1588
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:28,620
because that's how inspiring it was to me. And then there's this talk of this guy,

1589
02:02:28,620 --> 02:02:35,900
this other fighter, unbeaten, undefeated. And it's the Bane Batman type scenario,

1590
02:02:35,900 --> 02:02:41,340
at least that's the model that I had in my mind. And I'm like, you know, you've got the almost the

1591
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:46,780
Rocky versus who was the Russian guy that he's training for in the fight? No.

1592
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:53,420
Who's the Russian guy that Conor fights? The Rocky fights, sorry.

1593
02:02:54,300 --> 02:03:03,580
Yes, I'm Dragov. So it's almost that, right? You've got this training in the mountains and

1594
02:03:03,580 --> 02:03:11,900
chopping wood. And then there's the Dolly, Conor throws the Dolly, and you start to see,

1595
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:16,860
that was the first time I really took notice of Khabib. And you remember that video?

1596
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:20,620
Send me location. Send me location. Just tell me where.

1597
02:03:21,420 --> 02:03:26,220
Send me location. And there's a number of tribute videos called the location,

1598
02:03:26,220 --> 02:03:33,100
it's about with a K, about Khabib. I'm like, fucking hell. This guy is something else.

1599
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:41,260
This guy is real. Correct. Conor McGregor was spread between real and fake.

1600
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:51,740
Right. The showmanship was a part of, it was backed up, particularly by his striking,

1601
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:57,580
by his ability to sense his opponent, sort of almost using your antenna.

1602
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:07,420
But I really believe that in part, trying to get into your opponent's head with somebody,

1603
02:04:07,660 --> 02:04:15,180
I really wonder whether Westerners have any idea of what happens in places like Central

1604
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:18,540
and Eastern Europe, when you start talking about somebody's mother.

1605
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:31,900
I had this really bad cultural reaction, which is that there are people who are bought into the

1606
02:04:31,900 --> 02:04:40,700
whole trash talking thing. And if it had been like, I don't know, Conor McGregor versus,

1607
02:04:40,700 --> 02:04:43,420
and I don't know how to pronounce it, Child Sonan or something like that.

1608
02:04:43,420 --> 02:04:48,860
Yes, Child Sonan, yeah. It's a fag game. Yeah, they're both accepting the game.

1609
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:52,620
And with Khabib, I just had this other thought of like,

1610
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:58,620
have you never met anyone from Dagestan before? Yeah. Like anyone from Dagestan. It's not just

1611
02:04:58,620 --> 02:05:06,860
Khabib. It's so bad. Have you ever done improv? No. Well, inadvertently.

1612
02:05:07,820 --> 02:05:14,220
In improv classes, there's something called punking the game. Okay. And let's say that we're in a

1613
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:18,780
circle and we're supposed to whoosh, we pass energy around whoosh, and you can go boing,

1614
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:22,620
and it goes back the other way, and you can like send it across and stuff. There's only one rule.

1615
02:05:22,620 --> 02:05:29,660
One rule is don't punk the game. Punking the game is like not playing by the rules.

1616
02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:34,540
Game rejection. Yes. And what you see is Conor playing a game of tennis,

1617
02:05:34,540 --> 02:05:41,260
and he keeps on serving this ball across. And I saw it 100% from Khabib's perspective.

1618
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:45,100
Not only does the ball not come back across the net, he doesn't even have the racket in his hand.

1619
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:48,380
You know, he's there. He's got to be there. There's obligations to be done.

1620
02:05:49,340 --> 02:05:56,540
And it was that series of press conferences that really made me fall in love with Khabib,

1621
02:05:56,540 --> 02:06:02,860
and then how it gets me emotional thinking about, thinking about his tribute to his father.

1622
02:06:02,860 --> 02:06:06,220
I'm telling you, I can't see it from Conor's perspective.

1623
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:08,860
Of why you would behave in that way?

1624
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:16,460
Two seconds facing this guy is not a question of fear. It's a question of respect.

1625
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:23,260
Maybe I just don't get it. But I spend enough time, I have spent enough time

1626
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:29,500
in, I don't know, the north of India or the center of Turkey or places in Egypt,

1627
02:06:30,940 --> 02:06:34,700
or Ukraine or Russia, wherever. You don't...

1628
02:06:37,420 --> 02:06:41,900
I can tell the internet's gonna completely tell me I don't get it. You don't do this stuff.

1629
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:47,980
You just don't. It's like, I can't explain to people who are convinced that the internet is

1630
02:06:47,980 --> 02:06:54,380
the gift to prove that dunking and dragging is man's highest function. There's so much stuff you

1631
02:06:54,380 --> 02:07:00,620
don't do. And this whole move towards like anonymity and let's make fun of everybody and

1632
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:09,900
everything because mockery is good. This way, this is the direction to madness.

1633
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:17,180
I certainly think that, Peterson said this a while ago, one of the main problems with Twitter is

1634
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:23,820
it's driven the proximate price of being a prick down to zero. Sure. And the combination of real

1635
02:07:23,820 --> 02:07:29,340
people and unnamed accounts and bot farms and the inability to work out whether it's been said in

1636
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:34,620
earnest or said in a... Or whether it's been coordinated so that 100,000 people go off at

1637
02:07:34,620 --> 02:07:41,900
once on the exactly the same point. Getting back to the issue of arrogance and humility, what is

1638
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:57,660
Khabib? Competent, unwavering, humble. He's both arrogant and humble.

1639
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:07,260
And you have to look at the move that he does when you compliment him. What does he do?

1640
02:08:07,740 --> 02:08:17,740
Alhamdulillah, right? Or Mashallah or something with the name Allah in it. It's like, I give you

1641
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:24,700
this praise. Oh, no, no, no. It's not for me. It's for the God, all for my father or for my father.

1642
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:33,580
And so this issue about... This is a beautiful thing when you have Muslim friends is that they

1643
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:43,980
learn to deflect all of this positivity out. If they're getting it, they deflect it

1644
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:48,620
so that they don't keep it and they don't become insufferable. On the other hand,

1645
02:08:49,260 --> 02:08:54,140
if they're extraordinary at what they do, they know that they're extraordinary at what they do.

1646
02:08:54,140 --> 02:08:59,420
Khabib is under no illusions as to how good he is. He set the highest standards for himself.

1647
02:08:59,420 --> 02:09:01,660
Tomorrow night, I'm going to smash your boy.

1648
02:09:04,940 --> 02:09:11,660
He is simultaneously... You said competent. It just wasn't fair to him.

1649
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:25,660
He's way beyond competent. I guess I just want people to realize that you need arrogance to stand

1650
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:33,660
up against insuperable odds. And you need humility to stop your arrogance from driving you insane.

1651
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:40,380
And to keep asking that people be constantly humble is an affront to what we are as humans.

1652
02:09:40,380 --> 02:09:49,660
I really don't grasp it. You need that deep humility, 100%. But so many people need arrogance

1653
02:09:49,660 --> 02:09:54,300
in order to take on the challenges that they could... If you took the world seriously,

1654
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:57,020
you'd never take on those challenges if you were just humble.

1655
02:09:58,620 --> 02:10:06,140
Yes. One of my favorite clips of Khabib, post-fighting, post-career,

1656
02:10:07,660 --> 02:10:13,420
he's doing an interview and talking about the training camps, the gym that he looks after,

1657
02:10:13,420 --> 02:10:19,100
and some of the fighters that are there. And I think they train six days or six and a half days

1658
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:24,620
a week. And he tells them they need to get up. Some of the guys complain and he says,

1659
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:30,300
it's okay. You go home, your mom, she'll tuck you into bed at night, she will cook you dinner

1660
02:10:30,300 --> 02:10:35,420
and tomorrow, you'll be comfortable. But that's not why you're here.

1661
02:10:36,460 --> 02:10:42,060
Put that coffee down. Do you know coffee is for closers?

1662
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:48,380
Ah, yes. Yes. Good reference. Your name's Lavie. You call yourself a salesman,

1663
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:54,620
you son of a bitch? I just love... I really, really love this.

1664
02:10:56,140 --> 02:11:01,660
I had a conversation last week and I was told a quote,

1665
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:06,380
self-love is holding yourself to a higher standard than anybody else.

1666
02:11:08,220 --> 02:11:14,300
You know, I'll be honest with you, I get tired of these things. I think that there's a lot of men

1667
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:20,780
in particular looking for simple answers. And all of these things fall flat for me.

1668
02:11:22,620 --> 02:11:27,660
They're front-loaded because they simplify things. Imagine that that's all that self-love was.

1669
02:11:28,860 --> 02:11:34,220
Well, then I'd have a definition. But it's not going to work. And I think that this is one of

1670
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:40,540
the things that I don't know how to fight exactly is that we're in a world that's convinced that

1671
02:11:40,540 --> 02:11:47,900
the truth must be simple. And all of these simple truths don't survive the collider that is

1672
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:55,260
modern social media. So I don't disagree. The problem with a truth which is boundlessly complex

1673
02:11:55,260 --> 02:12:01,580
is that functionally, it's useless. And I'm so glad you made this point. That's the puzzle.

1674
02:12:02,780 --> 02:12:07,900
We're now in a world where to do the nuance is to get yourself tangled because the internet

1675
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:15,020
is not friendly to nuance. On the other hand, to say something simply and crisply leads you into

1676
02:12:16,140 --> 02:12:20,300
disappointing everyone who's believed in you. And you know, we were talking before a little

1677
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:25,020
bit about Christopher Hitchens. Yes. Tell me about your thoughts on Hitch. I asked Sam this

1678
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:29,020
question. Sam spent a good bit of time with him. What would the modern culture be like if Hitch

1679
02:12:29,020 --> 02:12:36,140
was still alive? Hitch, I think, would have been forced to either self incinerate or

1680
02:12:38,140 --> 02:12:43,100
adapt. And I'm not sure what you would have done. What self incineration in this context?

1681
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:49,420
One of the things that makes Christopher Hitchens a hero to so many people, almost oddly a secular

1682
02:12:49,420 --> 02:12:58,220
saint, if you will, is that he held the promise that one could simply stand in some place that was

1683
02:12:58,220 --> 02:13:06,060
reasonable and hold forth from that simple perspective like, yep, there is nothing to Islam.

1684
02:13:06,060 --> 02:13:09,020
It is nonsense. It might be something he would say, or you might say,

1685
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:17,180
you know, free speech is absolute and you have every right to say anything you want. And I have

1686
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:23,020
every right to say and the better ideas will prevail. Now you watch what's happened with Sam

1687
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:30,860
and this question of Trump. Sam perceives Trump to be an asymmetric existential threat

1688
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:37,580
and was willing to go and back the idea that the Hunter Biden laptop story

1689
02:13:38,780 --> 02:13:46,380
might not have benefited the election. And he's lost an enormous number of people who otherwise

1690
02:13:46,380 --> 02:13:50,460
agree with him. And now what's the reasoning? The reasoning and something I, oddly, I,

1691
02:13:51,260 --> 02:13:56,620
first time I met Sam, I went on his show to warn him that you can't just optimize for truth.

1692
02:13:57,340 --> 02:14:03,020
You have to optimize. I said, I have four variables I can't live without. Truth, meaning, fitness and

1693
02:14:03,020 --> 02:14:10,620
grace. So Trump is a fitness puzzle to Sam, which is if we allow Trump to destroy the country

1694
02:14:10,620 --> 02:14:15,820
in Sam's mind, then we've lost fitness. There's no, there's no point in being truthful.

1695
02:14:15,900 --> 02:14:22,380
And then there's a question about what is the meaning? Do you destroy the meaning of a democracy

1696
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:27,020
when you hold back information? Maybe you do. Maybe it no longer feels like it's an actual

1697
02:14:27,020 --> 02:14:32,700
democracy. What is the graceful thing to do? What is the just and right thing to do?

1698
02:14:35,500 --> 02:14:39,180
I am convinced that some of Hitch's positions

1699
02:14:39,660 --> 02:14:47,980
were attractive because he was using his big brain to suggest that life could be lived simply.

1700
02:14:50,620 --> 02:14:55,420
If we were just strong enough of character, if we were clear enough of thought,

1701
02:14:55,420 --> 02:14:59,740
we could espouse something like free speech or reason, and it would be enough.

1702
02:15:00,140 --> 02:15:07,820
Without requiring that we hold it up to a higher power.

1703
02:15:07,820 --> 02:15:13,740
Or that you get caught in some very serious situation where you're in an edge case.

1704
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:19,820
Free speech does not exist in an absolute forum under American law.

1705
02:15:21,660 --> 02:15:28,940
It just doesn't. We mentioned Miller versus California, which was a sort of a

1706
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:34,620
follow-on decision to memoirs versus Massachusetts. You don't have a right

1707
02:15:35,980 --> 02:15:42,940
to broadcast pornography because pornography does not enjoy First Amendment protection.

1708
02:15:43,900 --> 02:15:49,020
Now, how do you discern that pornography doesn't? Well, the justices claim that it doesn't.

1709
02:15:49,580 --> 02:15:54,780
And there's a three-factor test for what is pornography, which was, I believe,

1710
02:15:54,780 --> 02:16:00,700
attenuated under something called memoirs versus Massachusetts, but that was not allowed to stand.

1711
02:16:00,700 --> 02:16:08,940
You're not allowed to necessarily endanger troop movements by blabbing information in a war.

1712
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:13,900
You're not able to slander or libel. There are all sorts of adjustments to free speech.

1713
02:16:15,260 --> 02:16:21,820
And when you come at one of these perspectives from an absolutist frame of mind,

1714
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:27,020
you have to hope that you're not going to meet the edge case. A good example for me was the Second

1715
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:34,940
Amendment. I noticed that many Second Amendment types took an absolutist perspective, saying the

1716
02:16:34,940 --> 02:16:39,100
right to keep and bear arms will not be infringed and don't bother me about a well-regulated

1717
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:44,700
militia. I said, okay, I'm not going to talk to you about a well-regulated militia. My question

1718
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:49,500
is, should the Davy Crockett be sold at K-Mark? And they would often say, well, what's the Davy

1719
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:57,900
Crockett? And I said, well, it's about 100-pound personal nuke. Well, first of all, I was very

1720
02:16:58,460 --> 02:17:02,780
flabbergasted that a lot of gun enthusiasts did not know that there was a personal nuke developed

1721
02:17:02,780 --> 02:17:10,060
by the United States. But then immediately, many of them saw where this was going, which is, okay,

1722
02:17:10,060 --> 02:17:16,540
if we're going to restrict personal nukes at K-Mark, then you've got your foot in the door,

1723
02:17:16,620 --> 02:17:20,940
the camel has its nose under the tent. It's a difference of degree, not a difference of kind

1724
02:17:20,940 --> 02:17:25,740
all the way down. Exactly. So I think that personal nukes have to be sold at K-Mark,

1725
02:17:25,740 --> 02:17:29,420
because the American population needs to keep parity with the American military.

1726
02:17:30,540 --> 02:17:34,300
And then I say, well, do you realize what you just said? Do you realize that you've

1727
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:41,420
bounced out of your very simplified framework? They don't. And this is partially the problem,

1728
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:48,860
which is that if you can't talk about taste and trade-offs and balance, because it's all squishy,

1729
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:56,460
then you have all of these people running to these different ultra simplifications, none of which

1730
02:17:56,460 --> 02:18:03,500
work. There's a quote from one of my smartest friends, Gwinda. A dilemma of tweeting is that

1731
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:07,660
you're aware of exceptions and conditions to your statements, but can't include them without

1732
02:18:07,660 --> 02:18:12,300
turning an elegant aphorism into a clunky mess. So you must choose between writing

1733
02:18:12,300 --> 02:18:16,620
tinniered garbage or getting torn apart by pedants and replies and quote tweets.

1734
02:18:18,620 --> 02:18:22,940
I've chosen to fail in a particular fashion. No, but this is really important.

1735
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:28,700
I'm failing. How about you? Depends what your goals are.

1736
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:34,460
Well, but my point to you is I don't think we're meant to succeed here.

1737
02:18:34,460 --> 02:18:35,980
What's that mean? What's the criteria?

1738
02:18:38,620 --> 02:18:42,380
Was that a herd? What's the criteria?

1739
02:18:42,380 --> 02:18:43,740
No, sorry, the person who just said that.

1740
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:44,700
Gwinda, no, a guy.

1741
02:18:44,700 --> 02:18:52,780
A guy. What he said was that you're aware of the trade-off and there's no way out of the trade-off.

1742
02:18:56,220 --> 02:19:02,140
I believe that there are ways out, but they have their own problems. Once you start to understand

1743
02:19:02,860 --> 02:19:08,780
all of the different forces that are arrayed against you, you realize that if somebody

1744
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:16,060
chooses to hyper-focus on various things, they can effectively destroy your credibility in general.

1745
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:18,540
And you brought up Wikipedia and I wanted to talk about that.

1746
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:24,060
An interesting thing that's happening with Wikipedia is the difference between individual

1747
02:19:24,060 --> 02:19:32,220
Wikipedia entries and Wikipedia entries on a subject or a plant or a geographic place.

1748
02:19:33,980 --> 02:19:37,100
So isn't it strange that if you were to look up, for example,

1749
02:19:38,780 --> 02:19:43,660
pneumatic drill on Wikipedia, there'd be a huge technically accurate article about

1750
02:19:44,460 --> 02:19:45,340
pneumatic drills.

1751
02:19:45,340 --> 02:19:47,580
Constitutes it. Who invented it?

1752
02:19:47,580 --> 02:19:52,700
Right. And then you look up Jordan Peterson and I guarantee you it's going to be a war zone.

1753
02:19:55,020 --> 02:20:04,780
And now you fuse these two things together, which is weaponized Wikipedia and factual Wikipedia.

1754
02:20:06,300 --> 02:20:09,100
And this is like some really dangerous new object.

1755
02:20:09,100 --> 02:20:15,260
And I always knew that Wikipedia, the genius thing that it was, had a finite shelf life

1756
02:20:15,820 --> 02:20:20,300
because it made the fatal flaw of using authoritative sources as bedrock truth.

1757
02:20:21,260 --> 02:20:24,620
What happens when trolls get access to bedrock sources?

1758
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:28,460
What happens when the State Department or the Department of Homeland Security

1759
02:20:28,460 --> 02:20:31,420
or the intelligence community or people who hate you?

1760
02:20:32,460 --> 02:20:37,820
That was the headlines that happened after my episode on Joe's show,

1761
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:47,740
where it was the weekend that somebody had nudged the definition of recession on Wikipedia to no

1762
02:20:47,740 --> 02:20:54,700
longer be two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. And this was a Monday and it happened

1763
02:20:54,700 --> 02:21:00,540
over the weekend. I mentioned it and all hell broke loose. It had already broken loose over

1764
02:21:00,540 --> 02:21:05,500
the weekend. And then obviously anything Joe touches gets amplified to high heavens.

1765
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:16,940
And you're like, okay, so the definitions that we use, I think Shapiro calls it semantic overload,

1766
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:21,420
that's the battleground, ultimately almost all.

1767
02:21:21,420 --> 02:21:26,220
Tell me the frame and I'll tell you the argument. Like somebody will say,

1768
02:21:26,860 --> 02:21:35,020
you know, is it worth stopping Donald Trump by suppressing stories? Yes or no? Go.

1769
02:21:36,380 --> 02:21:44,700
I was like, well, first of all, the question was designed to subsume that we have to stop

1770
02:21:44,700 --> 02:21:50,060
Donald Trump. I might agree that with that. I believe maybe we should stop Donald Trump.

1771
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:55,260
But you did make that the argument and then you piled on a question on top of it and you subsumed

1772
02:21:55,260 --> 02:22:01,180
that within the frame. And so more or less, this is everything at the moment, which is if you can

1773
02:22:01,180 --> 02:22:05,980
define misgendering and dead naming, you've won the argument.

1774
02:22:05,980 --> 02:22:09,980
You suppose there's a world in which, yeah. So I'll give you an example for the fledgling

1775
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:13,980
podcasters out there. When you first start doing a podcast, you're nervous that the guest

1776
02:22:13,980 --> 02:22:18,620
doesn't like you. You're nervous that the guest isn't interested in you, that your question sucks,

1777
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:24,300
that your question doesn't make sense, and you're terrified of silence among millions of other things.

1778
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:29,020
Did any of those happen in this episode? Oh, you've been very welcoming. How could I know?

1779
02:22:29,020 --> 02:22:35,740
After you serenaded me with you, Gitta Laylee, it was a perfect aphrodisiac. So what you do,

1780
02:22:35,740 --> 02:22:43,100
and what I noticed with a lot of young new podcasters, is they do multiple choice offering.

1781
02:22:43,100 --> 02:22:49,100
So I'll ask you a question. Eric, Trump 2024, what do you think is going to happen?

1782
02:22:49,660 --> 02:22:54,060
Is it going to be that, and as soon as you say is it, and you then create either a binary or

1783
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:59,580
a trinary of options, you have now, not only, you've restricted for the entire universe of

1784
02:22:59,580 --> 02:23:03,420
different things that you could have come up with, I don't know whatever you're going to say.

1785
02:23:04,940 --> 02:23:09,580
I've given you two choices. So it makes it difficult for you to take a third because you

1786
02:23:09,580 --> 02:23:15,340
need to say no and why, no and why, and then take the third. So you often offer up this

1787
02:23:15,900 --> 02:23:22,540
very narrow, very unidimensional landscape. Exactly. And it ruins the conversation.

1788
02:23:23,180 --> 02:23:30,700
It's funny. Lex makes assumptions in so many of his frames that I unweave, but I think he gets like

1789
02:23:32,620 --> 02:23:37,340
some of the best out of me as a guest. And there's something about unweaving

1790
02:23:38,300 --> 02:23:43,500
Lex's questions, which I hate doing to him because I want to just answer his questions.

1791
02:23:43,580 --> 02:23:46,940
But on the other hand, there's something about the process of unweaving the assumptions that

1792
02:23:46,940 --> 02:23:52,460
actually benefits some of our interaction. So I think that there's a lot of this

1793
02:23:53,740 --> 02:24:02,940
just grooming us, grooving us to only think about certain possibilities. And

1794
02:24:03,820 --> 02:24:13,980
what I don't know is how do you get nuanced thought to propagate at the speed of the meme?

1795
02:24:13,980 --> 02:24:20,300
You need to make it sexy. Well, to an extent, I do this with acronyms and the acronyms have taken off,

1796
02:24:21,020 --> 02:24:25,900
but then there's a different population that gets very angry, which is why are you allowed to create,

1797
02:24:26,780 --> 02:24:33,580
we're allowed to create these memes with a distracted boyfriend, but you're not allowed

1798
02:24:33,580 --> 02:24:41,580
to create an acronym to make a concept sticky. So what we're in is some sort of warfare for

1799
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:54,620
mind share. And I'll be honest, I'm not seeing high-level interactions the way I was five years

1800
02:24:54,620 --> 02:25:01,900
ago between people. What's happened? I think that they've done a pretty good job of disconnecting

1801
02:25:01,900 --> 02:25:07,420
us. You remember the old data and society report where you looked at chains of association,

1802
02:25:07,420 --> 02:25:11,340
and the whole game was to tie everyone back to my loyianopolis or something.

1803
02:25:11,980 --> 02:25:17,100
So I go to Interject, I go to Qatar to do this debate about masculinity about six months ago,

1804
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:22,540
and they put up on one of the segments. I was pro-traditional masculinity, and there was a gentleman

1805
02:25:22,540 --> 02:25:27,980
on the other side, and they said, here is a montage of some unspeakable people that represent

1806
02:25:27,980 --> 02:25:31,980
masculinity. And there was Joe Rogan and John Peterson and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1807
02:25:31,980 --> 02:25:37,660
but the first person was Milo Yianopolis. I said, look, if you have brought me to the Middle East

1808
02:25:37,660 --> 02:25:44,140
to defend Milo Yianopolis, did you have brought the wrong person? I'm like, we need to shift that,

1809
02:25:44,140 --> 02:25:48,700
get that to one side. Milo can go over there. Do you see his debate with destiny that he did

1810
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:56,300
a couple of weeks ago, maybe three months ago now? Milo looked like an old touring singer

1811
02:25:56,300 --> 02:26:02,940
in a rock band, still doing the shows, but can't hit the high notes anymore. And the whimsy

1812
02:26:03,820 --> 02:26:12,780
and that sort of playful jester-joker kind of game, gamesmanship, had been abandoned in place of

1813
02:26:13,500 --> 02:26:18,700
bottom of the barrel, backbiting and genuine emotional sniping. And then destiny said,

1814
02:26:18,700 --> 02:26:24,620
after he's been pushed and pushed and pushed for 90 minutes, he says to destiny,

1815
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:31,100
back in the olden times, they would have left your kind on the side of a hill to die.

1816
02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:37,420
And destiny said, well, I think that the gays would have been left there first. Milo said,

1817
02:26:37,420 --> 02:26:41,580
well, I don't think that you can tell whether a baby's going to like dick when it comes out or not.

1818
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:46,300
Destiny said, well, you'd know all about young boys liking dick, wouldn't you?

1819
02:26:46,940 --> 02:26:53,180
Wow. And it broke Milo, it broke his brain. Sorry, what was that? And no one had any sympathy,

1820
02:26:53,180 --> 02:26:59,580
because for 90 minutes, he'd called destiny's wife a public fleshlight. He'd said everything

1821
02:26:59,580 --> 02:27:08,300
under the sun. Why are we dealing with these people? Because it is entertainment, it is mental

1822
02:27:08,380 --> 02:27:16,780
masturbation, it, a story about people will always be more seductive to a broader group

1823
02:27:16,780 --> 02:27:25,500
than a story about ideas. Got it. I think. Am I wrong? I don't know. I just,

1824
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:32,140
despairing. So much stuff, so much beauty in this world. And I just, I wonder at what point does

1825
02:27:32,140 --> 02:27:43,500
middle school lunch table, when you compare it to amino acids, you compare it to,

1826
02:27:51,260 --> 02:27:56,300
you go scuba diving? I have done. I suck. What's the most beautiful place you've gone scuba dive?

1827
02:27:56,460 --> 02:28:05,260
Ghillie T, off the coast of Bali. Okay. I remember scuba diving off

1828
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:10,940
Manjungan Island in Bali. Amazing. But the Red Sea totally blew my mind.

1829
02:28:12,620 --> 02:28:17,820
I can't tell you how little I care about Miloianopolis and how much I care about scuba diving in

1830
02:28:17,820 --> 02:28:24,860
the Red Sea. I don't know. Maybe I'm just wrong. There's something wrong. It's just to get back to

1831
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:30,300
it. We all used to talk to each other. And then this thing started dividing us.

1832
02:28:32,940 --> 02:28:37,340
You know, you started seeing all these messages. Oh, your boy said this. Your boy said that. Time

1833
02:28:37,340 --> 02:28:44,860
to come collect your boy. Who talks like this? The internet. And then we stopped seeing each other

1834
02:28:44,860 --> 02:28:55,980
in our feeds. And I said, well, this is Vijaya Gade under Jack Dorsey. Jack had gotten some system

1835
02:28:55,980 --> 02:29:00,860
whereby he took his hands off it because he knew that terrible things had to be done, I think.

1836
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:05,900
And he just had this idea, well, if I have to intercede at Twitter, then something has gone

1837
02:29:05,900 --> 02:29:11,100
wrong with the system. And you had this person who was just very happy bringing health to the

1838
02:29:11,180 --> 02:29:17,420
internet, but it disconnected all of us. It was very clear that our engagement just

1839
02:29:17,420 --> 02:29:21,820
dropped. And then if you complained about it, it was because you actually sucked and nobody

1840
02:29:21,820 --> 02:29:28,300
cared about your tweets. You had no idea where you were. And so all of this kind of good feeling

1841
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:34,220
evaporated in part because people didn't know how to fight as a team. And this is just,

1842
02:29:35,260 --> 02:29:38,220
I would love to get back to the masculinity riff a little bit.

1843
02:29:38,620 --> 02:29:47,500
I don't think men know how to fight as groups. And it's a key part about masculinity. And it

1844
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:54,700
really makes me upset to see all of these people in individual masculine space. If you're ever

1845
02:29:54,700 --> 02:29:59,660
faced with three attackers, two of whom have knives and one of whom has a gun, here's your best

1846
02:29:59,660 --> 02:30:03,500
move. It's like, you know, you don't know. You've never faced this.

1847
02:30:03,580 --> 02:30:04,540
You've never faced this.

1848
02:30:04,540 --> 02:30:07,900
Is the best move to have a group of five friends with you?

1849
02:30:08,460 --> 02:30:15,420
Well, first of all, yes. And having people's back.

1850
02:30:16,780 --> 02:30:21,420
So this is something that I've spent an awful lot of time over the last couple of years thinking

1851
02:30:21,420 --> 02:30:31,420
about. The definition of addiction is that you can find fulfillment alone.

1852
02:30:32,380 --> 02:30:33,980
It's something that I heard a few weeks ago.

1853
02:30:38,220 --> 02:30:49,340
The atomization of everybody, the generalized risk aversion syndrome that we are seeing,

1854
02:30:49,900 --> 02:30:54,700
something called extended adolescence or slow life strategy from Gene Twengey.

1855
02:30:55,580 --> 02:30:57,420
Talking about young people are getting their driver's license.

1856
02:30:57,420 --> 02:30:59,820
Don't know it, but let get immediately from the title.

1857
02:31:01,420 --> 02:31:06,060
People getting their driver's licenses later. They're partying less. They're drinking less.

1858
02:31:06,060 --> 02:31:09,180
They're leaving home later. They're getting occupations, starting jobs later.

1859
02:31:10,540 --> 02:31:12,860
Could this have been contributed to through COVID? Yeah, probably.

1860
02:31:14,140 --> 02:31:16,620
But it was catalyzed. It was already a trend that was happening.

1861
02:31:18,060 --> 02:31:25,100
It's affecting men particularly because male friendship groups are

1862
02:31:26,060 --> 02:31:35,900
more fragile in some regards than women's. In 1990, the number of men who said they had zero

1863
02:31:35,900 --> 02:31:41,500
close friends was around about 3%. In 2020, that number was 15%.

1864
02:31:42,140 --> 02:31:43,020
That's insane.

1865
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:47,420
The most common answer to the question, how many friends could you call on in an emergency,

1866
02:31:47,420 --> 02:31:50,620
is zero. The most common. It's not the average, but it's the most common.

1867
02:31:51,500 --> 02:31:54,220
More people have zero friends to call on than have any other number.

1868
02:31:57,580 --> 02:32:03,580
The challenge of modern masculinity relates to that addiction quote,

1869
02:32:03,580 --> 02:32:08,060
the belief that you can find fulfillment alone. You see this in the sigma male meme,

1870
02:32:08,060 --> 02:32:10,380
sigma male grind set. I don't know this.

1871
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:16,540
So you have alpha, beta, the sort of red pill, the blue pill, the purple pill,

1872
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:18,780
halfway between the two. I don't know this either.

1873
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:24,380
Okay. So the sigma male steps outside of the existing dominance hierarchy.

1874
02:32:24,380 --> 02:32:27,340
He doesn't try to lead. He doesn't try to do anything. He is a lone ranger,

1875
02:32:27,340 --> 02:32:32,380
Lauren to himself. Over the top of a lot of this meta meme, which is being created,

1876
02:32:32,380 --> 02:32:37,980
is a guy called Chris Bumstead, who is a three-time, four-time classic physique champion,

1877
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:42,940
Mr. Olympia. Classic physique is they have weight limits, which means that they have

1878
02:32:42,940 --> 02:32:49,420
a much more Arnold-esque. It's all about shape and sculpture, massive, but not a mass monster.

1879
02:32:49,420 --> 02:32:54,620
Phil Heath was sat in that seat not long ago, mass monster. I sit down with Chris,

1880
02:32:54,620 --> 02:33:01,100
this guy who is the face of the sigma male meme, perhaps the one of the driving forces

1881
02:33:01,100 --> 02:33:07,260
behind young male belief at the moment. And I asked him, how much of what you've done and

1882
02:33:07,260 --> 02:33:10,940
achieved in business, in personal life, and in your sport, could you have done on your own?

1883
02:33:11,420 --> 02:33:17,580
Zero. I could have done none of it. I couldn't have gotten through the difficult times

1884
02:33:17,580 --> 02:33:21,900
emotionally without my fiance. I couldn't have built my personal brand without my best friend

1885
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:26,060
and videographer Calvin. I couldn't have run my business without Vaughn and my other business

1886
02:33:26,060 --> 02:33:30,860
partners that are here. I couldn't have done any of this stuff. And this is the guy that

1887
02:33:30,860 --> 02:33:34,860
he's in the ice tub as there's dubstep music over the top of him saying,

1888
02:33:34,860 --> 02:33:40,380
you don't need anybody else and so on and so forth. The belief that you can find fulfillment alone

1889
02:33:41,180 --> 02:33:52,140
is a lie. It is a lie that people who have been hurt and scorned and rejected by the world

1890
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:59,020
retreat into. There is a safety blanket of cynicism that people can use. It's sour grapes at an

1891
02:33:59,020 --> 02:34:05,740
existential level. The belief that the upside of never trying is never having to feel the pain of

1892
02:34:05,740 --> 02:34:13,900
failure. And the generalized risk aversion, the extended adolescence, the slow life strategy

1893
02:34:14,700 --> 02:34:19,660
permits that to seep ever more into people's lives. In a world where we have hyper convenience,

1894
02:34:19,660 --> 02:34:29,660
why should I feel discomfort? So what's going on with the modern masculinity movement?

1895
02:34:30,540 --> 02:34:35,900
It's fractured. So there is the manosphere, which is the broad term that describes people

1896
02:34:35,900 --> 02:34:41,500
talking to men. I've never identified with it. I'm not a part of it. In as much as I speak to men

1897
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:46,140
about things that I struggled with and they listen, perhaps someone could put me in it,

1898
02:34:46,140 --> 02:34:50,540
but I don't think that they help. I think fundamentally at the moment the masculinity

1899
02:34:50,540 --> 02:34:54,540
movement sees women as adversaries and competitors rather than compatriots.

1900
02:34:55,500 --> 02:35:02,620
I think that they treat women largely like an enemy to be avoided or a resource to be used

1901
02:35:02,620 --> 02:35:09,980
and discarded. I think that largely much of men's advice benefits some men at the expense of most

1902
02:35:09,980 --> 02:35:15,180
others that if being a high value man means sleeping with as many women as possible,

1903
02:35:15,180 --> 02:35:20,540
but a low value woman is a woman that slept with many men, what you are doing is creating a wake

1904
02:35:20,540 --> 02:35:26,300
after you that other men have to pick up the pieces of if your goal is to be this high value,

1905
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:36,540
many high body count male. Let me give you this. So this is actually going into a paper,

1906
02:35:36,540 --> 02:35:41,500
my first academic paper that I've ever been a part of. So this is the male sedation hypothesis.

1907
02:35:42,060 --> 02:35:48,140
Okay. There's an effect called young male syndrome. You heard of this?

1908
02:35:48,140 --> 02:35:53,980
Nope. If you have a large number of dispossessed sexless men throughout all of history,

1909
02:35:53,980 --> 02:35:57,740
bad things happen. Yeah. Testosterone drops when you get in a relationship and drops again

1910
02:35:57,740 --> 02:36:03,740
once you have kids. This means in large part that women domesticate men in some regard.

1911
02:36:03,740 --> 02:36:08,540
They have to. You don't want to take risk taking behavior when you've got a newborn at home. Don't

1912
02:36:08,540 --> 02:36:16,220
jump off that fucking cliff. Okay. Like let's be, go home, go home. So when you have

1913
02:36:16,220 --> 02:36:18,940
large numbers of dispossessed young men who aren't having sex,

1914
02:36:20,060 --> 02:36:26,780
what's the reason for integrating into society? They take a brilliant study is done of men crossing

1915
02:36:26,780 --> 02:36:30,380
the road and the difference between when they cross and the distance from the nearest car

1916
02:36:31,340 --> 02:36:35,420
with or without the presence of women. You put a woman there, the distance

1917
02:36:35,500 --> 02:36:39,740
closes massively. No women there. They're not bothered. Risk taking behavior is a show. Look

1918
02:36:39,740 --> 02:36:43,500
at my excess fitness. Yeah. Look at all of these risks that I can take. Look at the plumage on the

1919
02:36:43,500 --> 02:36:51,500
back of my tail, right? So throughout all of history, it seems like they set cars on fire and

1920
02:36:51,500 --> 02:37:00,220
push over granny and cause havoc. In Portugal, 1700s, the first son, there was a disparity in

1921
02:37:00,220 --> 02:37:05,500
the sex ratio. I'm not sure why the first son was allowed to marry. Every subsequent son was put

1922
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:11,900
on a ship, go explore the new world. Don't burn our home was what they were saying. There is a

1923
02:37:11,900 --> 02:37:17,820
question. We have very high rates of sexlessness and we have very low rates of integration amongst

1924
02:37:17,820 --> 02:37:22,220
young men at the moment. Why are we not seeing them going around and setting a setting cars on

1925
02:37:22,220 --> 02:37:30,780
fire? Jordan Peterson was featured as the incel god. He inspired a movie by Olivia Wilde

1926
02:37:30,780 --> 02:37:33,740
starring Harry Styles a little while ago. I brought it up to Jordan.

1927
02:37:36,540 --> 02:37:43,580
The incel god? He was the king of the incels. Yes, this incel. I am so pissed to hear this.

1928
02:37:44,380 --> 02:37:50,300
Jordan laughed it off in classic him fashion. Yeah, but as a guy who opened for Jordan Peterson

1929
02:37:50,300 --> 02:37:58,060
on Harmonica, I've been to some of his shows. Jordan Peterson recognized this demographic

1930
02:37:58,060 --> 02:38:06,780
early and he had the courage to speak directly to it. If you want to see me break out in tears,

1931
02:38:07,420 --> 02:38:12,620
have me tell you the stories about the people who went up to Jordan Peterson and said,

1932
02:38:12,620 --> 02:38:19,420
I was smoking weed, masturbating in my parents' basement. Six months later, I've got a job,

1933
02:38:19,420 --> 02:38:28,140
I've got prospects, I've got a fiance, et cetera, et cetera. To turn him into the incel king or

1934
02:38:28,140 --> 02:38:34,380
whatever, no, Jordan Peterson tried to become the one person answer to the world uncle shortage.

1935
02:38:39,020 --> 02:38:46,780
I just have no patience for dismissing that much good. If some of his message seemed off to you,

1936
02:38:46,860 --> 02:38:51,340
it's because you didn't need it. You didn't understand what clean your room was about.

1937
02:38:51,340 --> 02:38:57,340
You laughed it off because you weren't screwed. He gave people a path just the way Sam gave people

1938
02:38:57,340 --> 02:39:03,660
a path from that abusive religious household where they didn't know to escape. To an extent,

1939
02:39:04,940 --> 02:39:11,820
all of these people spoke to people at different stages of their lives. A lot of this female

1940
02:39:11,820 --> 02:39:16,620
behavior which is, oh, I'm on only fans, I'm going to get my this, I'm going to get my that.

1941
02:39:16,620 --> 02:39:26,540
Well, good luck to you. I hope it works out. The gold digging or the misogyny, it's of a piece.

1942
02:39:26,540 --> 02:39:31,420
People are listening to each other's strategic conversation and saying, why would I want that

1943
02:39:31,420 --> 02:39:38,060
for my life? I'll round out the sedation hypothesis. You have this large cohort, dispossessed young

1944
02:39:38,060 --> 02:39:42,460
men, high tea, high risk taking, they cause problems. There is a question to be asked,

1945
02:39:42,460 --> 02:39:48,060
although many of the almost all mass shooters, including the ones that hit all of the headlines,

1946
02:39:48,060 --> 02:39:55,020
were sexless young men. Given that we have the highest rates of sexlessness amongst young men

1947
02:39:55,020 --> 02:39:59,180
that we've seen in a very long time, there is a question, why have we not seen an in kind

1948
02:39:59,180 --> 02:40:06,220
increase in antisocial behavior? It's my belief that young men specifically are being sedated

1949
02:40:06,220 --> 02:40:12,700
out of their status seeking and risk taking and reproductive behavior through a combination of

1950
02:40:12,700 --> 02:40:19,340
social media, porn and video games. I was waiting for it. So there is an idea from Diana. Sorry,

1951
02:40:19,340 --> 02:40:22,940
social media, porn and video games does not include weed.

1952
02:40:22,940 --> 02:40:28,380
I think ubiquitous weed.

1953
02:40:31,420 --> 02:40:32,540
The motivation killer?

1954
02:40:37,020 --> 02:40:41,900
We don't have a ton of culture around open weed. We have a lot of culture around open alcohol,

1955
02:40:41,900 --> 02:40:47,260
about open coffee. We used to have culture around open nicotine. We don't have a lot of

1956
02:40:48,460 --> 02:40:51,100
culture around open weed. We have culture around closed weed,

1957
02:40:51,740 --> 02:40:54,860
served dishes weed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I do think that in part,

1958
02:40:55,660 --> 02:41:00,540
the video game thing is an absolute as if drug. What's that?

1959
02:41:02,300 --> 02:41:07,020
You meet people who come from the gaming community or social media and they have an idea

1960
02:41:07,020 --> 02:41:14,060
that life permits you to do certain things that are absolutely not tolerated in civil society.

1961
02:41:15,020 --> 02:41:21,900
Like a lot of the people, an interesting feature of social media is the difference between critics

1962
02:41:21,900 --> 02:41:28,300
and trolls who call you names and people who actually try to find a way to ruin your life offline.

1963
02:41:29,660 --> 02:41:36,140
Like there's a huge connection between the gaming community and certain sort of bulletin boards

1964
02:41:36,780 --> 02:41:41,340
and this freak game about how can we destroy people offline?

1965
02:41:42,220 --> 02:41:51,980
Yeah, yeah. And once you meet these people and you read their messages to each other,

1966
02:41:51,980 --> 02:41:56,460
they're talking about, oh, yeah, I've got a cool exploit where I'm going to invite somebody to

1967
02:41:56,460 --> 02:42:00,700
someone's house because I think that person might be dangerous. You realize it's a video game.

1968
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:08,460
Yeah, so I had this idea specifically about Jordan, but it would apply to yourself. It would

1969
02:42:08,540 --> 02:42:17,020
apply to Joe. After a while, there is a particular threshold of exposure and notoriety that people

1970
02:42:17,020 --> 02:42:25,020
cross. And when they do, they are no longer treated like a human. It's easy online to dehumanize

1971
02:42:25,020 --> 02:42:29,820
because you don't see any there, there, you don't see that. But there's something specific about

1972
02:42:29,820 --> 02:42:34,460
crossing a particular threshold where you're no longer a person, you're a representation of ideas,

1973
02:42:34,460 --> 02:42:41,100
you're a conglomeration of viewpoints. And I think that really allows people to dehumanize

1974
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:45,660
the other side. Really, there is no one reading these tweets. Well, you think Jordan Peterson's

1975
02:42:45,660 --> 02:42:52,380
reading these tweets about the incel God thing? Yeah. Is he? I don't know. I think he is. I think

1976
02:42:52,380 --> 02:42:56,860
Jordan spends, I would love Jordan spend less time on Twitter. Okay. I think that would be,

1977
02:42:56,860 --> 02:43:03,260
I think that that would be good. But even if they're not, there is a person there that is the

1978
02:43:03,260 --> 02:43:10,060
representation of the person. And I don't know, like saying something to somebody online that you

1979
02:43:10,060 --> 02:43:16,300
wouldn't say to their face, to me seems like a coward's way of communicating. Or you view it as an

1980
02:43:16,300 --> 02:43:21,500
adaptive landscape, which is new exploits have been created. I mean, if I explained to you a

1981
02:43:21,500 --> 02:43:25,820
mosquito life cycle, okay, you're going to find somebody with excess blood, and you're going to

1982
02:43:25,820 --> 02:43:30,140
steal some for yourself. That's my video guy who's been eaten alive since we've been in LA.

1983
02:43:30,300 --> 02:43:35,580
Is that right? Yeah. Okay. But you see the same cookie cutter sharks do the same thing for large

1984
02:43:36,220 --> 02:43:43,180
marine wildlife. They'll just take a plug of flesh out. It's like, can't afford to go after

1985
02:43:43,180 --> 02:43:49,180
cookie cutter sharks. When you have those kinds of strategies, am I going to sit around in the

1986
02:43:49,180 --> 02:43:54,540
ocean and say, no, that's not a legitimate strategy. You're a parasite. It's like, yeah.

1987
02:43:55,420 --> 02:43:58,940
Like that's my whole game where I'm a predator. I just murder things for a living.

1988
02:43:59,900 --> 02:44:04,780
It's really what predation is about. And in a certain sense, what you've done is you've changed

1989
02:44:04,780 --> 02:44:12,060
the adaptive landscape. And these are the new exploits. Yes. So to get back to the video games,

1990
02:44:12,060 --> 02:44:17,020
porn and social media, Diana Fleischman has this idea she calls uncanny volvers.

1991
02:44:18,060 --> 02:44:23,740
Tell me more. She says that porn has been able to hijack the mate seeking behavior specifically of

1992
02:44:23,740 --> 02:44:32,700
men by giving them a very titrated dose of what it is that they would usually get. Which means that

1993
02:44:36,380 --> 02:44:41,580
part of that motivation to go out and do the risk taking behavior has been tuned down.

1994
02:44:41,580 --> 02:44:47,020
But what do you get from video games? You get camaraderie. You get progressive overload in

1995
02:44:47,020 --> 02:44:53,500
terms of your achievements. You get a sense of belonging. You get a dopamine when you achieve

1996
02:44:53,500 --> 02:44:56,940
something. You may even get some serotonin because you feel like you're lumped together with your

1997
02:44:56,940 --> 02:45:01,500
group of friends. Okay. And then once you get on social media, with social media, we've gamified

1998
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:05,500
the status hierarchy. It's there. There's a number right in front of you. And there are

1999
02:45:05,500 --> 02:45:09,100
levels that you can get to. There's your silver plaque on YouTube. There's your gold plaque.

2000
02:45:09,100 --> 02:45:13,500
There's your blue tick. Look who followed me today. Elon Musk followed me today.

2001
02:45:13,500 --> 02:45:21,500
Whatever. I got a retweet from Paul Graham. It has been able to, and I don't necessarily think

2002
02:45:21,500 --> 02:45:26,220
that this was by design. It could be by side effect. It has been able to specifically for men,

2003
02:45:26,220 --> 02:45:34,940
maybe also for women, give a titrated dose of most of the key drivers that got people out of the

2004
02:45:34,940 --> 02:45:43,100
house to go and do things. Scott Galloway trended earlier on for saying that unless you're asleep

2005
02:45:43,100 --> 02:45:47,660
as a young person, you shouldn't be in the house. And his point is life is for living.

2006
02:45:47,660 --> 02:45:53,980
There is lots for you to learn outside. Fuck off. Go out. Come on. And he got tons and tons of

2007
02:45:53,980 --> 02:46:02,540
pushback. And maybe he's wrong. But when I get advice, sometimes on Q&As, people will say,

2008
02:46:03,100 --> 02:46:07,980
young guys and girls will message and say, I'm 13. And I love your podcast. Like, what the

2009
02:46:08,780 --> 02:46:13,260
fuck? Fantastic. You are in a growth period that is unbelievable. And the people that you're

2010
02:46:13,260 --> 02:46:17,660
getting exposed to, I wish that I'd had access to at 13. What should I do if I want to improve

2011
02:46:17,660 --> 02:46:22,780
myself? What books should I read? What practices should I do? I don't mean to be patronizing,

2012
02:46:22,780 --> 02:46:28,300
but just go outside and live life. There is so much low hanging fruit from knowing what it's

2013
02:46:28,300 --> 02:46:32,220
like to have an argument with your friend and having to cycle home with a flat tire.

2014
02:46:32,940 --> 02:46:38,540
Just things. There is so many life experiences that I think you will gain massive amounts,

2015
02:46:39,500 --> 02:46:45,500
huge, huge amounts of benefit from over and above a 2D lesson. So me and my friend George

2016
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:50,460
have this conception of a 2D lessons and 3D lessons. So a 2D lesson would be reading about

2017
02:46:50,460 --> 02:46:55,580
Warren Buffett's wealth through an autobiography or watching it. A 3D lesson would be hanging out

2018
02:46:55,580 --> 02:47:01,180
with Warren Buffett at his house for an afternoon. And no matter how immersive we try and make learning,

2019
02:47:01,180 --> 02:47:05,980
3D lessons are always going to win because you can't forget them. They're so visceral.

2020
02:47:05,980 --> 02:47:09,740
And in a world where most of our time and increasing proportion of our time is spent online,

2021
02:47:11,100 --> 02:47:16,540
the in-person 3D lessons become more and more and more powerful. So this is my conception of the

2022
02:47:16,540 --> 02:47:29,340
male sedation hypothesis. How do you judge our sperm counts and testosterone over time?

2023
02:47:30,220 --> 02:47:33,180
Yeah. So there's some evidence. Andrew Heumann shared some evidence that although

2024
02:47:33,180 --> 02:47:36,700
sperm counts are decreasing, penis length is increasing, which...

2025
02:47:37,660 --> 02:47:43,660
But that's not... If I recall correctly, and I hesitate to get into...

2026
02:47:43,660 --> 02:47:45,420
Get into your penis literature, Eric. Come on.

2027
02:47:46,220 --> 02:47:51,900
Well, there is some trade-off in various reproductive systems between

2028
02:47:52,780 --> 02:47:58,380
things that we would classically associate with masculinity. So for example, dung beetles have

2029
02:47:59,020 --> 02:48:06,540
weaponry on their head called antlers, giant hook, and their copulatory apparatus and their antler

2030
02:48:06,540 --> 02:48:09,980
is in inverse proportion. It's the gorilla and chimp thing again, right?

2031
02:48:10,700 --> 02:48:15,500
That one of them has lots of testicles and very little penis length and the other one has the

2032
02:48:15,500 --> 02:48:20,940
reverse. So you have a lot of these conserved systems where somehow reproduction says you

2033
02:48:20,940 --> 02:48:25,820
can have this many total resources, but you have to figure out how to budget between various things

2034
02:48:25,820 --> 02:48:33,820
that appear to be strongly masculine. So I think that declining testosterone is a big concern.

2035
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:41,500
I would say that it certainly contributes to a generalized change in male behavior,

2036
02:48:41,500 --> 02:48:49,740
risk-taking. It is... Talk about, oh, and women that take birth control can impact the local

2037
02:48:49,740 --> 02:48:54,300
ecology of male testosterone by basically making it feel like they're around infertile women when

2038
02:48:54,300 --> 02:48:58,940
they're not, they're just artificially suppressed women. That impacts a man's testosterone level.

2039
02:48:58,940 --> 02:49:04,380
Men that are around weapons, if mean you walked past a table of guns, the testosterone would go up.

2040
02:49:04,380 --> 02:49:07,740
If we walked past, there's a chainsaw over there, so perhaps it's already high, I'm not sure.

2041
02:49:10,940 --> 02:49:12,540
Do I see how many volleys we can get?

2042
02:49:13,980 --> 02:49:23,180
Do football freestyle. The issues of sperm count, the issue of testosterone production,

2043
02:49:23,180 --> 02:49:28,700
I think contributes to this in a large way. What it is that's causing this, is it phthalates in

2044
02:49:28,700 --> 02:49:33,340
the water? Is it women peeing out their birth control and we've got estrogens in the water supply?

2045
02:49:34,620 --> 02:49:39,260
Is it the foods that we're eating? Is it seed oils? Is it the lack of time outside? Is it grounding?

2046
02:49:39,260 --> 02:49:44,940
Is it... There are a whole host of things that are contributing to this, but I started working

2047
02:49:44,940 --> 02:49:49,020
with a blood testing company, MaricHealth, about six months ago, and I had my bloodstone for the

2048
02:49:49,020 --> 02:49:54,300
first time. My testosterone was about 500, and I'm 35, and I was like, it should be higher than

2049
02:49:54,300 --> 02:49:57,900
that, so what should I do? They gave me some lifestyle interventions and some boron that

2050
02:49:57,900 --> 02:50:01,660
frees up free tea from sex hormone binding, globulin and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2051
02:50:01,660 --> 02:50:05,820
No pharmaceutical interventions, but they gave me a ton of lifestyle ones. I had my bloodstone

2052
02:50:05,820 --> 02:50:14,620
a couple of weeks ago and it was 900. Over the last six months, there's been some minor but

2053
02:50:14,620 --> 02:50:20,300
noticeable changes to my demeanor, one of them being I'm more aggressive. Like my frustrations

2054
02:50:20,300 --> 02:50:27,020
come to the fore more. Love it. And so, I mean, I'm dying to ask, are you, first of all, are you

2055
02:50:27,020 --> 02:50:35,260
married? No, in a relationship. In a relationship. Do you find that women, heterosexual women,

2056
02:50:35,260 --> 02:50:43,100
respond to classical masculinity? I have to be very carefully as I ask, because they certainly

2057
02:50:43,100 --> 02:50:48,540
respond more than they're supposed to, according to modern rules of femininity. But my guess is

2058
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:56,140
that it's greatly decreased from the market for masculinity in the 60s, let's say. So look,

2059
02:50:57,420 --> 02:51:02,060
again, inter and intersexual dynamics, something I've spent an awful lot of time

2060
02:51:02,620 --> 02:51:05,980
learning about. I'm writing a book at the moment with David Busse, evolutionary psychologist,

2061
02:51:06,860 --> 02:51:19,820
on this. In the early 2010s, after the success of 50 Shades of Grey, there was a proliferation

2062
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:28,140
of dark romance novels. And they, there was a pushback from the feminism movement,

2063
02:51:28,860 --> 02:51:35,900
saying that the portrayals of men as dominant, masculine, bearded, big chested, in a loincloth

2064
02:51:35,900 --> 02:51:42,300
or a plaid shirt, wielding an axe, wasn't what women wanted. They wanted a softer, more like the

2065
02:51:42,300 --> 02:51:47,740
brawny guy or the Marlboro man. Correct. They wanted a softer version of this. So they started

2066
02:51:47,740 --> 02:51:52,860
putting more agreeable, more feminized men on the front cover of books. They didn't sell.

2067
02:51:53,580 --> 02:51:57,580
Right. But I wouldn't guess that either of those would be where modern women's heads would be at

2068
02:51:57,580 --> 02:52:02,460
now. In the space of 10 years. So I think that there's, there's, there's massively a difference

2069
02:52:02,460 --> 02:52:06,860
between stated and revealed preferences. Sure. Right. And also to, you know, to caveat that,

2070
02:52:06,860 --> 02:52:10,060
the thing that you may sexually fantasize about is not necessarily what you want to get into a

2071
02:52:10,060 --> 02:52:16,780
relationship with. Guys will say. Say more. That what you optimize for in a one night stand and

2072
02:52:16,780 --> 02:52:19,740
what you optimize for in a marriage partner aren't always necessarily the same thing.

2073
02:52:19,740 --> 02:52:23,980
I would think they would be wildly disparate. Correct. Which means that the front cover of

2074
02:52:23,980 --> 02:52:28,220
the romance novel is not necessarily the partner that you want long term. They're the one that

2075
02:52:28,220 --> 02:52:35,020
you want to fantasize about. Most of these stories are driven by sex rather than driven by love.

2076
02:52:36,300 --> 02:52:40,460
So I have this hypothesis and I wonder if you, you have names for all sorts of things that

2077
02:52:41,020 --> 02:52:46,460
before you give me, I just need to bunch this up. Your acronym, your ponchant for acronym acronyms.

2078
02:52:46,460 --> 02:52:51,500
Yeah. And a friend, Mary says meme first, explain later. And I think that

2079
02:52:51,900 --> 02:52:58,220
some of my favorite episodes, they rely on aphorisms. They rely on creating memes. Sure.

2080
02:52:58,220 --> 02:53:02,940
Small, quippy razors and so on and so forth. First off, because it makes it easy to remember.

2081
02:53:02,940 --> 02:53:06,860
But secondly, because that's what gets the hooks into you. This is how you make things.

2082
02:53:06,860 --> 02:53:11,020
So if you are somebody that's listening that has an idea that really loves that idea,

2083
02:53:11,660 --> 02:53:15,340
give it a name. Give it a name and give it a cool name. Yeah. I came up with fame

2084
02:53:15,340 --> 02:53:20,940
seesaw the other day, which is that on your way up, people want to support you because you remind

2085
02:53:20,940 --> 02:53:24,060
them of their dreams. When you're at the top, they tear you down because you remind them of

2086
02:53:24,060 --> 02:53:29,020
what they gave up on. Yeah. Fame seesaw. Beautiful. And even if it's fucking wrong,

2087
02:53:29,020 --> 02:53:38,620
you can't forget it. So it's good. Very nice. You were saying that when women, when heterosexual

2088
02:53:38,620 --> 02:53:44,300
women realize that they have several possible life cycles and they don't have a clear sense of which

2089
02:53:44,300 --> 02:53:50,140
one they will actually live. Am I going to get married and raise children and be at home with

2090
02:53:50,140 --> 02:53:55,980
the children? Am I going to get married and have one child, maybe two, and be a career person?

2091
02:53:55,980 --> 02:54:00,940
Am I never going to couple, but have children? Am I going to have no children whatsoever?

2092
02:54:00,940 --> 02:54:03,500
Am I going to do that in a coupled situation? Yeah. Yeah.

2093
02:54:05,180 --> 02:54:09,900
Their decision trees blow out as to what it is that they're actually looking for.

2094
02:54:10,140 --> 02:54:19,900
And one of my strong senses is that women encountered something they weren't expecting,

2095
02:54:20,460 --> 02:54:24,940
which is that they might even be smarter than the guy at work who they're competing with,

2096
02:54:25,660 --> 02:54:32,540
but he's happy to come in all of Saturday, all of Sunday, and work hours that are completely

2097
02:54:32,540 --> 02:54:37,660
psychotic. And so then the idea, well, we need work-life balance. We don't want people coming

2098
02:54:37,660 --> 02:54:42,140
in on Friday and Saturday because that's sort of an unfair advantage that somebody who wants a

2099
02:54:42,140 --> 02:54:48,700
healthy life is different from somebody who wants an extreme life. And so now you have this problem,

2100
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:53,900
which is I'm attracted to the sort of man I wouldn't want to compete with at work.

2101
02:54:55,260 --> 02:55:00,060
If I'm going to be in the office, I want to know that I'm not going to have to deal with the guy

2102
02:55:00,060 --> 02:55:04,700
who's willing to give up every weekend and work hours that I'm unwilling to work because that's

2103
02:55:04,700 --> 02:55:15,980
not how I'm set at the factory versus I want that guy as the go-getter while I'm pregnant and

2104
02:55:15,980 --> 02:55:22,700
incapacitated and raising children to make sure that not only he can shepherd our family through

2105
02:55:22,700 --> 02:55:27,980
anything because he's highly capable, but can also get me back into the workforce when I'm done raising

2106
02:55:27,980 --> 02:55:39,020
children. And this is somewhat what I believe is responsible for the sort of incoherent messages

2107
02:55:39,020 --> 02:55:43,820
that men and women are sending to each other is that when we don't know what life cycle we are

2108
02:55:43,820 --> 02:55:50,780
going to be inhabiting, our eroticism and our romance and our desire is unstable.

2109
02:55:50,860 --> 02:55:59,340
One of the most uncomfortable correlations that I've found over the last few years is that as

2110
02:56:00,300 --> 02:56:05,420
gender inequality, pay inequality between the gender's increases, relationship satisfaction

2111
02:56:05,420 --> 02:56:11,260
for both men and women increases as well. Sorry, decreases. The more egalitarian,

2112
02:56:11,260 --> 02:56:18,380
the more equal the pay, the less satisfied both sexes are with relationships. Men who are in

2113
02:56:18,380 --> 02:56:22,060
relationships where the woman is the primary breadwinner are 50% more likely to use a rectile

2114
02:56:22,060 --> 02:56:29,260
dysfunction medication, where a woman is contributing more than 70% of the household

2115
02:56:29,260 --> 02:56:36,380
income, the marriage is twice as likely to end in divorce. Women for a man, sorry, for a

2116
02:56:38,620 --> 02:56:43,420
woman to move herself the same distance on a 10-point scale in terms of attractiveness

2117
02:56:43,420 --> 02:56:50,700
that a man can by increasing his income by $100,000, she would need a 10,000 times increase

2118
02:56:50,700 --> 02:56:57,020
in income. In short, women are interested socioeconomically in the status of their partner

2119
02:56:57,020 --> 02:57:00,780
in a way that men aren't. Now, the problem that you have is that women now have access

2120
02:57:00,780 --> 02:57:04,220
to education and employment in a way that they never have done before, so they're no longer

2121
02:57:04,220 --> 02:57:09,740
financially dependent on men. Sure, but you're seeing something which is particularly heartbreaking

2122
02:57:09,820 --> 02:57:16,700
in my group of females, which would be women in their mid to late 50s. I have to be honest,

2123
02:57:16,700 --> 02:57:25,340
I've seen some of the women I was most impressed by never coupling. When you talk to them,

2124
02:57:25,340 --> 02:57:29,980
there's some very uncomfortable things that get said, one of which was I was looking for a man

2125
02:57:29,980 --> 02:57:37,740
I could look up to and the pool was just so small. You're thinking, well, okay, it's illegal to say

2126
02:57:37,740 --> 02:57:42,940
I'm looking for a man that I could look up to because that's not in accordance with modern

2127
02:57:42,940 --> 02:57:51,020
feminism and egalitarianism. On the other hand, this idea that when you're one of the world's

2128
02:57:51,020 --> 02:57:57,980
leading chemists or something, there's just not that many men that are going to be in that position.

2129
02:57:57,980 --> 02:58:02,700
I got another meme for you. I got in a lot of trouble for this. It's called the tall girl

2130
02:58:02,700 --> 02:58:07,180
problem. If you stand atop your own status hierarchy, it's very difficult to find somebody

2131
02:58:07,180 --> 02:58:11,020
else across and above from yours. If you're a six foot one girl without heels, you're looking

2132
02:58:11,020 --> 02:58:16,540
at professional athletes and two women for every one man completing a four year US college degree

2133
02:58:16,540 --> 02:58:22,700
by 2030. Between the ages of 21 and 29, women earn 1,111 pounds more on average than their male

2134
02:58:22,700 --> 02:58:27,980
counterparts. But women still have this vestigial attraction to the man who is across and above

2135
02:58:27,980 --> 02:58:33,740
from them. That's hypergamy. This means that as you rise up through your own dominance hierarchy,

2136
02:58:33,740 --> 02:58:38,860
it amounts to a opportunity of diminishing returns. Then why are we not allowed to build

2137
02:58:38,860 --> 02:58:48,700
better men? This is this thing that just floors me. I'm now, through being a father, looking at

2138
02:58:51,020 --> 02:58:59,660
the subset of young men who are absolutely looking to crush it. The advice they're being given is

2139
02:58:59,740 --> 02:59:09,980
so horrific. What like? Well, that doesn't seem mentally healthy. I think it's much better for

2140
02:59:09,980 --> 02:59:16,780
you to enjoy this time with everyone else. It's just like watering down raw ambition.

2141
02:59:17,660 --> 02:59:27,740
Is it ludicrous who said, get out of the way? Get out of the way of these people.

2142
02:59:28,460 --> 02:59:35,180
These people want to invest and blow your socks off and just do amazing things. There's some

2143
02:59:35,180 --> 02:59:42,300
administrator or nanny or nurse ratchet who's like, well, that would be arrogant. We can't have that.

2144
02:59:43,260 --> 02:59:51,020
You're saying, I don't think you understand it, but ambition is a necessary input for certain

2145
02:59:51,020 --> 02:59:56,060
humans. If you sit there and say, why do you have a right to innovate when nobody else has

2146
02:59:56,060 --> 03:00:04,140
innovated? Don't you realize that your go-getter personality during the COVID situation was based

2147
03:00:04,140 --> 03:00:09,340
on your privilege? In fact, a lot of other people are suffering from mental health. You're just

2148
03:00:09,340 --> 03:00:16,300
thinking, why am I taking the most promising people and tying them to the most damaged people?

2149
03:00:16,300 --> 03:00:22,620
Why not instead take the most promising people and have them get a PhD by the age of 2021

2150
03:00:22,620 --> 03:00:26,460
and study what to do for their fellow souls who are struggling?

2151
03:00:27,660 --> 03:00:31,500
Do you remember when Elon took over Twitter and he started to rip out the tech team?

2152
03:00:33,180 --> 03:00:37,740
He said, I want to make Twitter a place where the people who want to work the hardest on the

2153
03:00:37,740 --> 03:00:45,740
biggest problems can come and work. People said, they looked at that and said, this is going back

2154
03:00:45,740 --> 03:00:50,460
to an archaic form of Silicon Valley where people are forced to sleep under desks and it's a blah,

2155
03:00:52,620 --> 03:00:58,140
those people do not have theory of mind to understand what it's like to be someone as driven

2156
03:00:59,020 --> 03:01:03,900
as it takes to look at that from Elon, not as modern-day slavery.

2157
03:01:04,860 --> 03:01:09,500
No, he was saying, it can be modern-day slavery or it could be the person saying,

2158
03:01:09,500 --> 03:01:14,220
for God's sakes, I'm burning to solve this problem. Let me go. Let me sleep under my desk.

2159
03:01:16,220 --> 03:01:21,100
Unhook the leash and let me go at this. There is a cohort of people out there for whom

2160
03:01:21,100 --> 03:01:23,900
that's their calling. They didn't want to work at Twitter if they got

2161
03:01:24,860 --> 03:01:29,580
frappuccinos and mindful Monday afternoons off and to be able to play ping-pong for half the

2162
03:01:29,980 --> 03:01:35,340
whatever it was that was going on. They want to go and they want to feel like they're contributing

2163
03:01:35,340 --> 03:01:43,180
to an astronomically-sized goal, an unreasonable goal, and they want to feel the rush of going

2164
03:01:43,180 --> 03:01:51,580
toward it. I think you're right. I think that there is a dampening of ambition. Since being in

2165
03:01:51,580 --> 03:01:57,740
America, since moving to America 18 months ago, the fuel that I've had from the enthusiasm from

2166
03:01:57,740 --> 03:02:03,580
the people I've been around has fueled me and powered me in a way that I wasn't, it was alien.

2167
03:02:03,580 --> 03:02:12,700
I was 33 years old and I'd never felt it before. There's so much to do and it requires ambitious

2168
03:02:12,700 --> 03:02:18,780
people. Those people have to be both arrogant and humble. It's a complicated thing. It involves

2169
03:02:18,780 --> 03:02:27,900
mentorship. I want to say also something about elitism. Elitism is incredibly unfair.

2170
03:02:30,380 --> 03:02:35,500
I've hung out with Stanley Jordan and I am never going to play any instrument the way

2171
03:02:35,500 --> 03:02:42,140
Stanley Jordan plays the guitar. He's an elite object. I am not going to be that guy. You have

2172
03:02:42,140 --> 03:02:48,780
to learn how to let elite people do elite things where you can't compete with them.

2173
03:02:51,100 --> 03:02:56,700
I don't know what to do about this. The idea that we're turning against the concept of elite,

2174
03:02:56,700 --> 03:03:01,500
because we've got this pretend elite that sits in these chairs that screws everything up,

2175
03:03:02,540 --> 03:03:08,940
and you've got all of these ambitious people who are being destroyed by enforced helplessness.

2176
03:03:09,820 --> 03:03:17,180
How do we fire the administrators necessary to return universities to being universities?

2177
03:03:18,620 --> 03:03:29,100
How do we explain that some people are built to fly wingsuits? It's a super dangerous activity,

2178
03:03:30,460 --> 03:03:37,980
but somebody needs that rush or they're not alive. People need danger. They need risk.

2179
03:03:37,980 --> 03:03:44,540
They need to be able to create. They don't need you in their way all the time. I have this very

2180
03:03:44,540 --> 03:03:52,220
strong sense that school has become the most dangerous place that we're pushing so many

2181
03:03:52,220 --> 03:04:02,620
people through school. School is basically destroying vitality. By the time you get

2182
03:04:02,620 --> 03:04:08,220
through this education that is so laden with administrators and people telling you things

2183
03:04:08,220 --> 03:04:16,380
that are wrong, I don't know how to say this, but when a friend of mine gets a call as a

2184
03:04:16,380 --> 03:04:22,460
chaired professor in a technical discipline from a dean who says, we have a little bit of a problem

2185
03:04:22,460 --> 03:04:27,740
with some of your current tweets. What did I say? It's not what you said, but it's that you liked

2186
03:04:27,740 --> 03:04:34,700
somebody else's tweets and you're thinking, I don't care who you are. You'd never talk to a

2187
03:04:34,700 --> 03:04:41,420
professor like that. You cannot have these people. We need the University of Chicago

2188
03:04:41,420 --> 03:04:48,140
to spread its middle finger across the country and get rid of these people.

2189
03:04:48,940 --> 03:04:57,900
You can't talk to them. They're a plague from hell on thought.

2190
03:05:00,620 --> 03:05:10,300
You can't tax all thought by making it nice. Something I really don't know how to communicate,

2191
03:05:10,300 --> 03:05:13,900
but I saw you got Sam Harris a certain amount of trouble, so maybe I'll buy a little bit of

2192
03:05:13,900 --> 03:05:24,060
trouble for myself. You can't have terrible ideas circulating everywhere,

2193
03:05:25,180 --> 03:05:31,500
leading to pogroms and riots and killings. I was just in Istanbul, maybe my favorite

2194
03:05:31,500 --> 03:05:39,260
city on earth, and I was reminded of the Turkish Kristallnacht that happened in the Beolu

2195
03:05:40,220 --> 03:05:45,820
Karakoy area of Istanbul where there was a rumor about the desecration, I think,

2196
03:05:45,820 --> 03:05:52,060
of the birthplace of Adatürk. People died as a result, and ethnic minorities could not be

2197
03:05:52,060 --> 03:05:59,740
protected. You cannot allow free speech to circulate every dumb idea infinitely until

2198
03:05:59,740 --> 03:06:08,140
people are killed in pogroms or holocausts or whatever. You've got two options. You either

2199
03:06:08,620 --> 03:06:14,780
constrain speech by rules or by culture. This is the reason that I was so against

2200
03:06:14,780 --> 03:06:22,940
Myloyanopoulos. You want a culture in which everyone is allowed to burn the flag and it

2201
03:06:22,940 --> 03:06:28,380
doesn't even occur to you that that's something you would want to do. That's culture. You've

2202
03:06:28,380 --> 03:06:36,460
got to load the inhibiting factor on culture. People say, well, that's what cancellation is

2203
03:06:36,460 --> 03:06:41,340
about. It's like, well, but if you misuse the concept of shunning, let's call it by something

2204
03:06:41,340 --> 03:06:48,700
older than cancellation. If you shun people for good questions, if you shun people for

2205
03:06:49,580 --> 03:06:54,860
speaking truthfully and decently as if they had done something horrible, then you lose the ability

2206
03:06:54,860 --> 03:07:00,940
to control bad behavior through social norms. One of the things that I've now come to understand is

2207
03:07:01,580 --> 03:07:08,860
we are either going to restore a culture which shuns only when shunning is really the correct

2208
03:07:08,860 --> 03:07:14,140
course of action, or we are going to have rules that prohibit what you can and cannot say. I am

2209
03:07:14,140 --> 03:07:19,660
absolute in that we should not have rules. We've got to put this on culture and we've got to get

2210
03:07:19,660 --> 03:07:25,180
a culture in which, in general, you are very careful about the negative things that you say.

2211
03:07:25,900 --> 03:07:31,580
One of the things that Milo did that I really disliked was he said, well,

2212
03:07:32,380 --> 03:07:37,100
the purpose of free speech is to protect outrageous speech. The answer is not really.

2213
03:07:38,460 --> 03:07:43,260
Yes, if I'm forced to stand up for your right to say horrible things, I can do that if the

2214
03:07:43,260 --> 03:07:47,820
culture generally retards horrible things. If the culture now starts to encourage it,

2215
03:07:47,980 --> 03:07:56,780
we can't have terrible ideas being the precursor of communal violence, let's say.

2216
03:07:58,780 --> 03:08:03,820
We really shouldn't be having rules determine what we can and can't say. It should be that

2217
03:08:03,820 --> 03:08:09,020
when somebody starts to say something that is the beginning of an incitement to madness,

2218
03:08:09,900 --> 03:08:15,500
that the cultural prohibition against that is very strong. In my recent travels,

2219
03:08:15,500 --> 03:08:21,740
I've been shocked. I've been in Bombay, I've been in Istanbul, I've been in Lisbon, Porto,

2220
03:08:23,500 --> 03:08:29,660
in the islands of the Azores. None of these cities has fallen as far as San Francisco.

2221
03:08:31,500 --> 03:08:39,820
Bombay is madness, but we don't have a homelessness problem in San Francisco. We have a zombie

2222
03:08:39,820 --> 03:08:46,540
apocalypse problem. We have a dysfunctional government problem. When you can't say we

2223
03:08:46,540 --> 03:08:53,020
cannot have this in Union Square, we just can't. We cannot have a zombie apocalypse in Union Square.

2224
03:08:53,020 --> 03:08:58,540
When that becomes controversial in and of itself, you've lost the plot. And partially,

2225
03:08:58,540 --> 03:09:04,540
what's happened is that we've given up on high trust societies where we more or less share

2226
03:09:04,540 --> 03:09:11,900
each other's values. That's the concept of the loyal opposition. We both know what the goal is.

2227
03:09:11,900 --> 03:09:15,740
You have an idea of how to get there. I have a different idea. I agree that we're going to have

2228
03:09:15,740 --> 03:09:20,140
a contest and one of us will win and one of us will begrudgingly go along with the other person's

2229
03:09:20,140 --> 03:09:27,580
idea. When your idea about what a just society is, well, let's vindictively punish successful

2230
03:09:27,580 --> 03:09:31,580
people. Let's pretend that male and female have no difference or all the difference according to

2231
03:09:31,580 --> 03:09:38,860
some set of rules on alternate Tuesdays. Let's decide that we can redefine what a recession is

2232
03:09:38,860 --> 03:09:44,460
or the consumer price index. Let's decide that we don't need masks. Yes, we do. No, we don't. Yes,

2233
03:09:44,460 --> 03:09:52,780
we do because of the science, science, science. Can somebody get rid of these people? We need

2234
03:09:52,780 --> 03:10:03,660
to be in a society that makes some semblance of sense. We cannot go in these opposite directions.

2235
03:10:03,660 --> 03:10:09,260
As far as I'm concerned, when you say, we don't want no more police, you and I cannot be the

2236
03:10:09,260 --> 03:10:18,220
loyal opposition to each other. You're not the kind of a person I even understand. Somehow,

2237
03:10:18,220 --> 03:10:23,820
that idea got into your head and it made sense to you. It's now carrying the day.

2238
03:10:26,780 --> 03:10:33,740
I have always supported some amount of reasonable gun control. I changed on a dime with that

2239
03:10:34,380 --> 03:10:37,660
abolish the police. We don't want no more police to fund the police.

2240
03:10:39,340 --> 03:10:44,140
Are you telling me that people are not going to be allowed to own a weapon and you're going to get

2241
03:10:44,140 --> 03:10:48,620
rid of the thing that was supposed to centralize the violence on behalf of the state and make it

2242
03:10:48,620 --> 03:10:54,140
follow rules? There's no coming back from that. I think that one of the things that we just have

2243
03:10:54,140 --> 03:10:59,420
to learn is that many of the voices that we've been listening to because they got jobs in our

2244
03:10:59,420 --> 03:11:05,180
organs, whether it was the New Yorker or the Washington Post or a professorship at Duke,

2245
03:11:06,060 --> 03:11:11,260
we have to stop listening to these people wholesale. We have to stop being tolerant

2246
03:11:11,260 --> 03:11:17,820
of the intolerant. If you come from a position that is sufficiently extreme and your whole point

2247
03:11:17,820 --> 03:11:24,540
is to try to use and weaponize democracy, to weaponize free speech, to weaponize good faith,

2248
03:11:24,540 --> 03:11:32,540
to weaponize what it means to hold a debate, you need to not really have a voice at the table

2249
03:11:33,180 --> 03:11:39,980
because we don't have a solution. If you say that I am entitled to sit at this table as a

2250
03:11:39,980 --> 03:11:44,620
member of the suicide bombing community strapped with a vest filled with high explosives,

2251
03:11:45,420 --> 03:11:50,220
the presence of C4 in your vest invalidates you being at that table that's trying to come up

2252
03:11:50,220 --> 03:11:55,500
with a solution. If you say fundamentally, I don't believe that we should be having children

2253
03:11:55,500 --> 03:12:01,180
because humans are evil and we need to bring this all to a close, it's very important that you not

2254
03:12:01,180 --> 03:12:10,940
be on the city council because that city is a generational endowment and you hand it to the

2255
03:12:10,940 --> 03:12:16,620
next generation and eventually you don't live there anymore. We are somehow seating people who

2256
03:12:16,620 --> 03:12:23,980
are so nihilistic and so freakishly divorced from anything that we should be able to assume as a

2257
03:12:23,980 --> 03:12:31,820
default. Certain positions that probably had 10 adherents appear to have millions of adherents

2258
03:12:32,540 --> 03:12:40,220
and if we don't get rid of these self-extinguishing theories, we are going to self-extinguish,

2259
03:12:40,220 --> 03:12:47,980
so I believe that civil society has an obligation to stop listening to positions that are avowedly

2260
03:12:48,060 --> 03:12:54,380
self-extinguishing. Eric Weinstein, ladies and gentlemen, Eric, I really appreciate you.

2261
03:12:54,380 --> 03:12:59,580
What's next? What can people expect from you? Have you got anything interesting coming up?

2262
03:13:01,500 --> 03:13:08,860
More than anything, remember that the whole point is when you see a person with a shirt that says

2263
03:13:08,860 --> 03:13:14,780
there is no planet B, look at the night sky and remember that the only way to get to planet B

2264
03:13:14,780 --> 03:13:19,820
is to change what we understand about physics and so look for me on that front.
