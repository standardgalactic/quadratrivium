00:00.000 --> 00:06.560
We can't imagine what it's like as Westerners to live in a country where every aspect of your life

00:06.560 --> 00:10.560
has to be run through a politically correct filter. People here complain about wokeism,

00:10.560 --> 00:14.480
or they hate Trump, and we can sit here and talk about how much we hate Trump, or we hate

00:14.480 --> 00:19.040
wokeism, whatever, and there's no consequences. But to live in a country where even your friends

00:19.040 --> 00:22.880
are turning and spying on you, and you have to watch what you say, and at work everything's

00:22.880 --> 00:28.080
in this context, and every movie, every song, every TV show, every newspaper, how it encompasses

00:28.160 --> 00:30.640
and affects you, we can't wrap our heads around it.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.360
Michael Malis, look at this show. I'm so nervous. Why?

00:37.920 --> 00:41.120
Kidding idiot. Is it because of all of the cameras and lights?

00:41.120 --> 00:45.040
Yeah, yes. I'll be gentle with you. I don't want gentle.

00:45.040 --> 00:49.840
Yeah, I've heard that. So, you were about to have an argument with me. Are you

00:49.840 --> 00:53.280
planned to have a potential argument? No, no, I had an imaginary argument.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.480
Okay. So, do you ever get an imaginary argument with your friends?

00:56.480 --> 00:57.920
Oh, yeah, I fantasize about them all the time.

00:59.920 --> 01:05.440
So, this was the imaginary argument. I've been working on this book as long as we've been friends,

01:06.640 --> 01:11.520
two and a half years, as you would say, and you texted me over the weekend about Louis Ling,

01:12.080 --> 01:17.360
right? And he's chapter two, and I'm like, this can I curse?

01:17.920 --> 01:18.880
Curse away?

01:18.880 --> 01:21.200
This Brit, this bloody Brit.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.960
That's the worst word that you could have used.

01:23.440 --> 01:29.760
I could have called you an Irishman. This bloody Brit has had all this time to read this book.

01:29.760 --> 01:33.520
He's not going to have it done for the interview. He's just going to talk about it

01:33.520 --> 01:38.160
cursorily when he knows how much I worked on it and how much it meant to me and how much I wanted

01:38.160 --> 01:43.920
to hear his perspective as an Englishman because Lady Thatcher is on the cover and she's a main

01:43.920 --> 01:50.320
figure in the book. And I was all prepared to come in Huffin and Puffin and Chris did his homework.

01:50.320 --> 01:54.480
I'm afraid that there's nothing for you to huff and puff about. So, that was resurfaced by

01:54.480 --> 01:59.520
Readwise, which is a highlighting. So, it had given it back to me because it's a relatively

01:59.520 --> 02:04.480
new recent highlight. Now, the Louis Ling thing, it turns out I actually did miss him because

02:04.480 --> 02:09.840
he was on the front cover of a previous book. So, maybe I have missed him once already. But

02:10.560 --> 02:17.680
my head is in a little bit of a spin because for all the everybody that's smart seems to talk about

02:17.760 --> 02:22.800
the Soviet Union and lessons that come out of communism. Lots of people,

02:23.600 --> 02:28.080
the Lexis and the Peterson's of the world or whatever, seem to draw a lot of lessons from this.

02:29.440 --> 02:34.160
I frankly didn't know much about it. If you'd held a gun to my head and said,

02:34.160 --> 02:40.560
tell me when the Berlin Wall fell or tell me who the main characters were in the decline of

02:40.560 --> 02:46.800
communism between the UK, America and the Soviet Union, I wouldn't have known. So, it has been

02:46.800 --> 02:54.720
a little bit like a fast track education through some pretty brutal elements of history.

02:55.520 --> 03:00.640
I didn't know it either. When I sat down to write this, I didn't know any of it. I didn't know

03:01.280 --> 03:07.920
why it was such a big deal that the Berlin Wall fell and what that meant. I knew in a,

03:07.920 --> 03:10.720
I was born in the Soviet Union, but I left when I was like one and a half. So, obviously I don't

03:10.720 --> 03:15.840
remember it in any sense. And though we were raised in my household with kind of Soviet

03:15.840 --> 03:23.760
inspired values for lack of better term, I still had no good idea of what it meant when it fell,

03:23.760 --> 03:30.160
how bad it was, what are the lessons, none of that. And I still don't have a good answer

03:31.120 --> 03:39.760
as to why the Cold War, which was the absolute primary foreign policy concern for over half

03:39.840 --> 03:47.360
a century for the West is like forgotten. I don't, I don't know how to reconcile those two things

03:47.360 --> 03:52.880
because starting from, you know, very quickly after the end of World War II, up through 91,

03:53.520 --> 04:00.320
all foreign policy, whether in Britain, Germany, West Germany, the US, this was the filter. This

04:00.320 --> 04:04.560
was the big concern. Is this person, how is this person going to address the Cold War if you're

04:04.560 --> 04:10.560
talking about a prime minister or a chancellor or a president? And if you ask people who Brezhnev is,

04:10.560 --> 04:16.720
right, who ran the Soviet Union for close to 20 years, what percent of educated, well-read people,

04:16.720 --> 04:22.960
not people who are a little older than us will know, know who he is. It's, it's a tiny percentage.

04:22.960 --> 04:32.800
And so when writing this, I still don't have an understanding as to why it kind of fell on my

04:32.800 --> 04:37.040
shoulders, because this isn't some hipster band that you probably haven't heard of.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.840
This was the Cold War. And yet now, if you talk about it, they're like, oh, yeah,

04:43.840 --> 04:49.360
wasn't that on like Labrador Records? Kitchy history type thing. Yeah. And it's like, this is

04:49.360 --> 04:57.840
millions of people in many countries over decades suffering things that all of us listening to this

04:57.840 --> 05:02.720
and everyone listening to this is in at least a semi-free country would find unimaginable.

05:02.720 --> 05:07.680
Just the, just even the one aspect of the idea of knowing that whenever you're on the phone,

05:07.680 --> 05:13.680
it's tapped, how that would affect your phone calls. Now, you know, we have that here in the

05:13.680 --> 05:20.000
sense of the NSA, but not to the extent where like, if I'm texting you and I'm making a joke about

05:20.000 --> 05:26.960
Trump or Biden, I have to worry, not in the middle of the night, am I going to get fired?

05:26.960 --> 05:31.520
Am I just going to get sat and be sat down by, you know, the authorities and be like,

05:31.520 --> 05:35.520
what did this email mean? How do you know Chris? Who else have you talked about these

05:35.520 --> 05:40.400
things with Chris? And have no, I can't complain to anyone, because if I'm complaining, I'm only

05:40.400 --> 05:44.560
going to make it worse. We can wrap our heads around what that kind of lifestyle is like.

05:44.560 --> 05:51.520
And this was the norm for a lot of people. And that's even the easiest part to deal with.

05:51.520 --> 05:56.640
You know, you just don't talk politics, but the rest of it, you know, it's just was so

05:56.640 --> 06:05.280
pervasive and extensive and for so long and for so many people. And I don't understand how this,

06:05.280 --> 06:10.560
you know, the New York Times has the 1619 project, which focuses on things which we can all agree are

06:11.200 --> 06:16.480
a major historic concern, you know, the slave trade, you know, is obviously, you know, historical

06:16.480 --> 06:22.080
abomination. So the subject matter at least is important, even if there's spin on it, you know,

06:22.080 --> 06:27.200
is a certain skew. But this is something that's just not discussed. And I can't,

06:27.200 --> 06:32.320
I don't even have a hypothesis as to, I know I do have a hypothesis. The hypothesis is,

06:32.320 --> 06:37.920
there's not an easy narrative, right? I had to find this narrative. It's not an easy story of,

06:38.480 --> 06:42.480
you know, it's okay, they're the bad guys, but then why are we teaming up with them in World War

06:42.480 --> 06:47.360
II? And who are the good guys? Are they Reagan? But is it really Reagan and Thatcher? Because,

06:47.360 --> 06:51.600
you know, they weren't entirely the heroes in the eyes of the press. So when you don't have,

06:51.600 --> 06:55.040
like the Vietnam war is another, or the Korean war is called the Forgotten War because it was a

06:55.040 --> 06:59.680
stalemate, right? So since there's no narrative and you can't make it into Hollywood where it's

06:59.680 --> 07:04.560
like good wins over evil, they just stop talking about it. And when you stop talking about it,

07:04.560 --> 07:12.160
you're ignoring what happened to untold numbers of men, women and children who had to suffer

07:12.160 --> 07:17.200
needlessly and who are now being forgotten. And I'm like, I'm going to do something about that.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.920
The complexity of the truth is inconvenient for both sides.

07:19.920 --> 07:26.480
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. So I'm going to try and do my best to summarize

07:27.440 --> 07:31.680
what I think is the reason or the message behind the book, because a good bit of it is

07:33.760 --> 07:40.480
repeatedly being stamped in the face by these very, very uncomfortable, brutal

07:42.160 --> 07:48.640
situations that many people across Romania, Ukraine, but largely in the Soviet Union,

07:48.640 --> 07:55.040
Russia especially, is that they're dealing with. But it's a book that's supposed to be about good

07:55.040 --> 08:01.360
as well, right? It's about good and evil. And it kind of does take a little while for me to

08:01.360 --> 08:06.000
get to the stage where I was like, oh, I kind of understand here. It seems to me that you have an

08:06.000 --> 08:13.360
issue with cynicism being used and weaponized as a reason for people to not have hope.

08:14.320 --> 08:20.800
What you have done is displayed some of the most egregious transgressions of humanity

08:20.800 --> 08:28.320
from recent history. Very recent. This isn't World War One. Since World War One.

08:28.960 --> 08:36.960
Almost exclusively since World War One in 1917, right? Yes. So you've tried to put out front,

08:36.960 --> 08:41.920
this is how depraved and awful and disgusting human existence can become.

08:43.440 --> 08:48.400
And yet it didn't win. Yes. And yet people said that it would never be defeated.

08:49.040 --> 08:54.000
And yet it happened essentially overnight from everything to nothing in the space of no time

08:54.000 --> 09:00.960
at all, which means that when we are facing struggles in future, that degree of hope

09:01.760 --> 09:05.600
should be something that should be continued forward, given that life right now is not as

09:05.600 --> 09:09.440
bad as it was then. So the delta between where we want it to be and where it is,

09:09.440 --> 09:15.280
isn't as big to leap. How far am I off? I think you said it better than I could have.

09:15.280 --> 09:20.000
I would not change one word of that other than maybe delta because people won't get that reference.

09:20.720 --> 09:25.760
And I'm being only a little glib. I think you articulated it perfectly. In one case,

09:25.760 --> 09:33.840
it was literally overnight. When Helmut Kohl, who was the chancellor of West Germany,

09:33.840 --> 09:41.600
he's in Poland with Lech Walesa. And you know, telling this, it's just, this is a very emotional

09:42.400 --> 09:48.640
book for me because when you see the photos of these people and their kids, and you know,

09:48.640 --> 09:54.320
there were times when the people in charge were ready to start shooting them. And someone else was

09:54.320 --> 09:57.840
like, we're not shooting them. And you see these children, it's just like, you know,

09:57.840 --> 10:01.600
it's like, hear these stories of like, I think it was Seth MacFarlane who had a ticket on 9-11,

10:01.600 --> 10:04.960
and he like missed his flight. And he has, I think that ticket framed in his house,

10:04.960 --> 10:09.520
like a plane ticket. It's just like, you know, it's just terrifying when you realize this wasn't

10:10.080 --> 10:16.080
hypothetical. Tiananmen Square was June 4th, 1989. So that year, 1989, when shit's hitting the fan,

10:16.720 --> 10:21.200
you know, East Germany, they're like, we want another Tiananmen Square. And they put the guns in

10:21.200 --> 10:27.040
the hands of the military, they gave them the bullets, they were ready. So you had Helmut Kohl

10:27.040 --> 10:31.840
in Poland with Lech Walesa, who was the head of solidarity and kind of the main figure in

10:31.840 --> 10:36.640
liberating Poland from communist rule. And Lech Walesa says to him, you know, I don't think the

10:36.640 --> 10:41.840
Berlin Wall is going to be around much longer. I think it's going to be like a matter of some,

10:41.920 --> 10:47.440
a few months. And Helmut Kohl laughs in his face. He laughs in his face, like Walesa was,

10:47.440 --> 10:52.000
I believe, 46. Helmut Kohl, I think was 60 or something like that. And he goes, look,

10:52.800 --> 10:58.400
you're young. You don't understand how these things work. They take a long time. It was like

10:58.400 --> 11:03.920
patting him on the head, the head of Poland. And it fell the next day, the Berlin Wall,

11:03.920 --> 11:09.680
the next day. And Helmut Kohl literally says, there were so many quotes in this that I found

11:09.680 --> 11:13.680
that I was just like, I kept, if this was in a movie, it would be ridiculous writing.

11:13.680 --> 11:19.440
And Helmut Kohl says, I met the wrong party and it gets on a plane and gets his ass out of Poland.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
And what else is just great with the fall of the Berlin Wall, I know we're spoiling to the good

11:24.000 --> 11:31.600
parts, is no one even bothered to call Gorbachev, right? So, you know, East Germany is heavily

11:31.600 --> 11:36.160
backed by the Soviet Union. It was kind of a Soviet satellite state as part of the Warsaw Pact,

11:36.160 --> 11:40.160
which was based on the counterweight to NATO. All these countries agreed to have mutual defense.

11:41.600 --> 11:48.960
And Gorbachev wakes up, you know, in Moscow, and there's people dancing on top of the Berlin Wall,

11:48.960 --> 11:53.840
and no one bothered to call him or let him know. And you could only imagine what's going on in his

11:53.840 --> 11:57.440
head. You know, it's just seeing that. But it was the same thing that was going on the head of people

11:57.440 --> 12:04.480
all over the world, because the Berlin Wall for so long was, you know, imprisoning half of a city

12:04.480 --> 12:12.080
or three quarters of a city, in a sense. People were shot, children were killed in prison for

12:12.080 --> 12:18.400
trying to cross it. And then, you know, they're just drunk and blasting their stereos, you know,

12:18.400 --> 12:27.280
to have this thing literally overnight go from a symbol of imprisonment, torture, oppression

12:27.280 --> 12:33.360
to the biggest party on earth is something that I think even now it's hard for us to

12:33.840 --> 12:34.720
wrap our heads around.

12:35.280 --> 12:39.360
Going back to the cynicism thing, why do you think it is that it's so prevalent? Because it's

12:39.360 --> 12:44.240
something that both of us, I think, rail against. Both of us have a particular distaste for people

12:44.240 --> 12:50.640
that are unreasonably cynical. And it's part of the reason that I ended up moving countries

12:50.640 --> 12:56.160
in an attempt to try and be around people who are less cynical. What is it that's so alluring

12:56.160 --> 12:57.920
about that cynical mindset?

12:59.040 --> 13:05.840
I don't know what I hate more than cynicism. You know, maybe like, you know, literal totalitarianism,

13:05.840 --> 13:10.320
but in terms of personality, I don't know what I hate more and what I'm more against, because

13:11.840 --> 13:19.520
it's such an absurd premise that's so easily disprovable. Cynicism, as I understand it, not in

13:19.520 --> 13:27.520
the Greek philosophical sense, but this idea that like, everything sucks, or, you know,

13:27.520 --> 13:32.640
don't get your hopes up, it's not going to work out. As long as you have one counter example,

13:32.640 --> 13:37.520
the thesis is disproven. And you're telling me that like, and like, if people are like,

13:40.400 --> 13:48.560
you know, I agree that most comedians suck. I agree that most movies suck. I agree that most

13:48.640 --> 13:52.240
books suck. I agree that most podcasts suck, especially mine.

13:53.440 --> 13:59.280
None of them. Not one. There's no book that you read that you're a better person having read it.

13:59.280 --> 14:04.480
There's no movie you've seen where you're like, holy crap, I feel like I'm watching something

14:04.480 --> 14:10.080
from heaven. There's no song that you've ever heard that even when you hear it for the 20th

14:10.080 --> 14:18.000
time, it shakes your soul. None. And if you're that kind of person, that's on you. That means you

14:18.000 --> 14:26.720
are somehow guarded or damaged or something within. And I think there is an enormous amount of pressure.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.720
And from what you and I have talked about, it's, I guess, more prevalent in British

14:30.720 --> 14:36.560
culture than America. But there is a lot of pressure of, you know, kind of just head down,

14:37.520 --> 14:42.480
go to the factory, do the work, don't hope for anything better. And it's just like,

14:42.800 --> 14:51.920
you don't have to become a king or a president or a CEO to improve, right? Not everyone has to be

14:51.920 --> 14:59.920
a fitness model to be in better shape, right? If you're someone who's 400 pounds, you can get

14:59.920 --> 15:06.080
down to 250. You're still a big dude. But think how much healthier you are, your clothes, mobility,

15:06.080 --> 15:11.520
walking up the stairs, quality of life in every way. Is that such an unreasonable goal? But for

15:12.240 --> 15:16.640
a cynic, it's like, what's the point? You're still fat. Well, yeah, you are, but come on,

15:16.640 --> 15:23.680
these are extremely different qualities of life. So I think it is a very non-rational,

15:25.280 --> 15:34.080
emotional perspective that tries to present itself as if it's realistic and cool-headed.

15:34.080 --> 15:39.920
It's like, oh, you're naive, you're a Pollyanna. And like you pointed out, the point this book is,

15:40.800 --> 15:46.800
I'm not being hopeful in the sense of nothing bad happens. I'm not being hopeful in the sense of

15:47.600 --> 15:54.560
the bad guys aren't really that bad. The extent of the depravity, I was on my buddy Dave Smith,

15:54.560 --> 15:58.320
he's a very failed comedian, his podcast. And he goes, if you read 90% of this book,

15:58.320 --> 16:01.280
you think it's the black pill. Correct. Because you're reading it and you're like-

16:01.280 --> 16:04.880
That's what I mean. I was like, okay, chapter 10, it was still not here.

16:04.960 --> 16:09.920
And I just one example off the top of my head, I hope I get through without my voice breaking,

16:09.920 --> 16:17.280
because I still read it and it just haunts me to my core. Early in the 1920s, there are these

16:17.280 --> 16:22.160
children who were homeless in Moscow. And they were thieves, pickpockets. You're a kid living

16:22.160 --> 16:26.880
on the streets, you've got to make do. So the Chekha come, the secret police round them up,

16:27.440 --> 16:31.920
and they take them to the cellar of the prison, and they start beating them and torturing them,

16:32.560 --> 16:37.440
and making them who you're working with, who are your colleagues, whatever the term they used,

16:37.440 --> 16:42.800
right? In your gang. They're kids, they don't- So they take them in the car, and they drive

16:42.800 --> 16:46.320
around, they go point out who you're- And at that point, you're like, yeah, him, him, him.

16:46.320 --> 16:51.840
You know, anyone. And then they took them back and they kept beating them. And you hear the

16:51.840 --> 16:57.440
other prisoners, like the adults, hearing these kids, these kids screaming. And these adult criminals

16:57.440 --> 17:00.720
are like, they were losing their minds just hearing the screams. The children, as the children

17:00.720 --> 17:06.240
realized, they were being returned to the cellar. So when you hear about the- So there's no

17:07.040 --> 17:12.960
whitewashing in this book of how bad it gets. You know, but people have this idea that, like,

17:12.960 --> 17:18.000
there's no point in fighting because, you know, it's inevitable that the bad guys are going to win.

17:18.000 --> 17:24.000
But they haven't, you know, like, I'm here, if Hitler had his way, I'd be dead. If Hitler had

17:24.000 --> 17:28.080
his way, you'd be dead, right? Like, you know, Britain was standing alone against Hitler for

17:28.080 --> 17:32.720
quite a while. Or you'd be a slave. I don't know what you'd be, whatever. Point being,

17:32.720 --> 17:38.640
you know, this insistence that villainy always- Why is it, you know, this is the line I had,

17:38.640 --> 17:43.120
you know, when I think about this book, why is it that the bad guys always get what they want?

17:43.120 --> 17:46.800
Well, I can't get what I want once. And when you put in those terms, it's like, yeah, you're right.

17:46.800 --> 17:52.560
And even if I can't, what, I'm just going to be like, eh, too bad. So I don't think it's a coherent

17:52.960 --> 18:00.720
worldview. I think it's a very emotional response coached in the mask of rationality

18:01.280 --> 18:04.640
and realism. And I don't think it's realistic at all.

18:05.600 --> 18:12.080
It's able to give people, it's a much more sort of pedestalized position to be in, right? If you

18:12.080 --> 18:16.480
say that everything's going to be bad, it feels like a well-researched. The critic always feels

18:16.480 --> 18:20.400
like the guy that's well-researched, right? As opposed to the person that's hopeful.

18:21.040 --> 18:26.160
Because the person that's hopeful that things don't happen have... And maybe this is actually

18:26.160 --> 18:30.720
reflected in terms of our neurochemistry. Andrew Huebman taught me about this thing

18:30.720 --> 18:33.600
where if you tell someone that a movie is going to be really, really good,

18:34.160 --> 18:39.520
their dopamine release, even if it's as good as they expect it to be, is less. And if the movie is

18:39.520 --> 18:45.280
less good than they expected it to be, then they lose even more. So what you're doing is by being

18:45.280 --> 18:52.160
the cynic, you're saving yourself from ever being the person that overpromises. So maybe reality

18:52.160 --> 18:56.480
does deliver the world better than you'd hoped. Well, brilliant. That's a bonus for you. And,

18:56.480 --> 18:59.200
oh, well, you know, I'm just trying to keep everybody's feet on the ground. That seems like

18:59.200 --> 19:07.120
a noble cause, right? So you named each of the different chapters, most of the chapters, up until

19:07.120 --> 19:12.080
toward the end, after this famous Einrand speech or passage from a speech that she gave.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.800
Why, what's so special to you about that particular speech?

19:19.440 --> 19:25.680
So there's a... In Prague, there's a museum of communism. And I visited there when I was in Prague

19:26.240 --> 19:32.960
several years ago. And I remember the captions on the different exhibits were worded in a very kind

19:32.960 --> 19:39.200
of idiosyncratic way. Because in a Western museum, you would have it be kind of scholarly,

19:39.920 --> 19:42.640
you know, even the Holocaust Museum, it's going to be kind of...

19:42.640 --> 19:43.520
This is what it is.

19:43.520 --> 19:48.640
Yeah. Yeah. Very kind of emotionless matter of fact. And I remembered that in this museum of

19:48.640 --> 19:54.000
communism, because, you know, the Czechs were under the boot of the Soviet Union for many decades,

19:54.000 --> 19:58.880
it's like, according to, you know, this ideology, we would all have food. But in reality, and thanks to

19:58.880 --> 20:03.360
their demented reality, this demented reality, we were all starving. And there was one caption,

20:03.360 --> 20:07.040
where they talk about how, you know, how like on the side of a pack of cigarettes, it says,

20:07.040 --> 20:10.560
you know, smoking this will be dangerous to your health. Well, in the same way,

20:10.560 --> 20:14.560
living in a communist country will be dangerous to your health. So it was very much like this kind

20:14.560 --> 20:20.160
of FU. And I sent my protege tray was in Prague recently. I go, can you... Because I'm like,

20:20.880 --> 20:24.800
can you take me photos of the captions? And he went through it, send them all. And this was,

20:24.800 --> 20:30.800
you know, over this past summer. And it was really a gut punch. And this was after the book was

20:30.800 --> 20:39.840
largely done. Because that was the first moment when I realized to what extent it encompasses every

20:39.840 --> 20:48.400
aspect of the people living these countries lives. You know, think, we can't imagine what it's like

20:48.400 --> 20:54.880
as Westerners to live in a country where every aspect of your life has to be run through a

20:54.880 --> 20:59.360
politically correct filter. Now, people here complain about wokeism or they hate Trump.

20:59.440 --> 21:04.160
But you can go to the sports game. You can watch some shoot them up movie, you know,

21:04.160 --> 21:07.840
Jerry Bruckheimer movie or something stupid. You can watch How I Met Your Mother. There's

21:07.840 --> 21:13.920
nothing political about it. It's just... And we can sit here and talk about how much we hate Trump

21:13.920 --> 21:18.800
or we hate wokeism, whatever. And there's no consequences. But to live in a country where

21:18.800 --> 21:23.680
even your friends are turning and spying on you and you have to watch what you say.

21:24.160 --> 21:29.120
And at work, everything's in this context and every movie, every song, every TV show,

21:29.120 --> 21:35.120
every newspaper, how it encompasses and affects you, it's... We can't wrap our heads around it.

21:35.120 --> 21:41.120
And, you know, so Rand was testifying in 1947 in front of the House and American Activist Committee

21:41.120 --> 21:48.720
and she was the only person testifying the only witness who had lived in the Soviet Union.

21:49.280 --> 21:54.400
And the Congress people were pushing back at her because they were just like...

21:54.400 --> 22:00.320
Because what she was saying to them was fantastical to them because they were of this idea that like,

22:00.320 --> 22:04.400
you know, we have it one way, you know, the Russians have it a different way,

22:04.400 --> 22:09.600
but people are all pretty much the same all around the world, which is true, you know, to that extent.

22:10.240 --> 22:14.960
And this congressman from Pennsylvania goes like, don't they like have picnics and visit their

22:14.960 --> 22:20.960
mother-in-law? And you could sense the exasperation, her voice, and she says the quote, which is on

22:20.960 --> 22:25.440
the back of the book, where she goes, look, it's almost impossible to convey to a free people

22:25.440 --> 22:29.680
what it's like to live in a totalitarian dictatorship. She's like, I can give you a lot

22:29.680 --> 22:34.080
of details, I can never completely convince you because you're free. And she breaks down,

22:34.080 --> 22:38.720
like, just try to imagine you're in constant terror from morning till night and at night,

22:38.720 --> 22:42.560
you're waiting for the doorbell to ring, where you live in a country where human life means

22:42.560 --> 22:47.520
nothing, less than nothing, and you know it, where you don't know who's going to do what to you when

22:47.520 --> 22:54.640
because there's no rights or law of any kind. And this sense, which I grew up with to some

22:54.640 --> 23:00.640
extent, it was kind of passively fed into me. You've told me about what's that concern that you

23:00.640 --> 23:04.000
have, you sometimes worry about giving people pieces of information because how are they used

23:04.000 --> 23:08.400
against you? Yeah, you run the filter in your head, like the sense of never being entirely safe

23:09.360 --> 23:17.360
is something that I don't think Americans, thank God, can wrap their heads around.

23:17.360 --> 23:22.240
Because they think, I think in so far, emotionally, you can kind of get to the point where, you know,

23:22.240 --> 23:25.920
you go to school and they're teaching you lies and then use favors of full lies,

23:25.920 --> 23:31.360
and then the movies are full of propaganda. So we can kind of get to that. But in the sense of like,

23:31.360 --> 23:39.200
there's nowhere else to go. We can't really appreciate what that's like. So that kind of was

23:40.000 --> 23:46.720
the theme, you know, trying my best. And again, I also can't, I've been to North Korea, but

23:46.720 --> 23:52.320
it's one thing to, beautiful country wouldn't want to live there. It's one thing to visit,

23:52.320 --> 23:57.360
because I knew I could get my ass out, right? It's another thing to be like, this is the entirety

23:57.360 --> 24:03.600
of my reality from the day I'm born to the day I'm going to die. And there's no alternative to this.

24:04.240 --> 24:09.840
And, you know, just how pervasive that is, I don't think any of us know what that's like to

24:09.840 --> 24:16.480
have a life that is effectively without choice our entire lives. It's the difference between

24:16.480 --> 24:22.240
being homeless or going camping. Yeah. Yeah, but, you know, even with homelessness,

24:22.240 --> 24:26.640
it's what if you're homeless and everyone else is homeless? That I mean, that's the difference.

24:26.640 --> 24:31.600
Because when you're homeless, you used to have a home, you could still have a shelter,

24:32.240 --> 24:38.240
you know, there's ways to change your environment. But yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it.

24:38.800 --> 24:44.560
Given the atrocities that occurred throughout all of the 1900s under communism,

24:45.360 --> 24:50.560
how the fuck did people not foresee the issues that were going to occur?

24:50.640 --> 24:56.240
Well, is it only obvious in retrospect?

24:57.680 --> 25:04.320
I think that's a great question. How did they not foresee? I think a lot of people did foresee it.

25:05.280 --> 25:10.800
Mikhail Bakunin, who was Marx's big rival, he had an essay from 1867,

25:10.800 --> 25:15.440
which is in the anarchist handbook, and he just dissects Marxism and you read it and you're like,

25:15.440 --> 25:18.880
this guy not only predicted the Soviet Union, he predicted the problems of the Soviet Union.

25:19.680 --> 25:23.600
Very prophetic. And the quote that if I could sum it up in one sentence,

25:23.600 --> 25:28.480
it's his quote where he says, if the people are being beaten by a stick,

25:29.120 --> 25:32.320
they're not much more mollified if it's called the people stick.

25:33.200 --> 25:39.680
So when you have the, and even if you, the argument was, this is going to be temporary,

25:39.680 --> 25:44.160
right? We're going to have this kind of oppressive dictatorship, the proletariat,

25:44.160 --> 25:49.200
we're going to purge these evil elements from our society. And once that's done,

25:49.200 --> 25:54.960
and everyone's working for the sake of everybody else, and the parasites are kind of destroyed,

25:58.240 --> 26:02.800
my hard work is not going to be going towards Carnegie and having an eighth mansion for him.

26:02.800 --> 26:09.120
It's going to be going towards the people. I'm going to work less. There is a kind of coherence

26:09.120 --> 26:13.840
to it. In the course of time, these methods will be abolished when they've become unnecessary.

26:13.920 --> 26:19.520
Yeah. Yeah. And you know, Emma Goldman, who's on the cover, she sat down with Lenin and she's like,

26:19.520 --> 26:23.680
you know, because the socialist argument was under capitalism, you're free to starve,

26:23.680 --> 26:27.840
right? But under socialism, the individual will be allowed to flourish. So she sits down with him,

26:27.840 --> 26:32.480
and she goes, people are getting locked up for their political views. There's no free speech.

26:32.480 --> 26:38.480
Like this is not what we're about. And Lenin goes, this is like a, like a bourgeois privilege.

26:38.480 --> 26:43.440
Like we're, we're in a time of revolution. Once this kind of civil, Russian civil war settled,

26:43.440 --> 26:47.760
then we're going to be reintroducing freedoms. And it was a complete lie. Once the Russian civil

26:47.760 --> 26:53.920
war, as she saw personally, was stopped, then they just doubled down even more. And even Lenin's

26:53.920 --> 26:59.920
erstwhile colleagues from other, like the anarchists, the, the Mensheviks, they were all locked up.

26:59.920 --> 27:04.560
And when Lenin adopted their views, the Menshevik views, and the Menshevik started pointing out

27:04.560 --> 27:08.320
goes, if you point this out, that is being counterrevolutionary, you're going to go to jail.

27:08.320 --> 27:15.280
So even pointing out the hypocrisy became a felony. So, you know, yeah, very quickly,

27:15.280 --> 27:22.240
it became clear what this means in practice. And God bless her and her partner in crime,

27:22.240 --> 27:28.400
literal crime, Alexander Berkman, they fled the Soviet Union very early on, they went to the West,

27:28.400 --> 27:33.120
they said, guys, this is a complete nightmare. These are people are not helping the workers.

27:33.120 --> 27:40.240
They're like, we're for violence. We're not like pansies here. I try to kill Frick. We're for bloody

27:40.240 --> 27:44.720
revolution. We're for stealing food if you're starving. You're not, but, but this is not what

27:44.720 --> 27:50.080
we're about. They're oppressing the, the say exact people we're supposedly for. And the Western

27:50.080 --> 27:54.640
intellectuals who love having other people do the dirty work, we're like, oh, you don't get it.

27:54.640 --> 28:01.920
Or like, it's fine. So that kind of, to me, was very disturbing. And this is something that happens

28:01.920 --> 28:08.960
to this day when you have these eyewitnesses, you know, speak their truth and testify as to what

28:08.960 --> 28:13.040
they saw. And you have someone who went to Harvard be like, oh, you don't get it. Read a book.

28:15.360 --> 28:19.120
Talking about anarchists, especially in the US, what was the story of Lewis Ling?

28:19.680 --> 28:25.840
Oh, God, Lewis Ling story. I love him. He's such a badass. Lewis Ling was one of seven men. There

28:25.840 --> 28:35.120
was a, in, I forget the year, in the late 1800s, there was a rally in Haymarket Square in Chicago.

28:36.080 --> 28:39.440
This is when they were, after the Civil War had ended, they thought there was going to be a third

28:39.440 --> 28:44.320
American revolution. You had the first one, which overthrew aristocracy and monarchy. The second,

28:44.320 --> 28:47.120
which overthrew slavery. And now you're going to have one, which is going to overthrow the

28:47.120 --> 28:51.120
capitalists. And we're going to have, you know, a revolution here in America and have things like

28:51.200 --> 28:56.160
the eight hour day and, you know, abolish profit and all that other stuff that they liked. And there

28:56.160 --> 29:03.280
was a meeting, public meeting. There were some speeches. It was peaceful, not mostly peaceful.

29:03.280 --> 29:07.920
It was entirely peaceful. The mayor came. He's like, all right, no problem here. He leaves.

29:07.920 --> 29:12.720
Someone throws a bomb. We still don't know to this day who threw that bomb for what purpose.

29:12.720 --> 29:15.600
A lot of cops were killed. A lot of cops started shooting. A lot of people were killed.

29:16.160 --> 29:21.280
They arrested seven people and they put them on various anarchists, some who weren't even there.

29:22.240 --> 29:27.440
Some who had spoken there and advocated peace and they put them on trial is basically,

29:27.440 --> 29:32.000
like you preach this ideology and they charged them with murder, even though there was not even

29:32.000 --> 29:36.960
an allegation that they had thrown the bomb or encouraged it or were like, yeah, more, you know,

29:36.960 --> 29:43.440
Lewis Ling, they searched his house and they found bombs at his house. And his attorney said, well,

29:44.320 --> 29:48.880
my client has the right to have bombs in his house. And which became this kind of meme

29:48.880 --> 29:52.880
before memes were a thing where it's like, he's described to have said,

29:52.880 --> 29:57.200
I couldn't have thrown that bomb. I was at home making bombs. And they imprisoned him and

29:57.840 --> 30:03.760
someone's, we still don't know how, snuck a blasting capsule into his jail. And rather than

30:03.760 --> 30:09.920
me hanged, he detonated his jaw. And he was, if you look at photos of Lewis Ling, it's like a

30:09.920 --> 30:14.400
time traveler because he looks like Channing Tatum or something. He looks like he came out of

30:14.400 --> 30:17.680
Abercrombie at, I think Abercrombie is not doing the like the studs anymore, but whatever, like

30:17.680 --> 30:23.280
when Abercrombie was the thing. And he blows off his jaw, it's hanging. And with his blood,

30:23.280 --> 30:27.440
he writes on the wall, hooray for anarchy. And he dies the next day. He's like, they're not going

30:27.440 --> 30:36.960
to get to me. So he was, you know, people ignorantly romanticized Che Guevara. But he was the first

30:36.960 --> 30:42.800
really, it's like young spirit of violent defiance. And I mean, violent in every sense of the word.

30:43.680 --> 30:51.600
And he really was a, you know, people, the cop who arrested him wrote a book about it. And even

30:51.600 --> 30:55.840
he talked about how people came to visit him in jail because they were so impressed by his like

30:55.840 --> 31:01.920
magnificent physique and what a study was. So he really was a total badass. You know, he

31:02.000 --> 31:07.280
certainly not a good guy, but certainly in terms of literature, this kind of very

31:08.480 --> 31:13.600
specific archetypical figure. What happened to the other six? Oh, they were hanged. One, no, no, no.

31:13.600 --> 31:19.680
What did one apologize? Sorry. They were told if you write for clemency, the governor will

31:20.640 --> 31:24.640
lessen the charges. And some of them are like, I'm not, I didn't do anything. I didn't kill,

31:24.640 --> 31:29.760
I didn't kill anyone. I'm not for murder. I'm not asking for clemency. And they're like, all right.

31:29.760 --> 31:35.680
And in fact, one of them, as he went to the gallows, turns and says, can I address the crowd and

31:35.680 --> 31:39.520
say a few words? And they just killed him right then and there. So they became, and there's,

31:39.520 --> 31:46.480
they got pardoned at posthumously. There's a monument to their, to them in a cemetery near

31:46.480 --> 31:51.280
Chicago. Emma Goldman was repatriated to be buried there as well. The dates on her tombstone are

31:51.280 --> 31:58.080
wrong, which is funny. And the quote for August B's quote is worded several different ways,

31:58.080 --> 32:04.800
but one of them, they're all effectively technically the same meaning. Someday the voices,

32:04.800 --> 32:09.040
someday our voices, someday our voices will speak louder than those you strangle today.

32:09.840 --> 32:13.120
And it's true. How would you describe the

32:15.120 --> 32:19.440
vibe of political philosophy at the start of the 20th century? Because everything kind of

32:19.440 --> 32:24.640
comes out of this, right? We're talking about anarchism around that sort of a time. We're about

32:24.720 --> 32:28.720
to have the First World War. We're about to have the inception of the Soviet Union.

32:28.720 --> 32:31.920
We're about to have this sort of onset of communism and then downstream from that,

32:31.920 --> 32:38.560
everything else happening. What was unique about that period in terms of political philosophy history

32:38.560 --> 32:44.240
that enabled this mix of ingredients to start cooking?

32:44.240 --> 32:49.200
I think a big part of it was the rise of the intellectual, because you had the industrial

32:49.200 --> 32:53.200
revolution happening kind of in that window. And as a result of this, there was a lot more

32:53.200 --> 32:57.520
money going around and there was a lot more opportunity for people to make their living

32:57.520 --> 33:04.480
just being intellectuals. And intellectuals had a much higher status in that society.

33:04.480 --> 33:10.240
They became an emergent class. And also you had these enormous fortunes being generated as a

33:10.240 --> 33:16.240
result of industrialization becoming a thing. Farmers were kind of on the down and instead

33:16.240 --> 33:21.280
you had people building factories and these giant kind of conglomerates that were changing the face

33:21.280 --> 33:26.560
of the world. And you had reactions to this, progressivism, of course, being one of them in

33:26.560 --> 33:32.080
America. This kind of classical liberalism was falling by the wayside because the argument was

33:32.720 --> 33:38.960
not unreasonably, I think, you had these enormous amounts of immigrants coming to the States

33:39.600 --> 33:44.560
from Europe and Eastern Europe and from Ireland and Italy. And they're living in these horrifying

33:44.560 --> 33:50.320
conditions. They don't have sanitation. People are getting injured at work and there's no hope for

33:50.320 --> 33:56.080
them. Children are dying young because there's no birth control and you have a woman who's got

33:56.080 --> 33:59.520
no husband and 13 kids, like what's she going to do? She has to prostitute herself.

34:01.040 --> 34:06.160
So when you have these horrifying conditions, at the same time you have the rise of the kind of

34:06.160 --> 34:10.160
monopolist class, a lot of people were like, all right, something's not adding up here.

34:10.880 --> 34:17.040
So we got to figure out how to square this circle. And there were different approaches

34:17.040 --> 34:20.880
to what that would look like. On the one hand, you had, so what people don't appreciate now is

34:20.880 --> 34:27.120
socialism at the time was really this kind of blanket term about that society has to be managed

34:27.120 --> 34:31.200
somehow for the greater good. It didn't mean the government runs everything necessarily. That is kind

34:31.200 --> 34:36.480
of the strain that went out. But anarchists consider themselves socialists even though they

34:36.480 --> 34:41.600
were opposed to government entirely. So they were kind of, you had in Britain, you had the Fabian

34:41.600 --> 34:49.280
Society coming out, you had the webs. And the Bolsheviks were the ones who won. And I think what

34:49.280 --> 34:53.360
ended up happening, and I don't think this is particularly ambiguous, is all these different

34:53.360 --> 34:58.800
branches of intellectual leftism were like, all right, we've got a shot here. This is the one

34:58.800 --> 35:05.200
country where they're trying it. We have to make it work and give it a shot to see if it does work.

35:05.200 --> 35:10.800
And Eugene Lyons, who was a former communist, a guest on the book, journalist said, yeah, you

35:10.800 --> 35:16.560
guys were looking at the Russians like guinea pigs. And you were perfectly happy to have them

35:16.560 --> 35:23.040
just be ground into nothing, because this was your noble experiment. And they were the ones paying

35:23.040 --> 35:26.880
the price, but you were the ones kind of reaping the benefits. Yeah, that's so interesting. The

35:26.880 --> 35:34.160
fact that even if it wasn't particularly your brand of socialism, your brand of progressivism that

35:34.160 --> 35:41.360
you wanted, even if they weren't getting it right, and the costs that were being, the toll was huge,

35:42.320 --> 35:45.600
if at the end of it, you could have pointed at it and said, well, that was a victory that went

35:45.600 --> 35:52.160
well, that would justify your movement going forward. And in all fairness, as different times

35:53.840 --> 35:59.120
moved on, there were plenty of socialists and leftists who were like, all right, I'm out.

35:59.200 --> 36:07.520
Too much. Yeah, when Hitler and Stalin signed the Rippentrop Pact, and a treaty of non-aggression,

36:07.520 --> 36:12.720
and they basically started becoming buddies, overnight, many of these communist front

36:12.720 --> 36:17.280
organizations in the West changed their names from advocating for being against fascism to

36:17.280 --> 36:21.200
being for peace. Oh, no, no, we got to stay out of the world or two. But there were lots

36:21.840 --> 36:26.880
of progressives, hardcore progressives who were like, they're like, you're shaking hands with

36:26.880 --> 36:32.000
Hitler. Okay, that's a wrap. Like, this is not ambiguous. This is completely where we're against.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.800
I'm out of here. So they still remained, you know, hardcore democratic socialists or whatever

36:36.800 --> 36:41.840
progressives depending on the individual. But in terms of having a love affair for the Soviet Union,

36:41.840 --> 36:47.440
that was a big one for them to swallow. And also just other things like the Hungarian Revolution

36:47.440 --> 36:53.280
and Prague Spring, Afghanistan, these were big, big problems for lots of leftists, but not so much

36:53.280 --> 36:59.280
for people like the New York Times. The Espionage Act was, is that the same thing that's still in

36:59.280 --> 37:07.440
now? Is that the same basis in America for deporting people that have been accused of being foreign

37:07.440 --> 37:11.680
agents and stuff like that? The one that was, I think it was 1916, 1917. Is that the same?

37:13.280 --> 37:18.400
No, I don't, I'm not sure that it is. So what you're referring to is after Leon Chalgas killed,

37:18.800 --> 37:24.560
President McKinley in 1901, and Teddy Roosevelt came in and Tessa Roosevelt said, you know,

37:24.560 --> 37:29.280
anarchisms are the worst people ever. It's worse than slavery and so on and so forth.

37:29.280 --> 37:33.840
And they basically passed a law saying if you're an anarchist or have certain other ideologies,

37:33.840 --> 37:38.160
you can be deported. And there was something called the Red Ark where they rounded up a bunch of

37:38.720 --> 37:42.240
anarchists and radicals, including Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and sent them,

37:42.240 --> 37:48.000
get your ass back to Russia, which if you love it so much. I don't know how, if that is still,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.960
I'm sure it's probably still legally enforced because laws don't ever get repealed,

37:50.960 --> 37:56.160
but I don't know if that's the basis for, if it's being used in a contemporary terms.

37:56.160 --> 38:01.440
Yeah, you said in 1916, keeping us out of the war was a winning slogan. By 1917, it was a crime?

38:01.440 --> 38:06.320
Yeah. So Woodrow Wilson very famously campaigned on, he kept us out of war, right? And Woodrow

38:06.320 --> 38:14.320
Wilson was only the second Democrat to be elected president after the Civil War. McKinley was,

38:14.320 --> 38:17.600
not McKinley, excuse me, Grover Cleveland was elected to two not consecutive terms

38:17.600 --> 38:23.520
because the Republican party just basically ran the table. And since Taft and Teddy Roosevelt in

38:23.520 --> 38:29.200
1912 split the Republican vote, Wilson snuck in, but it was not at all clear that he was going to

38:29.200 --> 38:33.200
get reelected because the Republicans regrouped. They had Charles Evans Hughes, who was a former

38:33.200 --> 38:40.400
governor of New York and Supreme Court justice as the nominee. And it's like, all right, we got

38:40.480 --> 38:44.400
this in the bag, you know what I mean? And it was, I think it was like 3000, 2000 votes in

38:44.400 --> 38:49.920
California decided that election and it went for Wilson and he got reelected. But this was

38:49.920 --> 38:54.320
the big argument, he kept us out of war. And then a few months later, it's like, well, we got to go

38:54.320 --> 38:58.640
to fight war in Europe, which was complete violation of the Monroe Doctrine and what America

38:58.640 --> 39:06.480
stood for since its inception. And very heavily, Wilson introduced, just like Lenin was saying to

39:06.560 --> 39:11.360
Goldman, you know, free speech is kind of this bourgeois contrivance. You can't have it under

39:11.360 --> 39:16.000
times of war. He's saying the same thing. So people who were advocating against the draft,

39:16.640 --> 39:20.960
people who were advocating things like that were imprisoned, including Eugene V. Debs,

39:20.960 --> 39:25.360
who was the socialist candidate for president. He locked him up and it came upon Warren Harding,

39:25.360 --> 39:30.400
who was inaugurated in 1921, to, you know, I don't know if you pardon him or game clemency

39:30.400 --> 39:34.960
to get him out of jail. So they were imprisoning a lot. They were, you know, reading the mail.

39:34.960 --> 39:41.280
It was very much a totalitarian vision. And the excuse was, you know, we have to do this,

39:41.280 --> 39:44.720
because otherwise it's going to be German spies. We have to fight the Kaiser, so on and so forth,

39:44.720 --> 39:49.840
make the world safe for democracy. But these were just complete brazen violation of all sorts of

39:49.840 --> 39:53.280
constitutional principles that are regarded nowadays as a sacrosanct.

39:53.280 --> 39:56.480
Mason What are the principles that the Soviet Union was founded on then,

39:56.480 --> 40:02.640
it's like 1917 at any time. What was the fundamental philosophy or principles that it was

40:03.120 --> 40:07.040
Well, there's the de facto de jure, right? So there's what they said it was, and then there's

40:07.040 --> 40:12.320
what it was in reality. So Lenin campaigned on this concept of all power to the Soviets.

40:12.320 --> 40:16.320
So the idea is you have these localized worker councils and the workers, you know,

40:16.320 --> 40:20.400
now that they're liberated from the shackles of capitalist control, they're going to sit down,

40:20.400 --> 40:23.200
figure out how to run the factory better for themselves. Everyone's going to share in the

40:23.200 --> 40:27.680
wealth. Everyone's going to put in their two cents from each according to his ability. So

40:27.680 --> 40:31.120
you're stronger than I am. So you're going to do the heavy lifting, maybe I'm better with

40:31.120 --> 40:34.720
my little hands with screws. You know, everyone's going to work together. It's going to work out

40:34.720 --> 40:40.640
just phenomenally great. So you have this kind of sense of localized control. But very quickly,

40:40.640 --> 40:47.840
it became, you know, Lenin what Lenin wanted and Trotsky his kind of sidekick. And you had

40:47.840 --> 40:53.440
plays like in New York Times saying explicitly, Lenin is not a dictator. He's just getting his

40:53.440 --> 40:58.880
way because he's smarter than everybody. You know, so like the most pro Lenin propaganda that

40:58.880 --> 41:02.800
even Lenin kind of would maybe shy away from saying with a straight face in the Soviet Union,

41:02.800 --> 41:07.280
because he didn't have some semblance of humility in the West. It was just like this guy's

41:07.280 --> 41:14.160
come to kind of save the world from the bad guys and we own whatever we can to make sure it works.

41:14.160 --> 41:17.040
You said that Lenin was widely regarded as a lunatic.

41:17.040 --> 41:17.760
Yes.

41:17.760 --> 41:18.080
Why?

41:18.800 --> 41:25.280
Well, before this idea that, okay, we're going to come in, we're going to overthrow capitalism,

41:25.280 --> 41:30.800
we're going to because, you know, the Marxist idea is much more radical than what the Soviet

41:30.800 --> 41:35.600
Union even tried to implement because the Soviet Union wasn't theory. It's like putting your ideas

41:35.600 --> 41:40.720
to practice, right? So this kind of concept of, you know, everything is going to be done through

41:40.720 --> 41:45.280
the state and we're going to change the very nature of man, that human being is infinitely

41:45.280 --> 41:50.400
plasticine. You know, early on they were talking about like, okay, what if kids are raised communally?

41:50.560 --> 41:56.080
That was wild. That absolutely took. What was the thing about code on marriage,

41:56.080 --> 42:00.320
the family and guardianship, it was seen as bourgeois to prefer your own children over others?

42:00.320 --> 42:06.720
Right. So what they did correctly or logically is you take the idea of equality

42:07.360 --> 42:12.000
and then you just extrapolate it everywhere you go and it's just like, it leads to consequences.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.240
So here's an idea. So like, let me give you a counter, a counter example that I was in my

42:16.240 --> 42:21.440
North Korea book, Dear Reader, when conservatives say the family is the basic unit of society,

42:21.440 --> 42:26.640
right? So they do that in North Korea, meaning if you commit a crime, Christopher,

42:26.640 --> 42:31.440
like the Williamson family is on trial because it's the next eight generations, but it's a unit,

42:31.440 --> 42:35.840
unit means one, it's not divisible. So if the family is the unit and someone commits a crime,

42:35.840 --> 42:39.600
the family goes on trial. So they are putting that into practice. Now that's not what conservatives

42:39.600 --> 42:43.920
mean, of course, but when you're talking about equality and you mean it thoroughly, it's just

42:44.400 --> 42:51.040
why should one child be advantaged by having loving, wealthy parents? And we have an aspect

42:51.040 --> 42:56.240
of that here, which I don't know that they're all entirely crazy. The argument is, why should I,

42:56.240 --> 43:01.200
who's the heir to the Kardashian fortune as a kid, have all these advantages? I'm never going to

43:01.200 --> 43:06.560
have to work a day in my life. You're born to a mother addicted to heroin in some gutter.

43:07.440 --> 43:11.040
We're not going to start off with the same opportunities. That's not fair. And I think

43:11.120 --> 43:15.360
there's something to that. But if they take it the extreme of, well, why should one kid have more

43:15.360 --> 43:20.000
love or a better parent than another? We're just going to take the kids and raise them all together

43:20.000 --> 43:23.520
by professionals. The government teachers are going to raise them. They're going to be trained in

43:23.520 --> 43:28.560
this. Not like, look, every mom and dad's winging it. That's not fair to those kids. We need to have

43:28.560 --> 43:34.160
professionals and experts raising them. And don't worry, the mom after work can go visit her kid

43:34.160 --> 43:40.320
if she chooses. This was the, the, the model for their whole country. And some of it, they had

43:40.320 --> 43:48.080
enormous pushback and some of it they implemented. But the whole point is this is a new scientific

43:48.080 --> 43:53.200
society. You guys are old, funny dotties. You're doing things just because your grandma did a

43:53.200 --> 43:59.280
certain way. We're starting from scratch and we rebuilding it nice and clean along scientific

43:59.280 --> 44:04.240
principles. None of this emotionalism, this kind of bourgeois sentiment like, Oh, I love my kid.

44:04.240 --> 44:10.400
No, no, no, no, no, no. This kid doesn't belong to you. This kid belongs to everyone. So it's, it

44:10.400 --> 44:16.720
doesn't, it's really, once you put it into practice, you know, in North Korea, as another example,

44:16.720 --> 44:21.040
like in construction, like the women have to do the construction also because women and women are

44:21.040 --> 44:25.040
equal. So they're putting into practice and it's just like, okay, good luck with that.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.600
Is this a warning for what happens if you take

44:27.680 --> 44:29.520
scientism or rationality too far?

44:30.880 --> 44:36.720
Um, I don't think so because I don't think it's really rational because I think that

44:37.280 --> 44:40.800
does it think that it's rational? It does. But I think everything thinks it's rational,

44:40.800 --> 44:48.720
right? Other Nietzsche, right? So this, I, the issue is thinking you're more informed than you are

44:48.720 --> 44:53.200
and not having this kind of understanding the limits or the bounds of your own understanding

44:53.200 --> 45:00.960
of competence. So this kind of love of a mother for her child isn't just like a custom or tradition.

45:00.960 --> 45:08.480
It's my understanding that when a child is born, both the parents have this biochemical reaction

45:08.480 --> 45:13.520
to seeing this kids. We even see with the seagulls, right? If seagulls are raised without their mom,

45:13.520 --> 45:18.160
they can imprint on like a sock with a seagull face and that feeds the kid. But there is this

45:18.240 --> 45:24.560
kind of literal brain connection between the two. They did cat scans on dogs, right? And dogs,

45:25.120 --> 45:29.520
the parts of the brain light up when they see you, their owners as other members of a pack.

45:30.160 --> 45:36.080
So there is that thing kind of that's happening in their head. So as we spoke earlier about

45:36.080 --> 45:43.840
cynicism, when you have this scientific view that emotions don't exist or don't matter or that they're

45:44.800 --> 45:50.880
irrational, emotions are more rational than people give them credit for. And at the very

45:50.880 --> 46:00.400
basis, and apologies to Ben Shapiro, feelings in many ways do inform facts. There is some reason,

46:01.200 --> 46:07.440
I don't know, I can't articulate what it is, why I like this song over that song.

46:07.440 --> 46:12.880
Even if the other song is melodically, compositionally, yeah, feelings don't care about your facts

46:12.880 --> 46:19.520
in that regard. Right, right. But it's not, I'm not liking this song because some capitalists

46:19.520 --> 46:25.280
told me to or because of my, or maybe I am, but I don't think that's entirely, it can be

46:25.280 --> 46:28.560
described entirely that. Because then we'd all like the same songs, that's not the case.

46:28.560 --> 46:34.720
It would be the mathematically best melodically, harmonially best song, yeah. I mean, I see this,

46:34.720 --> 46:38.640
I've been playing around a lot with this in my own sort of personal life, trying to,

46:39.600 --> 46:44.800
after this period of, you know, 600 episodes in whatever five years or something that I've done

46:44.800 --> 46:49.760
on the podcast, and then praying at the altar of cerebral horsepower and cognition and all these

46:49.760 --> 46:55.600
smart people that I've got to spend time with, then trying to reintegrate, I don't know, like some

46:55.600 --> 47:03.440
embodied emotional sense of just knowing and wisdom without sounding too Austin psychedelic-y,

47:03.440 --> 47:11.520
right? Not some woo out there, run to burn the secret shit, just your programming and your

47:11.520 --> 47:17.360
nature and your intuition is able to aggregate more information than your prefrontal cortex is

47:17.360 --> 47:22.160
able to rationalize. Yes. The reason that you crossed the street because that person was on

47:22.160 --> 47:27.120
that side. Why? Break it down for me. Tell me what it was about that person specifically

47:27.120 --> 47:31.680
that you had an issue with. Why? I don't know. I just, it was something I got a feeling. Well,

47:31.680 --> 47:36.000
yeah, because you're able to out the way that they walked, the way that they looked, the body,

47:36.000 --> 47:41.360
like all of that stuff, right? And like I say, from a personal standpoint, now trying to

47:42.480 --> 47:46.320
reintegrate those two things. So when you scale it up to the size of an entire

47:48.000 --> 47:53.440
nation, I can see why there would be, you know, there's conflict within me with this. I can see

47:53.440 --> 47:58.320
why there would be conflict when it comes to trying to build a national philosophy off this.

47:58.320 --> 48:05.520
And also this idea that everything is quantifiable. Like if you asked me to rank all the songs I like,

48:06.240 --> 48:09.680
I don't know that. And that's a, you know, very obvious, very easy example. I don't know that

48:09.680 --> 48:13.600
any people do it. And I think it would be extremely dynamic. You know, there's some days when you

48:13.600 --> 48:17.280
want to listen to that ballad and there's some days when you want to listen to some synths.

48:17.280 --> 48:23.120
So this idea that you could kind of sit down and just figure it out for even one person is

48:23.840 --> 48:26.640
kind of, even if it's yourself is kind of absurd. So

48:27.200 --> 48:32.800
where did this passion for revolution in the Soviet Union come from? Because it's so

48:32.800 --> 48:36.960
Marx, it came from Marx. It's so fervent. Yeah. So Marx was a,

48:38.640 --> 48:45.200
he took the Christian eschatology, this kind of the book of Revelation of St. John, this idea that

48:45.200 --> 48:50.720
we're going to have this, you know, big revolution, and it's going to bring about, you know, the

48:50.720 --> 48:55.680
heavenly kingdom here on earth. He didn't use those terms, but he very much fed, and this

48:55.680 --> 49:03.600
isn't really disputed, he very much fed into this kind of vision of bringing a new world peace

49:04.560 --> 49:09.280
through the state. And, you know, Marx very famously in Engels talked about, you know,

49:09.280 --> 49:12.720
after it all works out, the state's going to wither away because human man, he'll be all equal,

49:12.720 --> 49:16.880
and we won't need the government anymore, and everything's just going to kind of work itself

49:16.880 --> 49:25.280
out. But they really thought that, and they're not entirely wrong, that we are going to create,

49:25.280 --> 49:30.880
now that the industrial revolution has happened, and we have technology, and we have electricity,

49:30.880 --> 49:38.480
we have the capacity to remake reality into something that the world had never seen before,

49:38.480 --> 49:44.240
and something that's going to make things great for everybody. So they were right in the sense that

49:44.880 --> 49:49.920
they now had the capacity to remake society into something the world never seen before.

49:49.920 --> 49:55.280
But there's other examples of this, which is plastic surgery was invented as a result of

49:55.280 --> 50:00.480
World War I, because for the first time, you had these soldiers coming back from, you know,

50:00.480 --> 50:05.680
the front, and they were all deformed and mangled in ways that, you know, hadn't been seen before.

50:05.680 --> 50:10.320
And if you look at googling, you know, first photos, the first people who had plastic surgery,

50:10.560 --> 50:13.760
it's completely nightmarish, you know, but you have to take those halting steps

50:13.760 --> 50:18.400
to get to the point where it's, you know, contemporary Beverly Hills. But this, you know,

50:18.400 --> 50:24.880
this era, this was, you keep in mind in World War I, you had the king, and then you had a Kaiser,

50:24.880 --> 50:28.960
and then you had the head of the Ottoman Empire, and you had, you know, Archduke Franz Ferdinand,

50:28.960 --> 50:35.360
and you had the Tsar, and then you had, I think Italy had a king. So even though it's like 1914

50:35.360 --> 50:44.160
to 1917 and 19, through 1920, in some senses, for us, this is just like another world. I mean,

50:44.160 --> 50:47.440
obviously, Queen Elizabeth just recently passed away, but she was a symbol, you know,

50:47.440 --> 50:51.840
she's not running things. But this was a time where these people really were running things.

50:51.840 --> 50:57.760
And this really was a break from that kind of tradition of aristocracy or landed gentry into,

50:57.760 --> 51:01.440
like, all right, this is going to be the ultimate sense of democratization.

51:02.240 --> 51:07.840
What was happening in the Soviet Union before it became the Soviet Union? Why was it primed

51:08.400 --> 51:13.680
in such a way? Well, I don't think that, well, that's the thing it wasn't. So if you read Marxist,

51:14.560 --> 51:21.120
you know, orthodoxy, what would prime a country for this kind of worker's revolution would be

51:21.120 --> 51:27.840
industrialization, right, and severe monopolization and concentration of wealth. So Marx would expect

51:27.920 --> 51:32.800
it to happen in like the US or Britain or Germany. Yeah, that was not Hargreaves. What was the name

51:32.800 --> 51:36.080
of that factory where everybody kicked off and then they just brought new workers in?

51:36.880 --> 51:41.360
In the steel mills in, I'm blanking on the term right now, near Pittsburgh.

51:42.800 --> 51:46.880
But no, but they would be nationwide. Like, you would nationwide have the workers be completely

51:46.880 --> 51:49.920
oppressed and the workers are going to rise up and it's going to be a worldwide thing. But you

51:49.920 --> 51:54.960
don't go from like this feudal, the czarist, it was basically feudalism, you know, in many ways up

51:54.960 --> 52:00.720
until the czar fell. And you know, people were like working the soil, it was very primitive

52:00.720 --> 52:06.400
conditions. The czar falls, you have the first revolution, they have their parliament, but

52:07.120 --> 52:11.200
people had been under this thumb of czars for hundreds of years, they're not used to

52:11.200 --> 52:18.320
representative democracy. The parliament had very little power to do really anything. And then when

52:18.320 --> 52:24.960
Lenin came in and basically seized power in 1917, late 1917, it was like, no one really

52:24.960 --> 52:28.560
know what that meant. It's like, okay, the Bolsheviks are running things now. And they very

52:28.560 --> 52:32.400
quickly realized what it meant that he wasn't messing around. This is a different breed.

52:33.440 --> 52:37.120
Yeah, this isn't like the difference between like the Democratic Party and the Green Party.

52:39.920 --> 52:47.360
One thing that I didn't know was that the original inception of this was in the hopes of

52:48.160 --> 52:54.560
becoming the first, the tip of the spear of a worldwide movement, that the Soviet Union would

52:54.560 --> 53:00.080
be the test case. They almost saw themselves as the opportunity to prove that this could happen,

53:00.080 --> 53:03.280
and then from there, they would... They did see themselves that, yes. Very explicitly.

53:03.280 --> 53:06.720
But what you've got, what you mentioned earlier on that we'll get onto with regards to the press

53:06.720 --> 53:14.560
and the way that this was interpreted and responded to in the US specifically, you had some people

53:14.560 --> 53:20.000
in the US that were seeing it as that experiment too. So you had a kind of collusion, like a

53:20.000 --> 53:24.240
philosophical collusion that was going on across the Atlantic.

53:24.240 --> 53:29.520
Well, it wasn't just a collusion. So this was the big argument between... A lot of times in politics

53:29.520 --> 53:35.040
to this day, you'll have there an in religion. You have the putative argument where it's like,

53:35.040 --> 53:40.240
all right, you had the argument between the Gnostics and Orthodox Christianity. Is Christ

53:40.240 --> 53:45.120
co-equal with God the Father or is Christ subordinate to him? That's the Aryan heresy, I

53:45.120 --> 53:50.480
believe. But a lot of times just about power. You just have an excuse to fight one another.

53:50.480 --> 53:57.520
So Trotsky, who was again Lenin's right-hand man, he had the vision, which is more in line with

53:57.520 --> 54:04.160
Orthodox Marxism, that instead of thinking of nations, you think of classes. So the workers,

54:04.160 --> 54:07.440
workers of the world unite. You have nothing to lose, but you're changed. That's the great Marxist

54:07.440 --> 54:16.320
quote. So his idea is the working class in Russia have more in common with the working class in

54:16.320 --> 54:21.760
America than they do with the bourgeoisie in Russia. And that makes a lot of sense. And this

54:21.760 --> 54:26.400
is one of the reasons they were very much against the Great War. They're like, why are the workers

54:26.400 --> 54:33.680
and the poor losing their lives for the sake of czars and sultans and kaisers? We're the ones who

54:33.680 --> 54:38.560
pay the price for the wealthy. This is absolutely obscene. This is our opportunity to, you know,

54:38.560 --> 54:42.080
what they would call imperialist wars or capitalist wars, put a stop to it and have the

54:42.080 --> 54:46.960
workers of the world basically unify and create this, maybe not literally a paradise, but certainly

54:46.960 --> 54:51.280
the next generation of humanity. You know, when Stalin came in and he saw that wasn't happening,

54:51.280 --> 54:57.520
he was like, all right, you could have socialism in one country. But that was kind of the idea that,

54:57.520 --> 55:05.120
all right, it's going to start here. And this was a very real concern because Marxism predicted

55:05.680 --> 55:11.440
that capitalism would be destroyed by its own contradictions, right? And then 1929 happens.

55:11.440 --> 55:16.800
You know, this is 12 years after Lenin ceases power in what became the Soviet Union. You have the

55:16.800 --> 55:21.360
Great Depression. Things are unprecedentedly bad for unprecedented long time. There have been

55:21.360 --> 55:26.480
depressions before, but they never went out for that longer, that badly. People are looking around,

55:26.480 --> 55:30.240
and all the Marxists are saying with a straight face, we predicted this,

55:30.960 --> 55:35.120
and now you're seeing our predictions. And people, a lot of people were like, all right,

55:35.120 --> 55:40.720
there's this, these are the death throes of capitalism. And in that sense, FDR, you know,

55:40.720 --> 55:47.840
who is, you know, reviled by many conservatives can be seen as the right wing response because

55:47.840 --> 55:53.280
the alternative to FDR wasn't Calvin Coolidge. The alternative to FDR was very easily could have

55:53.280 --> 55:58.400
been a worker's revolution and having a communist dictatorship here in the States.

55:58.400 --> 56:02.720
What was that quote about? The capitalist will sell us the rope and we'll tie the news.

56:02.720 --> 56:06.400
Yeah, Lenin is alleged to have said, and apparently he never did,

56:06.400 --> 56:09.840
that the capitalist will sell us the rope with which we'll hang them.

56:09.840 --> 56:15.520
Yes, that was it. Yeah, that's funny. And then, do you think that he was actually true when he

56:15.520 --> 56:22.480
said that once we've reached the utopia that was supposed to this communist utopia, that we will

56:22.480 --> 56:30.400
be able to discard these methods? No, because the reason communism doesn't work isn't simply due to

56:30.400 --> 56:35.360
the human nature being bad, which doesn't even make sense, because if you are basing your philosophy

56:35.360 --> 56:39.760
on human nature, it is the basis for your philosophy. You can't say it's good or bad. It's like saying,

56:39.760 --> 56:44.240
well, I'm going to build an airplane and it's going to let people fly from their own power,

56:44.240 --> 56:48.480
but the people are bad. Well, if you're building around people can't fly, the problem is in your

56:48.480 --> 56:54.720
program, not in the person or you're building around. The problem is calculation. So without a

56:55.520 --> 57:02.160
market to set price, you do not know how much to produce. So a very obvious example is you don't

57:02.160 --> 57:07.040
know and have to know anything about comic books at all. But if you go to a comic book store and

57:07.040 --> 57:14.320
you see Detective Comics number 26 is $500 and Detective Comics 27 is $50,000 and Detective

57:14.320 --> 57:20.960
Comics 28 is $6,000, something about number 27 is special. You don't have to know it's the first

57:20.960 --> 57:25.520
experience of Batman, but you do know how to know is that either supply of this issue is very low

57:25.520 --> 57:31.680
or the demand is very high, but even not knowing the facts as to why that price is information

57:31.680 --> 57:38.400
about this is something that the market is asking for more of. But if I am setting a price, if I am

57:38.400 --> 57:45.760
as the government saying Detective Comics number 27 is going to be sold at $1,000, very quickly it's

57:45.760 --> 57:48.960
going to be a complete sold out everywhere. You're not going to be able to find it because it's way

57:48.960 --> 57:52.640
below the market. If you're going to be able to sell it's maybe going to be at the black market

57:52.640 --> 57:59.120
and that's going to be a blank store shelves. On the other hand, if I say we're going to produce

57:59.120 --> 58:03.600
X amount of copies of Detective Comics 27, then you're going to have these massive surpluses

58:03.600 --> 58:07.200
because at a certain point, if you don't have the price, you don't know how much to produce.

58:07.920 --> 58:12.400
Without having a price mechanism, you can't have central planning work because it's not

58:12.400 --> 58:17.280
going to have information about how much you need because at the same time, even if I tell you the

58:17.280 --> 58:25.360
commissar, listen, my factory needs a hundred more nails, those nails are still competing with screws

58:25.360 --> 58:32.400
and bolts, but also bread and milk and cars and CDs and computers. Every product is in

58:32.400 --> 58:37.040
competition with every other product and a currency is what kind of adjudicates those disputes

58:37.040 --> 58:42.240
between the demands. But if you're just telling me I need 50 nails and he's telling me I need 50

58:42.240 --> 58:48.240
pacemakers, both are in need, how do I figure out which is needed more and that's what price

58:48.240 --> 58:53.760
indicates. Is that the fundamental structural issue when it comes to communism? Well, when it

58:53.760 --> 58:58.800
comes to central planning, yes, in my opinion. What else? What are the other elements? Well,

58:58.800 --> 59:04.640
I think the other elements, it's very, very expensive to try to, in every sense of the word,

59:04.640 --> 59:10.640
to try to force a population to live according to your ideology. At a certain point, you need a

59:10.640 --> 59:15.920
lot of them to buy in or to have it enforce themselves because you can only pay so many police

59:15.920 --> 59:19.760
to beat so many people. And at a certain point, people are like, I don't want to be beating

59:19.760 --> 59:25.760
people anymore. Is there an argument to be made that in that case, a capitalist system that applies

59:26.320 --> 59:33.600
status and gives prestige to people who are the most productive, they are allowed to accrue that

59:33.600 --> 59:38.960
through the agreement of other people saying that, yes, your job title and high rise office is

59:38.960 --> 59:43.360
something that quite rightly you should feel proud about. Is there an argument to be made that

59:43.360 --> 59:48.320
capitalism is just a more nefarious way of motivating workers to do the exact same thing?

59:48.320 --> 59:55.440
Well, I don't think that CEOs are held in the same regard in any capitalist country

59:56.000 --> 01:00:03.920
as Stalin was. You know, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk is like, there was, I think maybe he's number

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:10.000
two now richest person on earth. The way people are shit on Elon Musk, 25, 8 on Twitter alone,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.600
even before he bought Twitter, there was no shortage of people condemning Elon Musk or condemning Steve

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:25.120
Jobs or condemning Bill Gates, George Soros. I don't think successful CEOs other than,

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.920
what's his name, who run Apple for many years with the turtleneck before he died.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.400
Tim Cook? Oh, what? Steve Jobs.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:36.080
Yeah, Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs, maybe he's on a pedestal. I'm thinking of Jeff Bezos,

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:42.960
sorry, I got this confused. I think very few CEOs are regarded with any sort of reverence

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:49.360
in the same way that the kind of leaders in these countries are expected to be revered.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:55.840
You're not hanging up a photo, even if you're a big shit poster of Elon Musk in your house.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:02.800
Would it be right for me to characterize the two prongs, the two sort of most brutal prongs of

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:10.240
existence in the Soviet Union? One as being the food and lack of access, so famine on one side.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:17.280
And then on the other side being the combination of state police and sort of state enforced

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:24.800
surveillance from the population on itself, that those would be, it seems like that gets an awful

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:31.840
lot of focus, not on a food and too much brutality coming from the state and also

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:39.040
like caused by its own population on itself. But I think in the West,

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:44.960
we can look at things as discrete issues, right? We can say it's a problem that

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:50.240
none of people have access to healthcare, even in places without the NHS, right? We can say that

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.200
education is an issue, they're teaching kids things that they shouldn't and they're not teaching

01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:00.400
kids that they should. Or we can talk about pornography with young men, too many people

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.720
are consuming pornography, it's deleterious to the health. But these are looked at in a way as

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:12.240
kind of discrete issues. I think the issue with totalitarianism is you don't get to separate out

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.680
these things, like everything feeds into another. And it's not, and it's kind of like if you remove

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:23.520
the secret police, you still have, you know, you're at school all the time, you're learning

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:30.160
all this stuff, you're still consuming the media with all the issues. The fact that your job

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:35.280
is basically assigned to you at a certain point being late to work became a felony,

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.720
even though it was not at all reliable, the public transport system in these countries.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:51.680
So I think we could both sit here until we're blue in the face, but until we've lived in these

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:57.840
places, we are not going to know what the worst part of it is. It's kind of like, it's kind of

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:04.320
like Plato's Cave. Just how bad did the famine get? Which one? Well, I mean, pick whichever

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.480
of your favorites there was. Well, I didn't have any favorites, most certainly. But if you're

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.440
talking about the Holodomor in the early 1930s, you know, Stalin's war in Ukraine,

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:18.160
Red Famine is a book by Ann Applebaum, which I recommend enormously, even though she's

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:27.360
got some pretty bad TDS, which doesn't at all take away from the enormous service she's done

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:33.920
in her research. They just decided, all right, we're going to liquidate the Kulaks.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:40.800
And the Kulaks were these kind of wealthy farmers and very, and we're going to kill them or deport

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:46.880
them to God knows where with their families. But very quickly, a Kulak became anyone who owns

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.240
like a cow. And a Kulak became someone in your village you don't like. You just got to turn them

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.720
in, accuse them of being a Kulak, and then you're rewarded with a grain for your family. So the

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:02.800
incentives were very heavily to turn on your neighbors. And you weren't allowed to leave your

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:11.520
village. And they took as much grain as they could. And they sold it for export. And people,

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:16.880
I mean, the levels of starvation were in the millions. And this was by design. So they came

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:21.680
back in the middle of the night, you know, these activists to search houses. And if you, they could

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:28.240
look, this is the sick thing that I learned about the Haldimor is your own body would betray you.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.240
They could take one look at you and see you're not starving. That means you're

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:37.200
less gaunt than you're less gaunt. That means you're hiding food, whereas the food. And if you

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:43.360
don't give me the food, that means I know you're hiding it. So that means I'm entitled to burn

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:49.120
down your house and put you out in the winter in the Ukrainian winter. And good luck with that.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.480
Because if you don't, if you're not handing it to me, you must be hiding it. And therefore,

01:04:52.480 --> 01:05:00.880
you're a Kulak. And what else ended up happening is in the rest of the USSR, they were told you

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.560
don't have food because the Kulaks are hoarding all the grain. They were created this kind of

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:10.880
national outgroup. And then there was this kind of level of hatred, which was later kind of

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:16.240
paralleled with Hitler against the Jews, to the sense of these people, you're suffering because

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.960
these people are, you know, they're getting wealthy at your expense. And there was this one

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:27.280
very disturbing story of this young woman who made her way to the city. She got out of her village

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:34.000
starving on a line begging for food. She had like a crust of bread in her hand. And the storekeeper

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.560
is like, this is what you filthy Kulaks, this is what you deserve. And God help anyone who helped

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:43.040
her. And then she died on the spot and everyone was basically happy about it because it's like,

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:46.480
we're on this line. There's no bread in the store because of her and people like her.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:53.600
I don't think that it was the same famine, but there's a story about babies that were so hungry

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:58.640
that they cried for so long that they couldn't even cry anymore. And there's a story about a mother

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:02.080
whose baby was crying and then the mother just started beating the baby.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.240
Yeah, Dave Smith brought up that. That was the story that got to him the most.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.880
That's pretty disturbing. Yeah, like, you know, people started swarming these train stations to

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:17.120
try to get out of wherever they were. And there was just this one scene where this mom and she's

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:23.840
lost. And when the human body is starving for that long, the mind starts degenerating and,

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:28.160
you know, it's functional insanity. And she's there and the kids crying because there's no milk

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:32.880
coming out. And she snaps and she starts beating the crap out of her kid from everybody. And then

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:40.480
she kind of reverts to normal. And, you know, that was one of those scenes where it didn't get to

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:48.480
me that much because it's so removed from any... No reference point. I have no reference point for

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:54.880
this. Like, I can... It's hard for me for any of us to imagine what it's like being that hungry for

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:59.600
that long, right? Even that is like, I mean, I know people who've been on the show Survivor,

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:04.080
but they know that at any minute they can get to food and they're only there for third days, Max,

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:09.120
and, you know, they're in a tropical paradise, you know, so on and so forth. And even so that's

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:13.600
bad, but, you know, they like you get used to it. But that's the closest, you know, any of us are

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:22.160
going to get to understanding what that's like. And the thing that is really... I would think the

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:28.560
darkest aspect is not just the hunger. It's the knowledge that this isn't changing. Like, this,

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:35.360
there's no hang on, you know, we're in war. Once this war is over, you know, it's like, no, no, no,

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:40.320
this is peacetime. And you're not allowed to leave your village. And if God help you,

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:44.880
if you find food, it's going to be taken from you. I can't wrap my head around it.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:48.640
And if you don't produce enough food, then we're going to ask you to produce five times the amount

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:53.520
of food that you didn't produce. And accuse you of stealing it. Yeah. Was this organized?

01:07:53.520 --> 01:08:00.160
Was the famine... So the famine was created by the state? Yes, by Stalin. Why?

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:06.960
Because he wanted to break Ukraine. He wanted to break... He wanted to collectivize the countryside.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:12.480
And for a long time, the Ukraine is very famously known as the bread basket of Europe because they

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:17.680
had these fertile lands and so on and so forth. And they were producing all the crops. And he's

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:22.800
like... And the Ukrainians, obviously, historically into this day, spoiler alert, have enormous amount

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:27.520
of rivalry, if not contempt for the Russian people and vice versa. And he's like, all right,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:35.920
Ukraine became part of the USSR. And he's like, we have to break Ukraine and break the spirits

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:42.240
of the people and not have any semblance of resistance to our scheme. And in this, he succeeded,

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:50.880
maybe not entirely, but very heavily. Who is Walter Duranty? Walter Duranty was...

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.640
You did his voice for the promo commercial because he was British. He was the New York Times man in

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:02.400
Moscow. He won a Pulitzer. He got to interview Stalin, which was an enormous accomplishment for

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:11.200
a Westerner. And while this starvation, this war on Ukraine, and it wasn't just Ukraine,

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.840
of course, people were starving all over the Soviet Union. That's where it was localized,

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:20.480
I want to be clear. He was writing in the New York Times how people who are saying there's hunger,

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:27.840
it's just anti-Soviet propaganda. And the quote is, there is no famine, nor is there likely to be.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:32.240
The Russian people are merely tightening their belts. Now, that's a very unfortunate choice of

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:36.240
words. I'm not trying to even be humorous. You only have to tighten your belt when you don't

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:40.080
have enough food. It's not a fashion choice. It means your pants are falling off because you're

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:46.080
losing weight. And you lose weight in two ways, diet and exercise, which they weren't doing,

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:52.480
or lack of caloric intake. And while this whole thing was happening, he's repeatedly

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:57.520
talking about how it's the people who are complaining or just the loud mouths,

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:03.760
everyone else is busy doing the work and putting time in the fields and producing so and so forth.

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:09.680
The Russians have tightened their belts before. And when Gareth Jones, who was another, who was a

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:14.400
British journalist, figured out what was happening because he got off his train to stop early and

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.560
just walked through the countryside and saw for himself what was happening, the entire Western

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:23.360
press corps, either there's differing accounts, whether this was, they sat down and said,

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:27.040
dude, consciously, or they just did it because they knew what their marching orders were,

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:33.200
called him a liar and a propagandist and so on and so forth. And Duranty was the one who took

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:39.840
charge of this whole campaign to smear him as a complete fraud. There was a second one,

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:44.000
another British man, Malcolm Ruggeridge, whose parents were members of the Fabian Society,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.440
who was a hardcore lefty, he got information as well. And then as a result of this, when he kind

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:56.560
of leaked the news of this kind of manmade atrocity, he was basically couldn't get work

01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:00.560
after that because whether it was because he had the wrong politics or whether because he

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:07.840
exposed his colleagues as worse than fools, as in league with the devil, he paid the price.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:13.600
Well, that's the question. Walter Duranty wasn't giving an accurate account of what was happening

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:19.520
inside the Soviet Union. As he later admitted, yeah. Why? What was his motivation for?

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:29.120
I think it's very hard to get into the heads of someone who is putting his name front and center

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.920
in terms of denied genocide. I mean, I have all the quotes are in the book where he explicitly said,

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:39.920
there's no need for anyone to go to these villages for a reporter to tell people,

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:45.440
you don't need to go check it out for yourself in a country which he would clearly admit is quite

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:52.960
secretive, is to me, unconscionable. I mean, whatever the motivation was, it can't be good.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:59.040
The best I can think of that would make the most sense to me is status. He was the dean

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:07.040
of the Moscow Press Corps. He was the big shot. And basically, if it's revealed that he doesn't

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:11.200
know what the hell he's talking about as it was, and as he admitted, it's like, well, then what

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:16.160
good are you? So, Opton Sinclair has this quote that's described to him. I think he actually

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:20.320
did say this one where he said, it's almost impossible to convince a man of something

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:25.120
when his salary is dependent on him not being convinced of it. So, it might be as simple as that.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:33.600
Yeah. I don't know. He seemed like a very... I couldn't work out his motivations. I couldn't

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:40.400
work out whether it was complicity, whether he had political sympathy for what was going on over

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.960
there, whether it was simply the associated reflected glory and status that he was getting

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.960
from having this sort of access to people that no Western journalist would or should do,

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:56.640
perhaps a blend of all of them, I suppose. One of the other things that happened, obviously,

01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:00.720
downstream from... Or maybe there's also a theory that he is being blackmailed to some extent.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:04.400
That would make some sense that the Russians had some intel on him and they didn't want it revealed.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:10.240
Who knows? That's interesting. One of the other things that happens downstream from there being

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:15.040
widespread famine, actually, going back to the famine for a second,

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:24.400
if the use of the famine from Stalin was to beat and erode the Ukrainian spirit,

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:32.160
surely, they could have considered, we might just kill them all. It might end up us having no

01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:39.120
people left in the Ukraine to conquer. Well, I mean, they killed a... They sure killed a lot of them,

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:46.800
but I think it was... I don't... That's a good question. I wonder if that was a concern.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.760
I guess... Because they were given some grain. It's not like they were given literally none,

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.320
they took it all, but they gave some back. Yes.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.680
So what happens downstream from a famine? Next thing that happens is you have

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:08.560
an ever-increasing paranoia within the people who are in charge of what's going on

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:16.960
among the populace. And this... I mean, there's a story where... Is it Stalin who gives the

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:25.840
police and a quota for each different area? I need 10,000 criminals from this region and

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.480
this region and this region and this region, which kind of like the kids from earlier on

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:35.440
drive around and tell us who your accomplices are, caused the law enforcement to go around.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:40.320
They were retrofitting the number of criminals to their quota for criminals,

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.680
as opposed to catching people that were doing crime.

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:49.600
Yeah. This is something that I think, again, Westerners have a hard time wrapping their

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.720
heads around and even I have a hard time wrapping my head around. Stalin would sit down

01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:00.480
and he'd have a piece of paper and he'd be like, all right, in Kazakhstan, you need to arrest

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:06.400
50,000 people or whatever the number is in St. Petersburg or Leningrad. You need to

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:11.600
arrest 10,000 in Lviv. You need to arrest this many. And it was the job of the

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:17.280
NKVD or the KGB, whatever it was at the time, to be like, all right, this is how many people

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:24.320
we have to find. And his last of the secret police heads, Beria, is most known for his quote,

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:30.240
show me the man, I'll show you the crime. And they prided themselves on getting confessions out

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:36.240
of people who were perfectly innocent. And the argument is, well, if we arrested you,

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:41.440
you must have done something. And if you're saying that we're arresting innocent people,

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:46.240
that in and of itself is being counter-revolutionary and criticizing the government. So that in

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:54.480
itself is a crime. So yeah. And my understanding is these lists are still in like the archives

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:58.080
in the Kremlin, like they still have them. This isn't just like hearsay, like they have the piece

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:01.360
of paper where he's got the names of the different places and the numbers.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:04.880
What were some of the tools that they used to extract confessions from people?

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:16.160
That was a very hard section to write about. Because I think people here, we think about

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:20.240
like what the police will do to get a confession out of you. It's like, okay, they're going to

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:24.480
yell at you, they're going to rough you up, you know, things like that. It's like, all right,

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:31.040
that's what we're used to as like police brutality. So at a certain point, they lower the death

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:42.880
penalty for children. So I think it was 12 or 14. 12. And this became, this was a big problem for

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:47.680
defendants of the Soviet Union, because this wasn't like hearsay, this was public. And they're like,

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:55.280
what are you doing? And one of the reasons what they were doing is if they would arrest people,

01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:01.280
they would have a death warrant for that person's kid signed on the desk of the interrogator.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:08.880
So, you know, your dad, who I got to meet a few weeks ago in Austin, he's come in, he knows he

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.440
didn't do anything. Look, I'll just talk to them, it'll be fine. And there's the death warrant for

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:20.080
Chris, in his view, signed. Like it's ready to be delivered. He'll confess to anything. I mean,

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:25.040
they were having Jews confessing and working for Hitler. And there was another time when, you

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:28.880
know, they brought in someone who was an old Bolshevik and the old Bolsheviks were the people

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:32.560
who fought the Tsar. They were like the terrorists of their time, like people who were fought with

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:36.320
Lenin. And they were hardened men, you know, the Bolshevik would arrest them. They had the

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:42.160
Gatorga system, which presaged the gulags and they'd send them to Siberia, you know,

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.600
middle of nowhere. And these men did that time for their political views. And they brought in one of

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:54.560
them. And they called his, I think it was his mom or his mother-in-law and check it because she's

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.960
watching his kids right there. And it's like, oh, are your kids okay? And they're like, yeah.

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.800
And so they just turned them. He's like, okay, I'll sign whatever you want, you know. So when you,

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:07.680
again, there's something that is hard for us to understand the West. You know, we are all used

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:12.640
to these movies where like, you know, someone's brought in, Tom Cruise is tied to a chair and

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:17.280
they're beating the crap out of him. He's like, spitting blood at them. He's just glaring at them.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:24.080
You bring in, it's like, we have your kids. The calculus is, and you know, they're not bluffing.

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:28.320
It's not like we have them, but like, you know, we don't really want to do anything. Like, they

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:36.320
don't care. And you know, they don't care. And when that happens, I don't think any of us can

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:39.040
understand what our thought processes would be like.

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.320
What was the conveyor?

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.880
Oh, so the conveyor, yeah, there were so many different techniques that they used.

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.880
The conveyor, it was called a conveyor because, you know, they'd wake you up in the middle of the

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:54.800
night and someone would be yelling at you for four hours to confess. And they'd make you write

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:59.760
down your whole life story and they rip it up and write it again. And then every element's go,

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:03.840
oh, so when this happens, and then when the guy who's interviewing gets tired, they just bring

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:08.160
somebody else like conveyor belt and you're up for days at a time. And as soon as there's any

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:12.400
discrepancy and was the movie you and I went to see, was it Amelie or was it the Southern movie?

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:17.120
Oh, why were you lying about what movie you saw with Chris? And then it's like, okay, so now

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:22.640
they have 10, this is 10 times you lied to us. Look at, you're not a trustee. It's very easy

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:27.760
when someone hasn't slept, when every little slight details being examined, and the guy's just a

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:34.400
fresh one through the door. And the thing is, the interrogators often knew this guy hasn't done

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:38.640
anything. It was just like, he's got a job to do to get you to sign that piece of paper.

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.640
And the quicker we could do this, the quicker we could get on with our lives.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:48.640
There's a study that was done on TSA agents in airports. And what they wanted to see was,

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:56.720
if given a outcome, will people retrofit reality in order to be able to achieve it?

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:03.440
So the original study was actually faces that were either angry or happy. And there was 100

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:08.560
images and you had to pick between them angry, happy, happy, happy, angry, angry. But after the

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:14.240
first 50 images, it was only angry images. But people still kept on picking happiness out of

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:20.720
anger, even though it was quite obviously angry images, because they had a predetermined idea

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:25.200
that this is something that I should be searching for. And it was used to extrapolate out to a

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:30.160
question around TSA agents, which is that everybody has gone through the scenario of there being

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:34.560
nothing in their bag. And the security guy saying, we're going to have to open this up because

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.840
something's come up and you open it up. And he's like, there's nothing in here. I don't know what

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:42.880
could have come up. And you don't know if it appeared on the screen in a strange way or whatever.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:47.840
But there would be a question to be asked. If every single person arrived at the airport with

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:54.000
their bags perfectly packed and no contraband or any of the other stuff in it, the TSA agents are

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.720
still likely to pick out issues within that, because that is what they're optimizing for.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:03.440
That's the function that they're optimizing for. And it's kind of the same with regards to this.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:08.960
Oh, yeah. And then it's even worse, because if you think about it this way, what if that TSA

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:17.440
agent is told 1% of the populace or the people coming through are potential terrorists? Like,

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:22.320
we know through our research in our studies, it's 1% or 0.5%, whatever small number. And then

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:26.960
you're as the TSA agent is putting everyone through. Well, if you put everyone through,

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:32.080
you're either grossly incompetent or maybe you're a potential terrorist because they would love to

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:37.920
work for the TSA. And now how do you disprove that you're a potential terrorist when the proof is

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:43.360
you're letting through literally every potential terrorist, right? You haven't

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:48.160
clagged one single person. So this must be by design. One or two, we can allow that's,

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:51.920
you know, negligent, whatever, every single potential terrorist you let through. What's

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:58.560
going on here, Mr. TSA agent? And that was part of the knife that was pointed to,

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:02.560
that was hanging over their heads. Yeah, there was this sort of damocles over pretty much everybody.

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:09.440
What was the scalping thing? Yeah, so they were very creative with their tortures. One of them

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:15.360
was they would tie a rope around someone's like head. I don't think this was done very commonly.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:18.480
And then they would have like a stick attached to it and they would turn it until just basically

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:26.240
the skin off top of their head popped off. To me, honestly, the psychological tortures

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:34.720
were much more horrific because we can all wrap our heads thanks to Hollywood about like people

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:39.760
just being beaten and fingernails put off and someone dislocates your shoulder. We've seen those

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:44.080
movies, you know, where the actor is just getting the crap kicked out of them and job broken and

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:52.720
whatever. You don't dare show even in like a silence of the lambs context, a movie where

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:59.600
someone is brought in and their kid, if that kid is being shown hostage in a movie,

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:04.640
he's going to get saved, right? They're not going to show that you sign the confession and they

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:09.600
shoot the kid anyway. Well, what was that general secretary Stanislav Kozia? Well, that was the

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:16.560
hardest, the hardest scene. That was the worst scene in the book? I think Peter Fector might be

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:23.440
the worst, but this was the one where, because he's also a very evil person, right? Stanislav

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:31.840
Kozior. And he was head of Ukraine. Stalin brought him to Moscow and made him like a second

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.960
in command or gave him a major position like in January, I think of 38, and by May he's arrested.

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:44.480
And we don't know exactly what the tortures were done to him, but he was a good Bolshevik, strong,

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:48.080
you know, Stalin means man of steel. They pride themselves in their ruthlessness.

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:52.320
And this is something the interrogators had to do. It's like, you're not going to feel sentimental

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:55.680
because this enemy of the people is being tortured. What kind of person are you, right? Like,

01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:00.640
you're a strong Soviet and, you know, they could have kept him up all night. They could have

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:06.000
thrown cold water. Who knows what they'd pulled. There was one Russian military guy where they

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.920
pulled out all his teeth. And then when he was pardoned, they gave him steel teeth and he was

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:14.640
instrumental in fighting the Nazis during World War II. And Stalin was like, oops, sorry, buddy.

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:23.520
And the thing with that scene is, you know, they did something to him which was not done to many

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:30.800
other people as far as my research indicates. And the question is, when the tortures reach this kind

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:37.600
of apex of torture, is it something that they always had in the back of their minds? We don't

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:43.680
want to go there, but we know we can do it. Or is it that this guy is a major name? We have to

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:49.600
break him and we have to go into uncharted territory. Were they letting him think he's going to

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:55.680
out with them? Or were they like, was he actually doing it? Was he like going for, you know, like,

01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:02.800
what's his name in Gitmo? Khalid, he was like, waterboard like 20 times with some crazy number,

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:06.720
which no one had ever done before. They're like, this guy is just like a beast, right?

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:13.520
So at a certain point, they brought in his teenage daughter and raped her in front of him.

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:19.360
And then he broke. And when you read, you know, even though the guy's a monster, he was complicit

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:25.280
in the genocide of the Ukrainians and, you know, just many tortures under his name, just to kind of

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.800
try to get into his head to be like, I don't care what these people are going to do to me.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:35.840
I'm innocent. Let me talk to Stalin. You know, you know, I know how this works. I'm a proud

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:40.560
Bolshevik. I never would never betray the people like spitting his blood in their faces.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.600
And then she comes in, it's like, what's she doing here? And he's like, oh, you're innocent,

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:48.240
huh? Okay. And then he just saw, and the thing is she killed herself. He got, he outlived her.

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:54.880
She threw herself in front of a train. And that's the kind of thing where when people

01:25:54.880 --> 01:26:02.960
think of oppression in the West, we think solitary confinement, cops not letting you sleep,

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:08.240
they're being the crap out of you, they're breaking your limbs. I think all of that is

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:17.200
something that would be excruciating, no question for us. But when you're watching someone assault

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:22.720
your kids and no, they're not going to have any consequences for it. And like, that's a wrap

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:29.200
for you. And it's just like, we don't know. None of us in the West, I think,

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:36.160
under, except under maybe ridiculous circumstances, can appreciate that sense of powerlessness.

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:42.800
Like even as someone with solitary confinement, shout out to Ross Albrecht, can still write

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:50.240
letters to people, receive information, you know, read a book or something. There's a little bit

01:26:51.040 --> 01:27:00.400
of sovereignty. And that, which is just so obscene in like almost a spiritual sense,

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:06.560
is, and the thing is, our heads would never go there. Like we don't think in terms like this.

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:15.200
And they were just very, the Soviets were very, very conniving and crafty in their machinations.

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:28.240
Why was this extreme paranoia, overbearing police and secret service involvement,

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:33.040
heavy use of cold cellars and hot cellars, learning about that as well, was pretty

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.600
fucking awful. 16 men locked in a room where it was so small that you couldn't even touch

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:41.040
the ground. And the only thing worse than that was the cold cellar, which was basically where

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:45.200
you were left to freeze in this super cold Siberian winter.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:49.120
They put you in a no, they put you in a pit, like basically like a basement and they threw ice water

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:55.920
on you naked. Not good. Yeah. Why? Why do you do the cold plunges? That's true. That's true.

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.120
Maybe I'd have loved it. They're a coup. Maybe I'd have loved it now. It's cool. Yeah. Just without

01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:06.720
the psychedelics and the catamine. Why is all of this happening? Why is it? Why are there quotas

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:15.200
for how many criminals need to be found? Is this an inevitable byproduct of

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:24.240
trying to search for revolution? Is this because of internal corruption? Is this

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.800
cultural within the political elite? Like what's driving this type of strategy?

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:35.600
There's several things. And to be clear, not every decade of the Soviet Union was as bad as

01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:39.200
this. This was the great Stalin's great terror in the late 30s.

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:49.200
Part of it is if you look at an axis between collectivism and individualism, a big part of

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:56.080
collectivism is to make sure that no individual has too much power. And we can understand that

01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:03.360
thing. A lot of people would be uncomfortable with Trump or Soros or Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:09.440
being like, all right, this guy is accountable to no one. He's untouchable. I can understand that

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:16.640
kind of argument. But when you extrapolate that nationwide and you make it so that no individual

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:22.560
has any power, everyone is only a function of society, what that means in practice is,

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:26.720
again, things like this, where you were just completely powerless and helpless,

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:32.640
and that's by design. That's number one. Number two is Stalin's goal was

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:42.480
to have it as public, greater good for society as possible. So anything private

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:51.040
was a threat to his vision. But what that means is if me and you are friends or your parents,

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:58.080
these are private bonds as opposed to public bonds for everyone. And right away, that is

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:05.120
the first step toward a conspiracy. Because if your loyalty is to your dad as opposed to society,

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:09.920
well, I can't have that because everyone has to be working for everybody else. And especially

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:15.120
someone like him, Stalin, who was personally very paranoid, any kind of organization,

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:22.400
whether it's a classroom, a factory, neighborhood, if they're working together,

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:28.960
that's a private society as opposed to the public society. So he did everything in his power to

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:36.800
atomize Soviet society as much as possible and to have people look at each other, to have this be a

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:45.360
as low trust of society as possible, that you don't know who is going to turn you in for what,

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:52.080
and to have enormous incentives for people to turn in their neighbors, colleagues, family members,

01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:57.760
co-workers, and so on and so forth, to maintain their status, just to maintain their homes.

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:02.720
There were jokes. Russians had these things called anikdote, where you could use humor to say

01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:06.960
things that were otherwise unspeakable, where people had to live in apartments together with

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:11.440
other families. And all it would take is a phone call to the secret police and be like,

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:18.880
he's a kulak, or he's hoarding gold. And the joke was like, oh, my gosh, we turned in Masha,

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:24.320
but Dasha has a better room. But all it would take is a phone call, they vanish,

01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:29.520
and now you've got their space. And so the incentives are there, especially if not everyone's

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:37.040
a good roommate. It seems like a lot of this story was either perpetuated,

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.040
created, or driven by Stalin. Yes.

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:47.840
What is he as a man? Is he evil? Is he captured by an ideology?

01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:56.640
He was nowhere near as much of an ideologue as Lenin. So that is real. And he was a thug.

01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:01.360
He came up as a bank robber, like a hooligan. He was not some kind of,

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:09.440
like Trotsky is very much the intellectual vision of the communist. And despite people

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:13.280
making excuses for Trotsky, as we saw with, I talk about the Kronstadt rebellion,

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:17.520
he had no problem putting people up against the wall who got in his way. So the reason he didn't

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:22.080
kill as many people Stalin is because he got deposed and deported. So when he's in the depths of

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:26.160
Mexico, plowing free to callow, he's not in a position to really be ordering

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:35.520
rapes and executions. So it was very heavily influenced by Stalin. But again, everything

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:41.280
that he did, there's in the West, when all this stuff became verified, especially by Khrushchev's

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.560
secret speech in 56, where he's like, yeah, all this stuff about Stalin is true. And when you

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:48.480
hear it coming from the guy who's exceeded Stalin as opposed to Western capitalist propaganda,

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:53.200
you're like, oh crap, we got to look at this square in the face instead of sweeping on the rug.

01:32:53.200 --> 01:33:00.640
It's kind of like all the things that Stalin did, Lenin had implemented. And Emma Goldman,

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:04.480
Alexander Berkman made that clear at the time before Stalin was even in power.

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:07.680
Also, something that happened...

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:09.360
Wait, no, they did it after Stalin was in power.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:09.680
Sorry.

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:14.960
89 was when the Berlin Wall fell. So it was a year after I was born. So for me, I didn't know

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:20.320
what it meant. I didn't know where it ran. I didn't know why it happened. I didn't realize that

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:24.240
there was actually four quadrants to Germany. It had been split up between, was it the French,

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:28.240
Russians, British, who's the other one? Americans.

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:31.280
And the Americans, right, whatever. I don't know, you got a bit of Germany. I can't remember it.

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:35.680
I read a very big book in not very much time, okay? Like, give me a break.

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:43.600
You talk about the absurdity of splitting not only a country, but a city in half.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:52.800
Did you look at what the process of that occurring was like, the creation of a wall,

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:58.560
the building of a wall where me that lives on this street and you that lives two streets in

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:01.680
that direction are now completely apart?

01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:04.880
Yeah. That was one of the things that was interesting when I was writing that chapter.

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:11.360
And how I framed it is, it would have been considered unthinkable because no one had

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:17.760
ever thought of it before. How do you disintegrate a city? The whole point of a city or one of the

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:23.680
big points is I can get easily from point A to point B. Everyone's physically close.

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:28.800
Here's the government sector. Here's the business sector. Here's the cultural center.

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:34.000
And they're all, you know, in proximity to one another. You don't need a car in most cities

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:40.400
or certain cities, and everything's just integrated. So it's like, what if you wanted to kind of

01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:45.120
Manhattan, you know, take Times Square, but now Times Square is a separate country.

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:50.960
It's like, we would have to sit down and really do the math here. It's like, okay,

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:56.400
you can get there through the subway. You've got the streets. You've got these tall buildings.

01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:59.760
Like some of the buildings are interconnected with these sky walks.

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:05.600
Like how would you separate this out? And they basically did this in East Germany.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:11.760
They're like, all right, all these people, because West Berlin, excuse me, is wholly contained

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:16.400
within East Germany. I had thought as a kid, and I think a lot of Americans still think

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:21.360
that Berlin is right in the center of Germany. And when Germany is split into East Germany,

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:25.440
West Germany, it just got split in half. You had a wall right down the middle. It wasn't.

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:31.840
The entire city of Berlin is in East Germany and closer to Poland than it is to West Germany.

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:36.960
So they're like, all right, if you go from East to West German, West Berlin,

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:41.200
once you step foot in West Berlin, you're in West Germany, and you're basically free. And

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:46.640
all the people kept crossing that border. And they're like, we're losing people by the thousands.

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:51.280
And not just people, we're losing our like the brain drain. We're losing the engineers.

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:54.800
We're losing the doctors. We're losing the people who, you know, kind of are

01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:59.200
punching above their weight in terms of production. And they're like, all right,

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:05.120
we're going to separate out the city into two halves. And you have to worry about the sewers.

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:07.840
People are going to sneak it through the sewers. You have to worry about the streets.

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:14.800
You have to worry about, you know, water pipes. Like every aspect that integrates a city,

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:20.320
they had to figure out how are we going to disintegrate this subway lines. And they did it.

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:26.560
And the thing is, when they did it like overnight, the first elements, even in America,

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:30.480
President Kennedy didn't really know what to make of it, because they never entered their

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:34.400
head that someone would try to do something like this, because it's not like Berlin is small.

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:38.720
So to encompass a city within a wall, like imagine someone even encompassing

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:44.000
like Austin in a wall, it's like, what? Like this wall would be just gigantic and it would

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:50.160
take forever. And they did it. And people started losing their lives, trying to cross,

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:54.480
you know, very, very quickly. And the stories that I love that chapter a lot,

01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:02.240
because there's a lot of just very dark moments where people just want to cross the street so

01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:06.480
they could celebrate their birthday with their sister and they get shot. But there's also moments

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:11.920
where people are like, I'm going to do something about this, you know, and escaping and just use

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.720
their ingenuity to kind of give a, you know, my favorite story is the one with the sports car.

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:19.920
I love that story. Hans Mechster, I think, is the name.

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:23.680
Yeah. So before that, what was the citizens escape tunnel?

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:26.400
You mean with the college kids?

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:27.440
It was elderly people.

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:28.800
Oh, the senior citizens tunnel.

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:29.920
Senior citizens escape tunnel.

01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:35.840
Yeah. So the senior citizens tunnel, Andrew Heaton told me this story. I'm

01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:41.760
very grateful to him. Basically, there was a chicken coop in East, I always cry,

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:46.560
I always lose it when I tell this story. And you tell so many times you think you're going to

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:50.720
be able to tell it calmly and you never can, or at least I can't, because they were a bunch of

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:56.320
senior citizens, old people, and they dug this tunnel from East Berlin to West Berlin, and they

01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:01.680
dug it six feet tall, and which is going to take a lot longer than something across space.

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:07.600
And they asked this old guy, why you guys built this tunnel so tall? And he said,

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:12.080
my wife's done crawling. So it's just this beautiful thing that they all got out.

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:14.320
Isn't that great?

01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:18.080
Fucking amazing. What about the sports car? What about?

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:19.440
Oh, God, it's a great story.

01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:24.080
Unbelievable. So I think his name is Hans Meixner. Please double check it on this.

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.960
He fell in love. He was one of the people who was commuting between East and West Berlin,

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:32.480
because you still had, thanks to the post-World War II laws,

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.800
you were allowed to cross the border if you're a certain type of citizen.

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:41.040
And he fell in love with an East German girl. And he's like, all right, I got to get her ass to

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:45.600
West Germany. So he goes to Checkpoint Charlie, and you know, that's the big one,

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:49.280
that was the most famous. So the exchanges and shit happened, isn't it?

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:53.600
Yeah, it's like it was the big border crossing. And he looks at that bar, you know,

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:56.720
even nowadays, you have a parking garage, you pay the ticket, and the bar goes up,

01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:00.960
and allows the car to go through. And as the guys, you know, he's making his crossing,

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:04.960
he very carefully measures it. And he's like, all right, this is how tall it is.

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:09.440
So he's like, I know what to do. I got to find a car that would fit under this bar,

01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:12.480
and I could just drive under it. So he finds, I think, was an Astrid Martin.

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:18.880
It was a British car, I remember. He rents it. He puts the girlfriend in the back seat.

01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.760
And he's like, well, if I'm going to flee with her, I got to bring mom along.

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:24.800
He brings the mother-in-law. And then he packs a ton of bricks.

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:28.720
He puts her in the trunk with bricks in case they start shooting her, right?

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:33.680
And so there were two points where you have to check. He gets passed through the first guard,

01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:36.880
the guard waves into the second point. And instead of going to the second point,

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:40.560
because he had taken out the windshield also, he just, and he took out some air from the tires.

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:47.600
He floors it, drives under the bar, and makes his way to freedom. And as I put in the book,

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.320
you would think that the guards would just stand there shaking their fists. They weren't because

01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:54.800
they didn't know what the hell had just happened. And they got married. And it's this beautiful,

01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:02.560
that's the other thing about the white pill. There are so many moments where even in this kind

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:09.120
of nightmare countries, there are these few just random, everyday citizens who were just like,

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:18.000
I'm going to find my happy ending. And they do it over and over and over again. And I just love,

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.160
and they actually recreated, there's a photo, an aerial photo of them recreating that picture

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:27.360
where he's in the wheel, she's in the back seat, mother-in-laws in the trunk with the bricks.

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:31.600
And there's a sequel to the story, because another guy did that same thing.

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:32.800
He didn't take the windscreen off.

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:35.920
But he read through the same car. I love it.

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:48.240
Okay, we've spoken about a lot of the brutality. There's been some small glimmers of hope.

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:50.640
What are the big glimmers of hope?

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:55.760
What do you mean?

01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:08.800
Well, you've got this essentially overnight fall of death throes of this culture philosophy

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:15.200
institution that's been going on forever. And it is brought about by two conservatives in the US

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:24.000
and the UK and a Russian. And it would have been almost unthinkable. It was unthinkable the day

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.160
before. Your man said it was unthinkable the day before, but then it evidently wasn't.

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.360
Yeah, if you look at Star Trek, what's the name? Chekhov?

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:38.000
The idea is, you had the Korean War, which was a draw. You had the Vietnam War,

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.800
which was a complete disaster for the West. And it was certainly not a victory for the West.

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:47.680
In the 70s, the argument was like, all right, look,

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:52.400
Soviet Union is not going anywhere. They're not they're not doing great, but they're certainly not

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:58.080
this is this is the reality. If you want to be realistic, instead of thinking they're going

01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:04.160
anywhere, we have to realize we're going to be in a world with two superpowers. We have to make

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:08.800
nice with one another and understand one another, because otherwise the costs are going to be nuclear

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:14.160
war and world destruction. Neither party wants that. So instead of saber rattling, we need to sit

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:19.360
down and work things out because this is going to be the status quo, at least for another hundred,

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.360
even if we have warp speed, even if we have warp speed, right, even with the federation,

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.960
this is just the nature of a reality. And before he became president,

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:37.360
Ronald Reagan sat down with one of his advisors and he goes, my policy for the Cold War is simple

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:45.120
and some would even say simplistic, we win, they lose. And that kind of approach of

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:56.240
this is not I'm not going to live on his earth where this sort of thing is going to be normalized.

01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:02.560
But the thing is that you're and Reagan really weren't interested in bringing down the Soviet

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:10.720
Union as their primary goal. Reagan especially his big interest was ending the threat of nuclear war.

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:18.000
And there's this couple of scenes that I uncovered in the research, because you know,

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.800
they're playing poker, you know, the US and the USSR, right? They both have to act one way in public

01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:27.040
another way in private, neither wants to kill each other, neither wants to be killed. Like,

01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:33.200
you know, this is you're playing Brinksmanship. And they bring Reagan down to show him the

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:39.760
how you retaliate if there's a nuclear strike. And his aides thought they're like, he's not going to

01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:46.880
do it. And he talked about this in the sense of like, wait a minute. So if I retaliate,

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:55.360
then within minutes, literally millions, if not tens of millions of Russians are who are innocent

01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:01.280
people, who whose only crime was being born on the far side of the Iron Curtain, which they can't

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:07.040
leave. And when I retaliate, I'm going to be killing all of them. And he's like, I'm the president.

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:12.640
I'm the most powerful man in the world. And I'm the good guy. I'm killing in minutes, tens of

01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:17.120
millions of people. It made no sense to him. And the but the beautiful part is Gorbachev

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:22.800
is taken down into the bunker. And he's dropped and thrown the rehearsal. And they go, okay, Mr.

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:26.800
General Secretary, if this happens, this is the button you press. And he goes,

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:30.800
I'm not pressing that button even for practice purposes. And he's like, if they strike us too

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:36.800
bad. But neither of them knew the other had this position. And what's fascinating is Thatcher,

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:41.920
who was PM at the time, Prime Minister of Great Britain, she gets a lot of heat very correctly

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:47.440
for being a scold. The first time she met Gorbachev, he came to checkers before he was

01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:52.560
out of the Soviet Union. You know, she wanted to meet him, which was it's the Prime Minister's

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:56.400
like summer house, whatever they call it, something the equivalent of Camp David here.

01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:00.480
And they're coming to breakfast, and she's yelling at him about their economics, and she's yelling

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:03.760
at him about their foreign policy, and she's yelling him about their foreign rights. And then

01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:08.320
she's human rights. And then she's yelling him that he hasn't touched his breakfast. And Gorbachev

01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:15.600
just stops and he goes, you know, I wasn't sent here to convert you to communism, like I have my

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:20.240
own views. So let's just take it down a notch. And she just burst out laughing. But what she doesn't

01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:25.920
get credit for was her sent to diplomacy. Because she and she boasted about this constantly and

01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:30.960
fairly. She was the one who spotted him. She said she made him. Well, she took credit for it.

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:36.720
She went on the BBC and said, I could do business with Mr. Gorbachev. And because both of them,

01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:41.040
Reagan and Thatcher were on the right wing of the right wing parties in each country,

01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:45.520
that gave them the space to be diplomatic. I mean, when you think of Thatcher,

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:51.280
you think of the opposite of diplomacy. She, you know, never had a fight she didn't like.

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:55.280
She was always throwing hands at Prime Minister's questions. She was always going after members

01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:00.240
of her own cabinets. She called them a wets, which in contemporary terms is like calling someone a

01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:04.400
soy boy. These were like her own, because it's like he's all wet, right? Doesn't that mean Britain?

01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:09.520
Like she called them that. And, you know, she said she did not suffer fools gladly,

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:14.480
but they both independently sat down with Gorbachev and they're like, all right,

01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:21.040
like this, this status quo, rather than being perpetual is intolerable. We cannot live in this

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:27.520
world. Reagan and Gorbachev thought this very strongly, where we have Lord knows, even we don't

01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:33.520
know how many nuclear missiles are pointed at one another, and that God forbid, you know,

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:38.400
someone gets angry or something happens. And within 20 seconds, all life on earth is destroyed.

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:45.200
This, this, this can't happen. And together, you know, they sat down and gave Gorbachev the space

01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:51.360
to demilitarize. And the thing is, when you have these kind of regimes, and I think Gorbachev

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:56.080
really ends up being the hero of the book, because there were so many times when people were on the

01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:01.840
phone with him from other countries, other communist countries, and saying, General Secretary,

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:05.760
it's all going to shit, you need to send the tanks. And he goes, no, I'm not doing it. And to

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:10.800
me, you know, people often talk about like what, what's beauty and beauty could be like a beautiful

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:15.840
woman. It could be like a sunset. It could be, you know, a song that throws your heart. To me,

01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:23.360
beauty that really kind of gets me really in a very primal emotional way is when these extremely

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:28.800
powerful people choose to take their hand off the trigger and are like, I'm not going to be

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.360
killing people. I don't care if it's going to cost me personally. It's just a wrong thing to

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:37.760
do. I'm not going to be on the side of the executioners. And there were so many moments

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:44.800
in this book, Lithuania being a major example, where they're begging him to use force, and

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:50.800
they're telling him correctly, if you do not, Mr. Gorbachev, if you do not send in the tanks,

01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:56.000
like this, this system that you grew up in that makes the Soviet Union, the rival to the United

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:01.520
States is all going to fall apart. And he's like, too bad, like it's going to go peacefully.

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:06.640
And there's a great scene in East Germany, where Hanukkah, you know, who's the dictator

01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:10.480
of East Germany is watching the footage of these marches. And he's like, all right,

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:14.320
we got to do something. We need to know the Tiananmen Square. And the head of the military,

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:19.920
who is no dove, no soy boy. I mean, this guy has a lot of blood in his hands, a lot of regression.

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:25.600
He goes, he basically, can I curse? He basically says, fuck you, we're not doing anything.

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:29.920
This is going to resolve peacefully. And Hanukkah was out of office the next day.

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:36.800
So that's the other like white pill moment. Like it's not that there are lots of times

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.120
when genuinely evil people, when people who have a lot of blood on their hands,

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:47.360
have done a lot of atrocities for one reason or another, maybe not voluntarily, because the chips

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:53.040
are not in their favor, where they're like, okay, I'm out. This is my limit. And I'm not going to

01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:57.680
make things worse, even if just from personal sense of self-preservation, where it's like,

01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:02.240
if I pull this trigger, my bullets in my head next, so I'm going to back away. If that's their

01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:05.840
motivation, I'm fine with it. The most important, but the thing is with Gorbachev, it wasn't his

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:10.080
motivation. He genuinely was like, all right, he spent enough time with the West as opposed to other

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:17.200
people who became in leadership roles in Soviet Union, where he's like, he went to, in 68, there

01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:21.440
was a kind of a softening of communism in Czechoslovakia. There's something called the Prague

01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:26.480
Spring, Dupček, who was head of Czechoslovakia, wanted to implement socialism with the human face.

01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:30.720
When Gorbachev went to visit Czechoslovakia not long after that, and the Russians sent the tanks

01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:34.960
and took him out of office, he went to a factory, and the factory workers literally turned their

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:40.960
backs on him to just give him a show of like, you were evil. And to see that, when you're like,

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:46.480
I'm just here to help you run your factory, I'm like this nobody middle, aporacic. And to see,

01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:51.680
we were told in our newspapers that you were happy that we were liberating or saving the

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:56.160
revolution Czechoslovakian. And I see the workers, and any of these workers would pull a bullet in

01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:01.120
me if they had their druthers. That was a very eye-opening moment for him. And he's like, I

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:07.440
don't want to be that guy. And what does power mean if not the ability to say, you know what,

01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:13.520
I'm not going to use this power? But could you imagine if instead of getting a Gorbachev,

01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:18.560
you got another Stalin? Well, they had that. I mean, Brezhnev wasn't another Stalin, but

01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:22.800
the fact that he sent in the tanks in 68 and Prague, the fact that the Hungarian rebellion

01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:27.680
in I think it was 56, it was 13 days where the Hungarians were like, all right, we're leaving

01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:34.000
the Warsaw Pact, and Khrushchev's like, that's cute. And they hung Imre Nagy, who was the prime

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.440
minister, you know, so yeah, you don't need, that's the other scary thing. When you have systems like

01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:46.400
this, you don't need another, like everyone, it's going to be very hard to get into Stalin's seat

01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:50.240
without being another Stalin, because you're going to have to get through all these kind of filters.

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:55.440
I've had two conversations in the last month, one with Schultz and one with Goggins,

01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:00.160
and I asked both of them. I find it interesting asking people similar questions. I like to get

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:08.560
the different response to the same prompt. And both of them have had long relationships going on

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:13.840
Joe's show and asked them both about what's it like, you know, being friends with Rogan and sort

01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:18.640
of observing what's been going on and so on and so forth. And both of them have said basically the

01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:25.920
same thing, which is kind of this very odd situation where somebody that has the most power is the

01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:32.960
person that's the most benevolent with it, the person who is giving and is prepared to use their

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:40.880
platform to be able to raise others up, so on and so forth. And yeah, it seems to me like I

01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:45.520
were both good friends with Michaela. Michaela, for the people that don't know, is named after

01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:53.040
Gorbachev. That's why Jordan called her Michaela. I'm not kidding when I said, when I thought to

01:51:53.040 --> 01:52:02.000
myself, why? Why name your daughter after this male Russian dude? I didn't know up until I read this

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:12.720
book any difference between Stalin and Beria and Gorbachev. They're all Russian guys that ran the

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:17.200
country. Maybe they did some bad things. Maybe they did some good things. I don't know. It kind

01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:24.480
of makes sense. I didn't know either. So when I had this weird western look at the end of the Cold War

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:30.560
and I thought Reagan and Thatcher were going to be the heroes, and as I was writing it, when you

01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:35.200
write a book, some of them the characters write themselves, it's very clear he's the hero of the

01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:40.240
three of them. Not that they didn't do heroic things, but in terms of the person who sacrificed

01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:46.400
the most, who was most committed to peace, who had the most opportunity to turn things in a very bad

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:53.040
direction. He's not an angel, let me be clear, but in terms of the amount of good things and choices

01:52:53.040 --> 01:53:00.000
he made in the area of peace, it's just off the charts. So I can very easily see now, having written

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:07.440
the book, why he did this. And I had no idea why, having previously written this book, he would have

01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:12.720
done it. So you say it is possible that those of us who fight for the dignity of mankind will lose

01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:17.360
our fight. It is not possible that we must lose our fight. That is the white pill.

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:22.960
Well, thanks for spoiling the book, Chris. Sorry, the final line and you revealed that it was Michael

01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:32.000
Malis all along. Yeah. Yeah. What's that mean? It means that hope doesn't mean that nothing bad

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:38.560
happens. Hope doesn't mean, you know, someone once yelled at me like, how can you, you're talking

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:42.880
about the white pill, but you moved from New York, you were adjourned from New York to go to Austin.

01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:52.720
I'm like, yeah, I'm not saying nothing bad ever happens. I'm saying that the idea that the good

01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:59.840
guys are these omnipotent deities and you're completely powerless against them and they're

01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:05.040
all knowing and all powerful and they're always going to win. It's like, but that's not true.

01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:10.400
First of all, no matter how evil you think they are, as I demonstrate in this book, they're much

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:17.200
worse. Like I didn't realize just how evil the Soviet Union was until I read this book.

01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:23.920
And again, this is the North Korea guy. Like it's so much bigger and worse than I had realized

01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:31.120
and I have all the receipts in it. But also the fact that you don't, if you as the reader don't

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:37.840
always get what you want, why are you ceding to them this view that they always get what they want?

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:43.200
You know what I mean? Like if I'm just to use an absurd example, if I'm Stalin and I want a dinosaur,

01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:46.800
like a living dinosaur, I can't get that right because dinosaurs extinct. That's just one extreme

01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:52.800
example. But I can't just defy laws of economics. I can't just snap my fingers and say, okay,

01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:57.280
everyone's going to be fed. I also can't snap my fingers and say, everyone who dislikes me is

01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:02.560
going to be identified by me. I'm not going to be able to do that either. So this claim that they

01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:08.320
can always win just because they've got the... First of all, the person who's got the most

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:12.400
numbers always wins. What about the George Washington? George Washington's entire career

01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:19.520
was retreating from the British. We won. Vietnam. Afghanistan, number one. Number two is just

01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:27.040
this kind of premise that just because some organization has been at it for a long time,

01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:32.640
like if you're starting out on third base, that's a huge advantage. Does everyone who's

01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:37.280
on third base make it home? No. And you wouldn't say that. And anyone said that would be absurd.

01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:45.840
So the fact that there are, again, so many examples of things that could have gone so much worse,

01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:50.640
but they didn't. And it's not because these were angels. It's not like, like you said,

01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:55.200
it wasn't like one year at Brezhnev, then Mother Teresa comes in, right? It's not like Reagan was

01:55:55.200 --> 01:56:00.240
an angel. It's not like that was an angel hardly. It's not like the people in West Berlin were all

01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:05.200
these kind of saints or the people in East Berlin were all saints or vice versa. These were human

01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:10.720
beings and human beings, as we talked earlier, are finite. There's limits to our knowledge.

01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:16.480
There's limits to our abilities. And at a certain point, the costs outweigh the benefits. Look at

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:21.680
the Confederacy, right? When Lee surrendered, there were lots of people in the former Confederacy

01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:25.360
who were like, we're just going to keep fighting forever. But at a certain point,

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:29.440
you have to look at it and be like, all right, I can't win this fight. So just out of a sense of

01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:33.440
self preservation, I'm just going to be like, all right, it's a wrap. And that's what happened

01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:37.200
in many of these countries. And that is what I think is going to happen at a certain point

01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:42.480
with 11 elements in the West, that the costs are just going to be too much for them to bear

01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:49.840
and they're just going to fold. To claim that the foes of human decency are uniquely brave

01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:53.600
and valorous, to me is another just blatant one of their lies.

01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:58.560
What do you think most people misunderstand about evil?

01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:08.960
I think there's two things. One is, I think Americans, in the political sense,

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:16.160
think an evil person has a weird mustache and is banging the desk, right? They really think it,

01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:20.480
you know, I talk about this in the book where there's this, I think it was, I forget who wrote

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:24.880
the poem was Leonard Cohen, about, you know, one of these Nazis, height normal, eyes normal,

01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:28.320
hair normal. It's like, what do you expect? Things like people really, even though even

01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:32.480
religious people who understand that the devil is seductive, still expect the devil to be walking

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:38.000
with hooves and horns. Like that's not how you look at, who was that the serial killer in

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:44.000
Florida who was played by that? Jeffrey Dahmer? No, the one in Florida who killed all those women

01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:51.840
who just looked like, trust me, we're both going to feel stupid later. Anyway,

01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:54.880
people are screaming into their iPods at the moment. Yes, they are. And he was played by that actor

01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:59.920
with the Zac Efron. Ted Bundy? Ted Bundy. Ted Bundy, you couldn't pick him out. If anything,

01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:04.880
he's good looking, right? You just think he's like a normal guy. So people understand that

01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:08.560
intellectually, but they don't really understand it emotionally. So that's one thing. Second is,

01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:17.520
I don't think people appreciate how sophisticated evil can get when it comes systematized.

01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:23.840
So again, when we think of like political evil, we think of like, again, the government brutality,

01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:28.400
like the cops are beating you up in your cell or you're putting the solitary, they are not

01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:33.280
thinking of the evil when it comes not to those who have been identified as criminals,

01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:37.600
but to those who are not criminals, not even accused of criminals and the oppression

01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:43.840
that can happen in that regard. And I don't think they appreciate how comfortable

01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:51.520
evil is in taking hostages. So you think, you know, Christopher, there's nothing you could do,

01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:58.960
I'm going to stand up. But when his family comes along, you'd fold in two seconds and you turn

01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:03.440
me in and I wouldn't blame you. And I think the other thing that was turned out, turned up

01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:08.640
in that chapter on the Stasi is people in this country, and I thought this as well,

01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:14.240
were of the belief that those who were informants to the secret police, who snitched on their

01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:20.560
friends, their coworkers, their neighbors, had a gun to their head themselves. So they bring in

01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:24.800
Chris, they're like, all right, Chris, I need 10 names. And you're like, or we're going to kill

01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:29.840
you and your family. It's like, all right, Michael, Zach, you know, blah, blah. What we don't realize

01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:36.080
here in the West is a lot of these people were volunteered. They were more than happy. And one

01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:40.320
of the Stasi recruiters point out, we didn't even pay them that much. It's like, they just wanted

01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:45.440
to feel important, or they were bored, or they just felt they were doing the right thing. And that,

01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:54.320
to me, is an element of evil that Americans are, I would say, almost entirely, but decreasingly

01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:59.040
oblivious to. Well, how would you categorize that last? What's what Hannah Arendt calls the

01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:04.800
banality of evil? Right. Maybe she's not using the term in the same way, but that's kind of like,

02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:11.440
how commonplace it is. There's this one very disturbing scene in this, which I got from Anna

02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:17.760
Funder. No, no, I got it from Timothy Geltnash, whose book is called The File. And both are great.

02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:22.000
Anna Funder's book is called Stasi Land, I forget which is which. After East Germany fell, they

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:28.080
opened up the Stasi files. So you could go in, and you could see what information they had on you

02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:33.440
and who turned you in. And this was a big moment for every East German to be like, do I want to know?

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:38.480
Or do I want to just look the other way and just pretend it never happened? Do I want to know?

02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:45.840
What would you do? It depends on how, if I went to, so that's the thing, right? Some people had

02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:50.880
gone to jail. Some people hadn't gone to jail. It may be just a curiosity thing. I think I would

02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:55.120
probably, I don't know. I don't know. Anyone listening to this who says they would know,

02:00:56.160 --> 02:01:00.160
it's, think about it for a second, because would you want to know that your brother-in-law

02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:04.160
turned you in? On the one hand, you could say yes. On the other hand, you could say no, right?

02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:08.160
It's not that simple. And the story in the book, there's a woman whose job there,

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:13.040
Frau Trumpleman, I think her name is, and the line the author has is, how do you work with

02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:18.240
poison every day and not become poisoned yourself? Her job, when the people come in, is to sit them

02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:22.480
down and basically walk them through. It's kind of like how they used to have, if you take an AIDS

02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:26.640
test, you have to physically go to the doctor to get the results so he can be there to kind of

02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:29.760
walk you through if it's positive, so you're not by yourself at home with a gun to your head.

02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:34.960
And this woman came in and she had been in jail for, I think four or five years,

02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:41.280
because she had wanted to leave East Germany. And she found out through reading her file

02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:46.960
that it was the guy she's still living with. And she just lost it. And that morning,

02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:51.040
you told her, have a nice day. How do you go home to that? And this is an entire country

02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:59.120
of people like this. So those of us who say they'd rather know,

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:08.720
maybe I can see the case for both sides very easily. Would you want to know, ask yourself,

02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:15.440
if one of your parents passed away and you learned that they were being unfaithful to your other

02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:19.600
parent their entire lives, is that something you'd want to know? Or is that something where you're

02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:24.720
like they're dead? I'd rather remember them as my dad or my mom than as someone who couldn't

02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:30.720
keep in their pants. As opposed to a turn of resentment for no reason. Yeah. You have a quote

02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:36.160
where you say, you should take one red pill and not the whole bottle. Yeah. What's the appropriate

02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:47.440
dosage of white pills? It's one book at whitepillbook.com. That's good enough for me. Dude,

02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:55.040
I can credit you with opening up an awful lot of my understanding around this sort of middle 1900

02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:05.600
depths of human depravity, heights of human hope, complicity of journalists and state

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:14.640
enforcements in hiding awful and disgusting actions both within their own country and outside of it.

02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:22.800
I have had a serious historical education from reading this and also you write beautifully.

02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:29.600
The pacing, the way that you use your sentences, it's the same way that you speak.

02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:34.880
I really, really genuinely, genuinely enjoyed it. There was a bunch of things. Just a little

02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:41.040
passage about Lenin, who was widely regarded as a lunatic. Just the way that it's done,

02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:45.920
it's the same way that you would speak it. I very, very much enjoyed it, especially given that I had

02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:52.160
no background to it. Dude, congratulations. I talked to you, we were close friends throughout

02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:56.880
the whole process of writing this book, and I talked to you a lot about how it was really

02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:02.880
getting to me and how intense and emotional. Can't see why. These stories were both in

02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:07.920
negative sense and the positive sense like the Hans Meichsner who drove the Speedster under the

02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:14.480
thing, just so much darkness and so much beauty. I'm glad that you can see what I was going through

02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:20.720
for the last couple of years. I think to me this was almost more like an exorcism

02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:32.080
because there were just so many souls. The idea that they would just be forgotten and

02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:37.680
stories swept in the rug, and I'm like, I'm going to do something about this. These people

02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:44.800
need to be valorized and be remembered. Just so many innocent victims who just happened to

02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:50.880
be born in the wrong place at the wrong time or looked at somebody the wrong way. I'm just so

02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:57.120
glad that I'm in an opportunity to keep their memory alive.

02:04:57.200 --> 02:05:02.240
You've done a commendable job, man. I think that they would all be incredibly grateful

02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:11.520
for what you've done. How many references are there in this book? In fact, I can get it up right

02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:16.720
now and find out because you've done it in Roman numerals, the way that the reference is.

02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:20.800
In the Kindle, I think it's Roman numerals. In the hard cover, it's numbers.

02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:24.640
I haven't ever seen Roman numerals go up this high.

02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:32.080
I didn't know that... What's this? What page am I on here? This is page 341.

02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:42.240
LD-E-X-X-V-I-L. LDL isn't L500?

02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:47.520
Fuck knows. I don't know, but if I go all the way to the very, very end, it doesn't even tell me

02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:48.640
it's still in...

02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:49.200
Roman numerals?

02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:51.920
It's still in fucking Roman numerals all the way to the end, so I don't know.

02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:56.320
Lots, though. My point being that you've done a shit ton of research, it's incredibly impressive.

02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:02.960
Looking at the stuff that you've got this from, where it's come from,

02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:09.840
shit from the 1800s, random back catalog. Dude, it's very, very, very impressive,

02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:14.880
especially given that I'm starting my journey of writing at the moment and observing somebody that

02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:17.840
is... I mean, this is mastery, I think.

02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:22.720
But I mean, this is... I'm not saying this to be glib. This isn't my first rodeo,

02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:30.720
and I can't believe I pulled it off. It took me over two years, and if this was my first book,

02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:34.320
I don't know that I'd be able to do it, like at all, because to...

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:37.360
Like trying to do your first bench session with 600 pounds?

02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:41.040
I think it's... Honestly, it's like trying to do a bench in a squad at the same time.

02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:45.440
No, no, and I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why it's a good metaphor,

02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:51.920
because first of all, to even condense this much history into a book is just almost impossible.

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:52.960
Because it kept growing, right?

02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:57.760
Right, and so it's under 400 pages, so to keep it to numbers is right.

02:06:57.760 --> 02:07:04.640
But then also, to have it just the writing alone, to have history being written in a

02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:09.280
conversational tone is almost impossible. Most history books are dry as hell,

02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:14.880
and I wanted to make sure there's something that is readable, and also on a personal level.

02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:18.560
When I... I've mentioned this when I was on Dave Smith.

02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:22.240
When I was co-authoring books for celebrities, it's kind of like method acting, right?

02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:25.680
You want to get into their head as much as possible, and that's something that I've taken

02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:32.960
with me whenever I write my own books. But when I'm getting into the head of these people who

02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:37.680
are being brutalized, or just that woman, that section was just copy and paste,

02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:42.000
but just thinking about what that's like to go in and find out that your roommate or boyfriend,

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:45.680
it's not really clear, turned you in, and you're still living with this person,

02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:50.880
I mean, it does a number on you, and it would do a number on anybody.

02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:53.200
Are you glad that you're done?

02:07:53.520 --> 02:08:07.840
I am... I'm right now in a very surreal space in a positive way, because it's...

02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:11.120
So there were some issues with the publication when it came out,

02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:12.240
on the first day.

02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:14.080
There's no hard copies available at the moment, is that right?

02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:15.840
It just takes like two weeks, but they're available.

02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:19.920
There was an issue with the pricing on the first day, and I was like,

02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:24.720
and if it had gone through a mainstream publisher, that would have just been a wash.

02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:28.400
So it took a while for people to get their copies of the book.

02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:34.880
And so I have the launch, I did Lex Friedman's show, and then it's kind of like radio silence,

02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:39.120
right? Because I'd been working ever so long, and I was like, holy crap, it's DOA.

02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:46.000
And I had to talk to our buddy Blair White, God bless her, and she's like, you've been so

02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:53.760
trained by social media to have instant feedback that if you're not getting

02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:57.920
results like that first day, you think it's done.

02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:00.080
And she's like, this is... people haven't gotten their copies.

02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:02.160
How are they going to be responding to it?

02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:05.280
And that kind of clicked, but that kind of worked for a bit.

02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:11.040
But now that these responses are coming in, there was a book that was published about

02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:14.640
how Reagan won the Cold War by Dutton, which is a mainstream publisher.

02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:15.760
I just found this out this morning.

02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:17.840
Wall Street Journal called it one of the books of the year.

02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:19.600
Amazon had as a staff pick.

02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:21.120
I'm not selling him like three to one.

02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:27.520
It's just... and doing... I haven't even started my podcast rollout.

02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:34.560
So the fact that it's selling so well, so quickly, and getting responses from so many names,

02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:38.560
because this... I know this always sounds like humble bragging, but I really...

02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:43.120
This is such an important story to me.

02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:45.600
And because this is my heritage, you were just a certain age,

02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:47.120
you kind of look back where you came from.

02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:54.560
The fact that I'm in my own best I can doing justice to so many people in so many countries

02:09:54.560 --> 02:10:01.680
for so long, and making sure there's that line in The Iron Lady, where it's the young

02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:04.960
Margaret Roberts is just yelling at Dennis, one's life must matter.

02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:11.360
But to be able to sit there and be like, this is being forgotten,

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.360
and to be able to do something about it, and seeing that what I wanted to do about it

02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:22.000
is getting done, it's almost like being in a dream.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.480
Like to be able to change reality, to have that power.

02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:26.320
It's just... I'm very, very blessed.

02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:28.640
Unreal Man, I'm proud of you.

02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:30.240
Thank you so much. That means a lot.

02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:31.200
Thank you for being here.

02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:33.760

02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:36.880
I apologize for my Twitter.

02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:39.840
Apologies in advance. That's it, man. Thank you.
