1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Korea had no future.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
At their current fertility rate right now,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
for every 100 Koreans, there will be 5.9 great grandchildren.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We are looking at a 94% population collapse over the next century.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Why have you been in the news so much recently?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Because I am calling out that the emperor has no clothes right now,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and I think a lot of people have mentioned collapsing fertility rates before,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
but I think that no one has really so consistently

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
brought it up in a way that the people who want to ignore it

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
have to look at the problem.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When I point it out, because I think a lot of people,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
especially on the more progressive side of the spectrum,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
they just want to dismiss it.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, the planet's better without humans or whatever.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But when you point out that not a single society on Earth today,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
except for maybe Israel, we can talk about that later in the conversation,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
has figured out how to have prosperity, gender equality,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and high levels of education, and anywhere close to a stable population,

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
considering we are trying our best, and I think rightfully so,

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
to spread those things across the world,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
that should be like a note.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That should be like, oh, this system that we think is so great

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and we want to be the future of human civilization doesn't seem to work

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
at the most basic level.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That seems like quite a scary proselytization for the future,

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
or prediction for the future.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If you're to say that we need to get rid of one from education, equality,

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
prosperity, or birth rate,

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
we just need to concede the fact that birth rate.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What we need to do is we need to find new cultural solutions.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We need to find a way to maintain fertility rates

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
while having education, while having gender equality,

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and while having a high level of prosperity.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There are many places we can look in the world today

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
to begin to get inspiration for how we might do that.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think to understand the scale of the threat right now,

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
one of the things I always start people with is when I started caring about this.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A lot of people are like, why is it that people in Silicon Valley

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
seem to care about this so much?

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's because there's a lot of VCs in Silicon Valley,

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
VCs need to chart the economy 50-100 years in the future

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
in the way that Wall Street people really don't.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
They're looking at the economy 5-10 years out or whatever.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Because of that, when I was working as a VC,

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I happened to be working in Korea when I was working in a VC,

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and I kept trying to chart the future of the economy,

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and I kept coming to the same answer.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is it Korea had no future?

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
At their current fertility rate right now,

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
for every 100 Koreans, there will be 5.9 great-grandchildren.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We are looking at a 94% population collapse over the next century.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
When I brought this up with the other partners at my firm,

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and I was like, hey, it just doesn't seem like

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
there is any feasible economic future for this country.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
They're like, yeah, but we pretend that's not the case in our investments.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Everybody knows this, but if we accepted it,

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
then the economy stops working, society stops working.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We're just going to ignore it basically.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
When I came back to the US, it was like going back in time 20 years.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I was in some sort of a sci-fi movie,

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and getting to be this one person who saw where the future was going to go,

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and having to be that crazy person on the streets.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, no, no, you guys don't understand.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There's countries further ahead than us on this spectrum right now,

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and we know a few things. We know there is no floor.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No country has hit a fertility collapse floor yet.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We know that there is no level of advanced fertility collapse where people freak out,

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
or at least not until it's too late, because you look at Korea right now,

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
60% of Korean citizens are over the age of 40.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's likely already too late for them to turn this problem around.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We need to turn this around before we hit that level,

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
but the truth is we probably won't,

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and we've got to think of solutions for when we don't turn this around,

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
but that's a different topic for later in the interview.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
One of the most common questions I imagine that people ask is,

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
why should anyone care about how many children another person has?

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is my choice.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You can't impose me to have kids if I don't want to have them.

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why should two guys sat on the Internet be telling the world

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
about the dangers of not having children?

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
People can go and do other things with their lives now.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Women are allowed to be in the workplace.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Men can go their own way and play video games

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and be a Sigma male as much as they want.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Why should anyone care about how many children another person has?

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So I think that that's a really good point.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
In our foundation, I think one of the things that people most often get wrong about us

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
is that we are trying to increase the world's population

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
or that we are trying to proselytize broadly to increase fertility rates.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And neither one of those things is true.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If we are on the Titanic right now,

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
no matter what the Titanic hits the iceberg,

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
we are trying to, one, make people aware that the Titanic is about to hit an iceberg,

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
get them in lines by the rafts, the ones who want to survive,

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
start getting the rafts in the water in a common orderly fashion before people start panicking

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
because that's what's going to happen.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And so what we promote is trying to get,

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I mean, I know my family is going to be okay.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You know, I know that my cultural group is going to be okay.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Broadly speaking, so one, I know that my family,

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
you know, I have eight kids and they have eight kids

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and you do that for 11 generations.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's more descendants than exists in the world today, I often say.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So I don't need to worry about people like me.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The reason I'm so loud about this is because I'm worried about the massive collapse

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
in cultural and ethnic diversity the world is about to see.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And it will be astonishing for people.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I think in the far future, there were more than like three ethnic groups

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and three cultural groups or something like that if we don't solve this.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And so what we're trying to do is just make people aware of this

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
because so much of the propaganda that people are consuming is telling them,

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
things are fine, have less kids, you're a good person if you have less kids.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And I know you've talked about this before on the show and it is, it is astonishing.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And I think when we look at this urban monoculture that is erasing all of the genuine diversity in our society,

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
one of its core messages is negative utilitarianism.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That the core evil thing in the world is human suffering

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and that human happiness just doesn't really matter

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
or it is largely outweighed by human suffering.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And therefore it's better if humans don't exist.

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And that's the end goal for the urban monoculture.

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I think for a lot of people.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What do you mean when you say urban monoculture?

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Well, okay, so this sort of gets down to like my personal politics to some extent.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But I think that if you look at society right now,

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
it's largely becoming divided into two factions

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and there has been a major political shift around what conservative and progressive means.

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The progressive is a party of this urban monoculture,

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
which is a single sort of cultural group or virus that infects other cultural institutions

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and erases whatever makes them unique and aligns all of their goals.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So if I talk with a progressive Muslim or a progressive Jew or a progressive Catholic

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
or a progressive Unitarian Universalist and I scratch beneath the surface,

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
often their morals, their views on gender,

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
their views on what future they want for the world are all very, very similar.

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If I look at conservatives from each of those factions,

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
their worldviews are very different.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And what the conservative party seems optimizing around,

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
so where the liberal party is optimizing on the goals of this monoculture,

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
so spreading the monoculture and reducing in the moment human suffering,

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
that's why they promote things like haze,

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
you know, like don't tell somebody that it's unhealthy to be fat

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
because that could hurt their feelings in the moment,

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
even though like obviously it's bad for them in the long term.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But the conservative movements all have very distinct cultural histories

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
which they are trying to preserve.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And that is often, if I look at the conservative movement today,

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
it's an alliance of these older traditions and newer but deviant and distinct traditions

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
that are trying to maintain cultural fidelity and exist 100, 200 years from now.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And so when I talk about the monoculture, that's what I'm talking about.

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This thing that wants to, when my kids go to school, say,

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
this is what correct morality is, this is the way you should see the world.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And if your parents are telling you anything else, they're deplorable and wrong.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Is that not the case with some factions from a conservative side as well, though?

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah, yeah, no, and I call them sleeper progressives.

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
They just want to erase all other cultures the moment they gave power.

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But I think that right now I can form an alliance with them because our goals are aligned.

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I think one of the really cool things that we've seen with the conservative party

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
is you saw something like when Andrew Tate converted to Islam.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
In the past, a conservative icon converting to Islam,

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
a lot of people would have been wringing their hands about that,

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
but a lot of people were like, you go.

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
At least you found some faith, at least you found some tradition.

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And so I think what we're seeing there is more of a realization

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that the big bad these days is this culture that's trying to homogenize the world.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Interesting.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What would you say to the well-meaning people from the progressive movement

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
to say it feels a little bit bad to be tarnished with the brush as a super virus?

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I think that I'm just somebody that holds liberal values.

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't believe that I'm part of some destructive force within the world.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And I think that there are people who genuinely, like within any movement,

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
when the Catholic Church used to be the iteration of this in European society

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and they were trying to convert everyone to their ways.

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And the Protestant Church during their own time had a period like that in some countries.

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The vast majority of Protestants, their Catholics in those countries,

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
were just decent, well-meaning people trying to live their lives.

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But the ones who controlled the cultural institutions

176
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and were burning people at the stake and trying to ensure that everybody fit

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
this very narrow definition of morality set by their culture,

178
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
to me they were the evil ones within those institutions.

179
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And today, when I talk about this monoculture,

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I think that the vast majority of people who are members of it

181
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
were the vast majority of Catholics and Protestants during periods

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
when those cultural groups were dominant in specific regions.

183
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Why is this culture so effective?

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Very interesting.

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Okay, so it's evolved a lot of new tactics that had never been tried before.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So in our book, The Pragmatist Guide to Crafting Religion,

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
what we essentially do is we argue that humanity can be thought of

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
as sort of an evolving firmware, which is like our biology, our genes.

189
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But on top of that firmware, there's evolving sets of software.

190
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And this software, today we often talk about memes

191
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
as like things that infect somebody and then cause them to just turn around

192
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and infect other people.

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But historically, most romantic clusters actually augmented a person's

194
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
sort of biological fitness, the number of surviving offspring they had,

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and that's how they survived.

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's how, I mean, if you look at things with a secular mindset,

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
why things like Islam and Judaism figured out stuff like handwashing

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
literally centuries before science figured out handwashing.

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And you see this across these traditions.

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
For example, if you look at all of the old traditions,

201
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
almost all of them have some arbitrary self-denial holiday,

202
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
like Lent or Ramadan or Feast of the First Burner, whatever, right?

203
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And just now, after throwing out all of those rituals over the past,

204
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
you know, 50, 100 years, secular society is like,

205
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
oh, now we got to have our juice cleanses.

206
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Now we got to have our, you know, they're realizing of fasting

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and stuff like that, right?

208
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It has positive mental effects.

209
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And so I think that if you see these as different,

210
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
like evolving cultural groups,

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
this super virus evolved some very unique tactics,

212
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and it is not the same thing as a historic progressive movement.

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What it is is something, so the reason I call it a super virus is

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
that it is very much so when you talk about a super bacteria

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
or a super bug, they typically come up in things like hospitals

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
where you have a ton of people with a weakened immune system

217
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
all in a similar environment with lots of sort of viruses or bacteria

218
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
that can intermingle alongside antibiotics and stuff like that.

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is what was created by the internet.

220
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is why all of this stuff started when social media happened.

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Essentially, you had a super spreader environment where pneumatic ideas

222
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
were able to test themselves against all of the world's traditions

223
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
at the same time, optimize and react very quickly

224
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and become incredibly virulent while evolving strategies

225
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
that had never been tried before.

226
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So one of the most effective strategies that it uses

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
is if you look historically,

228
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
if you look at cultural groups as sort of like nodal clouds

229
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
that sort of overlap with each other,

230
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
when you had a corrupted node within a nodal cloud

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
or a node that looked like it was flipping,

232
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
what you would do if you were a majority Protestant country

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
or majority Catholic country and like a Catholic came in

234
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and started preaching or a Protestant came in and started preaching,

235
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
you'd burn them.

236
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You'd burn them at the stake often, right?

237
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Or if somebody just had like random cultural mutation

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
in the same way you have like random genetic mutation

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and they believe something weird like they were a witch

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and you burn them, right?

241
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's how you maintain this level of cultural fidelity.

242
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What the virus does, which is very interesting,

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
is it organically determines when a node looks like it might be flipping

244
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and then it essentially shadow bands the node.

245
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It begins to de-connect that node's links

246
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
to all of the rest of the network's power structures.

247
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And this is really powerful because what it means

248
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
is the other nodes that might be allied with that node,

249
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
they don't react the way they would have historically

250
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
when somebody was being like burned at the stake or something like that,

251
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
which is actually why cancellation is a fairly ineffective tactic

252
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and genuinely not use that much

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
when contrasted with just a shadow banding process

254
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
of the person just doesn't get a promotion

255
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
if it looks like they might be immune to these ideas.

256
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They just don't, you know, their papers get published a little less.

257
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You know, certain platforms begin to favor them less

258
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
because of the algorithm.

259
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And that's how it has been able to maintain such control,

260
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I think, of the upper echelons of our society.

261
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But it's not like every organization is run by a progressive movement, right?

262
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
There are organizations out there that seem to be a lot more open to new ideas.

263
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
We're seeing pushback from a variety of places to the opportunity

264
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
for people to have independent jobs.

265
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So I would say that it's not every organization.

266
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So it specifically targets the organizations it can best use

267
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
to maintain its population levels.

268
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And so those are typically organizations that are involved in education.

269
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So you're looking at the middle school system,

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
the high school system and the college system

271
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
or the organization that it is most critical that it maintains

272
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
an absolute strangleholdover.

273
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And this again comes to fertility issues.

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Of the populations of the world,

275
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
if there is one population that has a very low birth rate,

276
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
it is this population, this urban monoculture.

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And because of that, the only way it can repopulate its ideological faction

278
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
is through siphoning children from other often more conservative cultural traditions

279
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
or in other ways, deviant cultural traditions

280
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
that are for whatever reason, having a lot of kids.

281
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Okay, getting back to fertility,

282
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
what groups are doing particularly well and particularly badly when it comes to fertility?

283
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This is a fascinating question.

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
All right, so if you look in a post-prosperity environment,

285
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
so a lot of people, they're like,

286
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
oh, well, countries in Africa are doing really well.

287
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They have high fertility rates or Muslim populations have high fertility rates.

288
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And it's like, well, that's irrelevant of those populations

289
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
or in a country where the average salary is under $5,000 a year,

290
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
because that is where you get above replacement fertility

291
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
in pretty much every country that's under $5,000 a year, you get above replacement.

292
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Every country above $5,000 a year, you typically get below replacement fertility.

293
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And so it's a level of desperate poverty, first of all,

294
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
that is often misconstrued.

295
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So you look at Latin America, Central America, South America, the Caribbean,

296
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
collectively as of 2019, so old news, they fell below repopulation rate.

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So it's really just a few of these poorest countries.

298
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So I really ignore any country at a high fertility if it's a poor country

299
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
or if it's not a wealthy country, right?

300
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And so I think where you can see is some misunderstandings that people have from that.

301
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So you look at populations like Muslim populations,

302
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
when they enter wealthier countries, their populations really crash

303
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
or when the countries where they are the dominant social group.

304
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So you can look at Iran.

305
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Iran's fertility rate fell above, below replacement a long time ago.

306
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And since 2014, they've been trying pretty much everything in their power

307
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
to try to get fertility rates back above repopulation rate.

308
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And their government has a lot of control over the populace and they are not able to.

309
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
They're still only at 1.7.

310
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So the groups that really show resistance to this are conservative Christian groups

311
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and conservative Jewish groups.

312
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And this is why I always think it's funny when people are like,

313
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
oh, you're talking about fertility rates, you must be about saving white people.

314
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And it's like white conservative people are like the only people on earth

315
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
who don't seem to be disappearing in the face of prosperity induced fertility collapse.

316
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The groups that are most at risk are the Eastern traditions.

317
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Even conservative iterations of those traditions are very bad

318
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
at resisting prosperity induced fertility collapse.

319
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Prosperity induced fertility collapse.

320
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What is the relationship between prosperity and fertility?

321
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Well, as I said, typically when a country earns over 5,000 USD a year,

322
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
fertility begins to fall below replacement rate.

323
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes, why?

324
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, well, so this is what we can say is nobody quite knows,

325
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
but there is some evidence as to what might be causing this.

326
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What is probably causing it is the ability to engage with a modern economy.

327
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So when somebody is not engaged with the modern economy

328
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and not valuable to the modern economy, then the modern economy basically ignores them

329
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
and they go on living the way humans have always lived and having a lot of kids.

330
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This is why within developed countries.

331
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So if you look at a country like the US, right,

332
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
typically the less money you make, the more kids you have,

333
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
except when you're at the very high end of the income spectrum.

334
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So if you're making an average of half a million dollars a year or more as a family,

335
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
you will be at above replacement fertility.

336
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And in many ways families at that income level are just not like the economy isn't grabbing them as much

337
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
because they don't need the economy as much.

338
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So what's really happening is if you look at our sort of free market structure,

339
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
what it does is it organically determines how to reward anyone who has the probability

340
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
that it believes has the probability of being productive with just enough money

341
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
to get them to spend their time being productive versus doing anything else

342
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
that may have long-term benefits to the society like having kids or whatever, right?

343
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And it's very, very good at doing this.

344
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And then it draws them into environments like cities where it becomes even harder to have kids

345
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and where they can, anyway, yeah, where they can be more productive

346
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
and spend more time working and generating money for this larger economic system.

347
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I was going to say it doesn't seem like, it doesn't seem realistic

348
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
that this could be a large behemoth,

349
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
evil-y behind the scenes working to try and get fertility rates down.

350
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It seems more likely that it is a natural byproduct of a capitalist machine

351
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
that wants to have workers who are available as much as possible

352
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
who don't take maternity or paternity leave,

353
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
who are buying their clothes and taking their holidays,

354
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
consuming and producing and pumping money back into the system.

355
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Is that the way that you see it?

356
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I absolutely agree with everything you're saying there.

357
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And that's also what I mean when I talk about the virus.

358
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I don't think any decision is made maliciously.

359
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I think everybody thinks they're a good guy.

360
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Everyone's trying to do what they think is best for the world.

361
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But sometimes sort of cultural evolutionary pressures can create incentive systems

362
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
that lead to actions that in the long term will have consequences

363
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
that I think most people would think are bad.

364
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay, at the beginning you mentioned a bunch of other contributing factors,

365
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
prosperity being one of them.

366
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What were the other elements?

367
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Gender equality and education are typically the other two.

368
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Run us through those.

369
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Well, gender equality, it is often specifically female education.

370
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
When women begin to have a choice as to what they do and can participate in the economy,

371
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't think that it's that they're choosing not to have kids.

372
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I think that that is a misunderstanding of what we're seeing in the data.

373
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I think it's that they prioritize economic stability

374
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and basically having their life in order before they decide to start having kids.

375
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But the way our economic system is structured,

376
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
people often don't really feel they have their life in order

377
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
until they're mid-30s or 40s and at that time they can no longer have kids.

378
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And so I think that that is why.

379
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It is not that women are choosing jobs over kids,

380
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
it's that they're choosing jobs then kids and their biological clocks run out.

381
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
While at the same time, and I think this is something that's really undersold

382
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
when people talk about fertility collapse,

383
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
is the absolute collapse of marriage markets in our society.

384
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I saw a tweet and I couldn't agree with it more.

385
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Being in a happy marriage these days feels a bit like catching the last chopper at an arm

386
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
because it is hard out there to find a good partner.

387
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And we have seen a collapse of the systems that previously

388
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
ensured people found great long-term dedicated partners.

389
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Well, that's the point.

390
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's not just about declining birth rates.

391
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's also about declining dating.

392
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So 50% of guys aged 18 to 30 say that they are not looking for casual or long-term relationships.

393
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I mean, you know, that's an unbelievably shocking statistic to say that

394
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
your natural biological inclination as a guy during the period of your life

395
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
when you're going to have the highest testosterone you're going to have

396
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
is just checking out completely of either casual or long-term relationships.

397
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The same thing goes for women broadly as well that it's just not good.

398
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So how do you fold in this decline in dating as well as children?

399
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I mean, how do you fold it in?

400
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What I just say is it's a problem.

401
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And one of the things we look at, I mean, we've written multiple books on like

402
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The Pragmatist Guide to Relationships, The Pragmatist Guide to Sexuality,

403
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
looking at this problem, trying to come up with solutions to this problem.

404
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And I think that this brings us to what the real solution to this problem is in a broader context.

405
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Not just dating, not just, but also fertility collapse, also the cultural.

406
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So whenever anybody first hears about fertility collapse,

407
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
they often want to use it as a way to justify I think the talking points

408
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
they wanted to push before it became a problem on their table.

409
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Like as soon as they accept it's a problem, then they're like,

410
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
oh, I can use this to push things I wanted to push already.

411
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So they'll say things like, oh, well, you should do cash handouts,

412
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
except we know that doesn't really work.

413
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You know, Hungary spent 5% of its GDP last year doing it

414
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
and they got the fertility rate up by like 1.6%.

415
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
When it's dropping like 3% year every year in a lot of places in the world,

416
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
that's really irrelevant.

417
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Like China, 2020, drop 20%.

418
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
2021, drop 13%.

419
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
In 2022, COVID lockdowns are over, it should be going up, only went up 0.18%.

420
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You know, so you're just seeing a 1.6% increase for 5% of your GDP is irrelevant.

421
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So, and people are often like, well, you could spend more.

422
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
What if you spent 50% of your GDP on this?

423
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But if it's naturally dropping every year, then you can never catch that toad

424
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
if you're doing it by spending money.

425
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And it's the same with things like free childcare.

426
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
God, I would like free childcare.

427
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You know, I plan to have seven kids or something like that.

428
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But in the countries that offer it, it does seem to help fertility a little bit,

429
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
like maybe like 3% or 4%, which is a pretty good amount.

430
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But it's not enough to offset the trends that we see.

431
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And then you talk to conservative groups and they're like,

432
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
well, what we should do is, and I'm talking far conservative groups,

433
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
not ones like me, but they're like, we should create estates, basically.

434
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You know, stop immigration, have one culture, one country.

435
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Except if you actually look at the statistics, the countries in prosperous countries

436
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
with the lowest fertility rates are often estates, you know, like South Korea, stuff like that.

437
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You look at the countries that have been most resistant to fertility collapse

438
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
in the prosperous world, you're looking at countries like Israel in the U.S.,

439
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
some of the most diverse countries.

440
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And you can even see this with cultural groups across countries.

441
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So you look at like Iran, remember I mentioned Iran famously has a real big fertility country

442
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and they're basically a Shia monoculture.

443
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But you look at Shia Muslims in India at similar economic levels where it's much more diverse

444
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
and their fertility rates like twice what it is in Iran.

445
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So I think that that's the first thing.

446
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So then the second question becomes, well, how do you actually solve this problem?

447
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Right? You look around the world and we've already talked about it.

448
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I mean, the solutions sort of staring us in the face,

449
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,000
the groups that are resistant to this are the ones that deviate in some way from the urban monoculture.

450
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Most of them are traditionalist religious groups and there are some traditionalist religious groups

451
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
that are more resistant to this fertility collapse than others.

452
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And some that seemed like they were resistant and then all of a sudden collapsed.

453
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Mormons are an example of this.

454
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Like Mormons had great fertility rates than like five or six years ago,

455
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
something happened and now they're probably below replacement rate.

456
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And so what that tells me is that the solution to this is going to come at the level of cultural experimentation,

457
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
both fortifying our traditional cultures to be more resistant to the new threats they're facing,

458
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,000
but also potentially inventing new cultures that work with technology, the internet,

459
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
new strategies that are open to us, which is what my family is trying to do.

460
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Tell me more about that.

461
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Okay. Yeah. All right, so I can go deeper into this.

462
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So we have everything from like our own traditions of the family,

463
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
our own sort of the moral framework, different ways of naming our kids,

464
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
different ways of dressing to an extent, like we look weird to other people.

465
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And a lot of people are like you guys look like freaks.

466
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Don't you know your kids will be weird?

467
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Don't you know they'll be bullied?

468
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And I go, you know, look around the world, which families,

469
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
which cultures are going to exist in the future?

470
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's one's like the Amish, the Hasidic.

471
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You know, wherever you look, they look different.

472
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
They dress different.

473
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
They name their kids different things.

474
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's because when you call something cringe,

475
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
when you call something different or weird or freaky,

476
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
what you are saying is it differentiates from the cultural norms to which you are accustomed.

477
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Those cultural norms became the dominant cultural norms

478
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
because they had a good immune system, because they were good at dehumanizing the other

479
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
and calling people freaky and stuff like that.

480
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But the reality is that if you want to join this game,

481
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
and this is why I'm out here, this is why I'm yelling,

482
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I don't want a future where it's just my kids is a failure, right?

483
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Where it's just my family.

484
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I want as much diversity into the future as possible.

485
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That's why I'm shouting this.

486
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I want people to join us.

487
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I want them to experiment and fortify themselves

488
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and not become overly complacent with their existing traditions

489
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
if their kids are being effectively peeled out by this monoculture.

490
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's very interesting to me.

491
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You know, I sometimes hear people in the rain.

492
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Why don't you just convert to like a traditional religious framework?

493
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And it's because most of those frameworks are right now on the downtrend

494
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
in terms of their ability to continue a high fidelity and maintain their kids.

495
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I do want them to find new systems to protect themselves against that.

496
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
But that's why that's just going to traditions isn't the answer anymore.

497
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
The virus or whatever you want to call it has gotten too good at finding kids.

498
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And so we have to find new systems.

499
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And also just the environment the kids are in with internet, with social media.

500
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It's so different.

501
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And then with AI that they're going to face.

502
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
How do you keep your kid from dating an AI girlfriend when they can have a deep fake

503
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
that's perfect and hot and loves them, right?

504
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
They need to want something other than hedonism.

505
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And that's a difficult message to convey to kids if they adopt the dominant social mores today.

506
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So to recap what you were talking about to do with this sort of almost monotheistic future

507
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
or this sort of monoculture future that we would end up with if birth rate decline continues.

508
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
For the people that might look at this and say, well, this is you trying to put forth

509
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
you want it to be a white ethno state.

510
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You want it to be more of your progeny that are out there.

511
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Your point is that that is the subgroup which is one of the few

512
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
which are continuing to be okay at the moment.

513
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
We're actually going to lose genetic and racial diversity if we allow the current trends to continue

514
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
because some of the groups that are reproducing with the lowest fertility rates

515
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
are the ones that add to that diversity.

516
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So in the future what you end up with is a very small number of different cohorts

517
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
of stuff like Amish stuff like not even Mormons apparently anymore

518
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
who are then downstream going to be the ones that fill out the entire country.

519
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah, if we do nothing, the future is really just conservative Christians

520
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
and conservative Jews and maybe conservative Muslims.

521
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Those seem to be the only groups that are just like persistently resistant to this.

522
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So that's a pretty sort of bland future racially from...

523
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yeah, and there's some groups that in the very near future

524
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
like if I was looking at this like an ecologist, right,

525
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
like the groups I would be probably most concerned about right now

526
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
are groups like the Jans and the Parsi.

527
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Like a lot of Americans don't think about,

528
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
but there's some of the oldest, most distinct cultures in the world right now

529
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and they will almost certainly have collapsed in population by the end of the century

530
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
to the point where it'll be difficult for them to carry on their traditions.

531
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Coming back to that conversation about we get prosperous,

532
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
we give women education, they enter the job market

533
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
and they have other things to do with their life.

534
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
What's your proposal?

535
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Presumably you're not saying that we need to rip women out of the workplace or education

536
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and if it is the case that we don't want people to be less prosperous

537
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and we also want to let people choose what they want to do,

538
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
if this is what they want to do, if women don't want to have kids

539
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
or if they don't feel like they're ready and they don't want to have kids until they are,

540
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
they're concerned about the living cost and the cost of bringing a child into this world,

541
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
they're concerned about the environment, they're concerned about losing their life freedom

542
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and struggling to find the right partner, whatever it is,

543
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
they've got better things to do with all of the money that they've just found.

544
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Why shouldn't they be allowed to do that?

545
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I think they should be allowed to do that and I think that real feminists today,

546
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
when I say a feminist, I mean somebody who wants gender,

547
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
well I don't know if feminism is the right word, people who want gender equality,

548
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
whatever word you want to use for wanting gender equality

549
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
in 100 years and 200 years to be an option, right?

550
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You're sort of at the crux of history right now

551
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
because no group that really has gender equality except for maybe Israel,

552
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
we can get to that later, there's questions there, whatever,

553
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
but it's anywhere close to above repopulation rate.

554
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So those groups and those cultural traditions are going to eventually disappear

555
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
and what they will do is they will get better in the short term

556
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
at taking the kids of people from these conservative traditions,

557
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
but eventually, I mean just the way cultural evolution works,

558
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
the conservative traditions will build systems that have resistance

559
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
to whatever technique that they're using

560
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and they will not be able to repopulate that way anymore.

561
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So if you actually care about this, then you can join the grand experiment

562
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and the grand experiment is, and this is something we genuinely don't know yet,

563
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
is it possible to have gender equality and a high fertility rate?

564
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
My family, so like when I look at what my wife and I did,

565
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I was asked to be on this podcast, Simone is in here,

566
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
not on my choice, I would have her on typically with me,

567
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
we write our books together, we run our companies together,

568
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
is one solution to the gender equality question,

569
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
which is to do everything together, write your books together,

570
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
run your companies together, raise your kids together, right?

571
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
But there are other solutions to this question that people can experiment with

572
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and what I love is this isn't a question of what's the most moral way to do things.

573
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Sort of the future will decide who was actually successful,

574
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
who was able to have a lot of kids, motivate the continuation of the tradition

575
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
through their children, you know, you get 18 years to pitch to your kids

576
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
that your way of living is a good way of living.

577
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And if your kids don't like that or they don't agree with that,

578
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I think we're blessed and that we live in a society where they can choose something else.

579
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And so, you know, I think that we are going to have a,

580
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
hopefully a lot of people trying new ways of living,

581
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
new ways of trying to achieve gender equality, like my family,

582
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
you know, doing everything with your spouse isn't the way that gender equality is typically envisioned

583
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
when people talk about it, but it is a form of gender equality.

584
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Can liberalism last under demographic decline?

585
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Oh, no, no, it's gone. It's dead.

586
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I mean, if you talk conservative liberalism, maybe,

587
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
like if you're talking about like traditional liberalism,

588
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
if you're talking about the progressive movement,

589
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I often say it's a bit like if you get a certain blast of radiation, right,

590
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
your DNA can be scrambled, your cells can no longer replicate.

591
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You don't know that you're a dead man walking yet,

592
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
you know, before you begin to feel the pain,

593
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
but there is nothing that can be done to save you at that point.

594
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The fertility rate is so low as in that community,

595
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
there's really nothing that can be done.

596
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Even if you look at the genetic level right now,

597
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
it's so funny, you know, conservatives are often like,

598
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
hey, you're on our team, why are you alerting them to the scope of the problem?

599
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You know, we win if we just sit back and let them disappear,

600
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
and it's like they're going to disappear no matter what.

601
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
If you look at the hereditability of voting patterns,

602
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
which is around 30 to 50%, you know,

603
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
whether this is done with identical twin studies and stuff,

604
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
this is not like fringe science, you can look up Geno politics on Wikipedia,

605
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
it's like mainstream.

606
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And you look at current fertility rates in countries like the U.S.,

607
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
we should expect about a one standard deviation shift

608
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
conservative in voting patterns over the next century.

609
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
In the next 10 or 20 years, we'll see a massive shift to the left

610
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
because as family units get atomized,

611
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
people vote more progressively.

612
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
When people don't have kids, they vote more progressively.

613
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But after that, you're going to see a massive shift in the other direction,

614
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and it's just inevitable from the statistics at this point.

615
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Has any country tried to fix this problem through authoritarianism,

616
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
and how does that work?

617
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
A lot have, it just doesn't.

618
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So Romania fit, what is it? Order 7707 or something?

619
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I don't know, maybe I'm getting a confused with Star Wars orders.

620
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But they decided under the communist period that they were going to ban abortion.

621
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And they thought, oh, this will be great.

622
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It'll shoot up fertility rates, and it did for a very brief period of time,

623
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
like two years or something like that.

624
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Then people found ways around it, and then after the law was repealed,

625
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
fertility rates crashed because fertility or having kids became associated

626
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
with really poverty often or low social status.

627
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And so you can look at countries like Iran that have been trying to implement things.

628
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's really funny, I watched what China is implementing right now,

629
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and it's like, Iran tried all of this 10 years ago.

630
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You guys can just look at what happened.

631
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You're going to have to get really aggressive if you actually want to solve this,

632
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and that's where I get really scared.

633
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Because a lot of countries, what we have found is that you can,

634
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
dictatorially, people have tried to ban abortions,

635
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
feel like what's happening in China now,

636
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:22,000
likely shutting down access to vasectomy clinics and stuff like that.

637
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So countries can ban these things,

638
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
and then it doesn't work because it doesn't work.

639
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So then what did they do?

640
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Then you get real handmaid's tale, and that gets scary for me.

641
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It was actually the peace on us in the Guardian,

642
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
and they were like, they had quoted me saying something like that,

643
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
and they go, well, that sounds like a threat.

644
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And I'm like, do you have the mind of a child?

645
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's like when I tell a child, don't touch the stove,

646
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
you're going to burn your hands.

647
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
They're like, that sounds like a threat.

648
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I'm trying to protect you here, but there's nothing I can do.

649
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
At the end of the day, the Titanic's hitting the iceberg.

650
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm just trying to prepare for what's going to happen next.

651
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But what happened next get really interesting.

652
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Sorry to keep talking.

653
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I don't want to.

654
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
No, keep going.

655
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
OK, so it's really cool here.

656
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
If you look historically, so when I started caring about this,

657
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I was in Korea, right?

658
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
95% population collapse.

659
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It was funny to think about because the memory is so strong there.

660
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Less than a century ago, Japan coming over,

661
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
murdering in Korea and China, millions of people,

662
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
this conflict there, China, Korea, Japan, trying to,

663
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
well, less Korea trying to take over the other two,

664
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
but mostly the other two trying to take over each other.

665
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
There's a lot of history there.

666
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And it's so funny that now any one of them could just,

667
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm like, how does Korea solve this?

668
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I guess they could import people from Japan or China.

669
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
No, you can't because their populations are collapsing.

670
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Any one of them could non-violently just walk into their neighbor

671
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
100 years from now.

672
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
They were able to motivate their citizens to kill people,

673
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
but they're not able to motivate them to have kids.

674
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And this is what's so interesting.

675
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It changes the game, but in a really beautiful way.

676
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You look at people like Putin who don't get the new world yet, right?

677
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
The world used to be, you keep out immigrants,

678
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
you maintain cultural integrity,

679
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and when you want to spread your culture, you go to other countries,

680
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
you kill their people, you subjugate them,

681
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and you force them to convert to your culture.

682
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
But that's not the game anymore.

683
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So you look at Russia, which has a desperately low fertility rate,

684
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
attacking their costless cultural and like ethnic neighbors,

685
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
the Ukraine, who also had the desperately low fertility rate,

686
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
both killing like an entire generation here.

687
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And they're never going to recover from this.

688
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It is not the game anymore, the game that they're still playing.

689
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You win now, not through war, but with love.

690
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And I say love and not just sex or spamming kids,

691
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
because if you spam kids,

692
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
they're going to breed like caged panda bears like everyone else.

693
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
They're going to not have any dedication to whatever weird thing about your culture

694
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
caused you to have a lot of kids,

695
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and they're just going to drift off into this monoculture and disappear.

696
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So what you need to do is you need to have a lot of kids,

697
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
but you also need to do a great job raising them,

698
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
make them proud of your cultural group,

699
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
make them want to continue that cultural group,

700
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
and those are the people who are going to be around in the future.

701
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And I'm really excited about that,

702
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
because that is so much better than the old system of murdering people.

703
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Can you try and explain or illustrate

704
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
what a world in deep population decline would be like?

705
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Yeah.

706
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So the first thing, and I often don't talk about, you know,

707
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
the first thing is all economies are going to collapse.

708
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Pretty much the Western economy.

709
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So our economic system is sort of a pyramid scheme.

710
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
A lot of people know this, but let's just spill it out.

711
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
If you look historically, people go, is this truism?

712
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
If I put money on this stock market, that money grows on average.

713
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
That has been happening because of two things.

714
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The number of workers has been growing exponentially,

715
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
and the productivity per worker has been growing around linearly,

716
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
a little exponentially, but mostly linearly.

717
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yes, technology has been growing exponentially,

718
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
but the productivity per worker is about linear,

719
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
or at least not close to the explosion worker population.

720
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
That is why the economy has always been growing.

721
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
If the worker population in the developed world

722
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
begins to collapse exponentially, people are like,

723
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
well, why don't people in desperately poor countries count?

724
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Because by definition, they have small economies.

725
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That's why they're poor, because their economies are small.

726
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So you don't need to wait for the world's population to begin to collapse

727
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
for all of the developed world's economies to begin to collapse.

728
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So you're going to begin to see the economy shrink on average.

729
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
It won't be like it is now where on average things go up.

730
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
On average things go down.

731
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
When things go down on average, people react very differently.

732
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You don't leave your money in the stock market anymore.

733
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You're going to have math withdrawals of money from the stock market.

734
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And then this begins to break a bunch of other systems.

735
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So you see things like Detroit.

736
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Okay, so why did Detroit ultimately end up having the problems it was having?

737
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And there's a few reasons.

738
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
One is our society uses this miraculous cheat code called debt.

739
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Now, I'm a private equity VC guy.

740
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm very familiar with debt.

741
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So let's just talk a little bit about how debt works

742
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and why it's such a miracle.

743
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
If I'm making a $10 investment in $8 of that into debt and $2 of equity

744
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and that investment grows to just $12, my equity in that investment has doubled.

745
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
But if it shrinks just $1, my equity has halved.

746
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
We leveraged our land, our businesses.

747
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Leveraged means took out debt against our cities, our states, our nations.

748
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's not people looking like the national debt.

749
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
No, no, no, no.

750
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's leveraged to the hilt all the way down.

751
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
If things start shrinking, the whole thing falls apart.

752
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And yes, national debt is a little different than personal debt and stuff like that.

753
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
But what you are beginning to see is essentially what we saw in Detroit.

754
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So people are like, oh, my house will be worth less.

755
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
That's great.

756
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Yeah, it's great if houses go down 20%, maybe 50%.

757
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But when people know a house is always going to decrease in price,

758
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
it decreases to a dollar.

759
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And when a house is a dollar, like what you saw in Detroit,

760
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
when a house is a dollar, there's no reason to maintain it

761
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
because houses cost a lot to maintain.

762
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
As anyone who is a homeowner knows, you put so much money into your house.

763
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
But you justify it because, OK, well, it's an asset that I own

764
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
and people stop investing in assets that way.

765
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So the whole way we relate to money and the economy is going to change.

766
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
So endless urban blight, economy is not functioning the way that they're supposed to function.

767
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So then what happens?

768
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Well, where do people begin to invest?

769
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
One is what happens in a negative scenario?

770
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So negative scenario, and this is what I'm terrified of,

771
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
is the developed world finds a cheat code, which is immigrants.

772
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
What they realize is that they can cheese their collapsing population

773
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
through mass immigration.

774
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But this cheat code only works if they keep really the only collection

775
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
of countries that has an above repopulation rate right now,

776
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
which is mostly in Africa, desperately poor.

777
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
So now you have an economic incentive, a gun to the head

778
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
of the entire developed world that Africa must stay in desperate poverty.

779
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Oh, you use Africa almost like a breeding ground

780
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
to create the future population to be pulled across into other countries.

781
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Yeah, it's sick, but that seems to be like when I talk to them,

782
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
that's like actually the going plan right now.

783
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
But I don't think it's going to work.

784
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I don't think that that plan is going to work so we can ignore it.

785
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
So what really happens?

786
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Well, because their economies are going to collapse

787
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
before they can do that sort of mass.

788
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Right now you're getting a lot of immigrants,

789
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
but it's immigrants who want to leave.

790
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And I think what a lot of people forget is a lot of people don't want to leave.

791
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Even when Ireland was suffering the potato famine,

792
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
what a lot of people don't know is that the landlords,

793
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
there was a rash of landlord murders at the time.

794
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And so they got scared.

795
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And so they would sometimes, I don't know how frequently,

796
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
offer to pay for all of their tenants to go to America on coffinships.

797
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It was horrible, but at least it was the idea.

798
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
That's the way I think many people would be imported these days, right?

799
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So a horrible immigration, but at least, you know,

800
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
they had the option to leave during the potato famine during this time

801
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
when people would walk into town and they saw everyone was dead

802
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
and then the corpses would start animating and they realized that they were just starting.

803
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Like it was bad, but the majority, a lot of people wanted to stay.

804
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And so I think what they're going to realize is that this,

805
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
this trickle of immigrants that we have right now,

806
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
it's pretty close to the max trickle of immigrants you can get.

807
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And it's only just offsetting population collapse right now.

808
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And when they get to the US, when they get to Europe,

809
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
their fertility rate collapsed.

810
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
First generation immigrants in the US only have a fertility rate of 1.7,

811
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
well below repopulation rate.

812
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So it's not like you could just bring immigrants and they solve the problem.

813
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You need to keep importing people.

814
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
But anyway, okay.

815
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Ignore all this.

816
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Okay.

817
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So world's collapsing.

818
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Where do you put your money?

819
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
If on average, the economy is collapsing.

820
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
This is where it gets cool because we get something we haven't had in a long time.

821
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Individual human lives start to matter.

822
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Individual human cultures start to matter.

823
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
If you have a cultural group that has a high fertility rate and is technophilic,

824
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
like they engage with technology.

825
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
And even if they're technophobic, but less of their technophobic,

826
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
that becomes a group you want to invest in.

827
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
That becomes a place you want to place money because that's the only place

828
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
that you can be fairly sure is going to grow in aggregate in the future.

829
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And that creates a totally different world economy than the one we have now.

830
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And it's a very interesting world economy.

831
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And so when people say like, what actually is our foundation sort of doing?

832
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Really, what we're doing is we're trying to identify those groups right now

833
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
and build connections between them so that we can have a pluralistic group

834
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
of thriving economies of the willing.

835
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And of the willing, what I mean is the people who were willing to have kids,

836
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
willing to give those kids a good enough life that they wanted to stay in that culture.

837
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Since learning about the current trends of population collapse, declining birth rates, etc.

838
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I've started to view a lot of the problems that we're facing,

839
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
especially the cultural ways that people see dating, family life, having kids,

840
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
relationships with their parents, the future of the world through a very different lens.

841
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And there's a trend at the moment that's only recently, like within the last couple of months,

842
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I've started seeing come out on the internet,

843
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
which is one of men in their 20s getting vasectomies as a protest against feminists

844
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
that want to be able to have free and easy sex.

845
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
It's literally like a clap back where you've got the pill, I'm going to get the snip.

846
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Have you seen this?

847
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I'm a fan. I mean, I focus more on the trans maxing movement. Have you heard of that?

848
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
No, what's trans maxing?

849
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Oh, it's fascinating.

850
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
So it's a group of guys who are not like traditional transit that they don't have gender dysphoria.

851
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
They don't feel like they were born the wrong gender.

852
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
They're just like, as a guy and as a not particularly attractive or not particularly wealthy guy,

853
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I got dealt a bad hand. Hormone therapy is easy to get access to these days.

854
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I'm going to become a woman. And that's what it is.

855
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
With what goal? What's the goal of it?

856
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
The goal is to get an easier life.

857
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I mean, if you've been consuming a fire hose of red pill and migtail content,

858
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
you know, it can sound like a pretty good idea to a lot of people, I think.

859
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Oh, because women have got it so much easier than men do.

860
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Therefore, if I become the closest thing that I can to a woman, it's going to fix all of my problem.

861
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Okay, fair enough. I mean, yeah, that that is an approach and the optional elected vasectomy in your 20s thing.

862
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I think sort of sit on the shelf next to each other for I wouldn't have predicted this on my 2023 bingo card.

863
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
But yeah, so just everything that I see, you know, this stophavingkids.org who you may be familiar with,

864
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
like this really serious anti-nateless movement.

865
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Have you heard of the involuntary anti-nateless movement?

866
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
They want to they want to sterilize the entire population.

867
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
They're like terrorists. They're just scary people.

868
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Wow. And what's the justification for this? I'm going to guess climate.

869
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Oh, no. So they're really just negative utilitarians.

870
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I think most anti-natalism and for people who aren't familiar with negative utilitarianism,

871
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:59,000
it's the belief that negative emotions are bad but positive emotions aren't inherently good

872
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,000
or that a human life, a negative emotions are more acute than positive emotions.

873
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Are they just much higher in volume?

874
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
The best the best the best example of this that I learned from a friend was

875
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
imagine that you got to spend the rest of your life in the optimal amount of bliss,

876
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
maxing out your pleasure, compare this to an existence where for the remainder of your life,

877
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
you were spent in maximum torture with as much pain as you can imagine.

878
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Or let's say that you did one and then did the other would one be worth the other

879
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
and most people have an inclination that suffering is somehow worse than pain that you are in

880
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:40,000
and then you net out after a human life, what was the group that involuntary anti-natalists

881
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
because of negative utilitarians?

882
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Yeah.

883
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
They basically say that a human life is net suffering overall.

884
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Therefore, it is morally reprehensible to bring any future life into this world

885
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
because the net experience is one of pain and torment and displeasure.

886
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Yeah.

887
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And I actually suspect that when we see this urban monoculture I've described begin to really dwindle in size

888
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
and the only people who are left are the most extremist was in it.

889
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
We're going to begin to have to deal with terrorists on that front and that really scares me.

890
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
But here's the thing, who's to know we aren't already dealing with terrorists on that front?

891
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Look at declining fertility rates around the world today.

892
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Biological fertility, declining sperm counts, declining testosterone.

893
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Who's to say there isn't something in the water?

894
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
You know what I mean?

895
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Do you think that someone's purposefully doing this?

896
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I don't know, man.

897
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I would hazard toward Hanlon's razor with stuff like this.

898
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Yeah.

899
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:41,000
The incentives align for people to believe that they're doing something which is sympathetic, empathetic,

900
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
caring, whether it be because of the environment, whether it be...

901
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
The environmental thing is such an interesting argument to me

902
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
because if you think that a planet that has too many people on it is bad for the planet,

903
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
wait until you see what a planet that has too few people on it is like.

904
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Oh, well, we existed 200 years ago.

905
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
There was only half a billion people or a billion people or whatever on the planet.

906
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
The planet's been fine with this many people on before.

907
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It's like, yeah, but what's the experience of the life like for the people that are on it?

908
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
What about all of the animals that you want to save?

909
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
What about all of the interjections that you want to make with regards to controlling the climate

910
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
to ensuring that all of the different ecosystems that you care about continue?

911
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So I've had a lot of pushback about talking about declining birth rates

912
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
and whatever you want to say, like dating sphere adjacent sometimes.

913
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Although I'm speaking to the researchers, I'm not doing a panel show with a bunch of different people

914
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
screaming at them saying that they're going to become loveless harpies in their 30s.

915
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I feel like the criticisms that people have about anybody that brings up declining birth rates

916
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
either haven't thought about the problem sufficiently well

917
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
or have a really, really perverse and malicious incentive

918
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
because anybody that sees a discussion about declining birth rates

919
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
is anything other than a concern for the future of human lives that haven't yet existed.

920
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
They're just not philosophically sophisticated.

921
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yeah, I'm totally open. I'm totally open to having the discussion

922
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
that maybe there is an optimal amount of population that would be great to have on the Earth.

923
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I think the carrying capacity of the planet is significantly higher than where we're at at the moment.

924
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And I think that climate mastery and all the rest of it we have a ton of work to do

925
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
for a whole host of things, whether that be AI alignment, whether that be grey goo from nanotechnology

926
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
but like pick your existential risk of choice, right?

927
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
But like fuck off, bro.

928
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,000
If you think that I'm not going to talk about the most existential of existential risks individually to you

929
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
and here's the other thing.

930
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
So folding this in, a lot of people will have listened to the Steven Shaw episode that I did

931
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
which was absolutely fantastic.

932
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I really love him as a demographer and a researcher in this world.

933
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And the novel, an interesting insight, the really novel interesting insight

934
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
that I'm going to kind of add into my worldview with regards to this that I've learned from you today

935
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,000
is looking at what happens when you roll the clock forward over a longer timeline

936
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
with which groups are going to continue to survive and which cultures are going to continue to survive.

937
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:20,000
If it's the case that you say that you care about a particular movement continuing to be pushed through the ages

938
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
because this is something that we should care about, let's say it's reducing the amount of people that are on the planet

939
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
to restrict climate change.

940
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Let's just say that it's climate change overall, right?

941
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
If you have, given the fact that political leaning is 50% heritable,

942
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,000
if you don't have any children, who do you think is going to continue that particular philosophy that you've got?

943
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Like you are literally making your ideology a dying breed.

944
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
No, I couldn't agree more.

945
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
And I think one of the things that I always think, you know, when you're talking about biodiversity and stuff like this,

946
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I always wondered, like, do these people not think into the future?

947
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Right now, from what we know about our planet, humans are the only species that can seed a new biome.

948
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
We are the only species that can get off planet, right?

949
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So if we seed a new biome in a million and 10 million years, it'll be just as rich as our own.

950
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
We could seed thousands, hundreds of thousands of new biomes.

951
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
If humanity doesn't win through this eye of the needle we're about to go through,

952
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
if humanity does die off, well, I mean, everything we know about physics today

953
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
says the sun will eventually expand and all life will go extinct.

954
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
It's in game.

955
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:38,000
You know, if you care about biodiversity in the long run, humans are critical to maximizing that.

956
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Although I will modify one thing you said.

957
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I think that there is a logical argument for negative utilitarianism.

958
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I think there's a logical argument for getting rid of humans.

959
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I don't agree with it.

960
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:00,000
These people are against my cultural group, but I don't think that they're just, like, completely insane either.

961
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Do you think it's a moral obligation to have children, then, with all of this sort of folded together?

962
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I think different people have different moral frameworks they're optimizing for.

963
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I think if somebody believes that their moral framework should continue to exist into the future,

964
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
200, 300 years into the future, like gender equality or something like that,

965
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
and you don't have kids, you have morally failed.

966
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,000
If you, however, are just like, no, it doesn't matter if my belief system dies out with me,

967
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
then whatever, you know, I'm not going to tell you that your morals are wrong

968
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
because I think that morality is one of those things where I believe that my morals are right,

969
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
if I go around trying to police everyone else's morality, I'm just going to have a bad time.

970
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So that line in the sand is one I've been really interested in playing about with.

971
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I absolutely agree that some sort of handmade tale future where women are kept in pens like cows

972
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
so that they can keep the future of the population going is wrong.

973
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Also, telling women that the only way that you can live a fulfilling life is by doing some domestic version of that.

974
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Also is wrong, but I can't see why there isn't any sympathy out there in the world

975
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
for the reverse of this situation.

976
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
What about all of the people who were told you don't need to have kids to have a fulfilling life

977
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
that did want to become mothers that had their preferences nudged in the opposite direction,

978
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
break through the fertility window and then grieve for families that they never had,

979
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
that where is the finger pointing going in the other direction?

980
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Because I don't see anybody unironically saying that women need to get out of the boardroom

981
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
and get back in the bedroom to start producing more children.

982
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I think that they're just saying, look, maybe you should think about the current cultural norms that are being pushed

983
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
and take them with a big spoonful of salt.

984
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Yeah, and I think that a lot of statistics women just aren't familiar with.

985
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Things that made my wife feel a lot more comfortable if you look at studies.

986
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Not all studies show this, but a number of them do.

987
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Is that parent households with two working parents,

988
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
the kids actually perform better academically and have better emotional health than parents with stay at home.

989
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It's a small effect.

990
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,000
But what I'm saying is, is that I think that there's this intuition that only the traditional way of doing things is correct.

991
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:21,000
And that the truth is, is what is correct is whatever ends up working in the long term for human civilization,

992
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
because nothing is really working right now.

993
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And so I just encourage people to, if they think I can't be a mom and in the boardroom,

994
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I would encourage you to rethink the way you're structuring your family,

995
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
rethink the way you're structuring finding a partner.

996
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
You know, earlier we were talking about dating markets,

997
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:42,000
and one of the things that our foundation is doing is we're working to try to create and promote new types of dating apps,

998
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
maybe even recreate the London season, you know, something like that,

999
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
but the travels between places like the Olympics where you have, you know, a bunch of the single people go,

1000
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
but there's some rules that make it harder to just have a really low switching cost between partners,

1001
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
which is one of the big problems that we're dealing with right now.

1002
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
So it was a lot of this is about experimenting with new social technologies

1003
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
and understanding that there probably are ways to have it all,

1004
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:13,000
much more than I think people want to accept because it requires trying new things and being called a freak by other people.

1005
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
What about people that say it's too expensive to bring a child into this world?

1006
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Why? Why are poorer people having more kids?

1007
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,000
If it's an issue of cost, then what you should see is a line where people have more kids,

1008
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
the more money they have, but typically the line goes in the other direction within and between countries

1009
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
until you get to like ludicrous levels of wealth, like half a million dollars a year.

1010
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So what I'd say is it's enormously expensive.

1011
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
It is a massive lifestyle sacrifice.

1012
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It absolutely is a lifestyle sacrifice, but is it too expensive?

1013
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I think that's the real thing.

1014
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Is it too expensive? Is it that you can't afford it?

1015
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Or is it that you would need to like us?

1016
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
We had to leave a city. We moved to a rural area.

1017
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
We changed the type of jobs we could get because of that.

1018
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
We made a lot of sacrifices to do this.

1019
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
And I understand that for families in less socially economically advantaged positions,

1020
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
they have to make even more sacrifices.

1021
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
But when a family decides they want a lot of kids, they do it.

1022
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And I think in addition to that, this is another area.

1023
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
One of the projects that we worked in was Project Eureka,

1024
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
which was a town for like single moms that had kids

1025
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
and other people who had kids and who wanted to co-raise kids

1026
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
because there are social technologies we can try.

1027
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And I would really like to see these commune systems and stuff like that begin to pop up more

1028
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,000
because I think as an investment prospect, they are a really good long-term investment prospect

1029
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
if you look at the model that I was talking about earlier.

1030
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
The challenges of...

1031
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
The reason that people say it's too expensive to bring a child into this world,

1032
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I don't think that they're talking about the cost on their finances.

1033
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I think they're talking about the cost on their freedom.

1034
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Oh, yeah.

1035
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:57,000
If you look at the reasons that are given for a lot of non-daters at the moment

1036
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
for people that are checking out of the dating market,

1037
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
it's just got better things to do, not wanting to lose personal freedom.

1038
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
There's this huge, huge study that was done by Pew.

1039
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And it just came back that people were just distracted.

1040
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
So what it seems is that if you are more financially enabled,

1041
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
there are more things that you can do with your finances,

1042
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
which means that you can go abroad to Bali.

1043
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Why not go to Bali for two weeks?

1044
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Well, if you have the kid, you can't go to Bali for two weeks.

1045
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
The girl with the list thing, which you must have seen that came off TikTok,

1046
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
a girl printed out 350 reasons not to have a child

1047
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
and then printed them all on a piece of paper.

1048
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
The reasons ranged from stuff like,

1049
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
a child is literally a parasite inside of you

1050
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
who can't wear my cute high heels anymore,

1051
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
can't do brunch on Sundays.

1052
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Yeah. So I want to get into this. I'm really excited.

1053
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
So there are, I think, two core reasons that people don't have kids

1054
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
within the category that you're talking about here.

1055
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
It's because they're optimizing for their personal happiness.

1056
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Now, this can be broad satisfaction, contentment, whatever word you want to use,

1057
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
but it's some sort of emotional optimization

1058
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
or they're optimizing for their own position within a local status hierarchy.

1059
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
This can be showing off to people on Twitter or whatever, you know,

1060
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
the trips that you're doing or the things that you're doing with your life

1061
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
because you think that these make you, you know, like better or higher within some group.

1062
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
As soon as you're not optimizing for one of those two things,

1063
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
typically having kids, or I suppose you could say that I'm trying to make the world a better place

1064
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:31,000
along some sort of framework like donating to like protecting ecology or something like that.

1065
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
A lot of that loops back to status though.

1066
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Yeah, a lot of that loops back to status.

1067
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So I think what we're going to see, and this is really cool

1068
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
because it's going to change what it means to be human.

1069
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
When people, I mean, even more than the other options people have right now,

1070
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
when Robosexuality, I always go back to the Futureama episode about this,

1071
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
that predicted this, when people can start dating AIs

1072
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
and you can have your deep fake girlfriend and stuff like that,

1073
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
and then eventually people will be able to go into pods

1074
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
and live any virtual reality lifestyle they want.

1075
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
When these sorts of things become possible,

1076
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
and they likely will within my grandkids' lifetime at least, if not our own,

1077
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
pretty much everyone who's optimizing for status or personal pleasure

1078
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
is going to be cold from the gene pool.

1079
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And any cultural group that can't motivate people to optimize for something else

1080
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
is going to be removed from the system,

1081
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
and that is going to fundamentally change what it means to be human,

1082
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
and likely have a pretty big impact on sort of the human sociological profile

1083
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
in terms of the genetic screening that's going to cause.

1084
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It's going to nudge the genetic disposition

1085
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
because the only cohorts that are left are going to have a particular type of predisposition.

1086
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
And over time that's going to, right?

1087
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Yeah, that's really, really interesting.

1088
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Because, you know, we all have this balance between

1089
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
hedonic pleasure and meaning that we seek in the future.

1090
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
You know, most parents, I don't think,

1091
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
if you were to test them on a minute-by-minute basis,

1092
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
it's not the most pleasurable thing in the world to raise a child,

1093
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
and I'm looking at some of the studies that I've seen.

1094
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
It's not massively pleasurable, but it's incredibly meaningful.

1095
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
And, you know, there has to be some sort of a spectrum

1096
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
where on one side someone lives for a life that in retrospect they're glad they're lived,

1097
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
and on the other side someone lives a life that moment to moment they're happy that they're living.

1098
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
And, you know, that spectrum between the two,

1099
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
am I living for a future that's meaning, or am I living for a now that's pleasure?

1100
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah, I'm so excited.

1101
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Well, I love what you're getting at here,

1102
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
which is how do you balance these two?

1103
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And the really cool thing is that biologically,

1104
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
we're already optimized to have kids.

1105
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And I think a lot of the unhappiness that comes in society today

1106
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,000
is that people forget that all of your ancestors had kids.

1107
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
They had sex, and they had kids.

1108
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
They're almost all of them dead, right?

1109
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,000
And so humans are programmed to find genuine contentment and happiness

1110
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,000
of a deeper kind and a more meaningful kind than they can get from almost anything else

1111
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
from continuing down the path that had led to our species being successful so far.

1112
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
And I think when you look at a lot of influencers right now,

1113
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
if you look at a lot of unhappiness, they are showing people

1114
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,000
what people are sort of biologically optimized for right after they go through puberty

1115
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
without people realizing that that optimization program changes as you get older.

1116
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Often there's a joke that I got in trouble for on Twitter,

1117
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
which is to say that I don't know if you know Blippi.

1118
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
He's like a blues clue sort of character who dances around around fire trucks for kids

1119
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
and is like, yeah, I'm driving a fire truck.

1120
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I'm playing in a dump truck.

1121
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I'm playing on the playground, you know, and kids are like,

1122
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
all this is the perfect life before they go through puberty.

1123
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
They see this. That's what they're optimized for.

1124
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
They're optimized for play and exploration.

1125
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
As an adult, you see this and you're like, oh my God, his life looks terrible.

1126
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I mean, obviously he probably makes a lot of money,

1127
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
but I mean, you wouldn't actually want to live that way.

1128
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And I often argue that Andrew Tate is sort of the Blippi for teenagers.

1129
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
This is what a teenage boy thinks is the ideal adult life.

1130
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But to an actual grown man, you see this and you can see sort of the deadness

1131
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
within his eyes and he's like, yeah, I have to please multiple women a day

1132
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
or they'll leave me and then I won't be able to maintain sort of the thing that I built up.

1133
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,000
And I'm like, oh my God, I can't even imagine having to just have a routine

1134
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
of constantly having sex every day so that I can at a base level

1135
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
maintain my economic empire.

1136
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
But to a young boy, this sounds, oh, that's the best

1137
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
because humans go through a second puberty when they have kids.

1138
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Your testosterone drops dramatically.

1139
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
You begin to gain happiness from different sources

1140
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
and it's a deeper kind of happiness.

1141
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And with young women, it's the same thing.

1142
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
With young women, they get told, oh, you're going to love traveling the world.

1143
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
You're going to love a certain point.

1144
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Love just becomes drawl, you know, because you were biologically programmed

1145
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
to want to know not everyone is, you know, people's biological programming is a bit different.

1146
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
You know, I could say that on average, human males are biologically programmed

1147
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
to find human females attractive.

1148
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
But obviously not all human males find human females attractive.

1149
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
So a few people don't go through this shift later in life.

1150
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
But when you optimize around the things that give you happiness,

1151
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
when you were a teenager and your whole society tells you to optimize around those things,

1152
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
you hit middle age and you're like, why doesn't anything really make me happy anymore?

1153
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Why aren't video games making me happy anymore?

1154
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Why aren't the things I used to do?

1155
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Why does these status games not make me happy anymore?

1156
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And it's because your culture used to tell you, hey, you need to move on to your next stage of life,

1157
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
but you don't have that culture anymore because you're in this bubble.

1158
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Going back to what you said about status and how status provides a incentive

1159
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:43,000
for people to behave in particular ways, ways that allow them to advertise their fancy trip to Bali

1160
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,000
and brunch and whatever on a Sunday on social media.

1161
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Have you considered a way of reprogramming statusful activities so that motherhood becomes pedestalized again?

1162
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I hate to say this, but I think for most of the population, people are like, oh, why don't you force them to?

1163
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I talk with some people and they're like, what about like banning porn or banning, you know, whatever, right?

1164
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Like would that force people to do this?

1165
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
And it's like, look, or banning social media, right?

1166
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:18,000
The cultural groups and people who aren't resistant to the existing pressures in this world that are sterilizing them,

1167
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
unfortunately, they're just kind of a lost cause.

1168
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
What we need to do is we need to find the few groups that have found a way to make themselves resistant to this

1169
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,000
and sort of nurture them so that they can survive through this period and then end up thriving,

1170
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
which is why we focus on things like trying to...

1171
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,000
It's not like humans are, well, it depends on your view of free will, I suppose,

1172
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
but we're not exactly deterministic beings, right?

1173
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,000
If we're able to nudge the culture in a way to get people to change their behavior, you know, people...

1174
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I had Peter Singer on the show yesterday.

1175
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Peter Singer managed to impact so many people's lives through animal liberation

1176
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
that wouldn't have done that without him nudging them in that way.

1177
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
There is status that was associated with being vegan.

1178
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Therefore, people started doing it.

1179
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
They were also brought into this philosophy that underpinned it.

1180
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I'm a club promoter by trade, right?

1181
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I ran nightclubs for my entire career.

1182
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
And with that, I understand the power of trends and mimesis.

1183
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I'm just thinking, at the moment, there is a mimetic trend about, like, motherhoods' lame or dangerous or freedom restricting.

1184
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Changing that trend technology seems something that could be quite a high-leverage opportunity.

1185
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Delta, you changed your mind on this, and I'm remembering conversations,

1186
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
because this is actually a debate I've had with my wife, and she's changed my mind before, but I forgot.

1187
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Which is, I think, well, she would argue, a core aspect of our advocacy, if we can,

1188
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:44,000
is to get it modeled in television shows and in other types of popular media

1189
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
that having lots of kids is a high-status thing.

1190
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:53,000
The big fear I have is I'm just really afraid of people having kids because it helps their status.

1191
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I would like it if it's like a yes and thing, but no matter what, when you make something a status thing,

1192
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:05,000
there's going to be a group of kids that are brought into the world only because of the way they augment the parent's status.

1193
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And that means that their parents are going to be narcissists, and they're going to be pretty...

1194
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
But you're right.

1195
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I mean, hopefully we can move culture in a way that doesn't just target the narcissist.

1196
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
That's more holistic.

1197
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Yeah, so we're about to get on to talking about another third rail of your approach to sort of embryo screening and genetic selection and stuff.

1198
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:34,000
But do you see it almost like, for one of a better word, like a breeding experiment that we have,

1199
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,000
not an experiment, but a breeding future that we have with humans,

1200
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
where there are going to be particular cohorts that continue.

1201
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
There are going to be particular cohorts that don't,

1202
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
given that a good chunk of our behavior is determined by our genes.

1203
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
The type of people that continue to reproduce will have a particular genetic predisposition,

1204
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
which means that we're going to nudge the entire human race's genetic predisposition in one direction.

1205
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Are we in the middle of a breeding experiment and are humans facing extinction?

1206
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I'd say it's a cultural experiment because the independent factor that's being changed is culture.

1207
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
And the dependent variable that we're measuring is their ability to have kids, so breed,

1208
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
but also maintain those kids within that social group.

1209
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
So if the kids just leave or they don't like their lifestyle as a child,

1210
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
you can't just give a kid a terrible childhood or they're not going to continue that cultural group.

1211
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And there has to be, this is actually a really interesting phenomenon here,

1212
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
where if you look at countries that are poorer but also have really low fertility rates,

1213
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,000
typically the common thing across those countries is that there is very low amounts of hope.

1214
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
This is why China has such a low fertility rate, because people was in China,

1215
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
this is where the, we are the last generation meme comes from.

1216
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
They're like, what am I just having kids so the government can use them?

1217
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Like there's no more like social mobility here or something like this.

1218
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And I think it's why when you're looking at a cultural group like Jews and Israel,

1219
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,000
there's such a high fertility rate as there is a high level of cultural hope within that cultural group.

1220
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
They feel like when they have kids, they're not just, you know, grits for the grindstone.

1221
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
They can move up within the culture, even if they're in a low status position.

1222
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,000
So I would agree with everything you're saying, and I'm really excited for this experiment.

1223
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I imagine that the discussions around climate are just another really pernicious sort of convincing factor

1224
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
about why people shouldn't have kids.

1225
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Not only are you contributing to the burning of fossil fuels,

1226
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
not only are you going to increase greenhouse gases, which are going to kill all of these other animals,

1227
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:41,000
but the life that your child is going to have on this planet is also going to be filled with fumes and grey skies,

1228
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
and it's going to be toxic and whatever.

1229
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
But this is, I was going to say, this is also just the latest apocalyptic cult in the US, you know,

1230
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
and it's not going to be the last one, you know.

1231
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:58,000
We keep having, if the US is dotted by anything, it's dotted by sort of apocalypticism and fears.

1232
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
The US actually, Jewish and Christian traditions more generally are dotted by this.

1233
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
And I think the next one we're going to see is AI.

1234
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Why would you have kids when AI is going to kill us all?

1235
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
You know, it's just a cycle and it keeps going.

1236
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
You do know that there's people watching this right now that is saying,

1237
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
well, what about you two?

1238
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
You two are just saying that it's the birth rate decline apocalypse.

1239
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
You're the same Cassandra as that you're accusing everyone else of being.

1240
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Well, because I would say that I do argue that things are going to get worse,

1241
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
but I don't argue they're going to kill us all.

1242
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I think if you look at real climate change data, it says, which I believe the climate is going to get worse.

1243
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
A lot of suffering is going to happen because of it, but it's not going to kill us all.

1244
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
That climate message hasn't done as well as spreading as, you know,

1245
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Greta Thornberg's and one of your recent podcasts is that everyone's going to be dead in five years due to the climate.

1246
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
AI is going to massively change what it means to be human.

1247
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,000
It could even cause some major catastrophes, but it's not going to turn us all into goo.

1248
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:02,000
And so I think that there is, it's right to say that we in the world have actual things to be afraid of.

1249
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
There's going to be actual systemic shifts, but I think that's different than just apocalypticism

1250
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
and being like, we're all going to die. No need to think about the future.

1251
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
You know, Harold camping style, right?

1252
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,000
OK, so the Millerist movement getting on to what you did with your children.

1253
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
We've discussed what the world should do, how we should move forward.

1254
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Some of the challenges, some of the reasons that people don't.

1255
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,000
What is the unique process that you went through with your wife?

1256
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
So this is spicy.

1257
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:38,000
What we did is we did full genetic sequencing of our embryos and we use those genetic

1258
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
sequencing to inform the order in which we implanted the embryos.

1259
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
So why did we do this?

1260
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Well, you have to do biopsies of embryos anyways, often to determine if they're halfway

1261
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
or not. Not everyone does this, but most people do.

1262
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
It's the normal thing you do when you're doing IVF.

1263
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
We had to do IVF anyway because my wife was unable to get pregnant naturally due to, you know,

1264
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
having depression when she was younger, which caused her to develop anorexia,

1265
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
which meant that she doesn't like mistreat naturally.

1266
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
And she actually was trans women.

1267
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:13,000
She often doesn't like competition to see who has to take more hormones to be a woman.

1268
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,000
And so, you know, she has to do all of this stuff to have kids.

1269
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
So I had to do IVF anyway.

1270
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
We had to do the biopsies anyway.

1271
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
And now with genetic screening data, we could go through that and her mom died

1272
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
solely of cancer.

1273
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
And so we were able to look at that.

1274
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And, you know, she suffered from major depressive disorder, which also has genetic

1275
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
feelings.

1276
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
So we were able to look at these things and say, well, I mean, if we can choose to

1277
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,000
lower the probability that our kids have to deal with these genetic conditions,

1278
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
like, would we lower that probability?

1279
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Like, to me, people are like, yeah, but people will make fun of you on Twitter

1280
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
if you do this.

1281
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
It's like, yeah, okay, my kid comes to me and they're like, dad, I really, you know,

1282
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
want to kill myself right now or have migraines.

1283
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
That was another thing we selected against.

1284
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
You could have selected against this and you didn't because people were going to make

1285
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
fun of you on Twitter.

1286
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Like, and this is just our cultural group.

1287
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
So people try to connect this with eugenics.

1288
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
But eugenics, the definition of eugenics is very clear.

1289
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
It's the belief that there's good and bad genes and that the good genes should be distributed

1290
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
maximally throughout society, which is sort of the antithesis of what we believe.

1291
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,000
We believe every family, every cultural unit has beliefs about good and bad genes, right?

1292
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Like our family doesn't want our kids to get cancer.

1293
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:27,000
But that reproductive choice should always be in the hands of individual families and

1294
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
individual cultural groups and that it should never be enacted.

1295
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
If anything, I would say that it's eugenics for the government to come and tell my family

1296
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:40,000
the genetic choices we should make because it views sort of pure, unaltered human DNA

1297
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
as the superior form of humanity.

1298
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Like they're actually saying we need genetic purity in humanity and you're tainting the

1299
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
genetic purity of the human species by like selecting things.

1300
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I don't know.

1301
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
To me, that sounds much more eugenics than me being like, I don't want my kids to get cancer.

1302
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
And this is something many cultural groups have done over time.

1303
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Like Orthodox Jews have to do this with Tay Sacks.

1304
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Some black communities have to do this with sickle cell.

1305
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Like it's also like an anti-Semitic and racist position to call this sort of genetic

1306
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
selection and this sort of reproductive choice eugenics.

1307
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
So I think that we do support and I think now here's the thing.

1308
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,000
That's the nice way to put all of this, but then let's go big or go home.

1309
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Let's be controversial here, right?

1310
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
So what happens if we really hold this position in the future?

1311
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Well, when we say our foundation's goal is to preserve and increase human diversity,

1312
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
a lot of people miss the and increase human diversity part because as soon as families

1313
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
have these choices, a lot of people think families are all going to choose the same thing.

1314
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I love it.

1315
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:51,000
People are like, isn't everyone going to choose like a white buff child?

1316
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
And it's like, no, no.

1317
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Like black families aren't going to choose like little Aryan kids or something.

1318
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
What are you out of your mind?

1319
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Everyone's going to choose things that optimize for their cultural traditions value system.

1320
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
And we're entering into this grand experiment where some of those value systems will prove

1321
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
to be more efficacious than other value systems.

1322
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Right now people are like, oh, you could select for IQ.

1323
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,000
We didn't select for IQ, but you could theoretically select for IQ and we might do it in the future.

1324
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
But IQ is such a like a bad metric because we're in the early days of this technology.

1325
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Eventually IQ will be 80 different things.

1326
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Are you optimizing for creativity?

1327
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Are you optimizing for in the same way?

1328
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
You don't just optimize for strengths.

1329
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
You optimize for agility.

1330
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
You optimize for lean muscle.

1331
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
You optimize for like this type of muscle fiber versus this type of muscle fiber.

1332
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:47,000
And we will see this blossoming, I hope, of human diversity at a level that makes our existing ethnic diversity look trite.

1333
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,000
And subcultures will be very intolerant to this new diversity, but I'm excited for it.

1334
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I'm excited for it because I think that when we have new perspectives, when we have new ways of doing things,

1335
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
a new cultural optimization, we get something more beautiful.

1336
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And one of the core focuses of our foundation is trying to get the cost of this technology as low as possible.

1337
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
And a lot of people, they hear about this technology and they go, oh, it must cost a fortune.

1338
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I mean, theoretically, it doesn't really.

1339
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,000
You're looking at genome sequencing, which we've gotten tremendously cheap.

1340
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,000
And then once the genome is sequenced, you're just comparing it to a data table.

1341
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,000
So right now, you know, if you did this at the state level, it would be tremendously inexpensive to do.

1342
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,000
And, you know, you could do this for like 50 cents a family and maybe like $50 per egg that's sequenced.

1343
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,000
And when you compare this to the cost of IVF, that is like nothing.

1344
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And many states are already supporting IVF, like the UK, like Israel.

1345
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:53,000
So to say that this technology could be widely available is not an irresponsible thing to claim at all.

1346
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
And I'm really excited for it.

1347
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Can you see why some people would feel uncomfortable or feel that this is a controversial technology to start using to be able to select for particular traits that a child would have?

1348
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Yeah, I mean, I see that when the problem is that it's controversial, except in every specific instance.

1349
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
It's controversial to your selecting that your kids don't get cancer.

1350
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
It's controversial to your selecting that your kids don't get major depressive disorder.

1351
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,000
And if you stopped me and my kid ended up committing suicide, are you at all to blame for that?

1352
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Do you take any responsibility?

1353
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And then people are like, well, this technology isn't foolproof.

1354
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
It doesn't 100% prevent those things.

1355
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And that's like, you know, one of these religious extremists who don't want to do blood transfusions being for their kid, you know, when their kid's dying or something.

1356
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Like, well, blood transfusion doesn't always work.

1357
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
It's like, so what?

1358
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
You're giving your kid a chance.

1359
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I mean, smoking during pregnancy doesn't always cause your child to have tons of deformities, but it's probably not advised.

1360
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Yeah.

1361
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
And I support the cultural groups that don't want to use this.

1362
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
They may be right in the long term, you know?

1363
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Humanity is an experiment, right?

1364
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
They may be right.

1365
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I may be wrong.

1366
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
And the future will prove which group is right and wrong.

1367
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,000
And we might might turn out that all of these decisions we're making, they don't end up making any difference, right?

1368
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
All we're using this technology for right now is to order our eggs.

1369
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Now, suppose somebody was like, oh, yeah, but I just want to create tons of embryos and choose the best embryos, right?

1370
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And this is where I think you get the genuinely...

1371
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
What do you mean?

1372
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Sorry, what do you mean when you say order your eggs?

1373
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Oh, it's the choice.

1374
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:30,000
It determines the eggs we choose first, but we still hope to use all of our embryos.

1375
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Not eggs, embryos.

1376
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,000
But so it's not like we're saying this human gets to exist or this human doesn't get to exist because of their genes.

1377
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:44,000
But I mean, functionally, eventually, because my wife has a C-section with every pregnancy, they're probably eventually going to take it out to some extent we are doing that.

1378
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:55,000
But I can understand, like when people say every human embryo is a life and you shouldn't be playing these games, that's the moral argument against what we're doing that I think holds the most water.

1379
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:05,000
The way that I look at that argument is to say, well, IVF generally, which needs, you know, you need to discard some eggs often if you're going to do IVF in any sort of economically sustainable way.

1380
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
It requires you discarding embryos and it expands the human fertility window.

1381
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:21,000
So to me, from my cultural perspective, every human I decide not to have, like if somebody was like, okay, pick up this pin and a human doesn't exist in the future, I'll decide not to have a human.

1382
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
If you pick up this pin, then I have functionally killed that human.

1383
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And so I can understand why like Catholic groups and stuff like that would look at what we're doing and say that, well, I think that humanity only starts at like sperm production.

1384
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Or at the production of an embryo.

1385
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And so I get that argument.

1386
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
It's just not my cultural practice.

1387
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And I hope that they can at least understand the spirit with which we're doing this, which is to, you know, maximize the number of offspring we have and increase their quality of life.

1388
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:53,000
If all that you're doing is playing around with the order of the embryos that you have, why does the order matter?

1389
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Well, because we likely won't be able to use all of them.

1390
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I mean, really,

1391
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Okay, but that's the same.

1392
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Like choosing the order is the same as discarding, right?

1393
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Yeah, it's probably functionally the same.

1394
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
But I mean, again, I just don't know how I can explain to my kid.

1395
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Oh, yeah, you got cancer because I decided not to do this when it was.

1396
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
So I had Johnny Anomaly on the show about two months ago.

1397
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And I love the guy.

1398
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Yeah.

1399
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
He really, he really sort of opened my eyes to this.

1400
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:31,000
And the most compelling argument that I heard was as soon as you concede that, let's say the testing that some Jewish groups, Ashkenazi Jews, I think go through.

1401
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:38,000
To ensure that they don't partner up with, yeah, Tasek partner up with somebody that is going to give their child something that's awful.

1402
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
The same thing occurs within other groups.

1403
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:55,000
And then roll the clock forward a tiny little bit and you say, if we can select to avoid really, really reliably heritable cancer that is just every single woman all the way back for as long as I can research it has always had some form of cancer.

1404
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:09,000
As soon as we can select for that to not happen, you open the door to say, well, okay, what's the difference between that and selecting for someone that's a little bit more conscientious because conscientiousness is associated with improved outcomes in life.

1405
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
What about somebody that's not going to have depression?

1406
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
What about somebody that's not going to have anxiety?

1407
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:24,000
What about somebody that's blah, blah, blah, like as soon as you open the door to not having something negative, you also then look start to get into selecting toward positive traits too.

1408
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Is there a line that gets drawn in the sand for you with regards to this?

1409
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
No, I believe every family should be able to make their own reproductive choices.

1410
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
And when we talk about things like IQ, he's absolutely right.

1411
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:42,000
If you look at this really rough thing we have now, IQ, that I hope we can break apart into a bunch of different things and get much more specific ways.

1412
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Right now, I mean, this is correlated with lower rates of rape, lower rates of incarceration, lower rates of, I mean, raping other people, lower rates of murdering other people.

1413
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Like there are real reasons why you may select for this.

1414
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
And I love when people are like, oh, that's unethical.

1415
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And I'm like, we live in a culture today where it is normal to dope your kids with amphetamines so that they score slightly higher on standardized tests where people do these little things where they're like, what would I give for two points of IQ?

1416
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And yet the fact that you could make a selection here is off the table.

1417
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
But we also need to consider that eventually as a species, we're going to have to do this.

1418
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And this is something that people just aren't talking about.

1419
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
So if you look at, okay, dysgenic pressures.

1420
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:31,000
So historically, like 50% of humans died, you know, in childhood or early in their life hood or something like that.

1421
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Right.

1422
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
And this prevented a lot of the diseases that we see in our society today.

1423
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:47,000
As we get better at things like C-section and keeping kids alive and stuff like that, we're going to see an increasing number of heritable diseases that previously would have been selected out of humanity.

1424
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,000
So you really only get two choices before every human is just a walking ball of cancer.

1425
01:22:52,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Either you start selecting humans before they're born, or three choices, or you start completely editing and writing humans.

1426
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I think maybe there you can get into even more morality, or you start selecting humans after they're born.

1427
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Or I guess you can just enter this future where everyone's like this walking cancer golem of all of these things that previously would have been selected out, but our medical technology.

1428
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I think that the most ethical choice there long term is probably to make these selections before, you know, the cells really begin to replicate.

1429
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:44,000
In your eyes, is there anything different ethically between rolling the dice of which sperm is going to get there first with which egg at which particular time during the years bunch of cycles and selecting.

1430
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Let's say that you were able to do a selection somehow that didn't involve discarding eggs because that would be a difference.

1431
01:23:51,000 --> 01:24:07,000
As far as you're concerned, is there anything different about parents going out of their way to choose the kind of life traits person that is going to come out as opposed to just saying we roll the dice when it happens, it happens.

1432
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,000
And with the combination that happens is what the child is going to get.

1433
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Well, I mean, we as a society have been doing this for a while.

1434
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I mean, if you consider that sort of thing, you know, eugenics, then not allowing brothers and sisters to marry as eugenics, because the reason presumably we have those losses that leads to negative genetic outcomes.

1435
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Again, I just go back to I say that reproductive choice should always be at the level of the family.

1436
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,000
And as soon as the state or an outside force says that a family can make these genetic choices and can't make these genetic choices.

1437
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:50,000
That is the core of what eugenics is because you are saying people born of these genetic choices are somehow genetically morbid or or or like some sort of a monstrosity.

1438
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
And then what do you do?

1439
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
What they're a second class citizen?

1440
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
I don't know.

1441
01:24:53,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I just don't think there's any way where you can begin to police families, genetic choices that doesn't turn into the the most evil of eugenics.

1442
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Do you think that there's an ethical difference between selecting embryos and going in there and actually manipulating genes and tinkering with stuff directly?

1443
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Yeah, I think in a lot of people's mind, there is a difference.

1444
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,000
But I think that again, this should be a cultural choice.

1445
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
I think that every parent should have the choice to to make the gene.

1446
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,000
It's always funny when people they say, oh, he and his wife think that we're they're like genetically superior.

1447
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I'm like, we're the ones editing our genes.

1448
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Like we think we are the least genetically superior of anyone.

1449
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
We are editing our genes through the hoops to try and make them as viable as possible.

1450
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Yeah, exactly.

1451
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:45,000
So here's one final thing, you know, to tie the two things that we've spoken about today together.

1452
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:52,000
A lot of people are told about the miracle that is IVF.

1453
01:25:52,000 --> 01:26:01,000
There are some concerns, I think that maybe women and men are overly reliant on it to believe that it can extend the fertility window out essentially indefinitely.

1454
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
IVG, which may actually end up doing this.

1455
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Maybe we'll we'll see.

1456
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I'm a fan.

1457
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
You want to talk about what IVG is?

1458
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Fuck it.

1459
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Tell everybody what IVG is and tell them it.

1460
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Tell them it in a very accessible way because Johnny taught me it and I don't I couldn't recite it.

1461
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
So teach it as if you're teaching it to a golden retriever.

1462
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:26,000
IVG basically means that you can create eggs and sperm from any human cell.

1463
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
So it means that two gay people could have a kid that's biologically theirs.

1464
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:38,000
But it also means you can do fancier things like you could have a poly couple of like 13 people and they could have a kid that is biologically out of theirs.

1465
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
It basically allows you to I mean in the simplest form is just egg and sperm from anyone.

1466
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:48,000
But this is really cool because it means, you know, if you're older, you know, you can have kids that are that are healthier.

1467
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
And a lot of people are having kids when they're older.

1468
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:57,000
But then, you know, you combine this with artificial wombs who were close on that technology to that completely.

1469
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Like when we're talking about cultural changes and technological and cultural solutions to technological and cultural problems, a lot of them are going to look like IVG.

1470
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
A lot of them are going to look like artificial wombs.

1471
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:16,000
What we may find is one of the solutions to the current collapsing birth rates is like gay triads or something like that, right?

1472
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Or poly cities.

1473
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Or like, I'm not saying that these things will work, you know, but if any of these sorts of cultural groups want to survive into the future,

1474
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:33,000
they're going to have to find ways to make themselves raising kids and keeping their culture alive work.

1475
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:43,000
And so I'm very excited to see how these technologies expand options for people and expand the diversity of cultures that are possible.

1476
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Because there's many more creative people than me out there who might find even more exciting ways to raise families and increase the cultural diversity of our species.

1477
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Just going back to the conversation about IVF.

1478
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,000
For the people that haven't been through it or don't know somebody that has been through it, what's the experience like?

1479
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
It's painful.

1480
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
You should ask my wife.

1481
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I've seen these shots right into the butt.

1482
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I don't know how she handles it.

1483
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
And she does this as a routine.

1484
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
We have a kid a year.

1485
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
She wants to keep doing this for like 10 years.

1486
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I don't, she is a tough, like, um, but it is painful.

1487
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
This woman was a woman who worked through her first pregnancy.

1488
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
She went to the hospital.

1489
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
She was taking sales calls while she was having contractions.

1490
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Back to work was in five days.

1491
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
The level of pain she felt when getting egg extractions and stuff like that was higher.

1492
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
We're not higher than pregnancy, but I mean, it was hard.

1493
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
She is not somebody who complains about pain.

1494
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
She doesn't complain about the shots, but the egg extractions, they really hurt.

1495
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
And I know that because she wouldn't, she wouldn't mess around with that stuff.

1496
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
So what I can say is it's a, it's a painful process.

1497
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:56,000
But if you see kids as like your mandate in life for me, not having kids is the equivalent of suicide or something like that.

1498
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Um, it's just not an option for me.

1499
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Um, and I, I'm glad that my wife, you know, I love if you had her on sometime.

1500
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
She's a, she's a weird woman, um, but really fun.

1501
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Um, she's seeing similar to I do.

1502
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
And so it's just not even something we would consider.

1503
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
We're going to do everything we can.

1504
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
And we tried to conceive naturally for like five years and it just wasn't in the cards.

1505
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:21,000
And I think increasingly what families are going to realize is, uh, it's really hard to get pregnant these days.

1506
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Humans are becoming infertile as a species.

1507
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
We're becoming infertile.

1508
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,000
And you're, and when you look at things like artificial wombs, they may be one of our only shots.

1509
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Uh, because when we hear, when I hear women who have these complicated pregnancy, when I hear stillbirths,

1510
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:41,000
oh my God, if your wife has carried a kid or you've carried a kid, when you think of a baby dying in that last trimester

1511
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,000
and you know that with stuff like artificial wombs, we can lower the probability of that,

1512
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:50,000
it just breaks your heart and you would want to do anything you can to accelerate the pace of this technology.

1513
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Malcolm Collins, ladies and gentlemen, dude, I, I find all of this,

1514
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I find all of this discussion a combination of harrowing, inspiring and interesting.

1515
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Uh, so for the people who want to find out more about the stuff that you do and keep up to date with your work, where should they go?

1516
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:11,000
So, uh, our book series, The Pragment to Sky Theory, The Pragment to Sky to Craft and Religion is the most relevant to this conversation.

1517
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
It's on Amazon, it's for 99 cents, the ebook.

1518
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Um, Twitter account, Simone H. Collins.

1519
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Um, or just, you know, search Simone and Malcolm Collins on Twitter.

1520
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
We have a joint account because I hate using Twitter.

1521
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Um, and we're recently starting up our YouTube and podcast.

1522
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Um, uh, we just uploaded the first episode of starting it back up today, which is, uh, Simone and Malcolm Collins based camp.

1523
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Um, so, uh, we're hoping that that's fun.

1524
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,000
I'd love to have you on some time if we're able to get enough followers to be worth your time.

1525
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Malcolm, I appreciate you. Thank you.

1526
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
What's happening, people? Thank you very much for tuning in.
