Just how triggering are our phones when it comes to dopamine?

00:03.280 --> 00:10.400
Okay, great question. We often hear that social media getting dopamine hit after dopamine hit.

00:11.200 --> 00:16.400
When we first get on social media for the first time or after a long period of time,

00:16.400 --> 00:20.800
the amount of dopamine that's released we think is quite substantial. It's novel. Remember,

00:20.800 --> 00:26.240
dopamine is about novelty, surprise, and the sense that we are on some exciting track.

00:26.240 --> 00:30.800
That's what dopamine is really about. It puts us into states of readiness, anticipation, looking,

00:30.800 --> 00:36.080
seeking, et cetera, almost always for things outside the confines of our skin. Just to contrast it,

00:36.080 --> 00:41.200
maybe for a bit more of a future discussion, serotonin does the opposite. When there's a lot

00:41.200 --> 00:46.080
of serotonin in our brain and body, typically it makes us feel satisfied, sated, and more quiescent,

00:46.080 --> 00:51.280
comfortable with what we have in our own immediate sphere and within us. The comfort of a good meal,

00:51.280 --> 00:55.840
the food you have, dopamine is about go, go, go. If you look at somebody who's high on cocaine or

00:55.840 --> 01:00.880
methamphetamine, it's all about pursuit because that's a very dopaminergic drug. You look at somebody

01:00.880 --> 01:05.360
who's taken a drug, and I'm not suggesting people do this, but it really ramps up serotonin. Let's

01:05.360 --> 01:11.040
say a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, prozaxol, et cetera. The side effects of those drugs,

01:11.040 --> 01:16.960
if the dosages are too high, lack of appetite, lack of libido, kind of meh about life,

01:17.680 --> 01:21.120
then so they'll adjust the dose down. That's because those are serotonergic drugs.

01:21.760 --> 01:29.040
So in general, when we are in pursuit of things, dopamine is quite high.

01:30.640 --> 01:33.680
Now you have to remind me your question because I've set up the dopamine serotonin

01:33.680 --> 01:40.720
parallel cell phones. Yes, forgive me. So the thing about cell phones is when you first get on

01:40.720 --> 01:46.720
there and you have no Wi-Fi on the flight or something and you land, it can actually be quite

01:46.720 --> 01:51.840
stimulating. You get a lot of dopamine. Oh, there's this. Oh, there's that. But very quickly,

01:51.840 --> 01:57.200
when you're scrolling on social media, you're no longer getting the novelty, but you're continuing

01:57.200 --> 02:01.200
to do it and you almost don't know why you're doing it. At that point, it shifts over to something

02:01.200 --> 02:06.400
that's a bit more like an obsessive compulsive behavior, where we can define an obsessive

02:06.400 --> 02:10.560
compulsive behavior where the obsession leads to a compulsion. So the obsession is a thought,

02:10.560 --> 02:16.000
the compulsion is a behavior, but the acting out of the compulsion merely serves to increase

02:16.000 --> 02:21.120
the obsession. This is very different than being obsessed with food or obsessed with cleanliness.

02:21.120 --> 02:25.840
There's no payoff. Right, exactly. There's no anxiety relief by carrying out the compulsion.

02:25.840 --> 02:32.720
With OCD behaviors, like scrolling social media, the dopamine quickly wanes and then you find that

02:32.720 --> 02:36.480
you're just sort of, and we've all been there, you're scrolling and like, why am I doing this?

02:36.480 --> 02:41.440
This isn't that interesting. This isn't that interesting. Now, the algorithms for social

02:41.440 --> 02:45.760
media are very clever. And I don't want to demonize it. I provide a lot of, a lot of my life

02:45.760 --> 02:53.760
has spent on social media now, but the algorithms that they've incorporated function on the most

02:53.760 --> 03:00.880
powerful way to keep people doing a behavior or an animal for that matter is intermittent random

03:00.880 --> 03:04.640
reward, a random intermittent reward that you don't know when you're going to hit the jackpot.

03:04.640 --> 03:08.480
So you're scrolling, you're scrolling, and then you see something. Typically, it's very high,

03:08.480 --> 03:13.040
what in nerd speak, we'd say signal to noise. So if you're reading some interesting things,

03:13.040 --> 03:18.880
this came out in the news, this came out, and then it's all of a sudden a riot or a person that

03:18.880 --> 03:25.280
is jumping, is based jumping off a building or for people that are scrolling, looking at bodies

03:25.280 --> 03:29.520
or something like that, live bodies that hopefully people aren't looking at dead bodies. But look,

03:29.520 --> 03:35.200
if something's very tragic, then that has this gravitational pull. And then what happens is you

03:35.200 --> 03:40.320
start getting the system working for that next dopamine hit that you don't know when it's going

03:40.320 --> 03:46.080
to come. It's just like gambling. So I look at social media as initially being very dopaminergic,

03:46.080 --> 03:50.960
driving rewards, surprise and excitement, but very quickly transitioning to something more like OCD

03:51.680 --> 03:57.040
and the kinds of behaviors where it looks, if we were to look at ourselves through the lens of an

03:57.040 --> 04:02.640
experiment like we would an animal experiment, we think that animal is sick. If you saw an animal

04:02.640 --> 04:06.640
digging in the corner, looking, looking, looking, looking for a bone, the dog is looking, looking,

04:06.800 --> 04:11.760
looking, looking, looking, looking, looking, looking, you'd think that's really sad. That's us.
