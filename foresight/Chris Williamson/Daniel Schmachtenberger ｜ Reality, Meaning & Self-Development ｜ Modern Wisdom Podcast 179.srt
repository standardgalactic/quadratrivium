1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,680
Wisdom is not algorithmic and cannot be made algorithmic you can't have a if this than that algorithm that actually equals wisdom and if you can then we're just a intermediate bootloader for the a is there better creatures in us right.

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:37,400
Daniel I I'm very impressed that we finally managed to get this recording sorted not only between time difference challenges or me needing to rearrange or a global pandemic were finally here we finally got each other on the line.

3
00:00:38,360 --> 00:01:03,740
Yeah the global pandemics fuck up our schedule sometimes it's very inconvenient yeah it's incredibly inconvenient you know I'm so as you're aware we talk a lot on this podcast about self development and you help people to make sense of the world sense making preventing global catastrophic risks so in light of the way that the world is at the moment.

4
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:18,140
What are your thoughts about how people can develop themselves whilst still ensuring that we have a functioning world that isn't isn't risky.

5
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:28,580
We can go like a million places with that question and so we'll just start and see what happens.

6
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,700
Even the topic of personal development.

7
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:44,100
What that means is pretty ambiguous the idea of development means that something can progress to some stage of more refinement or more capacity.

8
00:01:45,100 --> 00:02:01,460
And so we know what that means in mathematics or in playing classical piano or weightlifting right there's some sense of progressive development but what does it mean for a person to develop beyond early adulthood we also have a very clear sense that children go through developmental stages.

9
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:10,140
Of increasing their cognitive and social and linguistic and motor and all these types of capacities but then when does that stop.

10
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:22,740
Does it have to stop there's a development of more skills but what does becoming a more developed human being fundamentally mean is a philosophic is spiritual religious existential question.

11
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,820
And so the question of what is a meaningful human life is underneath that.

12
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:38,820
And then how do I effectively develop myself aligned with what is most meaningful.

13
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:57,900
And when I'm asking what is a meaningful human life there's not just my own experience but how do I relate to the whole of life how does the meaningfulness of life relate to both what I experience and also what I contribute to the experience of others.

14
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:14,020
And so when we think about the current world situation does the world situation we're in create a context for what kinds of human development are relevant within the general parameters of some universal truths and.

15
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:27,060
It certainly does because what the world needs if we want to really effectively serve to protect against unnecessary harm and to increase the quality of life it needs different skills that it needed a thousand years ago.

16
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:35,060
And it needs different it actually needs totally different kinds of minds and sense making in many ways.

17
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:43,060
And then some aspects of it are obviously going to be the same across lots of contexts like the refinement of our clarity in our own motivation.

18
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,260
And our own emotional resilience and things like that.

19
00:03:50,260 --> 00:04:03,260
I think the motivation is an interesting one to start on which is as soon as you have a concept of human development and there's some concept of more developed and you can conceptually understand that to try and orient yourself.

20
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,260
Then.

21
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:14,260
There becomes an inherent comparison with other people of are they comprehensively more developed human than I am.

22
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:22,260
And or am I more than they are and is my thinking that I'm more than they are some sign of ego which is actually a sign of low development.

23
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,260
In some particular way.

24
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:34,260
And it's easy to cognitively understand what some higher stage of development would express like.

25
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,260
And be able to act it without it actually being real.

26
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:51,260
And so as soon as there's you know you read David Deiden you have the an authentic man is such and such or a embodied woman is such and such or whatever you can just start acting that.

27
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,260
And having it be totally not real and having.

28
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,260
A bunch of personal development mimicking.

29
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,260
For basically status seeking.

30
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,260
And what's underneath that the status seeking impulse which is usually.

31
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:20,260
Fundamental insecurities is actually not healing itself which with the real personal development would be it's actually doubling down on itself and building up a presentation package and whether it's I'm rich or I'm buff.

32
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,260
Or I'm enlightened just depends on the subculture you're appealing to.

33
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,260
That is a very hard red pill to swallow.

34
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,260
And I couldn't agree more the.

35
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:40,260
There's a quote from Ben Bergeron who says that character will always beat strategy is a CrossFit coach.

36
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:47,260
And I think what he's talking about there is the virtue of doing the thing because it's the thing that you want to do.

37
00:05:48,260 --> 00:06:00,260
From your inner most being as opposed to doing the thing because that's what you think you should do based on what you've been told so that you can then signal that you are a person who has these virtues it's.

38
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Cart horse or horse cart.

39
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,260
When you mention.

40
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,260
Virtue signaling.

41
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:19,260
Which will obviously show up very differently in different cultures right that I'm a good Republican versus I'm a good Democrat is going to have totally it'll be repulsive to the people of the different tribe.

42
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,260
Or religions or different types of aesthetics.

43
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,260
From an evolutionary biology perspective it's mostly just made signaling.

44
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,260
And so whether it's a hundred and fifty foot super yacht or it's.

45
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:47,260
You know having read all the books in a particular space and presenting yourself in a way that we say OK well where is that imperative to want people to respond to me in a particular way.

46
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:52,260
Well it has something to do with power dynamics in a tribe and largely basically.

47
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,260
Mate signaling is the evolutionary origin of it.

48
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
It's valuable to just admit that.

49
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,260
And just kind of reflect on it to say.

50
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,260
The more I can reflect on the biological predispositions that arise the less I'm controlled by them.

51
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,260
And I don't want to be ashamed of a repress them or just automatically go with them.

52
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:19,260
Right because they gave rise to the capacity for abstraction and the abstraction can give rise to higher order interests.

53
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,260
In the base interests.

54
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,260
So this is actually a very valuable thing in personal development.

55
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,260
Is.

56
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,260
Just taking the time to very deeply earnestly inquire into your motive.

57
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,260
And OK I'm wanting to develop in this way why.

58
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,260
Is because mostly the wise are actually lies right.

59
00:07:45,260 --> 00:08:00,260
I believe that when I'm buff then I will dot dot dot and it's and it's not going to be true right so the thing happens and then it's just some other set of goals and.

60
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,260
And so.

61
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,260
Typically whenever someone is going about doing some.

62
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,260
Project to help the world or develop themselves or whatever.

63
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,260
They usually have mixed motives.

64
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,260
They have like a dozen different motives driving them.

65
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,260
And they're usually only aware of half of them.

66
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,260
And they'll usually only admit like one or two of them.

67
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,260
And.

68
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:35,260
And but this will affect your results and your trustworthiness because those motives will pull in different ways.

69
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,260
And so let's say.

70
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:45,260
I'm trying to develop myself as someone who's more capable of making a difference in the world and so I'm doing some alleviating poverty project.

71
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:52,260
And the mission statement of why we're doing this is because these kids don't have shoes and they don't have food and we need to bring it to them and we care.

72
00:08:53,260 --> 00:09:06,260
That might actually be true like I might actually care as one of the 12 or so motives that has me doing that I might also need to make some money in this nonprofit is a way that I can make some money I also might want to.

73
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:19,260
Feel successful in a different way and this hits a certain idea of what will make me feel successful.

74
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,260
And then there might be a bunch of stuff that's unconscious like.

75
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:34,260
Insecurity from childhood in school and still wanting to hear that I did a good job that my parents didn't give me or that they did project it on to the rest of the world.

76
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:47,260
The degree to which you can just really watch that right just watch the things that are rising in the mind and they'll show up when you notice where who you're comparing yourself with and where you feel jealousies.

77
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:53,260
Which is something that you think that you're wanting that someone else is getting socially or whatever.

78
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,260
And just in reflecting then you can ask yourself the question.

79
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:09,260
So which of these seem like they're coming from wholeness like from from the deepest wholeness.

80
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:17,260
The deepest wholeness version of myself I could imagine and which of them feel like they're more coming from insecurity or woundedness.

81
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,260
And if I imagine myself growing in my wholeness which of these would deepen and which would lessen.

82
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:30,260
And then of the ones that would lessen you can just ask if this wasn't there at all how would my life be different.

83
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,260
Like the desire that people like me or whatever it is just wasn't there at all.

84
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,260
And that doesn't mean to pathologize it just you just get it inquire in that and notice how does it move you.

85
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,260
And maybe some ways that it moves you are fine but it's good to at least be clear on it.

86
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:55,260
Are those some of the signals that people can use to identify that because the pernicious thing about our subconscious is that we're not conscious of it.

87
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:02,260
Not without doing a tremendous amount of introspective work time in solitude and all that sort of stuff.

88
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:12,260
So are there any signals that people can say that's that's that thing manifesting again.

89
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:25,260
Yeah I mean I think a lot of people if they just make time kind of already know what some of the signals are.

90
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:34,260
Say there's a project you want to do and you want to do it because it actually feels intrinsically meaningful.

91
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,260
Right there's a real intrinsic motive.

92
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:48,260
And you think about someone else getting credit for it you're not getting credit for it versus you getting credit for it you just or you even notice in the process of a conversation.

93
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,260
Where there is a credit seeking impulse arising you.

94
00:11:53,260 --> 00:12:00,260
And you say oh that impulse and the impulse to actually serve are not the same impulse those are two different impulses that are both arising.

95
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:07,260
And then maybe they can be made to be two sled dogs pulling in the same direction but they might be sled dogs pulling in opposite directions.

96
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:14,260
Because sometimes the way I can serve the project best is to let someone else take credit so they work harder to make the thing happen.

97
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:27,260
And this is why you know if you read the doubt a chain as a book of leadership almost it just says that thing again and again the best leaders the one that nobody even knows is leading who doesn't want to lead.

98
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,260
Who other people push to lead because they trust them and really just empowers everyone else.

99
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:51,260
I get it so thinking about what this means for people on a broader scale what it means for an individual to understand their motivations toward leading a good life.

100
00:12:52,260 --> 00:13:00,260
I think one of the key insights that I've had from spending time exposed to this sort of content is that I.

101
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:08,260
Didn't for a long time and still mostly don't know what I want to want truthfully.

102
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,260
It's a very hard question to answer.

103
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:22,260
Yeah there's a in processes in the process of development of becoming more self-reflexively aware.

104
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:29,260
So at first you're living in a particular way and you aren't even really reflecting on if that's the right way to be living right.

105
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,260
And then you start reflecting on you realize oh I'm actually behaving ways that go against the things that I want.

106
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,260
And so I'm getting angry or I'm getting jealous or I'm whatever it is that isn't who I really want to be.

107
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,260
And this is kind of like tier one mimetics and personal development.

108
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,260
Let me see if I can work on changing that.

109
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:57,260
And some people will start to realize well that pattern of being angry or being habituated or whatever being lazy was conditioned in me.

110
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:04,260
Because had I grown up with the Sioux Indians or with the Machiganga tribe or whatever I would be different right.

111
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,260
Like there's no question that there would be a lot about me that's different.

112
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:15,260
So I don't want to just be the kind of default byproduct of how I happen to grow up that I didn't even really have a say in where I chose.

113
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,260
So can I recondition and it's like yeah I can recondition it.

114
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:26,260
Then there's some more reflection it says so I can recondition my behaviors to be more aligned with what I want and what I value.

115
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,260
They're like fuck what I want what I value was conditioned also.

116
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:39,260
Because do I want to be a good Christian or I want to be a good Muslim or I want to be a good Hindu or a good scientist.

117
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:44,260
Do I want to be a Wall Street banker or a good family man.

118
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:55,260
Do I that was probably also conditioned right all the way down to your your metaphysical framework for what reality is and what the good life is in there.

119
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Now you've entered the heart of existentialism because you're asking what is worth wanting.

120
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,260
And then you have to say well what is the basis to answer that that wasn't just conditioned.

121
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,260
Is there some deeper than my conditioning basis can I pierce through the conditioning.

122
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:21,260
And so what I'm trying to ask is is there anything intrinsically meaningful about the nature of reality that I can come to understand.

123
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:28,260
That is beyond where I happen to have been conditioned where regardless of where I would have been conditioned this is something I could come to.

124
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:37,260
And it turns out that there are meaningful ways to address that.

125
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:43,260
Tell us that's what we're here for Daniel we are here to to find out about that.

126
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:54,260
There's different ways of approaching this that have validity so I'm not going to say what the truth of a meaningful life is but I'll say some.

127
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:03,260
Ways that I have found and that others I have seen have found that are meaningful and also acknowledge you can walk.

128
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,260
One or multiple of these paths.

129
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,260
I forget the author there's a famous quote the heart knows reasons that reason knows nothing of.

130
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:27,260
And there is a kind of poetic artistic answer to the question which is it just is.

131
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:43,260
Right there's a deep there's a sense of this is meaningful because it'll serve this and then that because this and then at a certain level there's a sense of just prima facia it just is and like life.

132
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,260
Life is fundamentally meaningful and worth serving why.

133
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:58,260
Just it's right there's no deeper explanation that adds more clarification than that it is based on your own direct experience of.

134
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:11,260
Your experience of a liveness feeling intrinsically meaningful and then you're sensing the depth of other people's experience of life and seeing that that's meaningful in your desire to serve life in that way and it just.

135
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:19,260
And so the answer there is not really a deep philosophical inquiry it's more about a felt experience.

136
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,260
That's great.

137
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:38,260
And you know the first verse of the Tao Te Ching is that the knowledge that is knowable is not the eternal knowledge and the Dow that is speakable is not the eternal Dow.

138
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:48,260
Which means the to translate the meaning or the purpose of everything that you can describe in words isn't really it.

139
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,260
Because it's fundamentally trans semantic.

140
00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:04,260
Semantic is a symbol that has a very finite meaning that is supposed to represent a certain ground right like the word Apple references Apple you know.

141
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:11,260
But when I'm talking about meaningfulness of reality there is no word that can actually hold the ground of everything.

142
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:18,260
And so there can be though a certain kind of felt sense of connectedness with it.

143
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:33,260
Now we can also think about it more and come up with better answers and it's actually nice when we do both of these and there's a confluence of the deepening of our own felt connection and the deepening of the clarity of how we understand it.

144
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:50,260
So some people go to landmark and it starts with well I don't want to say what landmark says.

145
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:59,260
There are some systems that would will say reality is fundamentally meaningless.

146
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,260
And that's empowering and beautiful because you get to create the meaning.

147
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:15,260
There isn't some a priori God that said this is how you win the race at the end and either get it right or you get it wrong by some you know predefined definition that can feel empowering.

148
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:31,260
There's actually some kind of metaphysics smuggled in there which is to say you get to create the meaning is still actually holding some concept of meaningfulness and the value on your own creativity.

149
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:41,260
Right so there it's not actually doing the deeper inquiry to say well why do I value choice why do I value creativity and what is the basis for meaningfulness my own assessment.

150
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,260
So again those are just in prima facie held as meaningful.

151
00:19:49,260 --> 00:20:12,260
So science is a process of trying to come to understand the objective world in a way that goes beyond my own subjective sense of what it is which means beyond my conditioning and my bias right.

152
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,260
And so I might think that sound travels faster than light at room temperature and air.

153
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:36,260
So I set up an experiment and measure it and I find out that it just doesn't and then I can do that 100 times or a million times and other people can do it we can use different apparatus and there is a the measurability and the repeatability gives us a certain sense of the objectivity of it right.

154
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:46,260
Well so science has done a very good job of giving us a framework for is what is that is not based on what I think is.

155
00:20:48,260 --> 00:21:05,260
It doesn't it hasn't given us the same basis for what ought to be and there is this classic division between science and ethics or science and existentialism and called the is ought distinction science can say what is it can't say what ought because it's not.

156
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:25,260
The process of science is a process of observing and measuring observable things which are inherently third person objects and then being able to find patterns of regularities expressed that I can express in something like math.

157
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:32,260
And so it pertains to the domain of the things that are measurable and repeatable.

158
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,260
Our experience isn't measurable.

159
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,260
It's feelable it's first person not third person they're fundamentally different categories right.

160
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:50,260
You say well no your measure your experience is measurable because we can measure brain waves it's not measuring the experience that's measuring a brain state that happens to correlate with your felt experience.

161
00:21:51,260 --> 00:22:02,260
But someone who studies the neuroscience of EEG is who's looking at the brain pattern of a Zen meditator can look at that and has no idea what the experience is like.

162
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:16,260
And so the fact that there might be some neural correlates to experience doesn't mean you're measuring the experience it means there's some neural correlate right but that's still the domain of third person which is fundamentally never first person.

163
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,260
So first person is outside of the domain of science formally.

164
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,260
This is important because it says science is not a method of knowing all of reality.

165
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:35,260
It's a method of knowing parts of reality and there's parts of reality that are rigorously outside of the methods of science.

166
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,260
But we want something like we had with science which was a better process of knowing.

167
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:54,260
And so are there better processes of knowing about the nature of first person and the nature of the relationship between first person and third person because a meaningful life is going to involve the nature of the world.

168
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:00,260
It's also going to involve the nature of my experience and it's going to involve the relationship between me and the world.

169
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:09,260
Right well that's at least three different ontological categories third person first person and the relationship between the two which is neither third person nor first person.

170
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:17,260
So that requires a more robust philosophy that includes but transcends the philosophy of science.

171
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:29,260
So let's say we just look at a kind of scientific story we can frame this lots of different ways is it a lot of people have.

172
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:42,260
Made a universe story based on a limited part of science and then kind of made a metaphysical story related to it like they'll take the second law of thermodynamics increasing entropy and say OK.

173
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:52,260
So there's a lot of energy at the Big Bang and basically the universe is running down and will eventually turn into just a cold vacuum and die in a big freeze kind of heat death.

174
00:23:53,260 --> 00:24:00,260
And so the metaphysics of universe is just this very slow inexorable march towards nothingness.

175
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:09,260
Now if all there was of science was the second law you might do that but that's obviously pretty silly.

176
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,260
And there's a lot of things that aren't explained by that at all.

177
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:27,260
And people will take evolutionary biology and talk about make a metaphysical answer that's all about becoming apex predators and dog eat dog kind of stuff and whatever right.

178
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:33,260
That's actually an important one to address because it's still very pernicious worldview.

179
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:41,260
Nature is kind of just cruel and optimizing it.

180
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:57,260
Anyone who spent time in nature and watched predation knows that it's pretty fucking cruel and the things that are the fittest and the fittest can involve effective cruelty survive.

181
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:18,260
And so humans following suit of that being capable of understanding Darwinian kind of process should seek to be as fit as they can be and that that's just being part of the natural order of things.

182
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:33,260
And that's not you know of every species the weak ones dying and getting cold is actually what strengthens the genetics and drives evolution forward so that cruelty the predator usually taking the weak prey out more is actually what's making the prey better.

183
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:53,260
Because they're getting the weak genes out and so then the stronger genes come slightly faster lion that eats the slow gazelle makes getting out gazelle slower over long periods of time so ultimately predatory dynamics violence winning competition is what drives all good things in progress and like that.

184
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:13,260
That's a very classic very narrow idea that takes one very tiny part of science and tries to blow it up to be the meta frame and then interpret it in a way that people wanted to interpret anyways to basically justify shit that was that they wanted to do.

185
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:36,260
I won't say the name, but a couple of people that are amongst the most powerful people in the world in terms of high finance have basically quoted almost all of this to me verbatim in conversations as how they see the world.

186
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:48,260
And, and they said, you know, either like basically apex predators to find the topology of the space.

187
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:55,260
And so either you're the apex predator or somebody else's but the apex predators are going to be the one who runs shit.

188
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,260
And if you don't like that you just won't be one of the ones who run shit.

189
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:12,260
One of the guys said pretty directly said, if you all animals are either predators or prey and predators don't feel bad when they kill prey.

190
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:19,260
And if you feel bad when the prey humans die, then you just said what kind of animal you are and that animal doesn't run the world.

191
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:30,260
And the of the predators who don't make it to alpha apex, they also aren't the ones whose genes really go and run the world.

192
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,260
And if you don't like the way the alpha apex are, it won't make any difference because they'll still be the ones who run the world.

193
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,260
You just won't be part of it.

194
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:46,260
And, you know, this the same conversation went to other places about why the Holocaust was a good thing for Jews.

195
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:56,260
And because they got the state of Israel and nukes and antisemitism became a bad word and etc.

196
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,260
Like thinking about, you can see what that worldview does, right?

197
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,260
The worldview makes people to think like that.

198
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,260
Those conversations wouldn't go to much darker places too.

199
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:19,260
Can I ask, how did you feel hearing those sorts of concepts come from people who not only can imagine it from an armchair philosophy perspective,

200
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,260
but actually have the power to be able to wield it in the real world as well?

201
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,260
Was that distressing to hear, to sit down opposite somebody and hear that?

202
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:32,260
Yeah, super distressing at first.

203
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:38,260
It was something I didn't have, I didn't have a reference frame for from how I grew up.

204
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:48,260
And that also meant I didn't understand critical things about the world that are important if you actually want to be able to make a difference to things in the world.

205
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:58,260
And so one of the things that I started noticing was how much there are certain psychological dispositions that seek power more than others,

206
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:09,260
and that are also willing to use power in ways that give them more power, including by disempowering everybody else.

207
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:15,260
And that those people have ended up being the people with most power most of the time.

208
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,260
What are the most effective?

209
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:28,260
They're the ones that are prepared to go to the places where other people's sense of empathy or virtue or inner compass or whatever it might be would stop them before that.

210
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:36,260
Right, so effective at a specific thing and a specific thing that ends up winning in a natural selection of violence.

211
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:47,260
And so you might have a peaceful culture that is way more effective at producing happy people and producing kind people and living in harmony with the land,

212
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:53,260
but Genghis Khan or Alexander the Great or whatever will come slaughter them and take their space and take their stuff.

213
00:29:54,260 --> 00:30:01,260
And so then the means that go on are the means that were effective at winning in a natural selection of warfare.

214
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:10,260
It ends up being that if you that drives an arms race, right, because then somebody becomes better at war,

215
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,260
so somebody else has to get those same weapons plus the counter weapons plus better weapons.

216
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:20,260
And eventually you get an exponential curve where it turns into AI-empowered drones and bio weapons and et cetera.

217
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,260
And it's actually too big to use any of the weapons safely and you destroy the whole world.

218
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:33,260
And that's why I work on catastrophic risk is the pattern of how we have made it through the local issues is actually what's driving the global issues currently.

219
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:46,260
That kind of rival risk be the apex predator kind of thing at scale is actually destroying the capability for civilization to keep going on period.

220
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,260
And so this apex predator thing, we're not apex predators.

221
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,260
That's just gibberish.

222
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,260
This is a really important thing.

223
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,260
I'd like people to understand.

224
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,260
An orca is an apex predator, right?

225
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,260
Killer whale.

226
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,260
Top predator in their environment or polar bear or tiger, right?

227
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,260
There's lots of apex predators we could pick.

228
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,260
But an orca is like the biggest one you can think of.

229
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,260
So they're a good example.

230
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,260
An orca can catch one fish at a time, right?

231
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,260
It's going to go catch one tuna and it's going to miss most of the time or one seal.

232
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:43,260
It can't take a mile long drift net and pull up 100,000 tuna at once, which we can now with industrialized dredge net kind of fishing.

233
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,260
That's not the power of an apex predator, right?

234
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:53,260
A polar bear can kill one walrus at a time and it's fucking dangerous to do that and it's pretty hard to do.

235
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:59,260
It can't slash and burn an acre of forest a second, right?

236
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:07,260
Or be able to do mountaintop removal mining or factory farm whole species of animal and hybridized new species and extinct species.

237
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,260
So that's not the power of apex predators.

238
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
That's the power of gods.

239
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
We're just shitty gods.

240
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:25,260
If we say, do apex predators have the ability to extinct whole species quickly and destroy whole ecosystems and make new ecosystems and genetically engineer new species?

241
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,260
No, that's not something that Darwinian process has anything to do with, right?

242
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:43,260
And so you think about if a polar bear got really pissed and went on a tirade and tried to break all that it could, how much harm could it do compared to Trump or Putin with nukes, right?

243
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Like compared to 1F15.

244
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:55,260
So then you say, well, who has the ability to make new species and destroy species and make new environments and destroy them?

245
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,260
Well, we've thought of that methodically as the domain of the gods or nature itself.

246
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:06,260
Since we have that much power, we can destroy nature itself, right?

247
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:18,260
And to not do that, we have to be safe vessels for that much power, which means that if you have the power of gods, you have to have the love and the wisdom of gods to guide it and to hold it.

248
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:26,260
And we have developed in our power through technology much, much better than we have developed in our love and wisdom to wield that power well.

249
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:36,260
And we have wielded our power to just how do we use our power to beat the other guys and then they try to develop their power.

250
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:41,260
But that process multiplied by exponential tech destroys everything.

251
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:54,260
And so we are at the brink of a phase shift of either the end of civilization in the not too distant future as we know it, or the emergence into something that is actually worthy of calling civilization, right?

252
00:33:54,260 --> 00:34:08,260
That is actually civil that can be able to hold the power of AI and the Internet of Things and geoengineering and bioengineering and actually not fuck everything up with that much capability.

253
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:15,260
There's this very deep question and say, as the power is getting stronger, it's also getting more decentralized, right?

254
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:25,260
So with CRISPR gene drives, you can do the level of bioengineering with a tiny little lab that used to be a whole, you know, the cutting edge of U.S. military, not that many years ago.

255
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,260
And the same with drone weaponry and whatever.

256
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:43,260
So we have, you know, during the Cold War, we actually this important thing to understand, until World War II, we didn't have the technological power to destroy everything quickly.

257
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,260
As much as we would have wanted to try, we just couldn't.

258
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:54,260
For the hundreds of thousands of years of human history, the most we could want to destroy would still be not that much relative to the planet.

259
00:34:54,260 --> 00:35:04,260
And then with the bomb that changed, it's like, oh shit, we can actually make this place not habitable for everybody pretty quickly with just some pushes of buttons.

260
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,260
That was the beginning of a whole new world, right?

261
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:15,260
And how do we deal with having creative power that we can't use or we don't exist?

262
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:25,260
And so when we created that, the entire world system had to be recreated just to protect us from using the bomb.

263
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:36,260
The Bretton Woods Convention coming out of World War II was basically a whole new world system where we had to have a united nations because individual national governments clearly didn't prevent World War.

264
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:45,260
And we had to have a World Bank and we had to have a totally new international monetary policy and all of those kinds of structures emerged then.

265
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:56,260
And we had to have mutually assured destruction, which emerged a little bit later, to make sure that neither the US or the Soviets would ever use that power, right?

266
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:02,260
Now, mutually assured destruction was this kind of automated locked on process that if anybody started to fire up there,

267
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:09,260
Nuke silos at the other one, the other ones would automatically go so you couldn't initiate the war without killing yourself and that's what kept everybody from doing it.

268
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,260
Mutually assured destruction was what saved us.

269
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:21,260
The system had computer glitches that started to put us into launch sequence many times and we only barely made it in largely by luck.

270
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:33,260
But that's where we only had two superpowers that had that totally catastrophic capability and those two could fully spy on each other to know if the other one was going to do something.

271
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:42,260
And you only had one kind of catastrophe weapon, not lots of them, two superpowers, one kind of catastrophe weapon.

272
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,260
And so, mutually assured destruction worked.

273
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:55,260
And we also war when we start running out of resources and then we're competing for the same resources because everybody's greed wants to get more.

274
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:01,260
Their own national development interests or their personal development interests expressed as monetary abundance says,

275
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,260
if there's a fixed playing field of stuff, my more has to be your less.

276
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,260
Okay, fuck it, war, right?

277
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:19,260
So one of the other things that happened was creating this kind of monetary system coming out of World War II where we could just make up shit tons of new money and debt based finance

278
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:27,260
and be able to create this globalism and just create so much physical abundance of wealth that we didn't have to war, right?

279
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,260
Everybody could be getting richer simultaneously.

280
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,260
That was the idea.

281
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:40,260
It just happens to be that you're destroying the planet very rapidly doing that by basically taking all of nature and turning it into trash, right?

282
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:54,260
Which is taking ecosystems that took billions of years to develop and unrenewably destroying them on one side and then turning them into pollution on the other side after a very short period of use.

283
00:37:54,260 --> 00:38:01,260
And you just don't get to keep doing that for very long on a finite planet before you destroy the planet's ability to let you keep doing that.

284
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:09,260
And also that debt based finance thing starts to catch up with you because in order to pay back the debt, you got to take out more debt.

285
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:13,260
And, you know, so you get this embedded growth obligation, right?

286
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:20,260
You have to keep growing exponentially year over year just to break even because you get to keep up with the interest.

287
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:28,260
So we get to about where we are now and the Bretton Woods world has completely broken down.

288
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:43,260
Because we can't keep just debt based financing rapid growth to prevent conflict because we already have more of our total GDP going to servicing the debt than is sustainable.

289
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:51,260
And so we're at the end of the financial systems ability to do that and COVID just made that worse by lowering GDP and increasing debt a lot.

290
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,260
And it was already unsustainable.

291
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:00,260
We're near the planetary boundaries on like 100 different boundaries.

292
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:09,260
And so we can't keep doing the turn nature into trash but money briefly on the way to trash process.

293
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:14,260
And we have dozens of catastrophe weapons now, not just one.

294
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:21,260
And nukes, there's just not that many places that have uranium and it's very hard to enrich and it's not like small groups can really make nukes.

295
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,260
They're really hard to make.

296
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,260
But that's not true for weaponized drones.

297
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260
They're really easy to make.

298
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:35,260
And for a lot of other new types of exponential tech that relatively small forces, not even state actors can make.

299
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,260
Plus there's lots of state actors that have nukes now and chemical weapons and bio weapons and other things like that.

300
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:47,260
So now you're in a world where you've got not two actors but lots of actors, more than we can even identify.

301
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:58,260
Ones that we don't even know who can have catastrophe weapons and not one type of catastrophe weapon but lots of them where you don't have clear counters for them.

302
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:07,260
And you're near the planetary boundaries environmentally and you're at the end of the economic systems capability to keep doing the thing it's done.

303
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,260
That's a transition point.

304
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:29,260
And I don't remember exactly how we got here but it's important in understanding this to say that the, oh, I was talking about the Apex Predator model.

305
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:45,260
So that even before we had nukes, an Apex Predator couldn't, doesn't make something like a city, right, which is a completely altered environment.

306
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,260
And we've been doing that for thousands of years.

307
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:55,260
But, and we've been using that increased power destructively and driving this arms race of increasing destructive capacity.

308
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:00,260
But at a certain point it became globally catastrophic destruction.

309
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:08,260
And now it's many, many different methods of globally catastrophic destruction initiatable by many, many actors.

310
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:18,260
And so this is now where we're like, oh, this is what the power of God's without the love or wisdom to guide it looks like.

311
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:26,260
And so you could ask this question as exponential tech continues and we get more power that becomes more decentralized.

312
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:32,260
Oh, yeah, it said all that, say nukes are pretty centralized, but the new tech is decentralized, but catastrophic.

313
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:44,260
How do we make a civilization that is antifragile with decentralized exponential technology?

314
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:54,260
Which means if I've got lots of non-state actors that can make catastrophe weapons and I don't even know who they are,

315
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:01,260
how do we make a world that doesn't break given the way that humans have historically used power?

316
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,260
How do we make a world where anybody can have the power to break everything?

317
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,260
That's an interesting question.

318
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,260
It's a very interesting question.

319
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:21,260
It doesn't surprise me that we are in a situation where we face challenges when we consider the intro to this discussion,

320
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:33,260
which was our evolutionary predispositions, our socialized values that we consider to be worth pursuing,

321
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:38,260
which are essentially repurposed versions of a genetic heritage and all this sort of stuff.

322
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:45,260
It doesn't surprise me with the most shaky foundation ever,

323
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:55,260
that when you start to add an awful lot of weight in the form of power, destructive power, technological power,

324
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:59,260
when you start to add that on top that the system becomes incredibly unstable,

325
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:04,260
I wonder whether because I consider myself to be a good person, I'm not perfect,

326
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,260
but I don't plan on blowing up the world, right?

327
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,260
I don't want to go out and hurt people, I don't want to go out and kill people.

328
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:16,260
For me, I think the idealist inside of me relating to self-development thinks,

329
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:23,260
well, if everybody becomes more self-aware, is able to iterate their introspection

330
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:28,260
and slowly become better over time, go to bed less stupid than when they woke up,

331
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:34,260
naturally out of that system, you wouldn't have any of the pathologies emerge,

332
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,260
you wouldn't have any of the challenges emerge because every individual agent within the system

333
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:44,260
would understand genuinely what is best for them, genuinely how to deploy that

334
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:50,260
and also would be using any spare capacity that they have to then help others to understand that

335
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:54,260
and then further progress their movement forward.

336
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:58,260
Aubrey Marcus on the show said, you do not serve others from your cup,

337
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,260
you serve others from the saucer that overflows around your cup

338
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,260
and what that means is you've got to sort your shit first

339
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,260
and then what you have as a surplus you use to help others sort their shit,

340
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:14,260
that's how I saw that and I wonder whether that's naivety, ignorance,

341
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:19,260
probably definitely a lot of ignorance, I've never been exposed to someone

342
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,260
who has been able to wield the sort of power of the people that you mentioned

343
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,260
and also have that mindset.

344
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:33,260
So probably some ignorance there that I just haven't seen this first hand

345
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:38,260
and it just sounds like a Hollywood movie to hear that happen, right?

346
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,260
It just sounds totally detached from me.

347
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,260
Yeah, Daniel met a guy but they don't really exist, do they?

348
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,260
You're like, no, these are actual people.

349
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,260
And yeah, I wonder how much of it is...

350
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:57,260
I wonder how much introspective work, self-development,

351
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,260
working out what do you want to want, what should I want to want,

352
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:05,260
what is genuinely good for me and then how can I make what is good for me be good for others.

353
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:11,260
I wonder how much of that can be the answer to some of these challenges that we face

354
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:16,260
and where the upper bound to what that can achieve is.

355
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:24,260
The body isn't just 70 or 90 trillion healthy cells all doing their own thing.

356
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,260
That would just be a pile of goo, right?

357
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,260
That would just be bioprotoplasm.

358
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,260
The body is actually a coordination between those.

359
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,260
It involves not just how they function individually in a Petri dish,

360
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,260
but how they relate with each other to be able to make tissues and organs and organ systems

361
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,260
and that whole thing, right?

362
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:50,260
And so a cell needs to do what it needs to do to be a healthy cell,

363
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:55,260
but it also needs to communicate with all the ones around it to mediate what the tissue needs to do.

364
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:00,260
Because it can't just be doing its own thing when the muscle needs to flex.

365
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:04,260
That particular muscle cell has to be engaged in the process, right?

366
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,260
And let's say that it's being a good healthy cell, but there's a cancer cell nearby.

367
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:15,260
If some cells don't actually take that cancer cell out, it'll replicate and kill the whole body.

368
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,260
And so there is a need to be a healthy cell.

369
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,260
There's also a need to coordinate with those around you for the things that need to happen.

370
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:28,260
There's also a need to have an immune function when there are things happening that damage the health of the whole system.

371
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:35,260
And so if we're talking about how do we want to develop people, we want to develop people in all three of those ways.

372
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:43,260
They want to have as much capacity to do the things that they should do individually.

373
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:51,260
They want to have the capacity to synergize, to have synergy with the people that are around them and that they can access.

374
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:55,260
Now, increasingly access, I guess, with the tools that we have.

375
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:00,260
The immune function, I can't explain. How does that manifest?

376
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,260
Is that law? Is that just police?

377
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,260
If you see harm happening, do you stop it?

378
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:16,260
Do you do something to correct the harm and correct the sources of harm? Who does, right?

379
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,260
How does that differ from synergy?

380
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:25,260
Is it because the actor is malignant as opposed to compliant or cooperative?

381
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,260
Well, they're within a spectrum, right?

382
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:38,260
It's actually very interesting in terms of cancer, because cancer isn't some external pathogen.

383
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:44,260
It's a cell that mutated in a way that stops doing synergy with the other cells around it, right?

384
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:49,260
Because its genetic code is altered where it doesn't actually identify with the rest of the whole in the same way.

385
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:56,260
So it doesn't want to sacrifice its own maximum consumption of sugar and reproduction rate to synergize with everything.

386
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:04,260
It's like, fuck it, I'm just going to consume and replicate as fast as I can, which is really good for it for a short while,

387
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,260
but it ends up killing itself and it kills the host, which is what humans are doing with regard to the planet

388
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:15,260
and also our relationships with each other, where you do that with someone else and it engenders enmity and war back and things like that, right?

389
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:25,260
There's oxidative stress and free radicals that are making cancer all the time. It's also getting addressed.

390
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:32,260
So the first stage of dealing with cancer in a healthy body is just not having that much carcinogenesis to begin with, right?

391
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:39,260
That the body is actually doing a good job of dealing with carcinogenic factors, radicals and oxidants and like that,

392
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,260
so cells aren't turning cancerous that often.

393
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:49,260
If there's too much carcinogenesis, and this is why we don't want to expose to carcinogenic compounds, right?

394
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:55,260
If there's too much carcinogenesis, it'll overload the body's ability to deal with cancerous cells and then you'll start to get a proliferation.

395
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:00,260
So this is the preventative side. How do we have people not become cancer cells in the first place?

396
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:08,260
How do we not deal with it on the prison or judicial side later, but on the how do we develop humans that are psychologically healthy

397
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:14,260
and if psychologically healthy also means are part of a whole, so they behave in a way that works well for them and the whole, right?

398
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:22,260
Then the next step is if a cell starts to get damaged, some oxidative damage happens to it.

399
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:28,260
The rest of the body tries to heal it first. Can we actually bring antioxidants and correct that process?

400
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:32,260
If that can't happen, then the body has to kill it.

401
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:36,260
If that doesn't happen, then it'll replicate and usually kill the body.

402
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:46,260
So when we start to think about the staging of the immune function and what that represents as a basis for thinking about judicial type process,

403
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:53,260
the basis of it should be identify what makes people orient towards harming the commons,

404
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,260
towards violence, towards sociopathy, towards greed,

405
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:04,260
and also identify what conditions the best qualities in humans and try to support all humans to have better development, right?

406
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,260
Then there is a protective function.

407
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:17,260
If people are harming other people, how do we prevent the harm from happening and how do we try to actually rehabilitate, which is the corrective force?

408
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:24,260
And it's only if rehabilitation can happen that some ongoing protection from that being able to continue to cause harm has to occur.

409
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:42,260
But when you look, okay, so you don't go kill people in Nigeria to advance your oil interests the way a Nigerian oil lord does.

410
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:49,260
But you buy gas for your car or whatever the equivalent is, right?

411
00:50:49,260 --> 00:51:00,260
Which is ultimately paying the supply chain to do the thing it does, which means paying the Nigerian warlord to do wetworks at some part of the supply chain.

412
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:08,260
You might never do the kind of gruesome torture that happens inside of a factory farm,

413
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:13,260
but you might go to a restaurant and buy something that came from a factory farm, which is paying someone to do those wetworks.

414
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:24,260
And so there starts to be this deepened responsibility question of, oh, I'm affecting the world at scale in a way I'm not seeing through the supply chains I'm interacting with.

415
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:33,260
And so now there's harm that's being caused that I'm not standing up to, and I'm also complicit with.

416
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:40,260
And it's not the job of the police to stop that because it's granted by law that that can happen, but it's not right law.

417
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,260
Right law wouldn't allow a factory farm, you know, or those other things to occur.

418
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:53,260
So then we have to say, so what is mine to do to actually see the injustices and harms and problems in the world?

419
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,260
What is mine to actually step up and resolve?

420
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,260
That's also an important part of the question.

421
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:03,260
Very symbolic. I like the analogy to the cancer cells.

422
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:08,260
I'm going back two years ago to an episode I did with Corey Allen, a meditation teacher.

423
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:20,260
And he had this analogy where he thinks when someone gets angry with him, as a conversant, you know, someone cuts him off in traffic or something happens or cuts in line at the checkout.

424
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:24,260
And then you can see that itching for to vent.

425
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:30,260
And he treats that anger like a pathogen like a flu virus.

426
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:36,260
And what he thinks in his mind is I wonder where that came from.

427
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:45,260
Like I wonder what the heritage of that anger is, like who passed it on to you, then who passed it on to them, then who passed it on to them, then where did that emerge from?

428
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,260
And that's the interconnectedness, right?

429
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,260
Yeah.

430
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:56,260
It's the interconnectedness. It's a basis for compassion and understanding.

431
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:00,260
And it's also an immune function to keep yourself from getting infected.

432
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:08,260
Because if you get pissed off back at them and you understand it as a pathogen, you'll realize that you actually just lost your sovereignty and just got infected.

433
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:14,260
And if you see that as, you know, I don't want to get infected, then you're like, oh, that means I'm going to relate to this differently.

434
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,260
You can also be a be a little bit of a bookend as well, right?

435
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:30,260
If that is part of a cathartic venting procedure that allows that person to drop their anger down by X percent, but you don't then pass, you don't hold that rock and then pass it on.

436
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:38,260
Then through being conscious through the mindfulness gap of being aware of the trigger that's happened, you can let that go.

437
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:43,260
You can reduce the entropy in the system, I guess you could say it as.

438
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,260
Is that a way to put it?

439
00:53:46,260 --> 00:54:06,260
Yeah. There's a fine point of nuance here, which is not going into reaction about someone else's poor behavior also doesn't mean condoning it and doesn't mean not having boundaries.

440
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:13,260
It's actually very important to be able to say, I know that that person does that abusive behavior because they were hurt when they were a kid.

441
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,260
I know that wasn't their fault. I actually feel a ton of compassion for that kid.

442
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:19,260
I know they had a head injury in war, right?

443
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:24,260
And that's really fucked them up and they still can't do that to me.

444
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,260
And so I love them.

445
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,260
I forgive them and I won't let them do that anymore.

446
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:32,260
It's a difficult line to balance.

447
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:38,260
I had a neuroscientist on talking about the neuroscience underpinning the seven deadly sins.

448
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:43,260
Very interesting, very cool rework of that guy called Jack Lewis, British guy.

449
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:51,260
And everything, all of them were in moderation, but not too much.

450
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,260
In moderation, but not too much.

451
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:57,260
Seneca's virtuous mean in moderation, but not too much.

452
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,260
And it is so hard. We are absolutist creatures.

453
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:08,260
If you put a packet of biscuits in front of me and say I can eat none or I can eat all of them, both of those situations are fine by me.

454
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:16,260
If you say that I can only have one or like half a biscuit torture.

455
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:26,260
Yeah. And so this process of the balance of right boundaries and right compassion.

456
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:30,260
There is no algorithm for it to get it right.

457
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:36,260
There isn't like a general rule of thumb that is always the right answer.

458
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:48,260
It's something you actually have to think about and feel into each situation, the instantiation of that situation, and you wrestle with it.

459
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:56,260
There are plenty of times where someone does the tough love thing to a friend or a family member that has addiction going on and that's what it took for the person to finally turn around.

460
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:01,260
Plenty of other times where someone does the tough love thing and the person just goes and kills themselves.

461
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:08,260
And that same person had they got to supported another therapy or rehab clinic or whatever could have turned around.

462
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:16,260
And so what the right answer is is not like if you have a very fast default, it's probably wrong.

463
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:27,260
It's something that you have to really take the time to reflect into what is actually called for here and then reflect into what are my biases and my biasing in a I don't want to take their burden on or biasing in a code dependent.

464
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:31,260
I must take it on direction. That's going to make me less clear.

465
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:47,260
It makes me think about the is an art distinction that you brought up and also about what self development is at its very core, which is trying to model an effective way to operate within the world.

466
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:54,260
It's trying to make as scientific as possible the way that you behave the way that I behave.

467
00:56:54,260 --> 00:57:00,260
Sometimes the way that we behave there's books about relationships and friendship and stuff like that.

468
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:06,260
But mostly it tends to be personal sovereignty up with mobility agency stuff like that.

469
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:13,260
But as you've just identified there in that situation, like there is no one size fits all.

470
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:23,260
There is no objective way to decide what the life that you should lead is what your definition of a good life is it's.

471
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:33,260
Got a shaky foundation evolutionarily it's got a very biased foundation culturally and socially you know.

472
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:39,260
That is what we're trying to achieve what is the best way for me to operate within this world but there is no.

473
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:43,260
There is no universal answer to that there's better and there's worse.

474
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:51,260
But better by who worse by who you know you can you can run this back as far as you want.

475
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,260
Yeah.

476
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:58,260
So I would say that.

477
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:04,260
Wisdom is not algorithmic and cannot be made algorithmic.

478
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:10,260
You can't have a if this than that algorithm that actually equals wisdom.

479
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,260
And.

480
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,260
And if you can.

481
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:25,260
Then we're just a intermediate bootloader for the AIs that are better creatures than us right.

482
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:37,260
I could actually go through some long derivations as to why I think consciousness is not computational not purely computational but there's something happening in consciousness that is fundamentally trans computational.

483
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:52,260
So strong computationalism is the idea that computation is both necessary and sufficient for consciousness mind and universe and I believe that's false.

484
00:58:52,260 --> 00:59:09,260
So there is something to the nature of choice and thus also good choice ethics that can be informed by lots of different principles and considerations but not perfectly prescribed.

485
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,260
And this is why.

486
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:26,260
At lower stages of development when people can't hold as much complexity and as much nuance with as much awareness sometimes they need just simple rules to not go off the rails.

487
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:30,260
So you think of the 10 commandments as rules like that right.

488
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:41,260
If you need to know don't kill anybody and don't rape anybody and don't the doldrum whatever like okay we'll tell you those things don't do that like the society will be better if people don't do those things.

489
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:48,260
But then you notice New Testament comes along and Jesus gives a different kind of teaching right.

490
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:57,260
Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you love thy neighbor as thyself it actually doesn't tell you what to do.

491
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:03,260
It isn't to do something or don't do something it's actually consider something a certain way.

492
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:11,260
So try to put yourself into the shoes of whoever you're about to act and ask how you would feel engage in empathy.

493
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:23,260
So it's an ethic that guides the guidance is consider something but not do this or don't do that so it's ultimately not prescriptive but there's still wisdom that can be offered.

494
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:33,260
So there's a lot of kind of general principles that we can offer that support wisdom but it's not reducible to prescription.

495
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:44,260
Now this is also something about personal development if one is wanting to grow in wisdom is it doesn't look like do this thing.

496
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:55,260
And so you also can't signal it very effectively by doing a particular thing.

497
01:00:55,260 --> 01:01:06,260
I mean someone could even try to signal aligned with what I just said right they could say let me consider that as just some kind of signaling.

498
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:21,260
What I'm talking about like is a depth of earnestness of what do I actually care about and why do I care about it and how do I reflect on what I believe to be both true and meaningful right now.

499
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:35,260
And what is right action factoring what I understand to be true and what I understand to be meaningful and how certain am I on what I think is true and how bias am I and what I think is meaningful and can I refine those as well.

500
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:42,260
It surprises me that we're even able to get out of bed in the morning.

501
01:01:42,260 --> 01:02:01,260
Like should I why I mean is this maybe I don't know I mean do I take the covers off with my left hand do I take the covers off with my right hand but this is the job of the ego right and this is part of I suppose the usefulness of the fact that we are still in some part primitive creatures.

502
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:11,260
That it allows us to have sufficient momentum to overcome the inertia that a constant rolling existential crisis would stop us from from being able to do.

503
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,260
The rolling existential crisis.

504
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,260
Which I grew up with.

505
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,260
Mostly comes.

506
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:27,260
Joseph Campbell had some nice quote something about that.

507
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:39,260
I'm getting the quote wrong but paraphrasing that people wonder about the purpose of life when they aren't engaged in the experience of feeling alive.

508
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,260
I love that.

509
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:46,260
And that and this is that prima facie thing that we were talking about.

510
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,260
In.

511
01:02:50,260 --> 01:03:07,260
Moments of full engagement with reality right whether it's fascination learning something or odd the beauty of something or whatever it is is typically not when people are in existential angst wondering what's meaningful or not because it is it is it's present it is it is.

512
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,260
Indwelling within the experience right the meaningfulness is eminent.

513
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:19,260
Now if I'm disconnected from feeling the meaningfulness of life no thought will replace that feeling.

514
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,260
And so then.

515
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:39,260
You know separate I can say well what's what's the purpose of life well it's to learn what's the fucking purpose of learning well because you grow what's the purpose of that well then you can do more what's the purpose and there's no end to that right there's no terminal value that you get to where you don't say why.

516
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,260
Why that.

517
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:51,260
And that's because what we're trying it's it's actually just a ridiculous question it's saying what part of reality.

518
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:53,260
Is why all of it.

519
01:03:56,260 --> 01:04:07,260
Right that's the question if I'm trying to say the purpose of reality is its love or its growth or its awakening or whatever it is I'm trying to I'm trying to take some little simple part I can conceptualize.

520
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:12,260
And make that the ordinating basis of everything.

521
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,260
Which is just actually silly.

522
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:17,260
Right.

523
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:28,260
You notice that purpose is a utilitarian concept the purpose of X is why.

524
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:40,260
The purpose of my job is I do this function at the business well if I if okay I do the marketing at the business or the accounting or the whatever it is well if I assume the business existing matters.

525
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:48,260
I then it makes sense why me doing that thing matters but it's utilitarian right assuming the value of why then I can say X relative to it.

526
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:53,260
But purpose is always extrinsic relational utilitarian.

527
01:04:54,260 --> 01:05:00,260
So if I say what is the purpose of all of reality what is their outside of reality to ground that in reference to.

528
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:11,260
So it's just actually an ill formed question because purpose is a smaller concept than reality is.

529
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:27,260
So yes reality doesn't have a purpose in the sense that anything within reality does but it's also not purpose less in the way that we think of purposelessness of things inside of reality is that the concept is too small to apply.

530
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:39,260
Do you know where I have my existential crises it's when I'm in the supermarket at three a.m. every time every time I get in there if I've been at work and I finished finished at the club.

531
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:47,260
And there's this big state change from it being loud and full of havoc and then I'm on my way home and I realized that I don't have X for tomorrow.

532
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:59,260
And then that's when it strikes me when I'm in the supermarket you totally correct it doesn't happen when you're sat with the people that you care about it doesn't happen when you're on your morning walk and just considering what it feels like to have the sun on your skin.

533
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:07,260
You know those aren't the times so does that not mean that seeking those experiences.

534
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:11,260
Where we do feel connected and we do feel present.

535
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:17,260
Is that why is that not the north star for how we should spend our lives.

536
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:25,260
First I would love to suggest that you go to the grocery store at three a.m. a few times on purpose.

537
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:32,260
To have the most meaningful connection with the people who are there you possibly can.

538
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:38,260
Go with that intention to transcend the the crisis.

539
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:45,260
Well you have a Pavlovian conditioning now associated with that right you've had that experience there enough times that just going there triggers it.

540
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,260
And you can recondition that.

541
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:57,260
And you can recognize having choice and agency that in a place where you're questioning meaningfulness you can bring it.

542
01:06:58,260 --> 01:06:59,260
Yeah that's beautiful.

543
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:02,260
And it may simply be.

544
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:09,260
Acknowledgement to one of the people who are working there it may be a deeper conversation but.

545
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:18,260
I've had so many experiences having a conversation with the person driving Uber for me instead of being on my phone.

546
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:24,260
That ended up being profoundly enlightening and some of whom are friends years later.

547
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:28,260
So it's interesting what happens when you explore.

548
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:30,260
A hundred percent.

549
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:34,260
I mean this is before we get on to should we seek being present.

550
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,260
This is the.

551
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,260
Probably the most.

552
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,260
Meaningful.

553
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,260
The most meaningful.

554
01:07:49,260 --> 01:08:08,260
The most important one of the most important changes I've made over the last few years as someone who's an only child who spends a lot of time in solitude working who is comfortable with my own company overly comfortable with my own company.

555
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,260
Learning the.

556
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:18,260
Fulfillment and the pleasure that comes from connecting with other people.

557
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:25,260
For no reason other than they're there and that they are there and you can connect with them.

558
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:33,260
Has been such a huge change like a ridiculously big change for me and it sounds so stupid.

559
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:41,260
You know especially if you grew up with that five brothers and sisters and you all see each other every Christmas and do whatever maybe your world view and mine.

560
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:46,260
You can't really understand why I wouldn't think that that would be a good thing to do but I'm telling you that I did.

561
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:50,260
Telling you that it was very much a single focused.

562
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:58,260
Lack of just lack of even awareness of other people not even a consideration had I have been aware I probably would have considered.

563
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:04,260
But it was incredibly blinkers on and.

564
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:06,260
Yeah man like.

565
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,260
So this answers the question you were starting to ask.

566
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:12,260
Great about pursuing a state.

567
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,260
Okay.

568
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,260
That can be done narcissistically.

569
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:19,260
And it won't produce a meaningful life.

570
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:21,260
Why.

571
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:22,260
So.

572
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:28,260
So.

573
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:34,260
You run a thought experiment.

574
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:38,260
Everybody in the world dies and you're here by yourself.

575
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,260
But.

576
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:47,260
You can have like a fighter jet and Lamborghinis and like whatever mansion you want.

577
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,260
There's just nobody else here.

578
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:55,260
Most people when they take time to really run through that scenario.

579
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:01,260
Try to figure out how to entertain themselves with experiences for a while.

580
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:05,260
And then fundamentally can't find meaningfulness in it.

581
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:17,260
And to the extent they can it's because they have the idea of a God which is still a being they're relating with or they get really friendly with animals.

582
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:26,260
But ultimately consciousness wants to be in relationship with consciousness and is the basis of any way someone reifies meaningfulness.

583
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:35,260
Do you think that's fundamental to consciousness or do you think that that's embedded due to the social animals that we are and that every other animal is.

584
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,260
Both.

585
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:45,260
Interesting.

586
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:49,260
Can you can you talk me through your thinking with regards to how it's fundamental to consciousness.

587
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:55,260
So we think of consciousness associated with an organism.

588
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:00,260
Like a person maybe a dog whatever.

589
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:09,260
And we think of them having some kind of separate consciousness associated with that brain and that body container.

590
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:16,260
And so that consciousness is just is the emergent property of their brain or it dwells in it or something like that.

591
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:22,260
This is this is a really deeply flawed concept.

592
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:33,260
Because inside of my body brain package that I call I physically that I think my consciousness associated with.

593
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:38,260
Doesn't include all of the coral reef.

594
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:45,260
And doesn't include all of the plants and doesn't include the soil microbiome.

595
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:49,260
I don't think of those as I but I wouldn't exist without all of them.

596
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:58,260
So can I say that my consciousness is an emergent property of this thing without saying it's an emergent property of all of that.

597
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:01,260
Because this thing is an emergent property of all of that.

598
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:07,260
And so without the plants I'm not even an idea.

599
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:13,260
Right like there isn't even a well formed concept of me that exists without an atmosphere and oxygen.

600
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:28,260
And without the sun and without the other planets that keep the asteroids from hitting us and without just keep going on and we find the entire universe is configured in a way that I'm the emergent property of a part of it.

601
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:38,260
And you take away the galactic center you take away the sun you take away the other planets you take away the gravitational field of the electromagnetic field or the bacteria and I don't exist.

602
01:12:38,260 --> 01:13:01,260
So my consciousness is not an emergent property so imagine putting me in a complete and perfect vacuum and just imagine I didn't physically die for a moment which I of course would.

603
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:11,260
What would the sensory experience be there'd be no sensory input what would the contents of consciousness with no sensory input be.

604
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,260
I think in words that were developed by other people.

605
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:19,260
I think in images that were created by other people I.

606
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:26,260
All of the contents of my consciousness came from the world.

607
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:35,260
So the idea that it's my consciousness is just kind of sloppy thinking in the misnomer.

608
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,260
That's fantastic.

609
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:40,260
The fact that you are.

610
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:47,260
The tip of the finger which is the end of everything which came before which permitted you to be.

611
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:50,260
And still not just before.

612
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:53,260
And still continues to permit you to be.

613
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:55,260
Yeah turn the sun off.

614
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:58,260
Hi.

615
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:02,260
We were touching on.

616
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:14,260
Being present as being the thing that you are to chase in order to discover meaning or why is that why is that not purely the thing that you should.

617
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:22,260
You should seek and I think that you mentioned about narcissism and the fact that there's an interconnectedness with other people.

618
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:25,260
Whether I am.

619
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:32,260
Pursuing a state through racing cars or.

620
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:41,260
Doing cocaine or doing the right kind of psychedelics or meditation.

621
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:44,260
It's not that different.

622
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:45,260
It's.

623
01:14:47,260 --> 01:15:00,260
Some kind of process I can find to give me some state of experience that I feel that I don't have and that I need to arrange the world a particular way for me to have.

624
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:04,260
Right.

625
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:09,260
So.

626
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,260
I remember this saying.

627
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:30,260
If I bring up the Bible or the Tao Te Ching all of the various wisdom traditions were interesting to me growing up so I'm not saying this in a way that people have to accept that book is anything other than interesting.

628
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,260
I remember there was a.

629
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:38,260
Quote in Luke attributed to Jesus that really bothered me as a kid.

630
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:44,260
And I came to understand really profound wisdom in it after contemplating it for a long time.

631
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:46,260
Right.

632
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:53,260
Maybe obvious for a lot of people said to those who have more shall be given and to those who don't have the little they have will be taken away.

633
01:15:55,260 --> 01:16:06,260
And it really deeply bothered because of the context of it being in the Bible and something that someone like Jesus would say that I wanted to be Robin Hood like and say like no no no we'll we'll give to those who don't have.

634
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:22,260
And we can see where this is true just in terms of like if you have debt you get compounding interest in debt and if you have savings you get compounding interest in savings to those who have more is given to those who don't have a little they have is taken away.

635
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:26,260
It just ends up being something that shows up as true in lots of places.

636
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:39,260
When someone is in a state of not having around relationships and they feel lonely and upset with people and whatever they're not maximally attractive.

637
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:47,260
As a person in that state right when someone's in the kind of abundance of their relationships they show up in a way that's more attractive to those who have more is given.

638
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,260
Ultimately they have and not have our states of consciousness.

639
01:16:52,260 --> 01:17:05,260
And so there is a place where I feel like I don't have enough and I'm some kind of empty needy thing that needs to get mine from the world.

640
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:14,260
Whatever that is more acknowledgement more money more muscle more knowledge more something more good state through meditation.

641
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:21,260
But I'm still basically coming from some kind of lack and what what's in it for me.

642
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:26,260
I think.

643
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:30,260
Okay so growth can happen in that place.

644
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:32,260
But there's a.

645
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:36,260
There's a place for that concert to shift.

646
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:46,260
Where I.

647
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:50,260
Stop thinking I need anything from the world in particular.

648
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:54,260
And there is a felt sense of.

649
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:59,260
Connection to life that has a fullness and dwelling within it.

650
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:04,260
And then what what do I get out of life stops being the relevant question.

651
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:10,260
And how do I pursue a particular state stops becoming the relevant question.

652
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:12,260
And.

653
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:19,260
Are there other people who are suffering who don't know how to shift it that I can do something about.

654
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:21,260
And are the things that I can create.

655
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:25,260
For the world starts to become a more interesting question.

656
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:28,260
And I think life kind of starts there.

657
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:31,260
I love it.

658
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:32,260
I love it.

659
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:35,260
It maps very closely onto the reality that I've.

660
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:37,260
Started to see slivers of I think.

661
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:41,260
Principally through this project but also through other things.

662
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:50,260
I think you've given a very robust framework for people to understand.

663
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:58,260
The interconnectedness the fact that you are because of everything that came before and everything which is still coming now.

664
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:00,260
The fact that.

665
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:03,260
You have the opportunity to.

666
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:08,260
Effect those around you in a way that allows you to make them more of them.

667
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:11,260
And less of the things that they don't want to be.

668
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:18,260
People are always going to weaponize in a.

669
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:22,260
Rivalrous capitalist economy people are always going to be able to weaponize.

670
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,260
Meaning seeking wisdom seeking.

671
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:29,260
A better life state change whatever it might be.

672
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:36,260
They're always going to be able to do that because there is going to be a reward for the people who are able to dangle that carrot.

673
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:39,260
And allow other people to go chasing after it.

674
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:44,260
But the fact that.

675
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:46,260
So many.

676
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:51,260
Of the pleasures that we have in life genuine pleasures that we have in life.

677
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:54,260
Come from such simple things.

678
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:59,260
Should be a signal to people.

679
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:04,260
It's a very subtle signal it's not as loud or as brash as a Lamborghini blasting past.

680
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:07,260
But it should be a signal to people.

681
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:09,260
Of where to look.

682
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:11,260
Right.

683
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:12,260
Like it should be.

684
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:14,260
This is where you should.

685
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:16,260
Point your attention.

686
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:18,260
Because.

687
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:24,260
Hadonic adaptation hadonic treadmill lottery winner versus person that loses their legs you know.

688
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:27,260
Pick your mental model with regards to that.

689
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:31,260
And yet if you.

690
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:34,260
Consistently connected with the people that were around you.

691
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:36,260
And.

692
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:40,260
Felt.

693
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:43,260
Like you were contributing to something that you genuinely felt.

694
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:46,260
Like you were contributing to something that you genuinely care about.

695
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:51,260
And we're progressing and we're still satisfying that airy review that wants to feel like growth.

696
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:56,260
Like everything else I think would fall into place and.

697
01:20:58,260 --> 01:20:59,260
The.

698
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:04,260
Beauty of the extraordinary in the ordinary.

699
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,260
Is is something hopefully.

700
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:12,260
That as people develop themselves they start to strip away the things that they think.

701
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:14,260
That they need.

702
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:17,260
And I left with with something which is more.

703
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:21,260
More simple and more pure and I loved it the start I didn't I didn't bring it up but.

704
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:25,260
As you mentioned about sort of the tier one tier two tier three.

705
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:28,260
Of self development that really struck me about.

706
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:32,260
His dark materials which is a children's trilogy by Philip Pullman.

707
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,260
And in it there's a girl called Lyra Balakwa.

708
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:38,260
Gets the name Lyra silver tongue halfway through you can tell I.

709
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:40,260
Listen to it and read it a lot as a kid.

710
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:42,260
And.

711
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:46,260
She's given this truth telling device called an elite theometer.

712
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:49,260
And she's given it and the.

713
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:54,260
Nuns in the Oxford of the universe that she lives in it's a multiverse.

714
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:58,260
Story then the nuns of the the university that she lives in.

715
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:03,260
Tell her this story about how people need to study for their entire lives.

716
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:09,260
After study for my entire life the people who have these devices have to study for.

717
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:14,260
Books and books arcane texts they have to understand all of these different things and then they can read them.

718
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:21,260
And she's she's given one in secret and it turns out that she can read it she's never learned to.

719
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:26,260
She can read it so she has natural grace she has unconscious competence.

720
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:34,260
And she's able to read it which you could draw an analogy to experiencing life the purity of experiencing life as a child.

721
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:40,260
There's a Luke Coombs song which opens up at 17 you don't think that much about life you just live it.

722
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:45,260
And I think that's the same then she hits puberty and as she hits puberty.

723
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:51,260
She loses the ability to read this truth telling device she loses that.

724
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:56,260
Conscious on competence she becomes aware it's the fall from grace it's.

725
01:22:57,260 --> 01:23:02,260
And then there's this like tiny little passage towards the end of the book.

726
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:11,260
And she's speaking to somebody another one of the nuns about how am I going to get the ability to tell the truth back from from my device from the elitometer.

727
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:15,260
And she says my dear child it will take you a lifetime of study.

728
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:21,260
But the depth of your understanding will be deeper and greater than it ever ever was before.

729
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:23,260
Conscious competence.

730
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:32,260
And I think that timeline maps sort of quite nicely onto what I hope personal development self development actually ends up being for people.

731
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:49,260
Yeah there's definitely a presence that we see in children that can be overjoyed and fulfilled with the experience of life.

732
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:59,260
And this is the in no way except you turn and become like little children she passed on the king of heaven.

733
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:13,260
And to be able to have a connectedness with life that isn't always seeking.

734
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:17,260
What stimulus is going to fulfill me next.

735
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:24,260
With adult capacities that can actually show up to the world is very interesting.

736
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,260
There was a I saw Jordan Peterson live a couple of years ago.

737
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:35,260
And they were reading questions out from Twitter that had been submitted Dave Rubin goes up on stage and asking these questions.

738
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:42,260
And one of the questions that somebody asked him was that essentially boiled down to the depth of my consciousness causes me to suffer.

739
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:47,260
I wish that I thought less I wish that I didn't consider things so much.

740
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:51,260
It is both a blessing and occurs to feel things so very deeply.

741
01:24:52,260 --> 01:25:03,260
And Jordan's answer to that stuck with me which was that you can try and regress back to a more animalistic more simple time which would be people looking at children and being envy of their innocence.

742
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:10,260
Right and thinking look at how simple it is looking at their dog and thinking look how simple it would be if I was just a dog.

743
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:14,260
You know I just lie in the sun and play with balls and stuff like that.

744
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:19,260
But you don't have that option and Jordan gave this really symbolic answer as he often does.

745
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:28,260
And he said you can take more of the poison until you girdle it into a tonic that allows you to rule your own world.

746
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:35,260
And I really like that I like the idea that it's not about escaping from Dante's Inferno.

747
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:42,260
It's about going through every single level right to the very very bottom and that's where you then sort of break it all open.

748
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:53,260
Danny man I feel like we could go on for forever but for me it's 11 a.m. and for you it's 3 a.m.

749
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:58,260
So I feel like I sadly need to let you go.

750
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:04,260
It's been a dude it's been six months since we've been planning this and I'm so grateful for you coming on.

751
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:09,260
Can I share a closing thought? Absolutely.

752
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:17,260
Every emotion has a value and has a place.

753
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:31,260
And so someone has an idea that a more developed human state never has sadness or anger or fear.

754
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:35,260
Then their idea of a more developed human state is a sociopath.

755
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:47,260
Because the key kind of definition in sociopathy is can't feel fear and remorse and guilt and certain negative emotions which is why they can hurt people so easily.

756
01:26:48,260 --> 01:27:05,260
So if I'm angry I'm angry because maybe I can process it better and I can right.

757
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:10,260
Maybe I can I made up some fake meanings and I'm angry about something that didn't even really happen.

758
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:12,260
I kind of took what that person said the wrong way.

759
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:18,260
But in so far as I'm there's a real thing and I'm responding to it and anger is rising.

760
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:24,260
It's that there's something that I care about or that I love that I think somebody's harming and I'm focused on who's harming.

761
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:29,260
I'm angry about litter because actually there's a care for nature in the environment that is the basis of that.

762
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:34,260
Or someone turning an animal or a kid or whatever it is and anger rises.

763
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:37,260
So the basis of the anger is love.

764
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:41,260
If there wasn't something I loved and cared about I just wouldn't give a shit.

765
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:43,260
Go ahead and hurt it.

766
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:51,260
And if I'm afraid I'm afraid that something that I care about is going to be harmed.

767
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:54,260
So again the basis of the fear is love.

768
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:57,260
The same with sadness same with all.

769
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:02,260
So there are times where based on what's going on in the world.

770
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:06,260
Some anger arises and I wouldn't want to feel any other way.

771
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:09,260
Like there would be something wrong with me if I felt a different way.

772
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:14,260
Because I'm not making up stories I'm not reactive and I want to go hurt someone or whatever.

773
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:22,260
But there is a there is an authentic love and care for the world that also is noticing and injustice and that it expresses to that emotion.

774
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:27,260
And me feeling that in that moment is actually me and wholeness and relationship with life rightly.

775
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:35,260
So am I pursuing always being in a particular kind of happy state?

776
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:38,260
Nope.

777
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:47,260
Because that would be shutting off all of the intelligence that the various emotions that are giving me real information about reality are.

778
01:28:48,260 --> 01:29:07,260
There is a certain kind of wholeness where I'm not driven by I can experience desire in a version but I'm not driven automatically by it.

779
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:17,260
I don't automatically think I don't automatically react because I'm afraid of something or have to get something I want.

780
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:21,260
I can actually just access okayness.

781
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:23,260
That's important.

782
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:34,260
But yeah I just on this topic of should we all be seeking those states.

783
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:35,260
Well yes sometimes.

784
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:44,260
And like we were mentioning about but you know even in the moment where someone's feeling really angry at an injustice they're not questioning the meaning of life.

785
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:51,260
That's also an experience of aliveness they might be feeling meaningfulness very fucking clearly in that moment.

786
01:29:51,260 --> 01:30:04,260
And so does one want to actually have their emotional self and in addition to their cognitive self connected with reality yes.

787
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:13,260
And so does someone want to have some actual presence in that connection yes but that looks like all the things.

788
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:22,260
What a wonderful way to start my day and to finish yours.

789
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:34,260
I hope that we don't have to rearrange a million more times but I absolutely love to have you back on man whenever whenever we can make time.

790
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:42,260
It was really really fun I enjoyed the conversation with you and if it's something that your listeners find interesting and they have more questions and I'm happy to come back.

791
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,260
Fantastic thank you so much Daniel.
