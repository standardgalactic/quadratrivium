1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You've spent a lot of time studying history and writing about current events at the moment.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How would you rate your predictive ability given the current state of the world?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Were the things that you foresaw coming or things that you've been particularly surprised by?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, nobody gets to predict with 100% accuracy anything because among other things,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
all the time things happen that you could never have seen coming.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I could never have seen COVID coming. I just didn't.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So whenever anyone boasts about their predictive capabilities,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I always think you have to deal with a certain amount of humility

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
because things happen all the time you couldn't see.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You can only see around the bend of the road you're coming to.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can't see around the corner.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, I mean, some things I've written about for years,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
particularly in my book, The Strange Death of Europe that came out in 2017,

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
which I think are sadly coming to fruition.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And I say sadly because people think that if you've predicted something and got it right,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
you would feel any pleasure.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And that would only be if the thing you were predicting was something you looked forward to.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And what I was predicting was something I was dreading.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And that was the transformation of our country of birth

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and many other countries in the West due to demographic change.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And I mean, every day now, pretty much somebody says to me,

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
gosh, I used to think what you were saying.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Strange Death of Europe was a bit out there and now I realize you were right.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But it gives me no pleasure for them to say that.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Because I always sort of think, well, if you'd have agreed back then,

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
some things might not have happened.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But as Mark Stein said, demographics is destiny.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So it's one of the things you can predict with the most ease.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Did you have Victoria's Secrets plan to bring sexy back on your 2023 bingo card?

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why are Victoria's Secrets bringing sexy back?

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
After experimenting with 300-pound mannequins, plus-sized models, disabled models, trans models,

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
a male model and a 38-year-old football player,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Victoria's Secrets have made the controversial decision to switch strategy

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and start using hot women to model their underwear again.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That makes commercial sense to my mind.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm always amazed that advertising executives find it complex, this stuff.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
All you need to do is stick sexy guys on stuff and stick sexy girls on stuff

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and sell all the merchandisers, which pretty much writes itself.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, I'm not particularly surprised that if you stick Lizzo in a bikini,

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
it's not as appealing as a bit of sales merchandise.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But, you know, live and learn, I suppose?

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
One of my friends owns a very big clothing company

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and for a while they tried plus-sized models, mostly for women.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There's not much of a body positivity movement for men.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No, not like a beer gut movement.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The skinny fat revolution.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And he said, we've split tested this into oblivion, big girls don't sell clothes.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So when you see that, when you see a company, you know,

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and some are making double plus-sized dildos or whatever,

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
the company is actively hurting their top line and bottom line

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
to be able to send the right message.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And that's all well and good.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Up until some shareholder meeting where some 70s year old guy

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
looks at the far right column of an Excel sheet and goes,

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
what the fuck's this?

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And they go, no, you don't understand.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's this really cool new movement.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's very progressive.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And he goes, I don't care.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I want more money than we had last year

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and this is less money than we had last year.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah, I mean, I suppose it all starts off from a good place

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
like some or many things.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But look, if you, you might agree that, you know,

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
it's not a good thing to sell anorexic looking models

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
to young women.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And that's, yeah, okay, let's all agree on that.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But you can, you can stop somewhere before morbidly obese.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You know, that's where the whole thing goes wrong

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
with body positivity thing.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Plus there's a place where the body positivity shouldn't occur.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It should be, I mean, if somebody is so morbidly obese

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
that they're at significant risk of heart failure,

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
you shouldn't celebrate them.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You should say, hang on a minute, steady on the donuts.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But they don't say that.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
They just, they run all the way.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I wish that you could just have sort of healthy looking women

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
on the ads and just draw the line there.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But as ever, they sort of don't know where the line is

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
until you just say something wrenches them back.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And I think wrenches them back is normally,

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
as you say, the bottom line.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, I have been thinking about this sort of performative

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
empathy point for a while.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Got this idea, I need to meme it better.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But I think something like short term empathy

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
or the shallow pond of empathy, I've been thinking about

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
what is most popular in culture at the moment

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
is something that optimizes for its immediacy

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
to signal that you are a good guy or good girl.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Right.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Even if that's at the expense of the ultimate outcome

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
for the person.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So let's say you're able to do something giving the child ice cream.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It may be what it wants right now.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It may be bad for it long term.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But if you're the ice cream promoter for the young children,

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
you will be seen as a good person.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And if you're the person who's saying, hang on a second,

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
that's not what you want long term.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Maybe responsibility in Peterson language.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Maybe not casual sex in Louise Perry language.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Maybe not as much food as you want in body positivity language.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're seen as bigoted or judgmental or whatever.

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Because there's no countervailing force in the culture.

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The unlimited empathy, people have run a long way very fast

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
because as you say, there's a short term gain to be seen

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
to be being empathetic.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's celebrate yourself.

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But ordinarily you would have some other counterforce in the society

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and different forces have provided that in history,

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
including the church.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But if there is no counterforce to say, for instance,

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
long term gratification, better than short term or whatever,

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
then yeah.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And that's a sort of unappealing position in our society now.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There's plenty of room for people to be in that space.

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But you're still on the defensive.

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We're still in a society where effectively to own an ice cream truck

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
in the sort of language of a child would seem to be a great thing

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to have the short term thing.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Not many people want that role.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's sort of uncool in some way.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It might become cool at some point in the future

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
when more people realize that the short term gratification thing

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
was leading to diabetes or whatever.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's the same as one of the justifications, I think,

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
for why people aren't having children,

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
that upfront children, you just see a very, very large cost

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
on all of the joy and stuff.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What the economists put it is that the child tax,

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
the amount of money you have less if you have a child,

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
weird way around to look at the future of the species, isn't it?

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If only I died with more money in my bank account.

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Life of regret.

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Death of regret, perhaps.

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Well, it's kind of the, as well, the Mexican fisherman story.

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Are you familiar with that?

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The parable of the Mexican fisherman?

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
No, I don't think I am.

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This is cool. You'll like this.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So an American businessman goes on holiday to Mexico.

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And while he's there.

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's a true story.

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's a parable, though.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Got it.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Fucking hell.

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He goes on holiday.

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He gets taken out fishing by a local Mexican.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And he asks the Mexican how he spends his time.

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The Mexican says, I fish a little on the morning.

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I catch enough for my family.

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We go back.

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We cook.

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We laugh around the fire.

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And I spend time with my children.

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And the American businessman goes, that's stupid.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Here's a better idea.

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What you should do is actually spend most of your day fishing.

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And then with the surplus fish, you could sell them at the market.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And the Mexican fisherman says, why would I do that?

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So, well, once you've got the additional money,

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
you could start to employ some of your friends.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And they could come out fishing with you, too.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And you could catch more fish, which you could sell at the market for more money.

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He says, why would I do that?

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He says, well, once you've done that,

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
you would be able to incorporate an America

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and you would maybe be able to start a canning factory

173
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
so that you could own the entire production process

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and you could then sell the company for a lot of money.

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He said, why would I do that?

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He said, because once you've done that,

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
you'd be able to fish a little on the morning

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and then go back and spend time with your children around the fire.

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Very good.

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And I often think about that as a much more direct route to happiness.

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You know?

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah.

183
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, that's the classic thing that the place you end up

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
is the place you started from.

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
There are lots of reasons why people aren't having children.

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And a lot of them are simple economic things.

187
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I mean, all of the western countries

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that have terrible replacement birth rate figures

189
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
are because of very easy things to solve,

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
like cost of housing and things like that.

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's not hard to build affordable housing.

192
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
They've proved to be incapable of doing so.

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So young people wanting to both get on the property ladder

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and start a family think they have to do either or.

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And they're not entirely wrong,

196
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
but that's something that governments could have sorted out

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and none of them do.

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
They're so hopeless at it and they have been for years

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
under consecutive governments.

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
They never build enough housing so young people don't see a future,

201
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
don't feel hopeless and then don't have kids

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and then everyone wonders why there's a demographic crisis.

203
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Intergenerational competition theory

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
is something I learned about a couple of weeks ago.

205
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You familiar with this?

206
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah.

207
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I didn't know about it before, but it makes complete sense.

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There was always this talk of millennials

209
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
are the first generation to have done worse than their parents.

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Well, they're not the first in a while.

211
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
First in two generations.

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And it seems like millennials actually probably

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
just about managed to get over on average.

214
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But Gen Z materially,

215
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
difficulty in getting on the property ladder,

216
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
the most common living arrangement for men under 35

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
is still at home with their parents.

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And yeah, it bakes in this sort of

219
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
intergenerational competitiveness

220
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and a dissatisfaction when you look at where your parents were

221
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and this felt sense that your parents got advantages

222
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
that you never did.

223
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Which is usually not true.

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I mean, they didn't suffer inflation at the same rate.

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
They suffered very high taxation in the post-war period.

226
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
We haven't had taxation as the levels it was at

227
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
in the 1960s and 70s, for instance, in the UK.

228
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There was a time when people were top rate

229
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
taxpayers were paying 99% tax.

230
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
A friend who once in that period paid over 100% tax one year

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
for reasons he could still lock.

232
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
How's that possible?

233
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It will be back tax and that sort of thing.

234
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So, I mean, there's a tendency,

235
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
particularly among millennials and after,

236
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
to think that their parents had it very easy.

237
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And my experience of people from that generation,

238
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
the boomer generation, it didn't feel easy at the time.

239
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And yeah, there were certain things getting on the property

240
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
housing ladder was a little bit easier than it is,

241
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
or significantly easier.

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Once you have, what is it, five times average earnings

243
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
being inadequate to get to the average property price,

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
you see the split go on.

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But you always have to factor.

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I mean, if you say, you know, the millennial,

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
the first ones or Gen Z were the first ones

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
who said whoever to have a better standard of living,

249
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
you have to bake in things like,

250
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
oh yeah, well, they had a world war, you know.

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So, that's quite a big PS.

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Well, there's a big footnote.

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So, yeah, everyone has their challenges.

254
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I just don't see why once you've identified them

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and know the way out of them, you don't do them.

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I was talking to mutual friend Eric Weinstein about this.

257
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I also spoke to Sam about this.

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I've spoken to a bunch of people.

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Why in your opinion do you think everybody struggles

260
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
to agree on the truth now?

261
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, that's quite straightforward.

262
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We can't agree on what's happened.

263
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So, broadly speaking, an event happens now

264
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and some people believe it has happened

265
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and other people think it hasn't.

266
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I mean, we've been through a number of deranging years

267
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
since we first spoke in which, for instance,

268
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
you know, they say there's been a global pandemic

269
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
which some people believe was something

270
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
which killed millions and millions of people

271
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
in their own country and think they were just about saved

272
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
from dying themselves.

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And other people think it was a fake

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and other people think we just massively overreacted

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and other people think it was all planned

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and nobody agrees what happened.

277
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's just to take one example.

278
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
In America, you have obviously the fact

279
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
that nobody agrees who won an election.

280
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That's a problem.

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And so you just have basic things.

282
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Nobody can agree on it. It just happened.

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I always say in America, you know,

284
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
it would be nice if we could just agree

285
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
that one thing that's just happened happened

286
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
but then nobody wants to.

287
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It says you must be a WF shill if you believe that.

288
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So I think it is the problem.

289
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And then obviously underneath that is just the problem,

290
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
the fact that the treadmill of social media

291
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
has totally changed the way in which we communicate,

292
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
the way in which we learn things, absorb things.

293
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And we don't know what the consequences of that are.

294
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We're so early into it.

295
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And it seems to me that among other things,

296
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
it's allowed people to have their own version of recent events,

297
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
recent history, past few days.

298
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And so when you sit down to talk to somebody,

299
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
you can fairly swiftly work out

300
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
whether they're somebody who's open to the idea

301
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
of things that happened having happened

302
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
or whether or not they will fight you all the way.

303
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And that just makes everything much harder

304
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
than it used to be.

305
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And that isn't to sort of particularly pine

306
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
for the era of a mono narrative.

307
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
If that era ever particularly existed

308
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and you read history, not clear that it did.

309
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But it's just massively worse.

310
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And news is coming at us at such a pace these days.

311
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And it's just like, you know, every day feels like,

312
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
you know, a month's worth of news in the past.

313
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Things just fly by you so fast

314
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
that you don't even have time to absorb it

315
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
before it's happened.

316
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So I think that's part of the reason.

317
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And in any case, the whole concept of truth

318
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
as being a desirable thing in the society

319
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
seems to have eroded from both the right and the left.

320
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Well, truth, for instance, used to be the basis

321
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
for a university education

322
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and the basis of university inquiry

323
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
that you sought the truth wherever it led you.

324
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That was the point of academia, for instance.

325
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Politics was different.

326
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Politics was always about having to find a way around

327
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
truth and deal with it.

328
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Addressing convenience.

329
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah, address it where you could, but, you know,

330
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
get around it if it was too awkward.

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But inquiry used to be about seeking truth.

332
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And we've been like that for a couple thousand years or more

333
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
since the Greeks, certainly.

334
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And then it changed at some point relatively recently.

335
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And truth is now not a desirable thing

336
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
because truth hurts people.

337
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And it can be mean.

338
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So it's not only that people have different opinions on things.

339
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
They don't agree that the thing we used to agree on

340
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
is worth going for.

341
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Well, they have different facts.

342
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But they don't agree that, I mean, they don't agree

343
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
that you should just follow truth wherever it takes you.

344
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Because other things are prioritized over truth.

345
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I still prioritize truth over all things if I can and try to.

346
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And I think that's the interesting thing about the world

347
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
is finding out what is true and what is not.

348
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But other people don't seem to have that same appetite anymore

349
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and would rather live in lies,

350
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
which I think is very dangerous for an individual

351
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and very dangerous for society.

352
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
In fact, it's dangerous for an individual

353
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and lethal in a society, I'd say.

354
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's interesting to think about the motivations

355
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
that people have for not believing something

356
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
which is already on an unshaky foundation

357
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
of we can't agree on the thing that we're not believing about.

358
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And Gwinda, one of my friends has this idea that

359
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
if no amount of evidence would dissuade someone

360
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
of what they believe, then they don't have a rational belief.

361
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
They have a religious ideology.

362
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah, yeah, that's Jonathan Swift beautifully put it

363
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
as if you can't reason somebody out for a position

364
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
they weren't reasoned into.

365
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah, of course.

366
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I mean, you're dealing with dogma with many people today.

367
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's just they don't know which faith they belong to.

368
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But it's dogma for sure.

369
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I just am not very interested in their views

370
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
because I think they can't defend them.

371
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If you can't defend your views, I'm not very interested in them

372
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
because I don't find them persuasive.

373
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I asked Sam this about whether or not...

374
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Obviously, whatever, 10, 15 years ago,

375
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
who's a big part of the New Atheist movement

376
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and I guess you were tangentially...

377
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I was a little bit of a whipper snapper.

378
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I was a whipper snapper New Atheist.

379
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You were an orbiter.

380
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I was a short trousers New Atheist.

381
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Okay.

382
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But, you know, your book, The Madness of Crowds,

383
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
talks about the collapse of grand narratives.

384
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
One of the biggest collapses of grand narratives was religion.

385
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So I asked Sam whether or not looking back,

386
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
he believed that his deconstruction of religion

387
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
was on balance and net good or a net negative.

388
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What did he say?

389
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
He managed to evade being too committal, either way, I think.

390
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But what do you think?

391
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Well, I think it's like a lot of things that you deconstruct.

392
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You only know afterwards

393
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
whether or not it's something you could have put back together.

394
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's like children with bicycles.

395
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Very fine at taking them apart.

396
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Very bad at putting them back together.

397
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Not comparing Sam to a child.

398
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But I mean, I just...

399
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think that is...

400
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If it's something you notice only once you've taken it apart,

401
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
once you can't reconstruct it,

402
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
you'd realize what function it might have performed.

403
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I said to Sam on stage a few years ago

404
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
that I thought that it would all be fine

405
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
if most atheists were as rational and level-headed as Sam.

406
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But it's not Sam Harris all the way down.

407
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's like Sam Harris followed by total mentalists

408
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
and who just will not reason or rationalize anything

409
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
and are just screaming harpies of insanity.

410
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So that's a shame.

411
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But yes, I mean, I think that that whole thing works for some people,

412
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
but obviously it doesn't work for others.

413
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I mean, religion is...

414
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You know, Schopenhauer, among others,

415
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
saw it was religion was philosophy for the masses.

416
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Absent religion completely.

417
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There's several lots of options of what will happen.

418
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
One is that the general public

419
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
lose the overarching framework of their lives

420
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and have nothing to replace it with.

421
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And another one is that they do replace it with other things,

422
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
which are new religions which crop up all the time.

423
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We have the religion of the body negativity movement.

424
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You know, we have the religion of trans.

425
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We have the religion of gender.

426
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We have the religion of race and all these things

427
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
have just stepped into this void.

428
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And they're all dogmatic things with their founding texts.

429
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
They've all got their own catechisms of a kind.

430
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Priests have priests.

431
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
They have excommunication rights.

432
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And my only observation really would be on that

433
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
is that I preferred the old gods.

434
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You know, I preferred the old priesthood, funnily enough,

435
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
partly because we knew its flaws.

436
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And the sweet point where you see the flaws of religious belief

437
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
but can still live through it is one even I can,

438
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
where I can especially feel nostalgic for

439
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
because I don't like the new priesthood.

440
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I find them as corrupt as any priesthood in history

441
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
with the negative attribute that not everyone's woken up to them yet.

442
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I mean, do we have in our culture an equivalent,

443
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
for instance, of the meme of the pedophile priest?

444
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't think we do.

445
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I mean, for instance, I would love it if the sort of adults

446
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
who push gender dysmorphia stuff on children

447
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
were regarded as the equivalent of pedophile priests.

448
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I think that'd be fine.

449
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But it doesn't come with that yet.

450
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's like the Catholic Church in Boston circa 1950.

451
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The priests are still fiddling with the kids

452
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
but no one wants to talk about it.

453
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So...

454
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
On the planet, they're the only 100% stress-free,

455
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
wild harvested venison that you can get.

456
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Here's my super secret hack.

457
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
If you are sick of buying meat that always goes off,

458
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
put it in the freezer from frozen, salt both sides of it,

459
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
put it in an air fryer for 10 to 12 minutes each side,

460
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and you have a perfectly cooked steak from frozen

461
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
that will never go off because it's going from freezer to mouth

462
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
in the space of 25 minutes.

463
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's a complete game changer.

464
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
All of their cuts are spectacular

465
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and you can get them frozen, delivered to your door.

466
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But their venison sticks are my favorite while I've been on the road.

467
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You can get the healthiest red meat on the planet

468
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
delivered directly to your door

469
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000

and using the code modernwisdom at checkout.

473
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000

venison.com slash modernwisdom

475
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and modernwisdom at checkout.

476
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It makes me think as we were talking earlier on

477
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
about some of the ways in which

478
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
lots of decisions need to be made

479
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and you don't know how the outcomes are going to occur

480
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
that there are no solutions, only trade-offs.

481
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I keep coming back to that in my personal life as well

482
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
but thinking about what people want to optimize for

483
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
in their existence,

484
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
there are no solutions ultimately

485
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and you have to give up certain things.

486
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You don't have to give up everything.

487
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Well, no, there's certainly better solutions,

488
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
but the world is trying to maximize everything.

489
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It goes back to the shallow pond of empathy

490
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
that accepting that trade-offs are an inevitability

491
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
doesn't fit into that paradigm.

492
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
We will always optimize for what feels most pleasurable

493
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
or empathetic in the short term.

494
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I don't know. I don't feel that.

495
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's how it plays out, I think.

496
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
For a lot of people, if they have no character.

497
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
What do you optimize for?

498
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I try to optimize for peace.

499
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That seems to be the thing that for me,

500
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
in my personal life, I try to do.

501
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
If the price is my sanity, the cost is too high

502
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
no matter what it is.

503
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I continually throw that rule out of the window all the time.

504
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That's what I try and aim for.

505
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I love the peace in your private life.

506
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I try.

507
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It reminds me of Lady Bracknell's line about the general

508
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
at the end of the importance of being earnest.

509
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
She says, the general was essentially a man of peace

510
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
except in his domestic life.

511
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But you're the other way around.

512
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You're a man of peace in your domestic life.

513
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Except for my private life.

514
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Maybe what I generally am.

515
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You're a highly agreeable person.

516
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I try as best I can to keep a lid on it.

517
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah.

518
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
This lack of meaning and people's desire there.

519
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Absolutely fervent desire to try and fill that hole

520
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
with as many things as they can.

521
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Like Lizzo.

522
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Like Lizzo, indeed.

523
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Did you see the stories that came out about Lizzo?

524
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Oh, it was wonderful.

525
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
About her Amsterdam.

526
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
My favorite story of the year.

527
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Long way.

528
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
For the people that don't know,

529
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Lizzo was on tour in Amsterdam.

530
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Took her backup dances to the Red Light District.

531
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes.

532
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And made the backup dancers,

533
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
some of the backup dancers eat bananas out of the vaginas

534
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
of Amsterdamian strippers.

535
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
My view is what happened here was that Lizzo

536
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
thought you could outsource the eating

537
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
of your five fruit and veggie day.

538
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
To the vagina of the stripper?

539
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
She's so reluctant to eat healthfully.

540
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
She even outsources the five fruit and veggie day.

541
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
That's my view.

542
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Well, it seems to me that both Lizzo,

543
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Ellen DeGeneres, Jimmy Kimmel,

544
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
all of these people who up front.

545
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Oh, isn't it wonderful?

546
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It's so great.

547
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's always nice.

548
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Not the Lizzo look nice,

549
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
but the squeaky clean Ellen DeGeneres thing,

550
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
just dancing.

551
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And of course, they're horrible in real life.

552
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Of course.

553
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It's a sort of rule that, by the way,

554
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
one of the biggest public figures is that the ones

555
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
who are most sort of sweetie-sweetie in public

556
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
tend to be the nastiest in private.

557
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Sometimes the opposite can be true.

558
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Some people who have thought to have a very hard edge in public

559
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
can actually be lovely, lovely people in private.

560
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Margaret Thatcher was a good example.

561
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Very, very nice to people around her,

562
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
but could make tough decisions.

563
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
To me, it's a counter signal.

564
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
If I see someone doing the Lizzo thing

565
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
of I am so body positivity,

566
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
it becomes their identity

567
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
because they're a flaming sword,

568
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
card carrying,

569
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
paragon of whatever this thing is.

570
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Well, it's also a bit like

571
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
the Jimmy Savile,

572
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
the hospital,

573
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
what was it called? It still goes,

574
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
but there was a hospital for children

575
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
that he raised money for all the time.

576
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And whenever anyone would try to do an investigation,

577
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Savile would go,

578
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
it's going to hurt the hospital for kids.

579
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Are you sure you want to run that story?

580
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That's going to hurt the hospital.

581
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So there are lots of people in our own age

582
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
who have a thing like that.

583
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
They build the equivalent of the Jimmy Savile

584
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Children's Hospital facade up

585
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
in order to protect themselves.

586
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Are you saying that Lizzo's work

587
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
with the body positivity movement

588
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
is in a case to try and effectively

589
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
put a wall of large

590
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
bodied people in front of it?

591
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
A very difficult wall to get over.

592
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I think it's probably easy to get over.

593
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Getting around it might be more difficult.

594
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yeah, I got into a car and it ran out of gas.

595
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So,

596
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I had this idea about

597
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
why

598
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
certain women

599
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
are very pro body positivity movement.

600
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And I was listening to Bill Burr

601
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
do a live show,

602
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and he said,

603
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
ladies, if you could only support

604
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
the WNBA the way that you support

605
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
a fat chick

606
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
who is gaining weight

607
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and no longer a threat to you,

608
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
there are more numbers than the NBA is.

609
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And I realized that

610
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
some non-zero number

611
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
of women may deep down

612
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
in their darker moments realize

613
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
that they don't discourage

614
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
some of their friends from

615
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
gaining weight because

616
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
they can eat themselves out of their

617
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
intersexual competition for potential partners.

618
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It's always welcome on men like that as well.

619
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
How do we play that game?

620
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I mean, this is going to show a low side of my character.

621
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
But you can't say always that you're sad

622
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
if

623
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
somebody you're not very close to, but you knew

624
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and you see them after some years and then

625
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
they're fat.

626
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I mean, you can't say there isn't a slight sort of

627
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
you'll never guess

628
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
because you've become fat.

629
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
There are different versions of that with men, I think.

630
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And I think men can be

631
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
complicit in that as well.

632
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You know, the thrill

633
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
would offend bolds early.

634
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I think that's very common.

635
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Well, there'll be a German word for that.

636
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Of course.

637
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
For the scalp.

638
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah.

639
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I think lots of people do that.

640
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But it's a pretty bad thing to encourage among people.

641
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But yeah, I think it is part of the competition

642
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
taking out of the competition for sure.

643
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I was thinking as well about how

644
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
material conditions

645
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
you were saying before

646
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
people's parents

647
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
maybe had it better in some ways, but also

648
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
would have had it way worse.

649
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Material conditions

650
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
often don't impact

651
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
people's demeanors in the way that they might have predicted.

652
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Like, rich people

653
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
can be bitter idiots

654
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and poor people can be grateful heroes.

655
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Although, as George Orwell said, by the age of 50

656
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
every man gets the face he deserves.

657
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
What do you mean by that?

658
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I think that's actually true.

659
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I think there's a certain age, it might not be 50 now,

660
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
but it's a certain age where you do show your life

661
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
on your face.

662
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Oh yeah, I mean, for instance, somebody

663
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
is very profoundly depressed

664
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
for a long time

665
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
that writes itself across the face.

666
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It writes itself in their eyes, I think.

667
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Particularly unhappiness

668
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
writes itself on somebody's face.

669
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Joy does as well.

670
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
If somebody smiles a lot, they have laugh lines.

671
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yes, there's a great truth in it.

672
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
We know that

673
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
because we judge people by

674
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
their faces, by the way they interact with us

675
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
by the way they look at us.

676
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's perfectly sensible.

677
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I've found a quote the other day that said

678
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
people with a low self-esteem will always

679
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
find a way to be miserable.

680
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And it made me think that

681
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
material conditions a lot of the time are what?

682
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Young people, but many people

683
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
lay at the feet of their

684
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
despondency or their nihilism

685
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
or their critical nature

686
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
or whatever it might be.

687
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And I've seen enough of my friends

688
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
and friends

689
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
vacillate through

690
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
varying levels of

691
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
affluence or

692
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
relationship or singletonness or whatever.

693
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And one of the things

694
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
sometimes it impacts the way that they show up.

695
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But many times they are the common denominator

696
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
between all of those situations.

697
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And the material conditions don't actually impact

698
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
the way that they show up all that much.

699
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Well, there's a problem of analyzing this

700
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
which is that anyone who's successful

701
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
inevitably looks at their own path

702
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
to some extent pre-ordained.

703
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I mean, almost.

704
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I mean, there are some people with wild luck.

705
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But most people,

706
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
a lot of people, let me say, who are successful

707
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
look back and they think, well, I don't understand

708
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
this person who hasn't made it to the same

709
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
rung of the ladder as I have. Why didn't they work hard?

710
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
There's a sort of

711
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
callousness actually that can creep in there.

712
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
But equally, people are

713
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
to a great extent masters their own fate.

714
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And it's a very hard one

715
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
to analyze that, as I said, because the outriders

716
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
skew the whole statistics.

717
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I mean, the outrider who does very well,

718
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
not everyone can do

719
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
what he or she has done.

720
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But he or she is likely to think

721
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
they could have done.

722
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Well, you retroactively, lots of people that achieve success

723
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
look back at the route that was

724
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
particularly designed by them,

725
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
for them to achieve the very specific

726
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
type of success that they managed to get.

727
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And then retrofit that as a universal law

728
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
that anybody else could follow.

729
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
One of the things I've realized is I've spent

730
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
more time digging into personal growth

731
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
and self-development and all of that stuff.

732
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So much of it is post-hoc rationalization

733
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
about one person's very

734
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
idiosyncratic solution for this thing.

735
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And they say, these are the universal

736
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
principles of X, Y and Z.

737
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And you go, no, they're not.

738
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
They're highly personal.

739
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's your personality just spun up

740
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
and tuned up to 11.

741
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah, I mean, most successful

742
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
people I've ever met have some

743
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
story of their own

744
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
growth which

745
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
is both inspiring

746
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and not replicable

747
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
because they're unusual people.

748
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Well, what's the alternative, as you said before?

749
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Like, you have to lay the agency at your

750
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
own feet because if you were to

751
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
perhaps admit the truth, which is

752
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I was in the right place at the right time.

753
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Well, that can be the case.

754
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Not many people say that, but some do.

755
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Yeah, if you're in Britain in the 80s,

756
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
for instance, it's a good time to make money.

757
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Easier, better

758
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
than today.

759
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Some people will say, yeah, it was a great place at the right time.

760
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
But most people do sort of

761
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
vaguely think they've made it,

762
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
it was sort of preordained.

763
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I will do that to some extent.

764
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I often describe myself as being lucky

765
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
and then need somebody to remind me

766
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
of how hard I've worked.

767
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Yeah.

768
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I had a friend who joined

769
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Goldman Sachs in 1998

770
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and he said he had

771
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
an absolute golden period

772
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
for about 10 years.

773
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah, a little bit less.

774
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
He said it was already starting to

775
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
wind down. Before Lehman, brother.

776
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Yeah.

777
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Some of that was to do with DEI, a very early

778
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
instantiation of DEI. That's right.

779
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yes, there's several books that make that clear

780
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
in the subtext, yeah. Several books

781
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
that make it clear about some of the hiring processes going on.

782
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah, 2006, he was already seeing it.

783
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
But he told me

784
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
he made a trade

785
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
on 9-11.

786
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
He made a very

787
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
particular trade

788
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and bypassed all of the

789
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
security

790
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
concerns, the limits

791
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
on everything and

792
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
the pit boss or whatever. He's just some young

793
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
dude. He's been there for two years, right? Out of

794
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
whatever university or something. What did his boss think

795
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
of the trade? Came over and said, like,

796
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
what the fuck are you

797
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
doing? And he said, look

798
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
at this. If this, then that. If this, then that.

799
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Ran it all the way down. He said, this is the outcome.

800
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
This is what's going to happen. And he's like,

801
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
we would like, I don't know what.

802
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So first off, he was concerned that it was going to

803
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
go wrong. And then he made

804
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
the most

805
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
ungodly amount of money in the space of three hours.

806
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And then all the markets shut for 10

807
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
days from September 12th.

808
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

809
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And the only

810
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
organization that had spare capital

811
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
was Goldman because of this

812
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
particular trade. Wow.

813
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
He was basically told

814
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
we may need to cut this. I'll check with him.

815
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
He was basically told,

816
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
go home. Don't tell anybody.

817
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Yeah, of course. That you made this. He shorted

818
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
the market. Yeah, I mean, it was

819
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
widely thought of 9-11 that because

820
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
the stock market tanked, of course, immediately

821
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and we didn't know if there's going to be a world war, if this was

822
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
a world war.

823
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And it was regarded very

824
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
swiftly as actually being the duty

825
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
of Wall Street to

826
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
not do that.

827
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But Bush came back. You remember he did that

828
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
ground zero announcement.

829
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And that was as much

830
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
for the stock market

831
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
as it was for the fucking popular.

832
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yeah, absolutely. Well, yes, because

833
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
stock market collapses. I mean, many, many more

834
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Americans, I can't remember the percentage,

835
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
are invested in the stock market than in Britain.

836
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I mean, like three times more or something

837
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Americans. With 401K.

838
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah, more than 50% of the population

839
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
in America has some

840
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
investment in the stock market. So it's

841
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
different from in the UK where

842
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
when the pound was shorted in the 1990s

843
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
by

844
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Soros and others,

845
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
they

846
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
a lot of British people are not that sympathetic because

847
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
they don't see themselves as being involved

848
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
in the stock market, which of course they are, they just

849
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
don't know it. You mentioned

850
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
George Orwell, the telegraph

851
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
recently spoke about his

852
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
wife's biography or autobiography.

853
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Oh, there's a new biography of Sonia Orwell, yeah.

854
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
George Orwell was sadistic,

855
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
misogynistic, homophobic and sometimes

856
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
violent. Biographer of the legendary

857
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
writer's wife says, darkness

858
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
that runs through 1984

859
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
is a reflection of his soul.

860
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Should we unperson, George?

861
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Well, it would be the obvious

862
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
end point to the full circle.

863
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Full circle.

864
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Yeah, this is just a way for

865
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
the author to get publicity is to repeat

866
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
things everyone knew. I mean,

867
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
George Orwell held the views

868
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
of his time about gay men.

869
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
For instance, we know he was a little bit homophobic,

870
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
but it was the 1940s,

871
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
you know,

872
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Nancy Boys and so on, as he would have called him.

873
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Were not,

874
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
you know, people weren't

875
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
like a 1990s

876
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
taxi driver's insult that they've thrown out.

877
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
No, it was a sort of word that Orwell

878
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
and people of his generation would use,

879
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
you know, fairies or something.

880
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And he does in some of his letters and some of his articles.

881
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But I mean, so fucking what?

882
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I don't care.

883
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I mean,

884
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
was he sadistic probably?

885
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
In some ways,

886
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
sometimes,

887
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
was, could he be cruel and nasty

888
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
probably being a human being?

889
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I just think that the

890
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
absurdity of our age of judging people

891
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
and passing, well, you know, just, just

892
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
wait till people do that to you.

893
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah. You know, wait, wait till somebody

894
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
weighs up your own

895
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
life in the balance and finds

896
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
you wanting, you know.

897
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I mean, I think it's preposterous.

898
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Human beings are what we are.

899
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Being amazed

900
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
us in the past.

901
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
There's always just an expression of our own vanity

902
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and thinking we've got past all that.

903
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's like the way, if a

904
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
friend of mine was saying to me the other day when I was at Oxford,

905
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
if you want to get a grant

906
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
to study these days, say in English,

907
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and you would choose

908
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Shakespeare as your

909
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
subject of study, which is sort of unusual

910
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
these days, you would,

911
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
you would, for instance, have to

912
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
find Shakespeare guilty of, you know,

913
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
racism, colonialist thinking

914
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and so on. And it doesn't seem to strike

915
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
these people that actually their job is not

916
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
to judge Shakespeare. Shakespeare judges

917
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
us.

918
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And he might find us wanting.

919
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
How so?

920
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Well, he gives us visions of

921
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
the universe and our place

922
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
in it, which it would do us well to listen

923
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
to.

924
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And that might include

925
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
exposing human follies,

926
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
human weakness, human pride,

927
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
human sin, human lust,

928
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
the tendency to

929
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
do evil in the name of doing good

930
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
or think you're doing good and do great harm.

931
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So much more.

932
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
All of this

933
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
is in Shakespeare's work and his characters

934
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
and the things he created

935
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
in his mind and his work.

936
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I think that if you look

937
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
at a panoply of a vision like

938
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
that, you should think, I wonder

939
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
what he's telling us. Rather

940
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
than I wonder how I can judge him.

941
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
What's the point of the letter?

942
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It's so boring.

943
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Human being from the past, inhuman

944
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
being in the past, shocker.

945
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Has it always been this way? Has it always been

946
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
people of the

947
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
present judging people of yesterday by the

948
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
standards of today?

949
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Well, most people didn't

950
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
have time in the past to engage in that.

951
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Too busy trying to put food on the table.

952
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Surviving past the age of 25.

953
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
But what it is in our

954
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
current society is there's a very strange

955
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
lack of respect for wisdom.

956
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Henry Kissinger said this in the early years

957
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
of the internet. He said all the knowledge

958
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
is there, but where's the wisdom?

959
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
People might not like me quoting Dr.

960
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Kissinger in that regard, but

961
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
again, he knows a lot more than

962
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
most of his critics.

963
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I do think that's

964
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
a strict oddity of the age.

965
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I think the oddity, the vanity of trying to judge

966
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
everyone from the past by our current standards

967
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
is just absurd.

968
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You think you know more than Shakespeare?

969
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
You think you know more than Orwell?

970
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
These are minnows

971
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
snapping

972
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
giants. I don't care

973
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
for them.

974
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
One

975
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
potentially unfortunate situation is

976
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
that women's mental health

977
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
is in part down to

978
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
misogynistic songs.

979
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
When BTS lead singer Young Cook

980
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
changed to a more misogynistic

981
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
music, a disturbing trend followed.

982
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
A psychiatrist's point of view

983
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
on BTS' Young Cook and the messages

984
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
of pop music.

985
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Early in their teen career, BTS took

986
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
a deliberate stance to refrain from

987
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
objectifying or sexualizing women.

988
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Despite going against a music industry norm,

989
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
BTS achieved huge success.

990
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Now, as part of his solo launch,

991
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
different imagery has surfaced

992
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
in Young Cook songs.

993
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
They include a woman telling her man

994
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
that she will be your fantasy

995
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
and swallow your pride

996
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
to make him never think about cheating.

997
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Lyrics that identify...

998
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You said swallow your pride

999
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
in a particularly suggestive way.

1000
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I've got more to go here.

1001
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Lyrics that identify women

1002
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
as those hoes over there

1003
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
with a male rapper telling his female partner,

1004
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I wanked before you came

1005
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
so that I can fuck you longer.

1006
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Of course, in reality, Young Cook songs

1007
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
are part of the course, or even tame.

1008
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Does that work, by the way, what you just described?

1009
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
You've never

1010
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
increased your stamina by

1011
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
having a warm-up?

1012
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I thought the lyrics were more likely.

1013
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I did that before you came and I just let you go to bed.

1014
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I kind of got a lie down.

1015
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I did that before you came and that's why I texted

1016
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
saying I'm not so fussed about you.

1017
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I don't have a quick dinner now.

1018
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
One of my friends had

1019
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
a rubric for this that was masturbate

1020
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
before you evaluate.

1021
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Oh, well, that's true.

1022
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That can be sensible advice.

1023
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm not sure if I liked you or I was just horny.

1024
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But no, girls, mental health...

1025
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You were reading out these charming lyrics.

1026
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Those hoes over there I wanked

1027
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
before you came so that I can fuck you longer.

1028
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Well,

1029
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
where to start?

1030
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Downstream from K-pop is a litany of female mental health problems.

1031
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
That's what I'm saying.

1032
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
There's a problem here, isn't there?

1033
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Because on the one hand, popular culture does have

1034
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
a massive impact on the way we see the world.

1035
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I was at a gym recently

1036
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
where I actually asked

1037
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
the gym staff to turn off the music

1038
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
because it was a load of

1039
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
rap, a very unpleasant rap,

1040
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
with repeated use of the N-word in it.

1041
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Obviously, it was a black rapper or so I was assuming.

1042
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Right.

1043
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Do you find yourself mouthing along to the lyrics

1044
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and not worried about it?

1045
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
That's right.

1046
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
What problem could possibly emerge

1047
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
from singing along?

1048
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Mate, just to interject there,

1049
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
someone got cancelled on TikTok

1050
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
for mouthing the N-word along to a song.

1051
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Right.

1052
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
It's possible.

1053
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It's no longer the sound of the word,

1054
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
it's the mouth shape

1055
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
that that word engenders.

1056
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Well, we know that it's a magical word

1057
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
in our time, which even the speaking

1058
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
of suddenly summons up the demons of

1059
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
the past. Lord Voldemort, yeah.

1060
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Very, very strange.

1061
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
But, no, I just said to the gym staff,

1062
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I just don't want to hear it because I don't want

1063
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I just don't want it in the background

1064
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
of my life, you know.

1065
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Was it that gym that we trained at?

1066
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
We can discuss this another time.

1067
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But anyway.

1068
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
No, I just don't like, I have certain things I don't want

1069
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
on my ears and that's one actually.

1070
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I have no interest in hearing the word

1071
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
as a banned word. So why would I want it

1072
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
in my mental background?

1073
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah.

1074
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But anyway, the point is, of course

1075
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
popular culture has a huge impact on people.

1076
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It has a huge impact on the way in which people see themselves.

1077
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It does. It does.

1078
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
At the same time, you can overstate it.

1079
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You know, somebody is not generally unhappy

1080
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
just because of the popular culture.

1081
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Apart from anything else because you can easily step out of it

1082
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
as I try to do.

1083
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And, you know,

1084
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
be a part of your time but not be its creature

1085
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
that says.

1086
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And

1087
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
so no, I think it's a sort of

1088
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
weak excuse for unhappiness.

1089
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The popular culture happens not to be to your taste

1090
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
or avoid it. Get out.

1091
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Look up from the screen.

1092
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
When is cancel culture going to come for

1093
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
rap lyrics?

1094
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Because it seems to me that, you know, it's worth fighting

1095
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
against the misogyny of

1096
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
air conditioning temperatures in offices

1097
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
that are conditioned

1098
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
to the male body temperature as opposed to

1099
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
the female body temperature or

1100
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I mean the

1101
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
the levity of the era

1102
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
is just astonishing to me.

1103
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
You know, lots of people

1104
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
attribute to me this quote that I was not quite

1105
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
right. I don't think it's quite from me but

1106
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
that we'll be talking about gender pronouns

1107
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
when the barbarians break in.

1108
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But I've said something like it

1109
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
quite a few times but I mean

1110
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
you know

1111
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
gender norms and air conditioning

1112
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
it's the sort of thing that you would be discussing

1113
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
just before you will get

1114
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
you know machetted.

1115
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I'm totally serious about this.

1116
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It's

1117
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
sometimes it's like

1118
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
one of the things that actually

1119
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
genuinely shocked me in recent weeks

1120
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
particularly after Hamas massacre in Israel

1121
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
was you know and

1122
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
something which I do think at some point when it's

1123
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
all died down a bit

1124
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
might be a moment

1125
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
of

1126
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I've got to say this carefully

1127
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
but a moment of

1128
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
seriousness which is

1129
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
you know

1130
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
take the music festival within a few miles

1131
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
of the Gaza border that Hamas attacked

1132
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
all the young people there

1133
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
were at this sort of peace rave

1134
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
and

1135
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
this isn't in any way to victim blame

1136
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
these are people just

1137
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
wanting to dance

1138
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
and

1139
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
dance into the early morning and

1140
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I think it was called the peace rave

1141
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
the peace and love rave something like that

1142
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and then this hideous

1143
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
other world broke into

1144
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
them and to their lives and ended the lives

1145
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
of hundreds of them.

1146
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
There's something

1147
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
haunting about this I find because it's

1148
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
especially haunting because

1149
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
it sort of demonstrates that

1150
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
your slogans and your attitudes

1151
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
only go so far

1152
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
and they can't keep out

1153
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
some of the things that are lurking at the edges

1154
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
and I think that when I hear

1155
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
people whining about

1156
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
minor things

1157
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
if you have any idea

1158
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
of the world out there

1159
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
if you had any idea of the things that was lurking

1160
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
you couldn't possibly

1161
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
be complaining about this

1162
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
How do you think

1163
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Gaze for Gaza will get on long term?

1164
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Well the joke at the moment is that there aren't enough tall

1165
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
buildings in Gaza to throw Gaze for Gaza

1166
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
off

1167
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
but

1168
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I mean these people

1169
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I've said very often

1170
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
they're part of the same phenomenon as

1171
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
turkeys for Christmas and chickens for KFC

1172
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I mean

1173
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'm fed up with these infringe

1174
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
idiot cases

1175
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
they're so mentally defective

1176
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
for these people

1177
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
and incredibly narcissistic

1178
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I can be queer and also celebrate

1179
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
so no you fucking can't fuck off

1180
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I can both argue for a two state solution

1181
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
and also celebrate queerness and also not let myself down

1182
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
no you can't

1183
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
no you can't

1184
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
you can't do all those things at some point you've got to choose

1185
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I've got a video to show you

1186
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
let me show you this video

1187
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Can someone please explain to me

1188
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
what this means

1189
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
what does reproductive justice

1190
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
mean

1191
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
free Palestine

1192
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
what does that even mean

1193
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
like what does it mean

1194
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm pretty sure

1195
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
abortions are illegal

1196
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
in Palestine

1197
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
unless it's like a super medical emergency

1198
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
and the mother will die

1199
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
from what I understand actually a lot of Palestinians

1200
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
have to go to Israel

1201
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
to get the abortions

1202
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
they want so what does this mean

1203
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
what

1204
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
it's such a huge sign

1205
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
there's

1206
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
five people holding this thing

1207
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
it's massive

1208
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
that's very good

1209
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
that's Danny the other half of Ryan

1210
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
who wasn't there the day that you

1211
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
came

1212
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
reproductive justice means free Palestine

1213
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
what do you think

1214
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
this is just

1215
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
incredibly ignorant young people in America

1216
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
who have been taught

1217
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
this weird

1218
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
version of the world where all oppressions

1219
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
are taken into lock

1220
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
you're either the majority or the minority

1221
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
for minority rights and issues

1222
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
or for majority rights and issues

1223
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
and all minority rights and issues

1224
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
intersect and overlap

1225
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
so that if you're queer somehow

1226
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
no it's not even that

1227
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
these ignoramuses

1228
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
who couldn't point to the river Jordan

1229
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
if you showed it to them on a map

1230
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
walk along the streets of America

1231
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
shout you know from the river to the sea

1232
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Palestine will be free because I think the Palestinians

1233
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
where they've mapped a very

1234
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
specific version

1235
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
of American racial politics

1236
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
onto everything else in the world

1237
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
it's the same thing people who talk about

1238
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
colonizers

1239
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
there's this language

1240
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
of colonizers

1241
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
apartheid all this stuff

1242
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
and

1243
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
they've just tried to map it everywhere

1244
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
actually it's highly selectively

1245
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
highly selectively

1246
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
the people who are talking about

1247
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
colonizers

1248
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
when I saw that

1249
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
the other day on the streets of London

1250
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I thought yes if only there was a name

1251
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
for large numbers of people who came from outside

1252
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
to a country

1253
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
and if only we could identify

1254
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
what they might be called in Britain

1255
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
oh it would be immigrants wouldn't it

1256
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
do you want to call immigrants colonizers

1257
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
in Britain

1258
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
you sure you want to follow this logical conclusion

1259
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
talk about indigenous peoples

1260
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
oh okay great anyway you don't want to apply that

1261
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
might there be a country

1262
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
or a continent say oh Europe

1263
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
where you don't want to start talking about the indigenous peoples

1264
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I notice that people don't

1265
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
but if you do want to

1266
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
welcome to hell

1267
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
so

1268
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
no all it is happening is a very selective mapping

1269
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
of a particular interpretation of the world

1270
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
that very

1271
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
dumb people in America have tried to

1272
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
put on certain selective other cases

1273
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
and it doesn't work

1274
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
but

1275
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
may they never find out

1276
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
how much it doesn't work

1277
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
may they never find out

1278
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I wish them bliss

1279
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
in their ignorance because if their

1280
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
ignorance ever gets popped it will be

1281
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
as brutal a day as can be imagined

1282
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I've been thinking

1283
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
for a good while about how

1284
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
hypocrisy is a purpose

1285
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
built tool for the internet to use

1286
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
it's like catnip for the internet

1287
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
it's the thing because

1288
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
the reason it's so purpose built

1289
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
it's like one of those

1290
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
can you spot the difference competitions on a touch screen

1291
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
iPad this is what's on the left this is what's on the right

1292
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and what you have is here's something that someone once said

1293
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
or a position that they used to hold

1294
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
and here is what they hold now

1295
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
or here is what they do in their real life

1296
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
here is whatever and it's kind of what

1297
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
you're identifying here that you have

1298
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
a worldview which is self-contradictory

1299
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
you're just using different words for one thing

1300
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
that is almost exactly the same for another thing

1301
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
and then complaining about this one

1302
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
saying don't look over here

1303
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
don't look over here yeah

1304
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
everyone is inconsistent to some extent

1305
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
and I don't think by the way

1306
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I mean on hypocrisy

1307
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
for instance

1308
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I can see a scenario where somebody might say

1309
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
oh Douglas you're hypocritical on this

1310
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
particular question I might say well

1311
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
there are some things I think are even more important

1312
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
than not being a hypocrite such as

1313
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I don't know surviving

1314
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
the worst thing about him is his hypocrisy

1315
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
hypocrisy

1316
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
there's a weird

1317
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
hypocrisy is the easiest one to catch people on

1318
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
is the truth of that

1319
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
it's the easiest one to spot

1320
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
you just

1321
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
and they do it

1322
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
as you say on this is what this person said

1323
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
20 years ago this is what they say now

1324
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
get human being in growing up

1325
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
shocker

1326
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
people

1327
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
are allowed to evolve

1328
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
they change their minds

1329
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
it would be rather boring to say the same thing

1330
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
and think the same thing only for

1331
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
70 years

1332
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
but yeah people find

1333
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
hypocrisy very easy to see

1334
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
and it's about the only vice you can really catch somebody on

1335
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I think

1336
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
because if you say one thing publicly

1337
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
and do another thing privately

1338
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
it's about the only one that people are really confident on

1339
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
or most other

1340
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
moral judgments are better or worse

1341
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
of sort of ebbed away but people still

1342
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
are able to judge hypocrisy

1343
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
but

1344
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I think

1345
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
there are worse things

1346
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I think not standing up for your

1347
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
loved ones not standing up for your country

1348
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
not standing up for

1349
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
yourselves in the face of

1350
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
horrible opposition

1351
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
from within without probably worse than hypocrisy

1352
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I heard you say recently you don't have to agree

1353
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
with everyone's principle to respect the principle

1354
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
they're sticking to

1355
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
did I say that? yeah sounds good

1356
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I didn't know I said that but yeah

1357
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
but the reason that I like that

1358
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
is

1359
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I think it shows

1360
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
why

1361
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
the bravery conversation

1362
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
or standing up for something that you believe in

1363
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
is something that is a pride

1364
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
at least then if someone is prepared to stand up for

1365
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
whatever their beliefs are

1366
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
that you can assume they're telling the truth

1367
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
especially if they pay a high price for it

1368
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
it's one of the reasons why I have

1369
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
a good amount of faith that Sam believes

1370
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
the things that he says

1371
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
why would he not? he pays an unbelievably

1372
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
high price to continue to flip flop

1373
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
from one tribe to another tribe

1374
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
to another tribe

1375
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I don't think it's an unbelievably high price but a price

1376
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
relatively high price

1377
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I mean very early

1378
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
in some people's careers or when people first make it

1379
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
to public notice people say things like

1380
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
do you really believe what you say

1381
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
the answer to which for most people

1382
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
is or ought to be well why would I say it

1383
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
if I didn't believe it

1384
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
there are people who obviously do say stuff

1385
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
for lolls

1386
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
or clicks or monetary purpose

1387
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
but at a certain point

1388
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
you've got to accept that the person thinks what they think

1389
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
and you know

1390
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
respect them for it or at least do them the decency

1391
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
of believing that they mean it

1392
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
and I think that even on people I disagree with

1393
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
wildly I mean it's such a boring argument

1394
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
that one some people use it particularly on the left

1395
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I wonder if they actually even believe it

1396
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I think they don't I think they're just doing it for money

1397
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
well that's an easier way to try to ignore them

1398
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
than actually trying to contend with the possibility

1399
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
of what they're saying is something they mean

1400
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
and believe and trying to work out if there's anything in it

1401
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
much easier to say the person's

1402
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
only doing it because they're paid or something

1403
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
yeah that's the

1404
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
shill grifter accusation

1405
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
very boring accusation

1406
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I don't doubt there are some people who that is the case with

1407
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
but way fewer than

1408
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
way fewer than people think

1409
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Michael Malis has a hierarchy

1410
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
of different

1411
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I think it's like the hierarchy of grifters

1412
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
if you say Michael Malis my face immediately

1413
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
sort of starts to smile

1414
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
it's terrible

1415
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
one of the it's like

1416
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
industry plant

1417
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
paid opposition

1418
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
it goes all the way up

1419
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
and he said that he descended recently

1420
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
he's not quite at paid opposition but I think he's industry plant now

1421
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I think Lex Friedman is

1422
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
paid opposition

1423
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
his paid is different from

1424
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
controlled opposition

1425
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
maybe it's controlled opposition I don't fucking know

1426
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
these are such weird

1427
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
terms that are cropped up in our area

1428
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
again I think they're sort of low

1429
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
resolution explanations

1430
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
really really low resolution

1431
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
explanations for things

1432
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
whenever I hear somebody describe things as that

1433
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I always sort of know you're not dealing with somebody who actually understands the world

1434
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
do you find there's a

1435
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
definitely a trend of

1436
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
conspiratorial thinking

1437
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
conspiracism

1438
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
much stronger in our adopted

1439
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
homeland than it is in the UK

1440
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
yes that's true

1441
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
what do you think

1442
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
are you

1443
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
how conspiracy-pilled are you

1444
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
do you see

1445
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I mean it's

1446
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
this is the moment when people say

1447
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
ahhh controlled opposition

1448
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
hahahaha

1449
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
this is me allowing you to graduate

1450
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I think I talked about this on the boys cast

1451
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
that's right

1452
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
briefly and

1453
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
various people wrote to me saying ah there you go

1454
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
that's proof that you're paid

1455
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
you're glowing as it's called

1456
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
you heard you're glowing

1457
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
so

1458
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
tell me if I'm wrong with this Mark

1459
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
you're the resident glow expert

1460
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
but you're glowing

1461
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
means you're like a

1462
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
planted

1463
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
person who's saying

1464
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
something that is outing there

1465
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
like

1466
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
it's an intelligence operation

1467
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
that's breached the surface and people can see it

1468
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
they comment on tiktok saying

1469
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
you're glowing

1470
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
the people that alleged to be FBI

1471
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
who are at certain protests

1472
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
or wearing chinos and t-shirts

1473
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
yeah

1474
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
so you're conspiratorial

1475
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
the thing with conspiracy theories is very difficult

1476
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
in our era because some of the conspiracies are true

1477
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
of course have come true

1478
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
well known to be true

1479
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
lab leak conspiracy

1480
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
theory probably true

1481
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
they shouldn't have ever called

1482
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
nobody should ever have called it a conspiracy theory

1483
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
because it wasn't a conspiracy theory

1484
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
it was one of a set of hypotheticals

1485
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
to explain what happened

1486
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
with covid

1487
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
so a lot of things get called

1488
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
conspiracy which are not

1489
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
they're just hypotheses

1490
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
that should be allowed to remain on the table

1491
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
and that makes a certain type of person increasingly prone

1492
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
to believe

1493
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
that everything that's called a conspiracy theory

1494
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
is not a conspiracy theory

1495
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
and before you know it you get

1496
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
sanish individuals thinking

1497
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
that the moon landings were a conspiracy

1498
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
that we didn't land on the moon

1499
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
the American didn't land on the moon

1500
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I don't know whether the people who now claim that

1501
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
believe that the Russians also faked it

1502
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
it's an interesting question to ask them

1503
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
do you think that the soviets

1504
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
were capable of getting to the moon but the Americans were not

1505
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
the Americans set up

1506
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
like a blow fan

1507
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
and a flag on a dodgy

1508
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
papier-mache set

1509
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
to make it or did the Soviets and Americans both agree

1510
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
to pretend to have gone to the moon but not really

1511
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
have gone

1512
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
none of it makes sense to my mind

1513
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
but I have noticed

1514
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
and it's actually all the literature that demonstrates

1515
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
that there's certain types of mental

1516
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
problems

1517
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
that people have that make them

1518
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
disproportionately likely to believe conspiracy theories

1519
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
on

1520
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
mass

1521
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and one of them is paranoia

1522
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
the more paranoid a person is

1523
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
more likely to believe that sort of thing

1524
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
and that's the observation in my own life

1525
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I've known a number of people who've gone into the world

1526
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
of conspiracy and not come out

1527
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
and they are all people who have suffered

1528
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
paranoid episodes in their lives

1529
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
which adds up

1530
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
so fear and genders

1531
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
as I say

1532
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
it's a sort of low resolution explanation

1533
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
for complex phenomena

1534
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
and I think

1535
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
it's also that

1536
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
conspiracy theories come about and are used

1537
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
by people who

1538
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
and this isn't an original point many people have made

1539
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
the claims about them

1540
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
are made by and large

1541
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
by people who

1542
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
don't understand how unbelievably

1543
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
chaotic the world actually is

1544
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
or can't face it

1545
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
so

1546
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
they can't face the fact that

1547
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
yeah somebody you followed in the newspapers every day

1548
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
all of your life did actually just die in a

1549
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
freak car crash because the driver was drunk

1550
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
they can't bear the idea

1551
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
the world can't be that cruel

1552
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
it can't be that random

1553
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
you want a bed

1554
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
it's got to be coordination it can't be coincident

1555
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
exactly

1556
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
so people who can't cope

1557
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
with the wild frivolity of the roulette

1558
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
table of our lives

1559
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
um

1560
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
always go to the there must be somebody behind it

1561
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
there must be somebody who's controlling all this

1562
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
you're joking nobody's controlling this

1563
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
if anyone's controlling the damn thing I'd want to know by now

1564
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
but of course they're not

1565
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
so it's a very unsatisfactory

1566
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
place to arrive at in your life

1567
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
and by the way

1568
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
my own observation is not very good for people personally

1569
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
because they start to lose agency

1570
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
themselves

1571
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I'm at the mercy of the world

1572
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
and the real answer is

1573
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
the world doesn't care

1574
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
doesn't even know that you exist

1575
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
it is deaf to you

1576
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
the ability

1577
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
for people to hold two conflicting thoughts

1578
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
in their mind at the same time is supposed to be the mark

1579
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
of sophisticated thinking

1580
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
but it does show up here

1581
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
which is the government is both

1582
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
so useless that they can't get anything right

1583
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
and so sophisticated that they're able to coordinate these

1584
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
oh that's masses of versions the Arab world

1585
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
is filled with that the Muslim world

1586
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
is filled with that things like

1587
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I've noticed this repeated on my travels things like

1588
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
um 9-11

1589
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
was an inside job of the Americans

1590
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
to allow the Jews out of the World Trade Center

1591
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
and also yay 9-11

1592
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
good for Osama bin Laden

1593
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
they can do both

1594
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
uh there's a somebody I

1595
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
knew interviewed the father

1596
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
of um

1597
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
the main 9-11 hijacker

1598
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
his name's gone out of my mind I don't care

1599
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
he must he should be forgotten but

1600
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
interviewed the father in Jordan

1601
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
and he was simultaneously capable

1602
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
of holding in his head that his son was a great

1603
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Shahid Amater for Islam

1604
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
and that 9-11

1605
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
was an inside job of the Americans

1606
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
well what the fuck

1607
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
like choose

1608
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
it's I mean

1609
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
do you think your son was an agent of the FBI

1610
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
and also a

1611
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
martyr like hey

1612
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
people do this the Muslim world is particularly

1613
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
prone to conspiratorial thinking

1614
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
because it's a

1615
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
source of flattery to itself

1616
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
to explain why they have

1617
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
created so few successful societies

1618
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
and Bernard Lewis made this point many years

1619
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
ago that the problem in the Muslim

1620
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
world is that there's a they have to

1621
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
find explanations because

1622
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
if you're given the revelations of Muhammad

1623
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
and you're told it's the last revelation ever from God

1624
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
and that you are the people who have

1625
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
received this revelation and everything's

1626
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
going to go great for you because you've got the revelation

1627
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
and then like the Jews you have one

1628
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
country that does much better than any of your

1629
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
countries and you know you

1630
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
can't get the economy of

1631
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
most of your country going at all and you can't

1632
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
provide for most of your citizenry and nobody

1633
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
is coming up the ladder and the economies

1634
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
in the dust and all this you've got to

1635
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
find an explanation for it because like what

1636
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
we were given the revelation and

1637
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
they're doing much better

1638
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
there's massive

1639
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
things like that that sit underneath the

1640
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
movements of our time which

1641
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
maybe billions of

1642
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
people on the planet believe

1643
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
and they believe them because it flatters themselves

1644
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
it flatters the governments

1645
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
who aspire to run these countries

1646
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
or claim to run these countries

1647
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
um yeah

1648
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
billions of people believe this

1649
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
shit. I was thinking

1650
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
about

1651
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
the extremist world view beliefs

1652
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
largely in the west but

1653
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I guess everywhere and I was wondering

1654
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
whether

1655
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
we have finally moved beyond peak woke

1656
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
and a study came up

1657
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
recently that was kind of interesting

1658
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
researchers from change research

1659
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
polled over a thousand registered US

1660
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
voters from 18 to 34

1661
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
a majority of both women and men

1662
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
consider far rightism and far leftism

1663
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
to be red flags in a potential partner

1664
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
76% of women and 59% of men

1665
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
consider identifying as a MAGA Republican

1666
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
to be a large turnoff

1667
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
64% of men and 55% of women

1668
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
say they'd also swipe left on someone

1669
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
identifying as a communist

1670
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
55% of women

1671
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
64% of men and 55% of women

1672
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
swipe left on a communist that's a no

1673
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
55% of men said that listening

1674
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
to Joe Rogan was a red flag

1675
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
41% of men

1676
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
said the same for a woman

1677
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
being into astrology

1678
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
oh well that's now you're going with that one

1679
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
if somebody says what's your start sign

1680
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
date over

1681
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
there's a really famous

1682
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
meme where

1683
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
it's on iMessage and the

1684
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
text says

1685
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
mum

1686
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
what time was I born at

1687
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
and the reply from mum says

1688
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
stay the fuck away from that girl

1689
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
the heart

1690
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
sinks when it comes up

1691
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
it's a question

1692
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
for shame

1693
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
33% of men

1694
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
said

1695
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
for Black Lives Matter it was a red flag

1696
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
if they say Black Lives Matter 14% of women

1697
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
53% of women said

1698
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
it was a red flag if they refused

1699
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
to see the Barbie movie

1700
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
31% of men

1701
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
58% of women

1702
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
red flag if they say there are only

1703
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
32 genders

1704
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
34% of men

1705
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
54% of women thought they identify as a

1706
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
conservative

1707
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
33% of men for they identify as a liberal

1708
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
so next time you're vibing with someone

1709
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
maybe save the podcast recommendations

1710
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
and daily horoscopes for the second date

1711
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
55% of women

1712
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
say that listening to Joe Rogan was a red flag

1713
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I wonder if the species has any

1714
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
future

1715
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
because they can't listen to Joe Rogan

1716
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
or anything else

1717
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
these people are wiping out

1718
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
very significant numbers

1719
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
of potential future partners

1720
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
how weird

1721
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Joe turning up in that

1722
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
that's amazing

1723
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
what happened to all the good old people

1724
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
who used to say I don't have an opinion on that

1725
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
what happened to those guys

1726
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I got pulled in

1727
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
a good bit recently

1728
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
on the internet for

1729
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
not commenting on the recent

1730
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
socio-political

1731
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
furor that's happening in the Middle East

1732
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
and I quoted you

1733
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
pseudonymously

1734
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
and said

1735
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I'm trying to make a habit of something which is very rare on the internet

1736
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
to not comment on something which I know nothing about

1737
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
it's a very good rule

1738
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
and yet

1739
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
it's the rarest

1740
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
thing of all

1741
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
people care about my

1742
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
insights into health

1743
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
and fitness

1744
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
my learnings about

1745
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
social psychology

1746
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
why shouldn't my fiscal advice

1747
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
be important

1748
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
why shouldn't my views on immigration

1749
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
it's much to be avoided that

1750
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I mean in the end

1751
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
you make much less of a dick of yourself

1752
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
if you don't start talking about everything

1753
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
there's

1754
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I mean

1755
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
somebody recently

1756
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
sent me an article

1757
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
a relatively well known person

1758
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
published about the Middle East

1759
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
and near the opening said

1760
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I don't really know much

1761
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
about the Middle East

1762
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
but this is

1763
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
in that case don't speak

1764
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
don't speak and say but

1765
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
if you don't know

1766
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
just agree not to do it

1767
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
that's one reason

1768
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
why there's a lot of

1769
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
television these days in the UK

1770
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
where you can be invited on

1771
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
to debate

1772
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
the total ignoramus who's only there

1773
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
for balance

1774
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
for off-comrelated balance

1775
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
and I just can't do that stuff anymore

1776
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
it's too

1777
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
demeaning

1778
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
that if there's a subject you know about

1779
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
a war that you've covered

1780
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
or covered many times

1781
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
as in my case with Israel

1782
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Hamas wars

1783
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
and Israel Hezbollah wars

1784
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I just can't be sitting there

1785
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
with somebody

1786
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
in a basic way but there's a lot of

1787
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
women

1788
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
who are currently invited on things for balance

1789
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
firstly because they're women

1790
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
secondly because they provide usually a left-wing perspective

1791
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
and that's needed if it's me

1792
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
that's on as well

1793
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
and you know I just is so depressing

1794
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
to give your informed opinion

1795
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
about something you've seen and reported on first hand

1796
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
and then they go to the other person

1797
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
and they go well like

1798
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I think it's

1799
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
why don't I just at home

1800
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
why I could be doing

1801
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
anything else

1802
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
and I've got to listen to somebody who doesn't know

1803
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
what they're talking about whisk up an opinion

1804
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
live on air

1805
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
it's so depressing

1806
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
but masses of people are like that and it's just

1807
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
yeah

1808
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
if you don't know about it don't talk about it

1809
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
it's a very good law of thumb or try it out in private

1810
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
with friends and mates and like

1811
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
try to learn something read a book

1812
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
are we morally obliged to

1813
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
have a take on everything

1814
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
no

1815
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
no

1816
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
most people's opinion doesn't matter

1817
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I mean it just doesn't

1818
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
and I also think

1819
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
the people who spend their time online

1820
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
broadly speaking

1821
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
trying to broadcast out their opinions on things

1822
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
should be told more often

1823
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
doesn't matter

1824
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
doesn't matter what you think

1825
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I mean one of my rules on

1826
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
on any war

1827
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
is

1828
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
to write a try to give advice to a government

1829
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
you know

1830
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
this is what the Israelis must do

1831
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
this is what the Ukrainians must do

1832
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I need to listen to you

1833
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I mean

1834
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
first of all you don't live in the country

1835
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
unless you live in a country

1836
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
be pretty damn sure

1837
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
you should be a bit humble

1838
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
about telling other people about

1839
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
their lives

1840
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
and also like who made you

1841
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
the tactician

1842
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
on everything

1843
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
well it was the same as Covid

1844
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
everyone became a virology or epidemiology expert

1845
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
and then they became a withdrawal from

1846
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Afghanistan expert

1847
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
and then they became a Ukraine expert

1848
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
and now they're all Middle East experts

1849
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
and I just think

1850
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
it should be regarded as a massive red flag

1851
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
that the person in question is

1852
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
normally what's happened is they've downloaded

1853
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
the set of opinions they believe that their tribe

1854
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
should have

1855
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
and that's why the morons marching in London

1856
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
with the exception of the Muslims who just whipped up all the time

1857
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
by the fact that the Jews do anything

1858
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Muslims don't care about other Muslims

1859
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Arabs don't care about other Arabs

1860
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
nobody cares about the Palestinians

1861
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
nobody cares about them

1862
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
can't tell you how little they care about them

1863
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Jordanians loathe them

1864
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
the Egyptians loathe them

1865
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
the Lebanese loathe them

1866
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
they've done nothing for the Palestinians

1867
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
for 70 years

1868
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
and yet

1869
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
whenever the Israelis do anything

1870
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
more Muslims across the west come out on the streets

1871
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
because they hate the Jews

1872
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
and you know

1873
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in Yemen

1874
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
not a peep

1875
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
on the streets of Britain and other places

1876
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
certainly not big protests

1877
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Bashar al-Assad has killed more Muslims

1878
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
in the last 10 years

1879
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
then everybody on every side killed

1880
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
in every war involving Israel

1881
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
since 1948 including the war of independence

1882
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
nobody cares

1883
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
the Muslims don't come out on the streets

1884
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
they don't care

1885
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
the only thing they care about

1886
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
is the hatred of the Jews

1887
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
and it motivates them like nothing else

1888
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
because it hits at the core of their self-esteem

1889
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
they can't bear it

1890
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
and so that one is

1891
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
very interesting to me

1892
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
but

1893
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
there are these fellow travelers

1894
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
who go along with them

1895
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
who have downloaded as I say

1896
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
a sort of pathetic American interpretation

1897
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
of colonization

1898
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
called justice, reproductive rights

1899
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
and try to map everything on

1900
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
and

1901
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
my friend's got a theory called

1902
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Gwinda's theory of bespoke bullshit

1903
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
many don't have an opinion

1904
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
until they're asked for it

1905
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
at which point they cobble together a viewpoint

1906
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
from women half remembered hearsay

1907
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
before deciding that this two minute

1908
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
two minute old makeshift opinion

1909
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
will be their new hill to die on

1910
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
that's very good

1911
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
my friend Freddie Gray at the Spectator

1912
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
he says each time a new big thing emerges

1913
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
which is the Bluffer's Guide

1914
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
to whatever

1915
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
and it usually involves

1916
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
saying things like

1917
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
well they better get this done before the brutal

1918
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Afghan winter kicks in

1919
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
who made you an expert on like

1920
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
meteorology in Afghanistan

1921
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
like what?

1922
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
the Ukrainians have got to make this advance

1923
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
before the dreaded Ukrainian May

1924
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
and I just

1925
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I mean I tried

1926
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
the Bluffer's Guide

1927
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I try for instance never to write

1928
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
about any foreign policy issue

1929
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
if it's about a country I've not visited

1930
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
preferably visited multiple times

1931
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I just

1932
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I can't bring myself to do it

1933
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I find it too embarrassing

1934
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
it's so interesting when you talk about

1935
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
knowing

1936
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
one opinion that a person holds

1937
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
and from that one opinion being able to accurately predict

1938
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
everything else that they believe

1939
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
that mono thinking

1940
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
just proves that you're not a serious thinker

1941
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
well I just

1942
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
it's fairly obvious if for instance you say

1943
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
what's the problem with the big bearded guy

1944
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
winning the women's weightlifting

1945
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I go okay I know all of your other opinions as well

1946
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
and to be fair

1947
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
that probably works the other way around as well to a great extent

1948
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
the interesting thing with

1949
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
most people is where they're slightly out of sorts

1950
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
with their own political side

1951
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
well that's exactly the point

1952
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
that

1953
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
if it's been a long time since

1954
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
you were surprised

1955
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
by the opinion of your favorite

1956
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
thinker or writer or commentator

1957
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
or whatever it is

1958
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
that's probably a reliable signal

1959
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
that they're not really thinking for themselves

1960
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
if you're just permanently

1961
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
it's like an old leather pair of shoes

1962
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
here we go again

1963
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
the covid things happened and I can already predict

1964
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
such and such is

1965
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
opinion on it

1966
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
every single time

1967
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
you know the idiosyncrasies of this person's

1968
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
very very particular

1969
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
worldview

1970
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
well that's because it's not theirs

1971
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
yeah of course it's everybody else's

1972
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
it's outsourced thinking

1973
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
and what's really sad about that is that

1974
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
it means that you're not really living your life

1975
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I mean you're living a

1976
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
pastiche of

1977
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
a prescribed set of opinions

1978
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
that's so sad, I mean it's so sad

1979
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
the wasted energies and wasted lives

1980
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
of people who've just

1981
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
excluded a set of opinions and they're just

1982
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
running them

1983
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
well that's not your life, it's just someone else's life

1984
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
you're just replaying

1985
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
what was that quote you told me about

1986
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
being shunted to the side of the road of your own

1987
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
it's a Philip Larkin quote

1988
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
from a poem of his, yeah it's a description

1989
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
of a couple and he says that something is

1990
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
pushing them to the side of their own lives

1991
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
it's a beautiful line

1992
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
terrifying line, horrifying line

1993
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
should make everyone

1994
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
judge for themselves

1995
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
oh well it means

1996
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
that there's a life that you

1997
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
hoped to live

1998
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
you saw yourself living

1999
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
and you got pushed to the side

2000
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
of it and ended up not living that life

2001
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I think

2002
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
a large number of people have that

2003
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
almost all unhappy people I've met

2004
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
have that feeling to some extent

2005
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
and then you've got a

2006
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
choice of poisons, one of which is to

2007
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
choose the poison of

2008
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
other people held me back

2009
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
another is to face up to the fact

2010
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
that you're in some way a coward

2011
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
or a victim of

2012
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
circumstance or something else

2013
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
but I think a lot, I mean

2014
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
you know one thing that young people

2015
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
can be encouraged to do is to set out

2016
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
the sort of life they would like to live

2017
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
imagine the sort of life they would like to live and the name for it

2018
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
and

2019
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
working it out is sometimes difficult, sometimes not

2020
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
but if you do

2021
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
have that image of your life that you think

2022
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
it should be lived and you end up

2023
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
not living it, that is

2024
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
particularly if you can feel yourself slowly being pushed away from it

2025
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I think that's a

2026
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
terrible, terrible feeling

2027
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
it's like watching your own demise

2028
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
occur second by second

2029
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
fortunately I've never felt it but I definitely fear it

2030
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
where do you go

2031
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
to find

2032
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
or to avoid cowardice or to find

2033
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
resilience or

2034
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
bravery because a lot of the time

2035
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
the easier path is easier

2036
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
and it's the one that's got the least resistance

2037
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
surround yourself with courageous people

2038
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
surround yourself

2039
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
with brave people

2040
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
and that can be

2041
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
bravery of all sorts of different kinds

2042
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
when I turned 40

2043
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I had a dinner

2044
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
which I think you weren't invited to

2045
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
but it's only because you weren't in town

2046
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
if I remember rightly but

2047
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I did get a lot of my favourite people in the room

2048
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
at least and it was interesting that

2049
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
a friend

2050
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
made a speech in which he said it's striking

2051
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
the names of the people around the table

2052
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
but some of whom will be familiar to listeners

2053
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
but a friend of mine gave a very touching

2054
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
speech I was very moved by

2055
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
how noticeable it was that Douglas surrounded himself

2056
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
with courageous people

2057
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
and it was from a very wide array

2058
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
of bits of the world

2059
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
and different disciplines and so on and I was really touched by that

2060
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
because I hadn't particularly noticed that I'd done it

2061
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
but then I realized I sort of had

2062
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
that actually yes I had

2063
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
a massive subconsciously but maybe now consciously

2064
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I wanted to be around courageous people

2065
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
because I think that courage is something that rubs off on other people

2066
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I think it's enormously

2067
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
to be desired

2068
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
to be around courageous people

2069
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
and there might be different types of courage

2070
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
some of it physical, some of it

2071
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
mental

2072
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
so

2073
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
that's one thing, surround yourself with courageous people

2074
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
or at least not cowards

2075
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
not cretins, not the sort of people who just

2076
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
say the same things that everyone's meant to say

2077
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
and so on. There's as many ways people

2078
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
can get out of this non-life

2079
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
that they are being shunted into

2080
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
one of my friends

2081
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
it wasn't a friend at the time

2082
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I just met him for the first time but someone that had been

2083
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
interested in for a good while

2084
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I met in Austin a while ago

2085
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
and

2086
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
he'd had an interesting story and he'd

2087
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
faced a cancellation over the last few years

2088
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
and he'd sort of told me the

2089
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
story and he said

2090
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
he sat on some rooftop

2091
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
later

2092
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
late at night talking about this thing

2093
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
and he was regaling me with the story

2094
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
and he said throughout my entire life I thought I was a hard man

2095
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I like to

2096
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
do man things and surround myself with masculine

2097
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
people and I was into

2098
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
guns and shooting and fitness

2099
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
and friends with navy seals and all the rest of it

2100
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
and he said my entire life I was scared that I was a coward

2101
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
terrified that I was a coward

2102
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
and he said

2103
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
in my darker moments

2104
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I could always hear my better self

2105
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
clearing his throat in the room next door

2106
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
beautiful

2107
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
and then this cancellation thing came along

2108
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
and he said

2109
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
even the people that do really hard things

2110
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
hard intellectual work

2111
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
hard training work, hard physical work

2112
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
all the rest of it

2113
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
there's a difference in the kind of difficulty

2114
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
that they do because it's elected

2115
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
you've chosen to do the hard

2116
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
workout but when

2117
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
the entire world comes to bear

2118
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
on you

2119
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
in a way that feels like chaos and catastrophe

2120
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
whipped up into a whirlwind

2121
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
and he said

2122
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
yeah I

2123
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
that was a genuine test

2124
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
and he was

2125
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
very grateful he said my better self

2126
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
stopped his coughing and

2127
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
kicked the door in and came to help

2128
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
but just

2129
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I could always hear my better self clearing

2130
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
his throat in the room next door

2131
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
the thing with that is

2132
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
the difference between

2133
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
situations

2134
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
you find yourself in that are dangerous

2135
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
through choice and

2136
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
ones that you've

2137
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
been thrust into

2138
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
and you probably know

2139
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
that the consequence of being

2140
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
thrust into a dangerous situation is much more

2141
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
likely to lead to

2142
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
PTSD and things like that

2143
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
than

2144
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
if you choose to

2145
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
and

2146
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I've been fortunate in my life the most

2147
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
dangerous situations I've been in have been ones I've chosen

2148
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
to be in

2149
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
and that's very different

2150
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
but yes I'm glad he found

2151
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
out that he was more

2152
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
courageous than he feared

2153
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
think about that what a beautiful line

2154
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
to be more courageous than you feared

2155
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
you were

2156
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
almost this war

2157
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
against yourself

2158
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
this fear of your own

2159
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
nature

2160
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I mean there's a horrible example I sometimes use

2161
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
but I mean

2162
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
if you're ever mugged

2163
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
for your wallet let alone you're mugged with

2164
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
somebody else let alone if you're mugged with a girl

2165
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
that you were with or looking after and you just handed it over

2166
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
there's like there's several reasons

2167
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
that it's worth handing over the wallet for

2168
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
one of which is like

2169
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
why do I need to risk getting shot for like

2170
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
or stabbed for a hundred

2171
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
bucks and a

2172
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
few phone calls to the bank

2173
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
so that's like the reason

2174
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
to hand over the wallet

2175
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
the reason not to hand over the wallet

2176
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
is are you sure that you're not going

2177
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
to spend the succeeding weeks

2178
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
dreaming dreams of pornographic violence

2179
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
against your attacker

2180
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
and thinking

2181
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
thinking of how you're going to torture him

2182
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
if you could get your hands on him and the brutal way

2183
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
in which you would have revenge if you ever

2184
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
find him

2185
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
it might be easy to just get your head kicked in a bit

2186
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
and are you sure you can live with

2187
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
the version of yourself that is you handing over the wallet

2188
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I said this recently in a piece in New York Post

2189
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
about the people on the New York subway

2190
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
where there's this awful thing you've probably seen

2191
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
where people you know like a woman

2192
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
will be being abused by some maniac

2193
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
fentanyl-addled

2194
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
you know

2195
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
drug addict and

2196
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
people like either look into their phones

2197
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
including men or they will get their phones

2198
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
up and like record

2199
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
and

2200
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I said Douglass is trying to get people killed

2201
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
and I wasn't obviously but what I was saying was

2202
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
where are the men

2203
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
just like stand up

2204
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
and like confront the guy if he's

2205
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
got a woman by her hair

2206
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
and is parading around the carriage

2207
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
and

2208
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
yeah the backlash was like

2209
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
what do you know

2210
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
these people might get killed if they step in

2211
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
but might say

2212
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
yeah but also

2213
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
maybe we'll have a more civil society

2214
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
if people don't think they can go around

2215
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
and do this stuff without consequence

2216
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
um

2217
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I'd like to see

2218
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
far more standing up like that

2219
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I think it's a pathetic position

2220
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
particularly for men to be in to sit there like

2221
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
getting out their mobile phones

2222
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
but you know it's everyone's choice

2223
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I don't exactly know what I would do

2224
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
in some of the situations I've seen

2225
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
you know read about on the New York subway

2226
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
didn't that guy do a thing

2227
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
and now is he in jail did he get jailed for it

2228
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
he's charged he's coming up

2229
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
for trial

2230
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
this is a

2231
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Daniel Needy I think

2232
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
former Marine

2233
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
there was a guy on the subway who was

2234
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
clearly off his head on

2235
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
various drugs

2236
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
was very very violent

2237
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
towards people in the carriage

2238
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
some point tore off his top and was like

2239
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I'm going to kill you or something like this

2240
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
and this Marine at that point stepped in

2241
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
got him into a choke hold

2242
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
was clearly not meaning to do it

2243
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
but the choke hold was too hard

2244
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
and he

2245
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
suffocated the guy and he died at the scene

2246
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
and that man then the ex-Marine

2247
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
is charged with

2248
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I think murder if not I think

2249
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
manslaughter

2250
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
um and

2251
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
he could face a very significant prison sentence

2252
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
there's a lot of discussion in New York as to whether or not a New York jury would actually convict him

2253
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
where's he being convicted

2254
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
in New York right

2255
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
um because

2256
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
you could say

2257
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
that the guy

2258
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
because there's a racial element like with everything in America

2259
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
uh and because

2260
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
the former Marine was white

2261
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
and the guy off his head

2262
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
uh was black

2263
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
there was an attempt of course to put the

2264
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
racial lens on it

2265
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
and we'll see if a New York jury

2266
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
which will be comprised

2267
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
half or so of women

2268
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
who have been on the subway

2269
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
who have probably had unpleasant interactions

2270
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
um

2271
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
will convict this man for stepping in

2272
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
and genuinely think that he meant to kill the guy

2273
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
or just

2274
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
this was like a good Samaritan act gone wrong

2275
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
but it's

2276
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
it's very salutary that

2277
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
that sort of stuff

2278
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
there was a guy in London about 15 years ago

2279
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
he very much haunted me because

2280
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
the fiance the girlfriend did a victim impact statement

2281
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
that was particularly harrowing

2282
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
that they were on the top of a bus in London

2283
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
a guy on the bus started throwing chips

2284
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
like people's heads

2285
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
and her fiance

2286
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
got up to say look

2287
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
mate lay off and the guy stabbed him

2288
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
he died

2289
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
and that's an account and in

2290
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
the wake of a story like that a lot more people

2291
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
in the society will be craven on the bus

2292
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
because they'll have

2293
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
that example in their head

2294
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
and my fear about this case in the New York Marine case

2295
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
is that he

2296
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
the Marine by doing what

2297
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
he did and it going wrong

2298
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
and the publicity it got will stop other people

2299
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
doing good Samaritan

2300
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
100% will have done while it's pending

2301
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
while it's pending so a lot rides off

2302
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
the verdict

2303
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
that's a lot of pressure

2304
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
and in America with a jury when you're on one of these

2305
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
cases where the society

2306
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
could break out in rioting I'm not sure

2307
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
it will for this guy because the victim wasn't enormously

2308
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
um

2309
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
upstanding as a member of the community and had

2310
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I don't think it was videoed or at least they didn't see the

2311
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
quite a lot of it was videoed but he'd also

2312
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
had previous things where he had like done

2313
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
a whole litany like a laundry

2314
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
list of times that he'd been

2315
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
arrested for

2316
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
for violent conduct

2317
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
so he won't be that sympathetic

2318
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
a character but then there are quite a lot of

2319
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
unsympathetic characters who get dragged through

2320
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
the the laundry of racial justice

2321
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
stuff in America and become saints

2322
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I won't name any names

2323
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
but

2324
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
going back to that sort of way you go when you need more

2325
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
resilience thing and the bravery piece

2326
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
what was that C.S.

2327
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Lewis quote about

2328
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
about the times not being optimal

2329
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
oh yeah what's that

2330
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
oh that's one of my favorite

2331
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
one of my favorite sermons ever given was by C.S. Lewis

2332
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
University church in Oxford in October

2333
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
1939

2334
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
um yes I love that

2335
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Lewis was a master of prose

2336
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
as well as theological writing and he

2337
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
um he gave this beautiful beautiful

2338
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
sermon in which he said

2339
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
yes he said um you know the conditions

2340
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
are not optimal at the moment

2341
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
um the search for truth and beauty

2342
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
that our species goes through

2343
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
you know is sort of going through such a trial

2344
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
um but he says the point is the conditions

2345
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
never were optimal they never are

2346
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
he says even those periods of history

2347
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
which which seem to be

2348
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
tranquil

2349
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
like the 19th century

2350
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
turn out on closer inspection to be filled with

2351
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
crises, alarms, panics and all the rest of it

2352
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
he says if

2353
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
human if humankind

2354
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
had put off the search for truth and beauty

2355
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
until the conditions were optimal the search would

2356
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
never have begun

2357
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
and the main point he makes

2358
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
is that

2359
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
um there is something wonderful

2360
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
and unusual about human beings

2361
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
and he says that the ants

2362
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
for instance have chosen their own route

2363
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
they've chosen safety and the security of the

2364
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
hive and presumably

2365
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
they have their rewards

2366
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
but as he says he says men are different

2367
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
and

2368
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
he gives this beautiful list

2369
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I think I can remember it he says

2370
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
they propound mathematical

2371
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
theorems in the league of cells

2372
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
they quote the latest

2373
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
poem whilst advancing on the walls

2374
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
of Quebec

2375
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
make jokes on scaffolds

2376
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
and comb their hair at the

2377
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
gates of Thermopylae

2378
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
this is not

2379
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
panache he says

2380
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
it is our nature

2381
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
fuck that's cool

2382
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
it's true as well in my observation

2383
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
absolutely true

2384
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
well because I've seen people in

2385
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
beleaguered cities many times

2386
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
cities under fire, cities under bombardment

2387
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
cities that are being raised to the ground

2388
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
and um

2389
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
and human life goes on

2390
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
it's an extraordinary thing

2391
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
people continue their studies if they can

2392
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
people continue their family

2393
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
life if they can

2394
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
they

2395
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
they've realized that the conditions

2396
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
will never be optimal

2397
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
they can be better and they can be worse

2398
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
but they're never perfect and I think that the real

2399
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
lesson of what Lewis is saying is

2400
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
and I think it's an important lesson for young people in our time

2401
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
don't put off whatever it is

2402
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
you're meant to do until the situation is

2403
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
optimal

2404
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
don't

2405
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
fail to pursue what it is you think

2406
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
you're meant to pursue in your life until

2407
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
you have total tranquility

2408
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
for instance you know that you have

2409
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
the house or the apartment you would like until

2410
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
you have the relationship you would like until

2411
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
you have the don't put it off until then

2412
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
or until the world is peaceful

2413
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
which will never

2414
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
happen

2415
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
never happen never has happened never will

2416
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
happen

2417
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
don't put it off till then because if you put it off

2418
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
till then it means you'll put it

2419
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
off forever

2420
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
so do whatever you're meant to be doing now

2421
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
start now if you haven't started already and if you started

2422
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
already don't go any slower

2423
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
for God's sake

2424
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
and this is part of

2425
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
the you know the cost of our

2426
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
times I've said this before

2427
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
but part of the cost of our times

2428
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
is the enormous expense of energy

2429
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
on idiotic things that you can do nothing about

2430
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I think we should say to more people

2431
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
don't howl at the moon

2432
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
don't shake your fists at the skies

2433
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
get on with what you're meant to be doing

2434
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
and that will be

2435
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
different for everybody

2436
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
but I just

2437
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I'm very

2438
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
well

2439
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
I'm too irritable to

2440
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
put up with

2441
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
going at the slow speed that a lot of people

2442
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
want to make us all go out these days

2443
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
so

2444
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I

2445
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
want them out of my way

2446
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
yeah I think a lot about

2447
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
the

2448
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
a rise of victimhood culture

2449
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
and it's got no time for

2450
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
it seems to me that

2451
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
an existential crisis is actually a luxurious position

2452
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
to be in because the bottom levels of

2453
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Maslow's hierarchy of needs have been sorted

2454
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
and

2455
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
victimhood culture is so rampant

2456
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
at the moment because the human

2457
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
systems

2458
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
demand for challenge

2459
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
is outstripping reality's ability to

2460
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
deliver it to it

2461
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
all of the problems, most of the problems

2462
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
that previously would have captured the front of our

2463
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
attention have been moved out of the way

2464
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
absolutely

2465
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
our sensitivity to challenge has now

2466
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
been tuned up

2467
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
I think that's true, by the way

2468
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I feel sometimes

2469
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
increasingly like I'm just from a different world

2470
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
than the one we're now in

2471
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
certainly a different society

2472
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
I'm sure it was the same with you

2473
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
when you were growing up but the Britain I grew up

2474
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
in was a place which

2475
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
liked resilience

2476
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I mean we

2477
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
admired resilience

2478
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
we didn't admire people who

2479
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
whined and mulled

2480
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
in fact those are the people you avoided

2481
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
at all costs

2482
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
ah she's a whiner

2483
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
god he's a whiner

2484
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
you know and people said things like

2485
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
you know

2486
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
that's one of my favourites

2487
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
how are you mustn't grumble

2488
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
now I would say well actually I've got

2489
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
stage 4 cancer

2490
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
I'm not sure that's grumbling

2491
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
I know but we talked about it like that

2492
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
people from that generation still say things

2493
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I've offended that generation who's got cancer at the moment

2494
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
she's like oh so boring

2495
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
so boring

2496
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
everyone I grew up with was like that

2497
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
now you might say there's something unhealthy about that

2498
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
but there's actually something healthy about it too

2499
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
and

2500
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
there's something healthy about

2501
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
assuming that everyone has their troubles

2502
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
and so they don't need you to add yours to their list

2503
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
of things to worry about that day

2504
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
and you know

2505
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
cheer people up and encourage them where you can

2506
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
and so on and so they don't bring them down

2507
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
it's a weird sort of

2508
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
self-fulfilling prophecy of

2509
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
pedestalising victimhood

2510
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
that there is a limitless

2511
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
sky on how much

2512
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
victimhood you can claim

2513
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
whereas if your

2514
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
status and your prestige

2515
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
is downstream from your accomplishments

2516
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
there is a limit

2517
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
on how much you can accomplish because you need to go out

2518
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
and fucking do it

2519
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
reality is going to constrain how

2520
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
much impressive stuff you can go and do

2521
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
but there is a

2522
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
ineffable

2523
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
universe of

2524
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
athlete's foot and my gluten intolerance

2525
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
and my chronic flatulence

2526
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
you know whatever else

2527
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
those are things that you can just continue

2528
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
to accumulate like trinkets

2529
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I just find

2530
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
those people boring

2531
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I just don't care for victimhood

2532
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I think it's

2533
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
an undesirable emotion

2534
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
it's a sign of a rather undesirable

2535
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
person

2536
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
but I don't know

2537
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
why we've given into this

2538
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I just genuinely, particularly in Britain

2539
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I'm just baffled by it because it wasn't the country

2540
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
we had

2541
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
when you said your solution for courage was to surround yourself

2542
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
with courageous people

2543
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
if you kind of get this

2544
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
mimetic wave almost

2545
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
moving through where fewer courageous people

2546
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
are around which creates fewer

2547
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
courageous role models which means to

2548
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
yeah, yeah, yeah

2549
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
and you have the thing of men being persuaded

2550
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
to become cringing eunuchs

2551
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
not a good thing

2552
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
well that's another reason why

2553
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
this conversation

2554
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
around the guy in the subway is so interesting

2555
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
because

2556
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
is he

2557
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
really supposed to stand up for the women

2558
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
or is that, is he mansplaining

2559
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
well if he mansplains

2560
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
while he stops a woman

2561
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
being dragged around by her hair

2562
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
well of course the answer to that is

2563
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
there's no such thing as mansplaining

2564
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
or at least it's not very important

2565
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
get on to something more important

2566
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
like women not being assaulted on the subway

2567
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
you know, choose your priorities

2568
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
with the denial of sex differences

2569
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
would lead to the conclusion that

2570
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
that woman can

2571
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
why shouldn't the women stand up

2572
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
why shouldn't they use their upper body weight

2573
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
yes, yeah, to push this

2574
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
fentanyl fuel maniac off this

2575
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
lady well as I say

2576
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
it's a luxury belief that one

2577
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
then it doesn't meet reality very well

2578
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I'm not sure anyone

2579
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
would be very happy if the men in the carriage

2580
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
said to the women in the carriage

2581
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
go on, go on, your turn

2582
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
yeah, we've had our

2583
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
centuries of patriarchal

2584
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
hierarchy

2585
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
there's one that got my goat recently

2586
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
with them

2587
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
it always happens now

2588
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
whenever anything comes up about conflict

2589
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Hillary Clinton was one of the worst culprits

2590
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
of doing this but they always say this thing

2591
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
one of the reasons you've got to stop any war

2592
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
once it starts is they say

2593
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
the first victims of war are women

2594
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
they're fucking not

2595
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
the men are men

2596
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
who do most of the fighting and the dying

2597
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Hillary Clinton's point is

2598
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
well, they're widows and then

2599
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
ah, yeah

2600
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
the poor widows of the men that are dead

2601
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
yeah, actually the British

2602
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
MOD has a thing of

2603
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
there's a special section now

2604
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
dedicated I think thanks to the impressive

2605
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
insight of that military expert Angelina Jolie

2606
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
they have

2607
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
a special bit of the MOD

2608
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
dedicated to women in conflict

2609
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
the suffering of women in conflict

2610
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
why not have a suffering of men in conflict as well

2611
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
such weird priorities our age

2612
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
it's totally unserious

2613
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
this age is so unserious

2614
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
so why you can't help thinking that at some point

2615
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
the maniacs, the barbarians

2616
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
will just break in

2617
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
because we've made ourselves so weak

2618
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
but it's so captivating

2619
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
right, this is what I meant when I said

2620
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
you know, have we progressed beyond peak woke

2621
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
because it seems to me like

2622
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
both the hyper woke

2623
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
and hyper anti woke thing

2624
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
is capturing so much

2625
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
of the attention

2626
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I'm so bored of these people, they're so ridiculous

2627
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
can't spend any more

2628
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
of my life listening

2629
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
to them, I don't want

2630
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
to listen to the slowest kid in the class

2631
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I don't want to go at his or her

2632
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
speed, I don't want

2633
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
to talk to somebody so mentally

2634
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
impaired that they think

2635
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
that we are a

2636
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
weirdly hemaphroditic species

2637
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
or that you can

2638
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
that the clown fish

2639
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
is a useful species

2640
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
to interpret behavior

2641
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
of human beings

2642
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
we can't go at this speed

2643
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
no, no

2644
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
20 years ago

2645
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
at the dawn of the internet age

2646
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
we had hoped that we would get so much farther

2647
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
in the 21st century

2648
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
and here we are with this

2649
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
stupid society

2650
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
slowed down by maniacs

2651
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
debating the first thing

2652
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
we knew boy or girl

2653
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
like no

2654
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
not going at that speed

2655
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Emo Radacanu

2656
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
did an advert for HSBC

2657
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
recently which you may have missed

2658
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
HSBC rewrote

2659
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
three classic fairy tales

2660
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
their book is called

2661
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
fairer tales and it shows that women

2662
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
don't need men at all

2663
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
with financial attitudes shaped as early as 5 years old

2664
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
the new book challenges traditional

2665
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
gender stereotypes, the new book

2666
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
called fairer tales, princesses doing it for themselves

2667
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
reimagines Cinderella

2668
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
sleeping beauty in Rapunzel

2669
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
as successful business women

2670
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Prince Charming

2671
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
successful business women

2672
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Prince Charming is a raised as the main character

2673
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Emo Radacanu

2674
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
read to them, so in the end

2675
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
the princesses didn't need a prince to save them

2676
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
they set up their own businesses

2677
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
saved their money and then spent it very wisely

2678
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
maybe one day you'll buy a tower

2679
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
or set up your own shoe business

2680
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
that's a quote

2681
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
said the tennis player

2682
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
that's the worst

2683
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I read Meghan Markle's book

2684
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
The Bench

2685
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
and that's worse

2686
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
that's worse

2687
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
wow

2688
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
yeah

2689
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
what an inspiring tale

2690
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
fairer tales

2691
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
princesses doing it for themselves

2692
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
have you seen the

2693
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
South Park episode where

2694
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Cartman wakes up

2695
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
he has a nightmare

2696
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
you told me about this over lunch yesterday

2697
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
for the people that haven't seen it

2698
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Cartman has a nightmare

2699
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
he is a diverse black woman

2700
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
his character is recast

2701
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
and all of his friends, Kenny and everyone else

2702
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
are diverse female

2703
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
or trans racial characters

2704
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
and then Cartman wakes up from the nightmare

2705
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
and his mother comes in

2706
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
are you having another dream where

2707
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
once again all my favourite characters

2708
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
in the cartoons have been replaced

2709
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
by definitely diverse women

2710
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
and she goes it's okay Cartman

2711
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
the CEO of Disney

2712
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
isn't hiding under your bed

2713
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
would you check

2714
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
would you check mum

2715
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
okay I checked she's not there

2716
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I'm worried that she's going to come out again

2717
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
replace all my favourite characters

2718
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
with definitely diverse women

2719
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I love those guys god they keep doing it

2720
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
yeah I mean it's the same thing with

2721
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
there was a rather unappealing

2722
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
young woman who

2723
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
was meant to be playing

2724
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Snow White and the new Disney Snow White

2725
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Rachel Ziegler

2726
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
no no no somebody else

2727
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
is it?

2728
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
she said

2729
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Prince Charming wasn't a prince he was a stalker

2730
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
yeah and she didn't need

2731
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Prince Charming to discover

2732
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
that she could be the woman she could be

2733
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I mean this is like

2734
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
sub Barack Obama

2735
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
circa 2007

2736
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
the princess is the person

2737
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
she's been waiting for

2738
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
your sister's keeper

2739
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
why don't they invent new

2740
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
that's what I can never understand with that

2741
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
why don't they just invent new tales instead of

2742
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
screwing up every existing tale that's loved

2743
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
make your boring movie about

2744
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
an inspirational tale

2745
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
of a woman who wants to start a business

2746
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
and then does and has some success

2747
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I mean okay

2748
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
make that intro film

2749
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
and Ram Sack and Rapal

2750
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
pillage all of the storehouse

2751
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
of stories that people liked

2752
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Brett Cooper's playing Snow White for Daily Wide

2753
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
did you see that announcement?

2754
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
what? you don't seen this

2755
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
let me tell you

2756
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Jeremy Boring and Ben Shapiro

2757
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
are doing their own live action remake of Snow White

2758
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
with Brett Cooper

2759
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
as Snow White

2760
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
because she's

2761
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
like West End trained

2762
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
supposedly a very well trained actor

2763
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
who can sing apparently

2764
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
like the triple threat podcast act sing

2765
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
and they announced it

2766
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
the other week it's going to be coming out next year

2767
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
god I hope they'd slay Disney

2768
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
there's a rumor

2769
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
that Disney has had to

2770
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
reshoot a ton of scenes

2771
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
including all of the dwarf

2772
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
scenes because originally the dwarves weren't dwarves

2773
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
they were

2774
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
like a multi-racial

2775
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
just group of different people

2776
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
they were diverse ethnic women

2777
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
it was the southern

2778
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
thing again

2779
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
but apparently

2780
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
this is just a rumor but apparently they've reshot it

2781
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
all of the scenes with the dwarves

2782
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
to CGI actual dwarfs

2783
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
so they've gone full

2784
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
yeah because I know that there was

2785
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
a revolt of the dwarves

2786
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
which is something you don't hear every day

2787
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
there was a revolt of the dwarves because

2788
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
of course dwarf actors who have

2789
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
their equity cards

2790
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
are annoyed because there's not many dead

2791
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
dwarves

2792
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
you'd have presumed that there should have at least been seven

2793
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
plus a stunt

2794
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
actor

2795
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
one to do all seven

2796
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
stunts

2797
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
well you could have 14 I guess it depends how

2798
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
demanding the acting

2799
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
how much logistics you want to spread around the dwarf actor community

2800
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
but the point is that there actually was

2801
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
apparently a rebellion about this because these are some of the few

2802
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
dead cert roles we've got

2803
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
is this not the same

2804
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
the people who didn't cast that

2805
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
people that would say we can only have a gay actor

2806
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
playing a gay man and we can only have a black actor

2807
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
playing a black man and we can only have

2808
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
those people are such

2809
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I won't use the word

2810
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
yeah I mean that again

2811
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
we haven't got time to go at the pace of these people

2812
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
acting is

2813
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
pretending to be other people

2814
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
people will be shocked

2815
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
that most people who play Hamlet are not

2816
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
themselves members of the Danish royal family

2817
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
welcome to the world of make believe

2818
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
a charity shop

2819
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
in Swansea asked people not

2820
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
to donate sex toys

2821
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Barnardo's customers have been asked

2822
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
to refrain from donating used and unused

2823
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
marital aids as they

2824
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
aren't quite the sort of toys we're

2825
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
looking for

2826
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
when they say we want like

2827
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
your old books, your old toys, they didn't mean

2828
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
sex toys

2829
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I think that's a perfectly good policy for a second

2830
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
hand shop

2831
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
customers were reminded of the core rifling through the second

2832
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
door

2833
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
you don't

2834
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
what have they got in here

2835
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
is there a dressing room

2836
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
customers were also reminded

2837
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
that the branch had CCTV

2838
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
so that these items can be traced back

2839
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
to the original owners

2840
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
oh

2841
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
that means that you

2842
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
there's like a

2843
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
what's he called that thing in Australia

2844
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
the boomerang

2845
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
that's a boomerang effect

2846
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
then it's back on your doorstep

2847
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
the next morning

2848
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
why can't I get rid of this thing

2849
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
get it over the hedge

2850
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
but he keeps landing in Barnardo's

2851
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
it's a dildo that will never die

2852
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
thank you for that story

2853
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
is there a lesson we can take

2854
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
from this

2855
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I think just be careful where you put your dildos

2856
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
there's a moral of the story

2857
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
never leave your dildo in Barnardo's

2858
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
definitely not in the bargain bin

2859
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
school in Lafayette

2860
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
has refused to celebrate Halloween

2861
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
because it isn't inclusive while going

2862
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
all out for LGBT plus history month

2863
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
is there much history

2864
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
with LGBT

2865
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
plus gay history

2866
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
I mean there are lots of gay people in history

2867
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
and there is that

2868
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
but it's also what we used to call history

2869
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
there isn't much

2870
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
tea history

2871
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
there's

2872
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
bee history

2873
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I mean there are sort of I'm a bit skeptical

2874
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
about bisexuality but

2875
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
there's a bit of bisexuality in history of course

2876
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
but I mean again these people are such

2877
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
ignorant nurses they never know anything

2878
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
I can't tell you Chris I mean I have to deal with some of this shit

2879
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
and

2880
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
they just don't know anything and they keep

2881
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
it's like the Orwell thing

2882
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
they're so called discoveries as if people didn't know them before

2883
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
and

2884
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
everybody knew most of the stuff that they are trying to bring out

2885
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
and it's just very tedious

2886
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
and again

2887
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
what's happened to the mainstream

2888
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
thing of it why aren't we concentrating on big

2889
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
subjects big authors big historical issues

2890
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
instead of this boring slow

2891
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
pace

2892
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
we're here at ARC

2893
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
and we're going to be attending at some point this week

2894
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I can't remember

2895
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
the question is something about a better vision for the future

2896
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
a more positive vision for the future

2897
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
a better story

2898
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
sorry John

2899
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
what is your

2900
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
how would

2901
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
how do you think that we can begin to

2902
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
tell a more positive

2903
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
story for the future because it seems to me

2904
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
that much of the

2905
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
proposals

2906
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
are quite easily criticized and often rightly so

2907
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
but

2908
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
there's this sort of zero some view of happiness

2909
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
and growth that somebody else's happiness somehow

2910
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
detracts from mine

2911
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
well that's a particularly British view of course

2912
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
very much yeah yeah yeah

2913
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
that guy's got something is because I've not got it

2914
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
he's taking it from me

2915
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
yeah but what's a more positive vision of the future

2916
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
well one would be that we're not

2917
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
facing imminent apocalypse and

2918
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
catastrophe all the time

2919
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
from every possible direction

2920
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
and particularly not ones that people have whipped up a new generation

2921
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
into a fervour over

2922
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I mean I think the green apocalyptic

2923
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
thing is particularly damaging to young people

2924
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I think it's very very bad for their mental health

2925
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
very had very very detrimental

2926
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
to their

2927
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
sense of how they build a future

2928
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
and I think a lot of young people have been lied to

2929
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
about the proximity

2930
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
of

2931
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
global climate catastrophe

2932
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
I mean every time there isn't an actual

2933
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
catastrophe going on in the world

2934
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
our leaders go straight back to the climate catastrophe

2935
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
and the climate crisis

2936
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
they now call it

2937
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
what is happening is not a crisis

2938
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
maybe a problem to be managed

2939
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
but

2940
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
there's a luxury in calling such things a crisis

2941
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
a crisis is like

2942
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
my shoes are on fire

2943
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
that's a crisis

2944
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
not like it's possible that in 40 years

2945
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
we'll need more AC

2946
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
I don't see that as a crisis

2947
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
but

2948
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
so yes

2949
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I think that in general there are several things that are

2950
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
big stories

2951
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
big narratives of people being spun

2952
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
which are incredibly innovating

2953
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
that is they sap energy out of the society

2954
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
you can feel it

2955
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
the hopelessness if you tell young people

2956
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
they're not going to live into adulthood because they're all going to burn to death

2957
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
the hopelessness of saying

2958
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
you can't change anything

2959
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
or that this is the trajectory we're on

2960
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
one of the other ones in the green stuff

2961
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
is the hopelessness of saying to people

2962
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
effectively

2963
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
you shouldn't leave any footprint on the planet

2964
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
including children

2965
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
and

2966
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
just to put one

2967
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
thing out there about the hopelessness

2968
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
of that

2969
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
there's this new thing that many cities have signed up to

2970
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
including London

2971
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
which is a future in which among other things

2972
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
we will not be allowed to move around

2973
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
very much and we will be allowed a flight

2974
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
perhaps every six years I think it is

2975
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
what's this?

2976
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
what's it called?

2977
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
I'm blanking on the name

2978
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
it's this new proposal for cities in 2030 or something

2979
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
the city car has signed up London to it

2980
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
it's one of these carbon neutral

2981
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
fantasies

2982
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
no fun 2030

2983
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
and one of them is that you won't be allowed

2984
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
to fly more than once every X number of years

2985
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
and of course none of it

2986
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
makes any sense because among other things

2987
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
all that means is

2988
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
apart from the fact that the airline industry is destroyed

2989
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
is that what it means is the cost

2990
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
of an airline ticket will be like

2991
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
40 times higher

2992
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
but

2993
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
so they always assume you can do all of these things

2994
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
and nothing will change

2995
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
amazingly you'll be able to put a rule like that in

2996
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
and you won't destroy the airline industry or whatever

2997
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
but all of it is just so

2998
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
anti-human

2999
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
I mean it is so anti-human

3000
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
the aspiration of human beings

3001
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
should not be

3002
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
to be born fight against

3003
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
the patriarchy leave no carbon

3004
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
footprint and die in the most

3005
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
ethically

3006
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
fine manner

3007
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
preferably taken out at

3008
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
a Swiss clinic

3009
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
you know and then like burnt in a cardboard box

3010
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
it's not a very heroic narrative

3011
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
you know

3012
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
and I think that

3013
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
actually we do orient our lives around

3014
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
stories and around narratives

3015
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
and we should not have

3016
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
the

3017
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
unique narrative that I've just laid out

3018
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
we should have heroic narratives

3019
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I mean for instance you know the narrative of

3020
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
the of adventure

3021
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
of life being an adventure

3022
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
that you set out

3023
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
on a path and hope

3024
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
you set yourself out on a heroic path

3025
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
or at least an exciting path

3026
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
you know I mean

3027
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
the counterpoint of the one I laid out earlier

3028
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
of the one you know

3029
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
you don't know

3030
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
the account part of the one I laid out earlier

3031
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
which is the you know everything that's going to happen

3032
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
if you go along this path of

3033
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
things other people have persuaded you

3034
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
to say

3035
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
is well you know where you're going

3036
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
you know everything to say

3037
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
and you know kind of what trajectory your life will be on

3038
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
I say well yeah and there's another trajectory as well

3039
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
and it's the one that I

3040
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
and I suspect you

3041
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
we've got ourselves in our life which is I don't know exactly

3042
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I don't know with that certainty

3043
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
I don't know what'll

3044
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
happen but if I put one foot

3045
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
fairly sure

3046
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
footedly in front of the next

3047
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
and

3048
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
and tread well

3049
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
and

3050
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
orient myself by

3051
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
things like truth

3052
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
sure I don't have the certainty

3053
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
but

3054
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
it's an adventure

3055
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
and it's my adventure

3056
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
your adventure

3057
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
you actually own it and then

3058
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
fancy that you'll actually have your life

3059
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
you can feel proud of what you got to

3060
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
right because you weren't being ventriloquized

3061
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
by somebody else's

3062
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
you didn't spend your life saying things you don't know

3063
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
or mean or believe

3064
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
or just

3065
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
repeating like a parrot

3066
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
in order to keep in

3067
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
with a group of people

3068
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
you shouldn't seek the affirmation

3069
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
from

3070
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
you will live your life

3071
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
remember that the outcomes that most people get

3072
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
are ones that you don't want in any case

3073
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
the average American is

3074
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
obese, divorced and with less than 1k in the bank

3075
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
so

3076
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
doing what everybody else does

3077
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
sounds like a very surefire

3078
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
strategy but the outcomes

3079
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
are ones that you don't want

3080
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
and that can be the case

3081
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
with financially successful people

3082
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
I mean it can be the case

3083
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
with people I often say that

3084
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
people who go into professions which they don't like

3085
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
and again it's interesting

3086
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
some of them are

3087
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
there are ones that people apologize for as you talk to them

3088
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
you notice that

3089
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
normally these days one of the biggest self-deprecating

3090
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
professions is lawyers

3091
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
you say to somebody what are you doing

3092
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
I'm a lawyer

3093
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
why that

3094
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
five years in full-time education

3095
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
three years in developing

3096
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
and normally it's like they think oh well it's not very

3097
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
interesting or something but I think

3098
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
why wouldn't you do something where you went I am a lawyer

3099
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
it's fantastic I love

3100
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
doing this

3101
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
that's British lawyers again for you

3102
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I've seen Americans do that as well

3103
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
my point is they're financially

3104
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
well rewarded

3105
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
and there's rules you can follow

3106
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
on that

3107
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
there are ones I don't understand

3108
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
if you are doing a job

3109
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
that pays you well

3110
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
and allows you to provide you for your loved ones

3111
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
that's worth doing

3112
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
even if it's not your optimal role

3113
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
doing a role that you don't much care for

3114
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
and you're not providing for other people

3115
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
and you don't see any particular purposes

3116
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
that's probably not a good idea

3117
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
or you could go

3118
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
you know that there are other options and other routes open to you

3119
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
that would allow you to also provide for the family

3120
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
or the

3121
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
the bravery narrative is definitely

3122
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
one that I think is lacking

3123
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
and this risk aversion that we have

3124
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
this young people

3125
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
getting their driver's licenses later than ever

3126
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
most commonly living arrangement

3127
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
for men under the age of 35 is still living at home

3128
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
with their parents

3129
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
such an awful stat

3130
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
people going into full-time employment later than ever

3131
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
and I think about you know when we were

3132
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
actually no you are the worst person to talk about this

3133
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
you told me you didn't get your driver's license until some

3134
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
ungodly age

3135
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
but most people

3136
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
couldn't wait

3137
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
they manifest similarly

3138
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
most people

3139
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
17 years old in the UK, driver's license

3140
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I want to be free, I want to be liberated

3141
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
I don't want to have to be asking mum and dad for lifts

3142
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
etc etc

3143
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
there's not a narrative of

3144
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
adventure

3145
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
I think that is important

3146
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
if you don't have a narrative of adventure

3147
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
and success

3148
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
and an idea of what that looks like

3149
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
you know you are disproportionately likely

3150
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
to live a

3151
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
more miserable life

3152
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I think probably both of us

3153
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
to some extent have worked

3154
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
our way out as we've

3155
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
done it and

3156
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
you know trodden a path

3157
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
is not completely clear

3158
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
and if you said to me what are you going to do in 10 years

3159
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I couldn't particularly tell you

3160
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
roughly what I'd like to do

3161
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
but it's not entirely clear

3162
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
it might be if I was in

3163
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
a corporate law firm and hoping to make partner

3164
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
or something like that but

3165
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
the lack of

3166
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
clarity on it

3167
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
should be energizing

3168
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I'd have thought

3169
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
that's what's exciting about it

3170
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
also for

3171
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
the desire for certainty

3172
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
which is also exactly where the conspiracism comes from

3173
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
because it removes

3174
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
random chance from the world

3175
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
and makes everything coordinated

3176
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
rather than coincidental

3177
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
that desire for certainty

3178
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
really dissuades

3179
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
people from going and doing something

3180
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
which has potentially

3181
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
outsized outcomes

3182
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
look at what happens the narrative of

3183
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
leaving home

3184
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
or leaving the village or leaving the town

3185
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
there's every reason

3186
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
not to go

3187
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
because if you go

3188
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
you

3189
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
risk a lot of things

3190
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
one of them is failing

3191
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
and

3192
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
if you go

3193
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
and you fail

3194
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
then you have to go back

3195
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
to where you were from

3196
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
with your tail between your legs

3197
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
and then you can console yourself

3198
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
that you tried it but it didn't work

3199
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
a lot of people

3200
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
even make the try

3201
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
because they think it won't work

3202
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
so they never leave

3203
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
and

3204
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
other people go and they finally make it to the city

3205
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
and that's as a story as old as our species

3206
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
they finally make it to the city or large gathering place

3207
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
and they make it there

3208
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
you know

3209
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
and one of the reasons why New York is a thrilling city

3210
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
is it's filled with people making it

3211
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
you know

3212
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I mean plenty of people

3213
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
who will fail

3214
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
it's very harsh in a way

3215
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
because

3216
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
the two are so close together

3217
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
a millionaires blocks

3218
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
will have

3219
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
a veteran with a sign

3220
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
lying on the street

3221
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
outside

3222
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
and then you get

3223
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
that simultaneous thing of success

3224
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
and the

3225
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
mirror of it

3226
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
of desperate failure

3227
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I don't mean that a judgmental

3228
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
in the case of the Vefa but desperate

3229
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
your life

3230
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
very close to each other

3231
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
and I suspect that both of these things

3232
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
fire up New Yorkers all the time

3233
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
yeah well you're getting to see how far you could

3234
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
go and how far you could fall

3235
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
shown in front of you all the time

3236
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
there's an interesting study

3237
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
by Candice Blake in Australia

3238
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
that looked at

3239
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
wealth inequality

3240
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
and local ecologies positively

3241
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
predicting

3242
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
self

3243
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
sexualization

3244
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
of women in online dating profiles

3245
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
so I think I followed that

3246
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
if

3247
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
there is high wealth inequality

3248
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
women both see the sort of

3249
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
partner they could get in their wildest dreams

3250
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
under their worst nightmares

3251
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
and it positively predicts

3252
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
more sexualized images

3253
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
in online dating profiles and social media

3254
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
and her

3255
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
argument was that

3256
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
it

3257
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
amps up

3258
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
a woman's

3259
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
competitive edge in terms of finding

3260
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
a partner that they think would be able to

3261
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
ensure they don't end

3262
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
up

3263
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
down at the bottom end of the inequality distribution

3264
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
and instead they end up

3265
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
in the clouds where they've seen people's

3266
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
outcomes occurring

3267
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
well of course there are also people who fake it

3268
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
well that's the effective way to play the game

3269
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
I was once in India

3270
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
and I had a guide

3271
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
who I got talking to and I said

3272
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
I said

3273
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
we were talking about how

3274
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
easy or otherwise dating was

3275
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
in the outskirts of Delhi

3276
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
which means the slums and he said

3277
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
the trick is

3278
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
he did describe it as a trick

3279
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
if you meet a girl you like

3280
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
you go for a date with her but you borrow your friend's shoes

3281
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
for instance

3282
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
there will be a friend who has a pair of trainers

3283
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
and you borrow his shoes

3284
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
for the date and then like another time

3285
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
you might borrow a friend's motorbike

3286
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
so like the pool of men

3287
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
helps like swap

3288
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
right okay and the idea is

3289
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
they have one good dating outfit and vehicle

3290
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
between ten people yes and he said

3291
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
the idea was that you get the woman to say she loves you

3292
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
and she'll marry you and then

3293
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
you do the reveal it was somebody else's shoes

3294
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
your shit shoes yeah

3295
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
which I thought was both

3296
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
horrific

3297
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
admirable he told it to me like that

3298
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
and horribly

3299
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
recognizable

3300
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
think of all the people who splash

3301
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
around money in restaurants and things

3302
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
you don't really have it at all

3303
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
pretend to live above their means or do live above their means

3304
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
it's all to try

3305
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
to entrap a mate

3306
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
I think people do a lot for sex

3307
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
yeah I know I've seen

3308
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000

3312
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
I don't know what I expect over the next few months

3313
