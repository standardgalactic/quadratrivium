0	7840	No scientist who actually wanted to retain any credibility would claim that the correlation between rising CO2 and
8160	13520	Rising temperature at this very tiny piece of time is proof of causation
13880	15880	Correlation is not proof of causation
18840	22080	Patrick Moore welcome the show nice to be with you Chris
22640	28420	What is your background? How did you come to be involved in the environmental discussion?
28900	31260	Well rather checkered I have to admit
31260	37260	I grew up on a floating village on the north end of Vancouver Island with no road to that area
37340	40620	It was a west coast inlet. So we were like
41340	43340	Outlanders there and
43820	47260	Everything was by boat the freight came on a boat once a week
47980	50420	to a village of about a hundred people and
50980	54020	in 1965 when the road came finally a
54740	60060	75-kilometer gravel road from Port Hardy on the other side of the North Island
61220	66660	Vancouver Island is the largest island on the west coast of the Americas from Alaska to Argentina
66660	69340	So it's a 300 mile long Island
69460	75100	and I was born on it and still live on it in a slightly more civilized part now
75540	80180	but I have a home on the beach where I grew up so I'm really lucky that way and
81180	87700	When the road came we thought wow now this place is just gonna explode half the people used the road to get out
88900	91700	so we learned something of human nature that day and
92220	95900	I then ended up being sent to boarding school because the one-room school
95900	98660	I went to till grade 8 only went to grade 8
98900	106060	So I was sent to Vancouver to st. George's school, which is modeled after the English public school and
106340	111220	There I excelled in science and particularly life science
111900	117700	Went to the University of British Columbia in an honors bachelor of science in biology and forestry
117780	124100	Which is the industry I grew up in and it's what we have almost on the entire province is trees and
125020	131340	much of which is in parks and much of which is in places where you're allowed to cut them and make lumber and paper and
132020	137940	So I then discovered the word ecology before it had been in the popular press and
139100	147700	realized it was an obscure branch of science going back to the late 1800s which basically dealt initially with soil forming processes and
148300	152300	When you when you understand soil science you understand that all life
152940	158140	emanates from soil on the land that is not it not in the ocean of course
158580	165980	But it it then led me to realize that ecology was about the interrelationships among all the factors on earth
166700	172740	Especially with relation to life, but life is made of rocks and air and water
173260	178660	So it includes those two and all those factors that come into effect
178660	186100	So it's almost like infinity the number of interrelationships there are and infinity is kind of a spiritual
186180	192380	Concept because none of us can actually fathom it and so as an agnostic in my family
193140	200900	My whole family was not particularly religiously oriented. I suddenly discovered religion in a
202740	205920	Non-religious sense in a way in science I
206900	209780	discovered the wonder of the infinity of
210380	212380	life and the universe and
213140	218820	Realized it was unfathomable at a certain level, but that we could know more about it
219260	226900	By studying it and that's where I got my beginnings and then I learned about while doing my PhD
226900	232740	I learned about this little group that was beginning to meet in the basement of the Unitarian Church in Vancouver
233220	237820	to plan a protest voyage against US hydrogen bomb testing in
238340	242020	Alaska taking on the world's most powerful organization at that time
242460	244460	a bunch of hippies and
244460	247380	But we were actually all professionals of one sort or another
247380	254340	It just that of course we looked like hippies because it was the hippie era in the early 70s and we sailed on that boat
255100	257100	12 of us and
257740	262100	John Cormack and his 12 disciples as we called ourselves and
262740	268100	We caused quite a ruckus and got on Walter Cronkite's evening news in the United States and
268540	271900	Help change the course of nuclear weapons
272980	278140	Development it was the cusp of the Cold War when they stopped increasing the number of nuclear weapons
278140	282580	And we stopped those nuclear tests on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians
282860	287180	Then went on to campaign against French atmospheric nuclear testing
287420	293820	France was still detonating hydrogen and atomic bombs in the air in the southern hemisphere in French Polynesia and
294100	300660	The French people didn't even know this was happening because France controlled all the media including Le Mans and we got in
300660	305980	We got this issue in Le Mans for the first time in France and the campaign against that began
306580	308580	domestically as well as internationally and
309500	311500	Oh just
311740	319380	The rest is history. We stopped the killing of 30,000 whales per year in the North Pacific when we turned from the nuclear issue
319820	322140	having one two major victories
322740	325900	And then three four years of campaigning
326580	334860	Against the ocean killing of whales by big factory fleets. It took that long, but we ended that by 1981
335540	340620	Deep Sea whaling was banned in all the oceans of the world by the International Whaling Commission
340620	342620	which is a branch of the UN and
342940	349820	So we lobbied at the UN and we went out on the ocean and got in front of the harpoon. So we had footage of people actually
350660	353500	Trying to save the whale from being killed by a harpoon
353620	359260	that's what made made it and that made us famous and then we started making a lot of money and
359340	363140	Then we hired a lot of people and then we had a payroll to meet and then as
363740	369980	Time went on the left sort of I guess realized that there was money and power in this new
370300	375980	Environmental movement that we had helped create along with many other groups, but we were the only ones at one point
376180	378180	We're talking about Greenpeace
378180	381420	Specifically is the movement here at what point did it become Greenpeace?
381820	386500	It became Greenpeace right at the beginning at the hydrogen test when you went up to Alaska
386500	394060	Yes, when when one of the people in the church basement meetings said as we were breaking up the meeting someone said see you later
394980	398940	and said peace because peace then meant sort of see you later and
400060	402740	Someone's he said why don't we make it a Greenpeace?
403340	406860	And so it started there. So we named our boat the Greenpeace
406860	411700	We nicknamed our boat that we went to it was named the Phyllis Cormack after the captain's wife
411980	416980	but we put a big sign saying Greenpeace on the front of it on the cabin and
418860	422140	By the middle of next well early next year the same
422980	430180	1972 we changed our name from what it had been that don't make a wave committee to the Greenpeace foundation
430180	433420	That's much better. That's much better as it goes. Yes
433580	439660	Foundation wasn't because we were wealthy like foundations are it was because of the Asimov trilogy
440700	446580	About the small group of people on the opposite side. What star what Star Wars is fashioned after
447060	449660	that that took on the Empire and
450220	455340	We were taking on the Empire indeed and succeeded. What about your exit?
456340	460260	My exit was unfortunate, but it was caused by the fact
461300	465420	That as we became more well-known and powerful and political
466340	471580	The we were basically hijacked by the left in the end who were more clever at politics than we were
472140	474140	as that was their game and
475100	477100	So I ended up being the only
477740	480900	Director of Greenpeace International during the last six years from
481540	488380	79 when we created Greenpeace International, and I was instrumental in the negotiations that brought that about
489260	492140	And until 86 when I left I
493140	502020	Was the only director with any formal science education and we were now dealing with toxic waste and issues of chemistry and
503500	505620	You don't need to be a PhD
506100	512740	Marine biologist to know to save the whales or you don't need to be a nuclear physicist to want to stop hydrogen bombs
512900	519340	But if you're going to get into the issue of toxicology and now where they're calling plastic toxic, right?
519340	521700	And calling carbon dioxide toxic
522420	524420	Which is complete BS?
524660	528660	you've got to know some chemistry and you've got to understand toxicology and
529140	532900	Because toxicology is not just about something being poisonous
532900	538540	It's about how much of it does it take to be poisonous which is known as the poison is in the dose
538740	544740	Which is basically the first rule of toxicology such like do no harm is in medicine
545300	551220	The poison is in the dose is and like for example table salt is one of the best examples
551220	559060	It is an essential nutrient sodium chloride right with chlorine in it is an essential nutrient you die without it
559060	565460	That's why Gandhi made salt at the sea so they didn't have to pay a tax on something that was essential for life
566100	569180	well at a certain point it
569580	574740	Gets to be too much and if you actually ingest four or five tablespoons of
575620	577620	Table salt all at once
577900	585340	You're likely to die because it becomes toxic at those higher levels and you also have you at four or five tablespoons
585580	587820	Sitting on the counter isn't harmful to you
588180	590860	It's only harmful if you're exposed to it
591260	594100	So there's a lot of issues in toxicology
594660	601580	That just got ignored in the whole thing and then suddenly I find my other five directors in Greenpeace
602580	608780	Agreeing that we should have a campaign to ban chlorine worldwide that would be our next big campaign and
609500	615060	It was based on the fact that chlorine was a constituent of dioxins DDT and
615860	617860	Other chlorinated hydrocarbons
619020	622140	Chlorinated hydrocarbons are a very common group of
623460	630300	Molecules because carbon is the basis of life and chlorine is essential as in sodium chloride salt
630580	635540	So there's lots of chlorinated hydrocarbons around and not all of them are toxic
636060	639140	At at at low levels and some of them are
639900	642620	But banning chlorine specifically
643140	645140	Was such a stupid idea
645380	650380	Seeing as though it is the most important element for public health adding it to drinking water
650700	654820	Swimming pools spas as we use bromine also these days
654900	660780	There was a time when iodine which is another one of the halogens in that group along with chlorine
660780	666980	Was the most important thing in your in your medicine cabinet as it was when I was a child if you got a cut
666980	669540	You put iodine on it to stop infection
669540	678940	And so there's that reason for chlorine the other reason is that 85% of our pharmaceuticals are made with chlorine chemistry and
679460	685540	25% of them actually have chlorine in them if you look at the ingredients in your cold or flu medicines
685540	690820	Just for an example, you'll see a little cl after a lot of them. That's chlorine
691220	693500	so at a purely
694500	701020	Scientific perspective, I couldn't stay in a group that was going to launch a campaign to ban chlorine worldwide
701060	704420	But that was just the sharp end of the stick for some years
705340	713620	After a long evolution 15 years for me from the beginning of being involved in the beginning of the environmental movement or the modern environmental movement
714620	719380	We actually had a fairly strong humanitarian orientation in the early years
719380	722620	we were trying to save civilization from all out nuclear war and
723140	725620	So that must means you care about people as
726620	729860	Well as the environment which was the green part of Greenpeace
729860	738020	But the peace part of Greenpeace was to end nuclear war or the threat of nuclear war and we did a pretty good job of helping with that and
738780	743220	But by the time I had to leave the environmental movement
743980	746980	Now controlled largely by the political left
747740	752180	Had basically changed the tune to humans are the enemies of the earth
753340	759940	Humans are the enemies of nature as if we are the only bad or evil species on the planet
759940	764740	And everything else is either benign or good or whatever you want to say, but they're not evil
765020	771060	Right just so this is original sin reinvented for environmentalism as it is in
771820	775540	extreme Christianity and I suppose other religions
775540	780180	I don't know much about other ones, but I do know that in Christianity
780180	785100	There's a wing of it that considers humans to be born with evil in them
786820	792100	Not that they don't have some good in them, but I don't believe that one iota
792100	798620	I just think we're it's not even an irrelevant thing to discuss. Why do you think that transition happened?
799100	804620	From it being about peace to this Alex Epstein calls it human racism
805260	812420	Yes, it's the same reason why Americans now think America is evil even though they are Americans
814100	817860	I it's self loathing is another way of expressing it
819140	821140	It is a deeply
823140	829300	Destructive mental condition to believe that you are evil even when you're good and
831180	833820	So I what it is. So why is it?
834620	838300	Why did it happen fear of death? I think is at the root of it
839300	841300	That's why doomsday
842460	848660	Predictions are made throughout history is because people believe that when they die the world will end
848940	851500	Because they think they're so bloody important or something
851500	852580	I don't know what it is
852580	860060	But it is it is the fear of owns one own one's own death projected on the universe or or on the world
860540	864300	End times apocalypse they keep saying it's going to happen
864300	871180	They've been saying it for 10,000 years or more this little guy standing on a street corner with a sign saying the end is near
871260	873020	Well, they used to say the end is nigh
873020	876340	But I think that's an English term that nobody knows what it means anymore
876660	881440	But the end is near right and that's what aOC is saying and that's what
882340	889340	Greta is saying and that's what the ice IPCC is basically saying. That's what the World Economic Forum is saying
889340	892980	That's what Biden is saying. They're all saying the end is near
893700	899220	Because of climate change now now it used to be because of the devil or witches or something like that
899220	905700	But now it's because of climate change that the end is near and I'm sure it's a projection of one's own fear of death
906140	910820	One of the reasons I'm sure of that is that I don't think that way and I'm not afraid of my own death
910820	918540	I have absolutely no fear of it because there's one thing that you must do in life is not to worry about things
918580	923700	You can't do anything about because then you'd be worrying about way too many things and you'd never get anything done
923700	928220	and so I only worry about things that I can do something about and
929180	935340	As as far as I can see I can't do anything about the fact that I have a
936420	941100	Short life on this earth short meaning under a hundred years or so
941460	943460	it definitely does feel like
944420	946420	there's a narrative at the moment of
947420	949420	human racism of
950100	951820	the
951820	959420	descriptions of humanity being a scourge on the earth people are made to feel guilty about the cars that they drive or the flights that they take or
959540	962620	You know, you have Greta Thumberg going back from conferences on a
963340	966900	Rowing boat and it's taken a six months to get back across the Atlantic. I
968140	970140	Don't know I
970420	972420	Think I'm unconvinced that
973140	974780	all of this
974780	976780	Can be attributed to
976780	979540	The denial of death, you know, Ernest Becker might agree
979540	983460	But I'm not sure that all of it could be but I don't know where else it could come from
983460	988180	It's definitely a you know fear is a very good control mechanism for people. So there are other
990060	992140	There are other powers at play there
992300	997220	However, I don't understand why people would take it and imbibe it themselves and then start to push it back out
997460	1000660	Because if it's something that is that makes you feel uncomfortable
1000660	1005340	I even most people tend to shy away from it, but it really does feel like
1006100	1009420	People have become their own torturers with this, you know
1010060	1011340	It's almost
1011340	1017420	Part for the course that humans are damaging the earth that we're causing harm and that we shouldn't be here
1018620	1021740	You said it and I I too
1022140	1027500	Don't know if I have the whole picture, but I think that's part of it now fear and guilt
1028460	1031460	You see those are the two that when they're combined
1032220	1038380	Are so powerful in controlling people the way I put it is you're driving your SUV down the road
1038460	1040980	You're afraid that you were killing your grandchildren
1041940	1048580	By putting out the toxic co2, which is actually the main food for all life on earth why they can't get that
1048580	1054780	I don't know but it is it is a fact and it is not toxic
1055780	1062580	Etc. But there is a fear and then that makes you feel guilty because you're killing your grandchildren
1062820	1068140	right so fear and guilt that's why I call the chapter in my book climate of fear and guilt and
1069660	1075380	Michael Crichton used the word fear in his book on climate change as well. I
1076380	1081180	Forget the whole title, but the word fear climate of might have been climate of fear, but
1082620	1084620	the the the fear
1084820	1088100	That is put into people about the end times, you know
1088100	1096540	And if people would just think straight they would realize that people have been predicting the end times since practically the beginning of time
1096540	1100540	And they have never once been right
1101180	1103180	They are batten zero on
1103860	1109340	End times right so why should we believe the new end times story?
1109980	1114140	Well because this one's backed up by science and it's got all of these people around the world
1114140	1121660	They all agree with each other. There's research. There's studies that have been done and you have 80% of scientists say that climate change is real
1122500	1123700	well
1123700	1127820	This is because lying has become acceptable to a lot of people
1128140	1130140	bald-faced lying
1130260	1135500	It the 80% thing or the 97% thing is a lie
1136020	1139700	It's been shown to be a lie in the they you know
1139700	1144860	This one study that said it was 97% done by a psychologist from Australia
1145380	1150100	And not a sign not really a scientist. That's a soft science at best and
1151060	1158900	He came up with this 97% number when analyzed and this Christopher Moncton was involved in this reanalysis
1159740	1163260	along with a couple of other really smart people on numbers and
1163980	1171260	Statistics and it turns out to be 0.3% not 97% who actually in their paper
1172980	1174980	Declared that humans
1175860	1178860	Will cause a climate disaster basically
1179380	1182660	Many of them said humans have a role in climate change
1183260	1185260	But they didn't say it was going to be a disaster
1186260	1187620	so
1187620	1192660	That if you break down what people actually said or even inferred
1193460	1200100	You will not find that many climate scientists who will outright come out and say this is a climate emergency
1200820	1204520	The scientists are hiding behind the politicians who fund them
1205660	1213460	That's where they get all their money. They get their money from politicians through bureaucrats in the deep state in the United States
1213460	1219980	I don't know what you have as equivalent to the deep state, but having watched Boris rise to fame
1219980	1223620	I can't fathom what caused that
1224180	1229740	So it must have been some kind of weird political good hairdo. That's what that's what yeah, right
1230900	1232900	Let's not talk about that anymore
1233660	1241380	Is my attitude towards it because I just watched these things somebody came out today and said that polar bears are inbreeding
1241900	1247220	Right and that's because there's not enough ice for them to find each other anymore. Is that same? Oh
1248100	1250100	Yeah, right
1251540	1257620	That's so weird is that true that it well first what is inbreeding, right?
1258420	1264740	Is it beyond cousins or second cousins anything closer than that genetically? That's our definition of it
1264740	1271620	Yes, but in plant breeding for example and animal breeding in breeding is commonly used in
1272100	1275620	In order to maintain characteristics that are desirable
1275780	1281700	But I've seen I've seen tigers that have got down syndrome from too tight inbreeding
1283700	1289620	Yes, but inbreeding is absolutely necessary like you're not going to start breeding with snails
1290260	1292260	right so
1292260	1294260	How far out does it go?
1294340	1298500	Well, it needs to be within your own species, but not within your own hereditary genetic pool
1298820	1303940	Yeah, but it should it should always be someone of another race, right because that's the most outbreeding you can get
1304660	1308100	Right, it should never be anybody in your own race because that's inbreeding
1308980	1313380	You see inbreeding and outbreeding are flexible terms in that sense
1314180	1316180	There's extreme inbreeding
1316500	1318500	And there's extreme outbreeding
1319540	1320820	right
1320820	1322820	If you outbreed you water down
1323380	1326100	The genetics if you inbreed you concentrate them
1326980	1332340	A combination of those two things is always essential in species evolution
1333460	1334660	and
1334660	1340340	So therefore they're just using the word inbreeding as a political term rather than a scientific term
1340820	1343380	There because inbreeding is bad period
1343860	1344900	Right
1344900	1349540	That's that's how they're getting away with that and the idea that they aren't finding enough of each other
1349860	1354740	The the population of polar bears has grown by four or five times since the treaty
1355140	1357220	Do you know about the treaty on polar bears?
1357620	1365700	So you do but nobody else does because they never mention it. They never mentioned that in 1973 on the advice of wildlife biologists
1366180	1372260	Because too many people were now able to go to the Arctic in planes and hire Inuit guides and get polar bear rugs
1372900	1378980	There were too many people doing that it was had become too easy and rich people were able to easily do that
1379700	1383380	So the polar bear population was declining due to over hunting
1384100	1392020	So the all the nations with polar bears signed a treaty international treaty to and the unrestricted hunting of polar bears
1392180	1394180	In other words, there had been no restrictions
1394580	1398260	On killing polar bears up till then because there didn't seem to need to be any
1398500	1401780	Because there was lots of polar bears and hardly anybody ever went up there and killed one
1402100	1405540	Besides which they're really mean and horrible and they'll kill you if you don't watch out
1406100	1410260	But with a high powered rifle the odds are turned in your favor
1411220	1417860	So they signed that treaty and since then the polar bear population has grown from somewhere between six to 10 000
1418340	1420500	to somewhere between 30 and 50 000
1421220	1422740	those are the
1422740	1426420	accepted figures by all the people involved in this except for
1427220	1431940	Uh fakers, which are not scientists, right? They're political activists
1432980	1435060	Give me your thoughts on extinction rebellion
1435620	1441060	They're really really stupid and bad
1442820	1445220	Elaborate on your thoughts about extinction rebellion
1447140	1453060	Well, because you you come from right you come from greenpeace co-founder of greenpeace and extinction rebellion
1453700	1459780	There there seems to be people could see some sort of lineage or progression or connection, you know, it's an environmentalist movement
1460340	1463780	No, there's no lineage or progression. We didn't dress up like cult
1464660	1467620	teams of a cult movement like all dressed in
1468100	1473940	Really stupid looking red uniforms that are somewhere but across between the inquisition
1474660	1477220	and uh a cartoon uh
1478580	1482820	And spraying blood on buildings and this sort of thing actually
1483540	1487220	I signed off when people started chaining themselves to other people's stuff
1489940	1491940	Peace peacefulness pacifism
1492420	1494420	Is non-violence, right?
1494820	1496820	but
1496900	1502340	It doesn't include inciting other people to violence against you. That is not pacifism
1503060	1505060	in other words
1505060	1511700	By you making the first blow or you chaining yourself to someone's tractor who is trying to make a living with it
1512660	1514660	That is not peaceful
1514660	1515860	And yet
1515860	1520820	They they were basically saying that anything short of killing the other person is peaceful
1521060	1523940	Almost, you know, it it's not peaceful
1524500	1530100	To interfere with other people's livelihoods in a way that threatens their livelihood. That's not peaceful
1530100	1536260	But they think that they think that this is a really important and just worthy cause they need to get attention and people aren't looking
1536260	1538260	So they need to do more
1538260	1540260	So why don't they go with the Taliban?
1540820	1545940	That would be good. They then they'd have machine guns and they could kill anybody they wanted and have mass murder
1546900	1551620	To destroy the human race, you know, that's more or less what they're
1552740	1554740	Recommending as far as I can see
1554740	1558100	Uh, so I think they are I think they are evil
1558740	1565380	There are good people and bad people and people that are sort of in between like actually most people are a little bit good and a little bit bad
1566020	1568020	But these people are evil
1568020	1574180	That's what I think of extinction rebellion. What about Greta Thunberg the other one of the other horsemen of the
1574420	1576420	environmental apocalypse
1576900	1582820	Yeah, well, it's funny that people didn't notice right away that she is a young girl with pigtails
1583540	1586580	Because uh, that's what Stalin and Mao
1587220	1589700	And hitler all used young girls
1590340	1591860	with pigtails
1591860	1594500	In their photographs that's all been well documented
1595060	1598820	um, I don't know what the pigtails has to do with it, but uh
1599540	1601300	dictators all
1601300	1604500	Often it seems almost always use children
1605620	1608500	As as a front to make it look as though
1609380	1610660	They're nice
1610660	1615540	I suppose. I'm not sure what they're Danish though. Is there someone someone in Denmark sending her over
1615700	1619460	Is there some totalitarian leader in Denmark trying to get Greta Thunberg to?
1620660	1625220	No, the movement is totalitarian right and the movement the movement controls her
1625940	1631220	Uh, green she she's she's there's all kinds of photographs of her on trains with the head of Greenpeace
1631940	1635220	Etc. I mean and and of course Al Gore and
1635940	1637940	The list is endless
1638180	1641140	And her speeches are written for her obviously
1642020	1646100	And she doesn't know anything much about climate change or science
1647220	1649620	So what what is she then she's simply a tool?
1649620	1654740	Right. She is just a tool nothing more. She is not a wise person
1656340	1658340	Telling us what we should be doing
1658660	1665780	She is being used by Hollywood actors and phony politicians like Al Gore
1666660	1670100	Uh, none of none of whom actually have any science
1670740	1673940	What scientist is behind Greta Thunberg?
1675140	1677140	Thunberg I should say
1677700	1682020	It sounds like you've got a problem with the delivery mechanism, especially for
1682180	1687220	Extinction Rebellion and I can absolutely agree with you there. I don't think that going and
1687940	1693540	Hammering and chiseling the front door of banks or trying to erect structures in the middle of London Bridge
1693540	1698740	I don't think that that's a a fantastic way to get people on side simply from a human psychology perspective
1698740	1704100	If you want to compel people to be a part of your cause you need to convince them not terrorize them
1704180	1706180	Terrorize them that being said
1706580	1711380	Yeah, yeah, but I mean gluing your breasts to the street for example. Has that happened?
1712100	1714100	Yes gluing gluing
1714660	1717220	Your breasts what like so lying face down
1717700	1722820	And and gluing your breasts to the concrete so that you can't be moved so that you're blocking the traffic or whatever
1722980	1724020	Okay, right
1724020	1729460	So that that's the kind of thing they do and I agree that it's very sensational and everything
1729860	1734180	But it has absolutely nothing to do with the issue whatsoever whatever the issue is
1734180	1738900	I don't even know what their issue is. Is it that humans are should be exterminated?
1739300	1741620	It seems to be that would be basically their issue
1742260	1743060	and
1743060	1748260	So I recommended that a man glue his penis to the top of a of a
1749060	1751060	subway car
1751300	1754920	And somebody did a cartoon of it on twitter as a result of my suggestion
1760100	1762740	Right, so as you can disagree one of the five
1763540	1765780	Unacceptable words either no no
1766740	1771700	You can disagree with their methods, but there is an awful lot of
1773940	1780420	Well-known people who appear to have credentials saying that we are in a climate emergency, which we are aren't we?
1781940	1783940	No, we are not
1784180	1786180	in a climate emergency
1786820	1790420	I don't know people say to me well all you have to do is look outside
1791780	1793780	To see that it's a climate emergency
1793780	1799460	I I'm looking outside and I see a beautiful green mountain with a glacier on top of it where I live
1799940	1804420	And a whole mountain range right next to me and the whole of vancouver island is as healthy as can be
1804820	1809620	And yet they say it's been stripped mind of all its trees. No, it has not
1810180	1812660	What do you think they mean when they say climate emergency?
1813060	1815060	I
1815620	1821140	Think they mean the end times are coming. It's just another way of saying we're all doomed
1822580	1824580	Right because if there was an emergency
1824820	1827380	It means that if you don't do anything about it, you're doomed
1827700	1833540	We got upgraded right it was climate crisis and then within the last couple of years it is now climate emergency
1834180	1838820	Precisely, and I can't imagine what more extreme word they could now invent
1839380	1841380	after they've come from
1841380	1842580	you know
1842580	1849780	Crisis to emergency change crisis emergency. Yeah, there isn't you are right. There isn't much left, but there's there's so many
1850660	1852260	differing
1852260	1855620	Critiques around what the impact is that humans have had on the planet
1855620	1860820	So the world getting too hot for instance increases in the temperature. That's something that's happening. Is it not?
1862500	1868420	The world has been warming ever so slightly since about 1700 when the little ice age
1868900	1871540	Stopped getting colder and started getting warmer
1872180	1878660	There have been these thousand year cycles for the last 6,000 years of the interglacial period known as the Holocene
1879060	1882500	Which we are in now, which is about 12,000 years long
1883140	1887940	Since we emerged from the last major glaciation which peaked 22,000 years ago
1888260	1895300	Which was one of 45 major glaciations that have occurred during the place to see an ice age over the last 2.6
1895780	1901380	million years, which is the first ice age in 250 million years since
1901860	1903860	The previous ice age
1904180	1907220	Ended after a hundred million years
1907940	1911780	From 350 million years ago to 250 million years
1912660	1916420	There was another ice age the previous one to this one
1916900	1920420	Since the last 250 million years until recently
1920980	1923620	Which was 2.5 million years ago
1924500	1927540	It was warmer than it is now at all times
1928900	1933060	It is now colder than it has been even in this interglacial period
1934260	1936260	During this place to see an ice age
1936660	1939140	Which has gone up and down and up and down and up and down
1939700	1947220	In cycles of 41,000 years for the first 1.6 million years and in cycles of 100,000 years for the last
1947860	1952020	1 million years in concert with the two molankovitch cycles
1952660	1957300	Related to the tilt of the earth changing and the orbit of the earth changing shape
1958340	1963300	This is caused by the gravitational attraction of jupiter on our earth
1964500	1969220	And so these people want us to think that the world began in 1850
1969860	1971860	When we started using fossil fuels
1972580	1978980	But for 150 years before that it was also warming and during one of those warming spurts because
1979380	1982100	When the earth warms it just doesn't warm continuously
1982340	1986900	It goes up and then down and then up and then down and then up and then down but net warming
1987540	1992260	Net cooling looks like this down and then up down and then up down and then up
1992740	1995140	There's cycles within cycles within cycles
1995620	1997860	We understand very few of these cycles
1998580	2002500	We certainly don't know what causes the onset of an ice age
2002980	2007780	Such as the one we are in now and we have no idea when it will end
2008180	2011780	Because actually at the bottom level it is still getting colder
2012580	2014580	And until we came along
2015700	2017700	Only 150 years ago
2018260	2022340	We started restoring a balance to the global carbon cycle
2022740	2028740	By putting some of the carbon back into the atmosphere that had been taken out by life
2030020	2035940	And drawn down co2 to the lowest level it has ever been in the history of the planet
2036020	2038020	Which is 4.6 billion years
2038660	2040500	So when was the lowest?
2040500	2043300	22 million years 22,000 years ago
2044020	2047060	co2 sank to 180 parts per million
2048100	2051140	Due to the cooling of the glaciation
2051700	2055700	Causing the oceans to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
2058500	2061940	Liquids hold more gas when they're cold and when they're warm
2062740	2064980	Air holds more humidity
2065940	2067940	In other words gas
2068580	2071780	When gaseous forms of what can be liquids
2072260	2077460	Holds more of it when they're warm like warm air holds more water than cold air does
2077460	2082100	That's why fogs form when the air cools because it condenses. So it's the exact opposite
2083060	2084180	water
2084180	2088260	And in particular holds more gas when it's cold
2088820	2090820	So when the earth cools
2091140	2095460	The oceans absorb co2 from the atmosphere and the the total co2
2095540	2099860	There's nearly 50 times as much co2 in the oceans as there is in the atmosphere today
2100260	2102260	That wasn't always the case
2102260	2106420	Because the atmosphere had a lot more co2 in it in the past
2106900	2109220	Going back 200 million years
2109940	2111940	It had about 2,000 ppm
2112820	2115620	Today it's 400 because of our
2116900	2120500	Increasing it from when we came along it was 280
2120820	2124820	So you do agree that we as humans have had an impact on the climate
2126420	2130180	No, just producing co2 doesn't mean you're having an impact on the climate
2130500	2133860	The primary impact of increased co2 is more plant growth
2134500	2138900	And that's called the greening of the earth and nasa has verified this with
2139620	2145060	Maps on the internet and so has csiro in australia, which is the one they're the one that broke it
2145700	2150180	in in 2014 or I think it was
2151140	2154820	When they showed a map showing up to 30 increased photosynthesis
2155300	2160340	Due to increased co2 in the atmosphere. So that is the main known fact
2160900	2164020	From what has happened as a result of more co2 in the atmosphere
2164340	2170980	There is zero evidence that the co2 increase in the atmosphere is the cause of rising temperature
2171700	2179940	None whatsoever because it was already rising as I was about to say during the first 150 years of rising out of 1700
2181220	2184500	There was a period of over 40 years
2185140	2191460	Where the temperature increased more and faster than it has done since 1850
2192980	2200500	Especially since 1950 when we were actually starting to put a significant amount more co2 in the atmosphere post war
2201700	2203220	And today
2203220	2207700	It's exponential. There's a wonderful graph. It's in my book which shows
2208660	2210900	The temperature record in central england
2212340	2218900	From 16 60 or so when the first first thermometer existed. So this is this is the longest
2219620	2225140	thermometer record of temperature in the world because they were invented in england
2226100	2233620	And so that shows a very steady continuous rise in temperature of a little over one degree celsius
2234340	2236840	in 320 years
2237700	2239700	It's not a big deal
2240260	2246500	Certainly compared to previous like they they keep saying it's never gone this fast. It's never risen this fast
2246820	2252020	That is a lie. It has risen this fast many times in the even recent past
2252420	2257060	Especially from about 1690 to about 1730
2258180	2262420	It rose faster and longer than it ever has done since
2263220	2270260	It's all in the record. Now, they'll say, oh, that's just a local measurement. Well, all measurements are local measurements
2270820	2274980	But not if you aggregate them across multiple, right? No, that's called the climate
2275300	2281380	If you aggregate them across global except global is really badly skewed by there being by far the most
2282100	2288420	Measuring centers in north america and europe and hardly any in many other places, especially africa. So
2289380	2294820	It even that is skewed badly in terms of localism, but never mind that
2296740	2303620	The fact of the matter is is climate is a 30 year average of each weather
2304500	2306100	Event, right?
2306100	2312500	Whether it's hurricanes or tornadoes tornadoes are almost non-existent in the united states this year compared to previous years
2312580	2315140	For some reason the conditions just didn't happen
2315940	2318820	Because united states has 90 of the world's tornadoes
2319540	2324500	There's a reason for that. It's geographic. It's because from the arctic to the gulf of mexico
2324980	2328020	There are no mountains in the way because that was an inland sea
2329380	2332660	The prairies in other words of the united states
2333380	2337220	Were end of canada that was that was the sea bottom at one point
2337220	2342420	And so it's a straight shot for arctic air to come all the way down to the gulf of mexico and for hot
2342820	2346500	Gulf of mexico air to come all the way up and they combine and boom
2346900	2354500	And that's how hurricanes are formed too is the convergence of cold and warm air masses and that's why when the earth warms
2355940	2357620	The tropics
2357620	2361940	hardly changes when the earth warms the warming is is
2363620	2369940	What's the not inadvertently is greater anyways the warming is always greater towards the poles when the earth warms
2370260	2375380	It wasn't that long ago when all the arctic islands of canada were covered in forest
2375460	2379620	And there was giant camels roaming there five million years ago. That's not very long ago
2380180	2384900	That that's five million years is like an eternity to these people. They don't even know what it means
2385460	2387460	right, so if we have
2387700	2392420	Most of the effects of global warming or of any warming that occurs at the poles
2392500	2398100	Presumably that is going to increase the melting of those ice caps. Is there a concern whether it is
2398820	2402820	man-made or otherwise cyclical in nature or simply a trend over time
2404100	2407940	Should we be concerned about increased warming rising sea levels?
2408420	2414100	We have a lot of coastal cities. We have people who live there who may not be able to move very easily
2414900	2416900	Is that a danger
2416980	2421220	People who can't move very easily. Do you have some of those are the in wheelchairs or what?
2423220	2426500	You have people who may I say I say two things about this
2427220	2428500	number one
2428500	2430500	You won't have to run
2430820	2436660	Right, this is happening very very slowly and always will happen very very slowly. It doesn't happen quickly
2437300	2439300	number two hire the dutch
2440340	2443220	Right 25 of holland is below sea level
2444180	2446180	And they're growing most of their food there
2447380	2452180	On this land that is below sea level. It is not difficult to build dykes
2452820	2454820	around pieces of land
2455220	2457220	Especially if the land is steep
2458740	2460740	Sorry, especially if the land is flat
2461060	2465060	You can save a lot of land by building a foot of dyke or two
2465780	2467780	If the land is steep
2467780	2470260	You have to decide whether it's worth it or not
2470900	2475780	To build a wall because you're only going to lose a small amount of land if it's coming steep out of the water
2476180	2481380	So those are the basic situations the sea level has always been rising and falling
2481940	2485940	We should not weep because we happen to be victims to this
2486660	2489220	eternal factor in the earth's
2490180	2491380	climate
2491380	2492900	and sea level
2492900	2499140	Right the earth sea level has been 40 meters higher than it is today in the past and it's been
2499780	2501780	100 meters lower
2502740	2504740	So it goes up and down
2504900	2510980	But if you look at the islands at the equator in indonesia, which are made of limestone from ancient coral reefs
2512180	2515380	They're all undercut sometimes up to 12 feet
2516340	2520500	Undercut they've got this angle undercut. They look like mushrooms, right?
2520660	2523700	You may have seen them in photographs. Vietnam has them too
2523940	2530740	They're all through that part of the world where the islands are made of limestone, which is more erodible than granite by waves
2531940	2533940	now
2534100	2538260	If if the sea was constantly rising for the last 10 000 years or whatever
2538980	2545700	Because it stopped rising pretty much around 7 000 years ago when the glaciers melted coming out of the last glaciation
2546420	2549780	The most recent glaciation. It's not necessarily the final one
2550340	2555220	As people think the last glaciation means the final glaciation. It just means the more recent
2555700	2559780	Yes, the most recent one of 45 that have occurred in the Pleistocene
2560180	2563860	So we have no guarantee that anything is going to change
2564340	2570660	Another one should be here in 80 000 years according to the last million years of cycles all which is
2571380	2574740	Thoroughly documented by ice cores from Antarctica
2575860	2580180	So this sea level rise and up and down has been happening forever
2580660	2584420	And people in the last 10 000 years have adjusted to it
2585540	2589940	It's not going to like they're they're they're making it seem as though it will be a flood
2590580	2592580	Like an inundation, right?
2593220	2595220	That's the climate emergency
2595540	2599060	Scenario that all of a sudden our houses will be under water
2599700	2601700	It's not going to work that way
2601780	2607540	And that's why Obama is perfectly happy to buy a 14 million dollar house right on the ocean
2608260	2610260	in Cape Cod
2610260	2612260	Because he also knows this
2612820	2614820	That he's safe there
2614980	2616980	there's some inland
2617300	2619300	harbors in the uk
2619380	2621140	isn't there and there's some
2621140	2623140	Ruins of of roman
2623700	2628100	Shipping places that are actually miles inland from when the sea level was higher
2629060	2634180	Precisely and that was 2 000 years ago when the romans built docks on all across the south of britain
2635380	2637380	And uh lewis
2637380	2639380	You know where lewis is no
2640020	2642340	Well, it's one of those castle towns
2643700	2645700	On a river that flows south
2645700	2647540	It's way inland
2647540	2649300	It was on the sea
2649380	2651380	Also, there's a place in france
2652580	2654580	Called something sir lemare
2654740	2656340	it's like
2656340	2659620	Many many kilometers from the sea today. It used to be a harbor
2660420	2662420	so it appears as though
2663380	2665380	The sea level is lower today
2665780	2667780	And that would be worldwide
2667940	2669940	than it was 2 000 years ago
2671300	2672420	and
2672420	2677460	That is because the world was warmer 2000 years ago during the roman warm period
2677780	2679780	That's why they have a name for it
2679940	2685060	Because it was the roman warm period and in the roman warm period 2000 years ago
2685620	2687620	It was warmer than it is today
2687780	2691540	In addition during the medieval warm period 1000 years ago
2692180	2697300	Interestingly a thousand years a thousand years a thousand years. This has been the trend
2697460	2701940	There was also a thing called the minoan warm period before the roman warm period
2703540	2707300	The earth has been cooling for 6 000 years net cooling
2707620	2710900	We are in a slight upward tick now. It's just an upward tick in
2711620	2714980	A downward movement. Do you think that we've got further to go down?
2716420	2718420	Yes, 80 000 years further
2719380	2722980	The malankovitch cycle so 100 000 years so you think that
2723620	2724580	realistically
2724580	2726580	We are seeing this upward tick
2726740	2730900	What has happened is it has coincided with an increase of releasing carbon dioxide
2730980	2736500	Which has led some scientists to associate the increasing temperature with the increase in carbon dioxide
2737220	2743060	Which justifies blaming it on humans, but that if you were to roll it forward by another
2743940	2745940	500 years
2745940	2750420	You are going to see the crest of that thousand year cycle actually
2751060	2752900	diminish
2752900	2756260	And we're going to start to cool again and then cool again to a lower level
2757220	2759540	Than we would have seen previously at the previous low
2760420	2761860	You got it
2761860	2766180	If things continue on the same pattern they have for the last 6000 years
2766580	2771220	Which is typical of an interglacial period through the Antarctic ice cores
2772020	2778660	We have a really good picture of the last 800 000 years and now they're starting to go back more than a million years
2779140	2782740	Into the times when there was a 41 000 year cycle
2783460	2787780	Right now we only have really good information for the 100 000 year cycles
2788420	2793540	Especially going back through four of them. They all have names. The previous one was the emion
2794260	2798020	I'm forgetting the other two right now, but they have names on a chart
2798980	2801620	And they were a hundred thousand years apart
2802900	2804900	In quite perfect synchronization
2805300	2807940	We know the co2 levels and the temperature
2808660	2812420	At the Antarctic during those cycles because we can measure
2812900	2818260	proxy measurements of isotopes and actually the co2 is measured directly from bubbles in the ice
2818980	2820260	down
2820260	2822260	400 000 years in ice
2822980	2825300	And so we've got that and we know
2826100	2828100	that the interglacial periods
2828980	2830660	come out in
2830660	2832660	10 000 years
2832660	2838740	Whereas and then there's a 10 000 year these these are not all equal exactly right, but approximately
2839300	2841300	10 000 year interglacial period
2841940	2847540	Where the temperature remains higher for a period of time and then a gradual 80 000 year
2847860	2850580	Decline into the next major glaciation
2851140	2857700	So it appears as though and the and the interglacial periods are virtually always warmer at the very beginning
2858260	2860340	Of them in other words as you come out
2861060	2862500	Of the previous
2862500	2864420	glaciation
2864420	2866100	It goes up
2866100	2869700	To what we call the Holocene climatic optimum
2870500	2872500	Meaning it was warmer then
2872660	2874660	For the first 6 000 years
2875300	2881780	Of the Holocene interglacial period and since then it has been cooling. This is well documented the graphs are in my book
2881780	2884260	They're from Iceland and Antarctic ice cores
2885940	2891300	And they're also from marine sediments marine sediments can take you back half a billion years
2891700	2895460	Because stuff has been falling on the bottom of the sea from all the life in the ocean
2896180	2899540	And the stuff and the sediments flowing into the ocean
2900020	2906660	In addition so the life that dies falls to the bottom and is embedded in the sediments that come from the land
2907380	2913300	And that record is in layers and we can date all of that with radioactive techniques
2913860	2914820	So
2914820	2916420	We've got that
2916420	2919220	What do people mean when they say that we've got 50 harvests left?
2921780	2925300	Is that like 50 years of crops apparently yeah, I think so
2925300	2928900	I don't know why they wouldn't just say 50 years of crops as opposed to 50 harvests because
2929540	2933540	That's just confused me but yeah, let's call it 50 years of crops left. What do they mean? Is that
2934020	2938100	Something to do with soil microbiome stuff or biome stuff and virum stuff
2938740	2942340	No, it's it's simply a cult doomsday prediction
2943060	2944660	Is what it is
2944660	2947300	They have absolutely no reason to say that
2948020	2950020	Topsoil degradation none of this
2950820	2955940	Oh, yeah topsoil degradation. It's happening everywhere. No, we're our farming methods are
2956420	2960820	So improved now that soil conservation is so improved now
2961540	2968100	That we're not losing soil like they say we are and yes soil gets washed into the sea by rivers, right?
2968820	2973540	New soil is created. It's not as if soil creation has ended
2974260	2978020	And people think that trees use dirt to make themselves
2978980	2983060	And therefore if you take the trees away over and over and over again by harvesting them
2983300	2988420	The soil will eventually go away, right? No, the soil is made by the bloody trees
2989300	2993620	That's how soil gets there if there was no trees that would be rocks there no soil
2993940	2995940	Soil doesn't just happen by itself
2996340	3000660	It happens because of the leaves falling and the branches falling on the ground and decaying
3001300	3003300	And some of it turns into soil
3003380	3008100	soil forming processes was the beginning of ecology in the steps in the ukraine
3008500	3015220	Studying the grasslands of the ukraine, which are very productive deep churnizem soils have been created by grass
3016420	3020100	Doesn't it's not just trees that make dirt. It's all plants
3020740	3022740	make dirt and
3022740	3029540	When you look at a tree and you see this huge say at a big mature tree you see this huge solid thing
3031060	3034900	It's hard to believe that it's 99% made from air and water
3035860	3043700	Right the carbon and the hydrogen and the oxygen in that tree, which is over 99% of that tree's biomass
3044500	3048260	Came from carbon dioxide and H2O water
3049220	3054980	That's what made it trees are basically carbohydrates. So are we except for our bones
3056660	3058660	And so
3059220	3062660	The knowledge of of life is so poor
3063300	3069700	Science has progressed so far and yet the average person's knowledge of science has degraded
3070260	3072260	Because they're being told all these lies
3072980	3077700	That carbon dioxide is poison when in fact it is the primary food for all life
3078100	3080660	And there isn't enough of it right now
3081460	3085460	And there certainly wasn't enough of it when we first started putting some back
3085780	3092180	It's important to note that all the carbon that we are releasing was made by life
3093220	3099140	In the form of fossil fuels and much more importantly in the form of carbonaceous rocks
3100260	3105700	Now have you heard of carbonaceous rocks? I have not of course you have it's called limestone
3107140	3109620	Yes, and limestone is what we make cement with
3110820	3112820	And limestone is calcium carbonate
3113860	3115860	It is a carbonaceous rock
3116340	3119300	The carbon in limestone came from co2 in the ocean
3120260	3122580	And the co2 in the ocean came from the air
3124420	3126020	So as
3126020	3131140	The shelled creatures evolved what we call the marine calcifying species
3132820	3135300	All life in the sea was microscopic
3136100	3138100	Invisible and unicellular
3138260	3142340	Until about 600 570 600 million years ago
3143380	3145620	Then the Cambrian explosion occurred
3146420	3150420	Which was the advent of multicellular life in the sea
3151460	3153460	And large creatures this big
3154580	3156580	Came into being if you read
3157380	3159380	Stephen
3160020	3161540	ghouls
3161540	3164660	Book a wonderful life. You will see the history
3165780	3168820	Of early life as discovered through the Burgess Shale
3168820	3175300	Which is a fossil deposit in the rocky mountains at Yoho national park in canada the chinese have a parallel one
3175940	3178580	Where soft bodied organisms were preserved
3179860	3182260	That because most fossils are bones or shells
3183060	3184820	Because they were hard parts
3184820	3188020	And they could be preserved more easily soft parts would normally decay
3188580	3193620	But because of mudslides which immediately ended oxygen exposure
3196340	3199300	Ancient creatures that were only soft like jellyfish
3200100	3201860	Were preserved as fossils
3201860	3205940	So there's a record of these species evolution in the early times of the Cambrian
3207140	3211780	At a certain point many different species somehow from a common thread
3212500	3216820	Developed the ability to combine calcium and carbon dioxide
3217620	3219620	calcium like sodium and
3219700	3221700	potassium is in the salts in the sea
3223220	3224340	And
3224340	3227700	Combined calcium with carbon dioxide to make calcium carbonate
3228340	3229940	to form shells
3230020	3237540	Armor plating around their soft bodies like oysters and mussels and crabs and barnacles and shrimp
3238020	3244020	And tiny coccolithophores, which are a plant phytoplankton and a little bit larger for eminifera, which are about
3244260	3247540	They're an animal they're about the size of a very tiny grain of sand
3248500	3251380	And they are all marine calcifying species
3251940	3253780	coral reefs are actually
3253780	3260260	The predominant one which is about 50 of all the calcification going on in the world and was much more before
3260580	3266500	When coral reefs were much more widely spread when the earth was warmer. They've been reduced to basically
3268340	3270980	Small places where the ocean is still warm enough
3271540	3275780	For the high biodiversity of corals the particularly indonesian coral triangle
3276420	3277620	and so
3277620	3279140	today
3279140	3284740	We have a situation where these coral species and other calcifying species are still
3285380	3289540	Using the carbon dioxide out of the ocean and it's raining down on the bottom
3290100	3295700	As dead shells right as shells from dead creatures and that has built up and formed all of the
3296500	3301460	All of the limestone in the world over the years and that's where most of the carbon dioxide has gone
3302100	3306020	90 approximately only about 10 of it has gone into fossil fuels
3306340	3310980	Now the fossil fuels are also the result of forest being buried and turned into coal
3311700	3316900	Of species sinking to the bottom the the soft parts of species turning into oil and gas
3317460	3322180	In and now we find them on the land in places like texas, which was once a sea bottom
3323140	3325140	and and the fracking
3325540	3328500	Deposits all were at one time a sea bottom
3329220	3333540	Whereas the coal deposits were a terrestrial environment where forests
3333860	3339060	But all of the fossil fuels were made with photosynthesis. They were all created by solar energy
3339380	3344180	They were all created by carbon dioxide being drawn out of the atmosphere and locked away
3344660	3350420	For hundreds of millions of years where the plants on the land and in the sea could no longer use it because it was gone
3350820	3354180	Into these locked up sediments. They call it sequestration
3355300	3358500	Or sequestered carbon it is out of the cycle
3359380	3362020	That's why co2 came down to such a low level
3362500	3367300	At the last glaciation when the oceans cooled and pulled it out of the atmosphere to 180
3367540	3370180	Which is 30 parts per million above the death of plants
3370740	3373860	Plants don't just need co2. Just like us
3374420	3378100	They need a certain level of co2 just like we need a certain level of oxygen
3378500	3382100	If you have an an atmosphere with 5% oxygen you die
3383060	3385060	Actually, you die at 10% oxygen
3385380	3389940	I think it's even higher than that whereas oxygen is around 20% in the atmosphere
3390580	3392580	But you go up to the top amount Everest
3393220	3397620	And you've got to be a sherpa who's been doing it for their whole life before you can breathe up there
3398180	3399940	And successfully live
3399940	3403460	So that these are true true isms about life
3404020	3409700	That they need a certain level of their essential nutrients and carbon dioxide being the key
3409860	3411860	Essential nutrient for all plants
3413780	3417540	They need it at one one third one fifty and they start to die
3418020	3424020	And it is believed that during some of the last major glaciations because of ash layers that are associated
3424500	3430340	With the peak of those glaciations that high altitude plants did all die and burn
3431060	3433060	Because they were dried out
3433300	3438260	And that would be because when you run when you the higher you go the thinner the air gets
3438980	3442900	So even though co2 is still at the same parts per million
3443300	3446020	Compared to the other gases. It's more dispersed
3446660	3450260	And therefore more difficult for plants to obtain that
3452500	3456740	Everything i'm saying is thoroughly documented on the internet
3457460	3461300	The and the most important point is that no scientist
3462100	3464980	Who actually wanted to retain any credibility?
3465380	3473140	Would claim that the correlation between rising co2 and rising temperature at this very tiny piece of time
3474020	3476020	Is proof of causation
3477220	3480660	Right correlation is not proof of causation
3481380	3484260	Correlation just means two things are going in the same direction
3484660	3490180	And very often the reason they are is because of a third common factor and let me give you an example
3490420	3496260	The relationship between ice cream consumption and shark attacks
3498740	3500740	They are perfectly correlated
3501140	3506740	When ice cream consumption goes up shark attacks go up ice cream consumption goes down
3507300	3510340	Shark attacks go down. It's a perfect annual cycle
3512020	3518820	Do ice cream consumptions cause shark attacks? No. Do shark attacks cause ice cream consumption? No
3518820	3525540	This is a correlation which is not an example of causation because temperature
3526420	3530740	A third factor is the cause of both of them going in the same cycle
3531780	3534420	When the temperature gets warm people go to the beach
3534820	3538820	Eat an ice cream and go swimming and some of them get attacked by a shark
3539540	3541540	In the winter neither happens
3541620	3548500	So this is correlation is far more common than causation and there's a a website called
3549460	3554020	Something correlations spurious correlations. Yeah, that one. It's very very good
3554500	3556500	Yeah, yeah, yeah, like Nicholas Cage
3556660	3560420	Correlated with the number of people that die by being caught up in their bedding every year
3560740	3564900	There's a statistically significant. All right, so what's the third? What do you think is the third?
3565860	3570500	Factor in that case. Is there something that there doesn't have to be one? Yep
3571620	3573860	There doesn't have to it's just that they're both right
3573940	3579060	There could be a a separate factor causing temperature to change and a separate factor
3580580	3584260	Causing co2 to change and the fact that they're both going up at this time
3584500	3586500	But they're not going up in sync
3586820	3592500	If you look at there's one graph in in my book that shows that in this interglacial period
3593140	3598900	We came before humans started emitting we came to a point where co2 was at 280
3599380	3603700	And temperature was at a certain point. I don't know what exact Celsius it was
3604420	3610580	And then suddenly co2 just shoots up off the chart if you put it in a hundred thousand years graph
3611460	3613460	this little bit of time right now
3614100	3621460	150 years and really only the last 60 or 70 where it's been substantial 60 years of
3622260	3624580	Radical increase in co2. I won't
3625780	3630420	You know say that's wrong. It is a radical increase. We don't need to do it this quickly
3631220	3632580	And that is why in my book
3632580	3637780	I make it very clear that reducing fossil fuel consumption would be an excellent strategy
3638420	3642100	If you had something reliable cost effective to replace it with
3642980	3644980	Right and that is nuclear energy
3645620	3650180	With nuclear energy we could easily take out half the fossil fuels being used today
3650580	3655780	Not because of climate change, but because they're precious and should be conserved because they're
3656340	3662580	Non-renewable they don't they're not being made as quickly as we're using them by orders of magnitude
3663060	3668740	Right, so we should be conserving fossil fuels for the essential things like flying airplanes
3669140	3672020	It's not easy to fly an airplane with anything else
3672580	3680020	Besides a liquid fuel and liquid fuels are hard to come by as our gaseous ones like methane natural gas
3680900	3682260	so
3682260	3684020	electricity
3684100	3687860	Is mostly being made by fossil fuels today not just in china
3688260	3693780	It's only in france that more than 50 of the electricity is being made by nuclear energy
3694820	3700180	And they they diss france for this and they hold up germany as a shining example of green
3700660	3705700	When in fact germany is emitting nearly two times the co2 per capita of france
3706020	3710020	And their only reason france is emitting less co2 is because of nuclear energy
3710260	3712820	Why is the world so averse to nuclear energy?
3713300	3715060	Because they're idiots
3715060	3720180	And they're they're brainwashed and whatever else, right? I have nothing but
3721300	3723300	Contempt for people who just
3724100	3729300	Reject nuclear energy when almost no one has ever been killed by it except chernobyl
3729620	3733060	Which was a stupid reactor design that the russians made
3733540	3738580	From their plutonium production reactors to make nuclear weapons. They just cookie-cuttered the same
3739140	3741140	cheap reactor all across
3741300	3745940	The former soviet union all of which have been shut down in any of the former satellites
3746260	3749140	They still have 10 running eight or 10 running in
3749860	3753540	In russia, but they have modified them so that can't happen again
3754340	3760100	They should have done that in the first place because they had a negative void coefficient or a positive void coefficient
3760100	3762980	I never get them right, but one is good and the other is bad
3763780	3764820	and
3764820	3769140	Their reactor was a design that could theoretically
3769780	3771780	Go critical in other words
3771940	3773940	Become a nuclear bomb
3774020	3775700	And that a slow one
3775700	3777700	That was a slow nuclear bomb that explosion
3777780	3779780	They happened faster in real nuclear bombs
3780260	3787860	And do more damage than that one did but it blew a 2000 ton lid off itself a concrete lid and then burned because they had a huge
3788580	3791780	Carbon moderator in there. That was 2000 tons or something
3792580	3795620	To I mean there's big numbers involved in Chernobyl
3796020	3799540	And that burnt for 10 days while firefighters tried to put it out spewing
3799940	3802500	More and more radiation into the atmosphere the whole time
3803060	3807060	Whereas Three Mile Island wasn't even worth talking about
3807540	3813140	It was a bad accident to cord a core meltdown, but it didn't cause any damage to anything or any one
3813700	3820660	And no one died in Fukushima from radiation and no one will because no one received a sufficient dose to cause any harm
3821060	3825940	And this is confirmed by the radioactive effects research foundation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki
3826260	3831380	Formed after the second world war by macArthur and the japanese to study the life history
3831780	3837940	Of people who were exposed to the radiation and survived aren't there some tuna or some fish in the sea
3838420	3844260	Who are showing higher levels of radiation and ten eyes to yes ten eyes imagine that
3845060	3847060	No, there are not
3847060	3849060	there's higher levels means
3849940	3853140	Infantesimal higher levels if that's what they mean
3853620	3860020	They did have a ban on fishing in the region because a lot of liquid was going into the water that was contaminated as they say
3860340	3864980	Had radioactive substances in it. There are radioactive substances in you and me
3866100	3868820	Potassium 40 in particular if you eat a banana
3869460	3875060	Which is radioactive we have radiation stuff wasn't from a banana was it that was from something much more dangerous
3875060	3883380	Well, what do you mean what was more they nuclear reactors are not inherently dangerous they are if you eat them
3884500	3889620	Yeah, but we we we don't eat them and nobody ate anything from Fukushima because they stopped
3890180	3892180	Taking crops from the land nearby
3892420	3899620	I mean they took the Fukushima was one of the stupidest accidents that ever occurred in the world and the japanese are so insular
3900020	3904900	In their culture that they did not take the the lessons that were learned
3905300	3907300	From other accidents that occurred
3907620	3913700	They just didn't and the the difference in culture can be explained this way in the united states or britain
3914260	3916260	When a reactor has a problem
3916260	3920900	The operator phones the prime minister and tells him what the problem is and what he's doing to try to fix it
3921540	3925620	In japan the operator phones the president asks the president what he should do
3926820	3928820	Right because he's the president
3928820	3934100	And he doesn't know what the heck to do so those three explosions that happened one day after another i think
3934340	3940260	Approximately at Fukushima could all have easily been prevented even after the meltdowns occurred
3941620	3946340	Because they were hydrogen explosions people think those were explosions in the reactor
3946420	3954020	They weren't they were explosions of hydrogen gas that was not released as it should have been to prevent it from becoming concentrated at eight percent
3954340	3956340	hydrogen almost spontaneously
3956580	3960180	Ignites with any spark and causes a huge explosion
3960420	3962420	So and then they evacuated
3962500	3971380	All the people even though they were not subject to sufficient radiation to require evacuation and over 2000 people died from the evacuation
3971700	3980580	Because they evacuated five intensive care wards into gymnasiums in other communities where they did not have the facilities to keep them alive
3981460	3984340	So that that's the kind of overreaction
3985220	3989060	That happened to in Fukushima, which was a bad accident
3989060	3996740	It was a huge industrial accident that it did not cause death what caused death of almost 20 000 people was the tsunami
3997700	3999700	And I saw on cnn
4000100	4004580	A headline written across the screen during the Fukushima disaster
4005940	4008900	Which said nuclear crisis deepens
4009700	4011700	As bodies wash ashore
4011940	4013940	That's what it said
4015540	4020420	And that was to me the beginning of fake news all the way when they started showing
4021460	4024500	smog and calling it carbon dioxide basically
4024980	4026980	And showing backlit
4026980	4029220	chimneys of factories with black
4030020	4036180	smoke coming out of them supposedly but no it was water vapor and that's what water vapor looks like when you backlight it
4036900	4038900	so the
4039780	4042500	And you know and the same with the inbreeding polar bears
4042740	4047060	I mean they are just making up one story after another now and floating it in the media
4047380	4050340	And it all comes back to the fact that the politicians
4050900	4056580	Are funding the scientists to give them what they want, which is something that they can instill fear
4058500	4062580	And guilt into the population about in order to have power
4063140	4068660	And then the media and the activists are the bullhorn right the megaphone
4069300	4073700	That puts that into just a giant global story and nothing else matters
4074180	4077940	The truth doesn't matter one bit anymore in this discussion
4078260	4082580	What about the people that say we're seeing the beginning of the next big extinction event?
4085940	4087460	It's so stupid
4087460	4090420	We're not seeing the beginning of the next big extinction event
4091140	4095220	Okay, if a big extinction event was happening and it was being documented
4095620	4100820	I could get it but read the chapter in my book on extinction where I appeared before
4101380	4103700	a committee of the u.s. House of Congress
4104820	4108340	With three people there claiming to be united nation scientists
4109460	4111460	Saying that yes
4111460	4120180	We only know of 1.7 plus million species which have been identified named photographed written up, etc
4120660	4124100	But there are very likely 8.7 million species
4125220	4127220	That's what they said
4127540	4132580	There's probably 8.7 million species and this is our best estimate
4134020	4136020	Where did they get that estimate?
4136180	4140980	In air there's no way you can turn 1.1.7 into 8.7
4141700	4145300	Without having any actual observation of any real thing
4146260	4148900	So they were saying there's about 7 million
4149700	4157300	Unreal species that we don't know about and then they say and a million of those will go extinct in the next few decades
4157780	4161540	Right, how many of the how many of the observed creatures?
4162180	4164180	Have they seen go extinct?
4165140	4172340	An ever decreasing number as humans in around 1920 when the passenger pigeon became extinct
4173300	4174820	suddenly
4174820	4178660	The general population took an interest in the issue of extinction
4179460	4182420	Prior to that which wasn't very long ago 100 years
4183540	4187700	Nobody cared about extinction. They thought it was a normal thing except a few naturalists who
4188580	4194500	Bemoaned the extinction of the dodo bird or other species that went extinct as a result of human activity
4195380	4198900	And most people don't realize that the the main cause
4200180	4203140	Of species extinction is not hunting
4203860	4206500	Right it it is actually agriculture
4207700	4212100	And the changing of habitats so that is why most
4212900	4220100	Species recovery programs are based on habitat and making sure that there's a place for these species to exist
4220900	4222340	That's key
4222340	4228420	but we have not like overrun 90 percent of the world's habitat and much of the
4229300	4232180	Area that we are using especially for forestry
4232900	4236900	Is perfectly suitable for most of the species that always lived in the forests
4237860	4238900	agriculture is different
4238900	4243780	Agriculture creates a monoculture on purpose and that's pretty hard to get away from
4244100	4249060	People who preach that you should have 17 different species of plants growing on the same plot of land
4249140	4253060	I'd like to see them do it successfully. It's not possible
4253700	4258100	So they the farmer wants to get rid of every insect every animal
4259060	4264020	You know everything other than every other plant all other all other plants are weeds
4264980	4266340	in this case
4266340	4269380	And so agriculture is is where you have to really
4270100	4276820	Look at what you're doing in the landscape and make sure that in that landscape and it usually happens naturally if you fly across the
4278020	4282100	Whole agricultural area of the united states. You see lots of forest
4283060	4287540	Burst among the agricultural land because and and in europe too
4287940	4289940	I mean most people don't realize that
4290500	4295300	200 years ago 250 years ago less than 10 percent of europe remained forested
4295780	4298900	Because the trees were being used for everything to do with fuel
4299140	4304500	They were being used to heat all the buildings to to smelt all the iron and copper to do the glass works
4305140	4309620	And steam engines everything was fueled by wood and all the building of everything
4310180	4315780	So forests started to disappear in central europe initially and then spreading out over the whole of europe
4316100	4319060	The first time in the history of humans where forests
4319940	4323460	Were disappearing if we were cutting them faster than they were growing back
4323860	4329780	That's why agriculture was invented 10 000 years ago and forestry wasn't invented until about 1750
4330180	4334180	In central europe because they realized they had to start planting some trees
4335220	4337620	And then silviculture otherwise known as
4338340	4344500	As as forestry scientific forestry came into being and now there's 43 forest cover in europe
4344740	4348100	Well speaking of trees. I thought I thought the amazon rainforest was wrecked
4349300	4351540	10 percent of it has been modified
4352660	4355460	That's quite a lot that could be quite a bit. It's a fair big forest, isn't it?
4356260	4358900	It's a huge forest and it's not in any way endangered
4359940	4365700	The the problem with the you know my book is titled fake invisible catastrophes and threats of doom for a reason
4365700	4367700	I put the word invisible in there
4368180	4373380	Because to most people the amazon is invisible they show you a picture of a fire that takes up the whole screen
4373700	4375700	Right, it might be about 10 feet
4376020	4381700	Of the you know of the amazon which is almost as big as the continental united states brazil itself
4382180	4386500	Is almost as big as the continental united states and amazon is a huge part of brazil
4387220	4389620	And there are parts of the amazon
4390500	4392260	That have been developed
4392260	4394260	But most of it is intact
4394740	4401140	And even where it's been developed it is only small areas if you just look at a satellite photograph of it
4401540	4404180	You can see it. I've flown over it in an airplane at
4404660	4409460	Fairly low elevation and you go for five hours and you hardly see any people
4410020	4412900	It's called a human desert by people but even
4413700	4418260	You know the the leader of brazil now is under attack over the amazon
4419140	4421140	from the left
4421220	4428340	And one of the reasons you can get away with that is almost no one in brazil has ever been to the amazon even though it's in their own country
4429140	4431780	People don't go there. What would you do there?
4432580	4438580	It's got manouse, which is basically a manufacturing hub for electronics. So it's a sort of a
4439380	4441380	Tax-free zone of some kind
4441460	4447220	You've got bay lamb at the mouth of the river, which is i've been to that city. It's not very interesting
4447300	4451700	It's just a city at the mouth of the amazon and there's not much else to do there
4452260	4454260	You can go on a boat up and down the river
4455540	4460420	Then you see all you see is trees the whole way and the amazon
4460980	4465620	Is 300 miles wide during the flood period. It will never have a bridge over it
4466420	4468420	It doesn't have a road anymore
4468420	4475540	Because the road the plants grew up through the pavement and destroyed the road within 10 years when they did build one to manouse
4475620	4480660	And i'm going to guess that if we continue to increase the concentration of carbon dioxide that's just going to happen quicker
4482020	4489860	Yes, the amazon is is growing faster, but interestingly it's the drier places that benefit most from increased co2
4490660	4491700	because
4491700	4496180	Increase co2 has two effects one more co2 for growth
4497060	4498180	like
4498180	4499620	I'll give you the second one in a minute
4499620	4505380	But first i digress to say that i used to laugh at people who said their plants grew better when they talked to them
4505860	4510500	As if plants have ears and can hear you and are empathetic or whatever
4511140	4513140	And i saw i sort of chuckled at that
4513380	4520580	Then i realized that when you're talking to your plants you're breathing 40 000 parts per million co2 on them
4520900	4522340	That's our breath
4522340	4525300	Is 100 times the level it is in the air
4526100	4532100	So you're basically breathing super concentrated fertilizer onto your plants when you're talking to them
4532340	4539460	And they do grow better because of that because they would like to have more co2 than exists in the natural world today
4540180	4546900	The second thing that increased co2 does is it makes most plants more efficient with water
4547780	4554100	Because now it's easier for them to get the carbon dioxide they need because it's more concentrated in the atmosphere
4554740	4559380	And therefore they don't need to make as many holes in the bottom of their leaves. They're called stomata
4560340	4567300	It's where they take in the air with the co2 in it, but it's also where they lose water through transpiration
4568260	4571540	So the fewer of those holes there are the less water they lose
4571860	4578900	Therefore the more efficient they become with water and gives them ability to survive in places that have less water than they could before
4579220	4586180	That's why trees are marching out onto grasslands in many parts of the world the southwest of the us for example and australia
4586820	4588820	the very eastern part
4589540	4590660	of
4590660	4594180	Sorry the very western part of australia western australia as it's known
4594820	4598260	Is the driest part of australia the nalabar desert is there too
4598260	4600740	Which doesn't have much of anything growing on it because it's so dry
4601060	4604420	But in the in the west like around perth and down to albany
4604900	4608900	The the trees are growing much faster now and so are the crops because
4610180	4612260	You know if if you're a farmer
4613060	4621140	Today and you are giving your plants all the water and all the fertilizer they need the mineral food
4621940	4627860	The limiting factor to the plant's growth is carbon dioxide because of how low it is in the atmosphere even today
4628580	4632740	And the the proof is in the pudding here because all commercial greenhouse growers
4633540	4635140	in the world
4635140	4639300	Inject carbon dioxide into their greenhouses because they haven't enclosed space
4639780	4645620	Where they can increase the level of co2 and they generally go up to between 800 and 1200 ppm
4646420	4650900	Which even above that the plants grow faster, but there's a curve because economics is involved
4650900	4655300	They have to buy the co2 so at this level at right somewhere in the curve
4655300	4662580	They say okay 1200 is optimum for us because above that buying more co2 has an ever decreasing increase in yield
4663460	4666180	And so 1200 works really well in greenhouses
4666180	4671700	That's four times sorry three times what it is today in the global atmosphere and that is
4672260	4674260	We should not even be concerned
4674580	4677940	Until co2 gets up to 20 000 ppm
4678580	4682580	Because that's what submariners survive in for three months under water
4683540	4691700	and the the the people who uh had the trouble on apollo 13 where the co2 was building up it went up to at least 20 000 in there
4692340	4694580	See we our breath is 40 000
4694980	4698820	We have 40 000 ppm co2 in our lungs
4699300	4702260	Just before we breathe out. I don't want to be breathing that in though
4703620	4705140	Yes, you do
4705140	4709140	But the same air that I breathe that well in that case you can no no just once just once
4709220	4713540	Yeah, yeah, but you don't want to be a closed system of breathing that back in when you put your mask on
4714020	4717940	You are breathing a significant portion of the air. You just breathed out back in again
4718980	4719940	so
4720020	4726980	We we can survive at a whole different bunch of levels of co2 just fine and plants are happy with it at
4727540	4731540	10000 ppm or they wouldn't be here because that's what it was back
4732260	4737540	500 million years ago one of the things that I decided to fact check you on or internet check you on
4738020	4740900	was photos of the great pacific garbage patch
4741380	4744660	And photos of birds with plastic inside of their stomachs
4744900	4751380	Now I'd seen these floating around on the internet and when I was reading your book and listening to you
4751460	4755780	I found that you'd said try and find me a photo of a big patch of garbage
4756260	4758260	That doesn't have mountains in the background
4759220	4762900	Because in the middle of the pacific there aren't any mountains that are nearby
4762900	4765460	So if someone was to take a photo of it something that's supposed to be
4765780	4771780	Didn't someone say it was nearly the size of texas or something like that size of texas and growing faster than anyone ever predicted
4772020	4774740	Yes, and I thought well if this thing's so big
4775380	4776740	That seems ridiculous
4776740	4782180	I'd seen photos of big clumps of plastic floating together bottles and and and stuff
4782660	4783460	In the middle of the ocean
4783460	4789540	So I did a search and I kept on looking in the background and people have re cropped numbers of different photos
4789860	4792180	And twisted them so that they look like they're at different angles
4792740	4794740	I thought oh, that's
4794740	4799220	That's kind of interesting because I thought I was pretty sure that that was there and then the other thing that you mentioned was
4799940	4806580	Birds that birds don't have teeth so the way that they digest their food is actually by putting little stones or nuts into their stomach
4806580	4809940	And they kill it and then they use that to grind up the food
4810580	4813380	And then they eject the little bits of plastic back out
4813380	4816820	So I thought well I'll have a bit of a read about that and I'll have a look and I'd seen a photo
4816820	4821460	It's sort of a carcass of an albatross and it's laid on the floor and it's really just sort of
4822100	4824100	bones and some feathers
4824420	4828900	And it's got like a thimble like a full reel of string inside of it and other stuff
4829140	4832020	And you'd mentioned that a lot of these might be staged and I thought yeah
4832420	4837700	Not a lot of them not a lot of them chris all of them. Okay. I looked and I thought with a skeptical. I was like
4838820	4845380	Yeah, I mean that that one does look a bit ridiculous and then a few of the other ones do and I read an article from
4845940	4847940	I want to say it was a bbc
4848340	4850740	one of david attenborough's documentaries about life or something
4851540	4856900	And it's one of the write-ups that's a partner to one of the episodes and the episode you see one of the birds eating plastic
4856900	4861540	And I was like, right, okay. Well, maybe they're doing this thing. Maybe they know you don't not in his episodes
4861540	4866020	You don't see a bird eating plastic. Oh, it might have been it's definitely a documentary on the bbc
4866660	4870340	And he's holding up a plastic bag next to a chick in a nest
4870660	4872660	Okay, and saying and saying
4872820	4879060	Adult birds are feeding plastic to their chicks. There's no pick. I've I've searched the internet thoroughly
4879300	4884660	He's actually removed one sequence that sequence where he's holding up the plastic bag
4884660	4887700	It no longer is available on the internet. I don't know why that's interesting
4887940	4893300	Yeah, it why did you say it the first time if about a year ago if sir before I wrote my book
4893540	4895540	I I think he's on to me
4895620	4897620	uh, and
4897700	4903060	He's he's an absolute liar in many many cases and I've made three of them in the book
4903700	4908420	One of them is that albatross adults are feeding plastic to their young
4909060	4915140	Mistaking it for food greenpeace says the same thing the smithsonian institute in the united states is saying the same thing
4915620	4917620	They are pushing this lie
4917860	4920340	That albatross can't tell plastic from food
4921780	4925540	Sir david attenborough never mentions the word gizzard anywhere
4926100	4928980	He wrote the bloody secret life of birds book
4929780	4933220	He did a ten part series on bbc on birds
4934020	4939780	Right and he doesn't know that birds all have gizzards that need to have solid objects in them to grind their food
4939780	4947620	Because they have no teeth and therefore have two stomachs all birds every bird in the world. That's why all land birds
4948660	4953940	Take pebbles into their stomach and when their chicks are in the nest and can't go and get pebbles for themselves
4954100	4955940	They put pebbles in their chick
4955940	4958980	So if you have a more convenient pebble that is made of plastic
4959460	4961460	And it's able to do the same job then
4961780	4967220	No, the land birds do not feed bits of plastic to their chicks as far as I know because there's plenty of pebbles
4967780	4971620	But out in the ocean where birds are actual marine animals that
4972260	4977060	Nest on rocky islands barren rocky islands where all there is is a bit of grass
4977540	4985380	Right, there's no pebbles there either. Yeah, so traditionally their favorite. Well, naturally they feed their chicks squid
4985780	4987220	little squid
4987300	4989300	In those squid is a beak
4989380	4993940	That beak is retained in the gizzard as part of the digestive aids
4994580	4999300	Right, it's like a ball mill in mining where they put steel balls into a mill to grind the ore
4999460	5003540	It's exactly the same concept in many ways, but in the in the gizzard
5003540	5011940	It's a muscular motion where they go like this with their gizzard and grind the food with these solid objects in there to help with it
5012660	5014900	And so the other thing they'll take is pumice
5015700	5021860	Which is volcanic lava from undersea volcanoes and because it's spongy it floats
5021940	5025940	It's got air in it or gases in it. So it floats so little bits of
5026580	5031060	Pumice will come to the surface sometimes in huge layers when a undersea volcano goes off
5031300	5033140	But they're not it's not always there
5033140	5038820	So they have to resort them to hard bits of wood and nuts that have dropped off a plant
5039380	5042740	In a river or by the seashore and come out in the ocean
5043140	5046180	So it they have to work really hard
5046660	5052180	To find enough digestive aids that are suitable in size and and hardness
5052820	5057460	It's not easy for them. And when plastic started showing up in the ocean 60 years ago
5058660	5065460	They started choosing pieces of the right size not plastic bags not cigarette lighters
5065860	5068660	Not spools of yarn. That's all staged
5068980	5074020	They don't feed them those kind of things and they're actually they're not feeding the plastic bits
5074340	5079220	They're giving it to them to ingest so they can put it in their gizzard. That's where it goes
5079700	5082180	They know how to decide which goes in which stomach
5082420	5088740	So the story that I read had this lady explaining about the situation and that the parents she'd used the word feed
5088740	5092740	She'd parents would come back and given the chicks these plastic pebbles
5093060	5095060	And I can't remember the word that they used
5095540	5100820	To describe what happens as they're just about to fly the nest some bird word
5101380	5103380	They the bolus
5103460	5108580	Maybe they cough up most of the hard objects in there. Yeah
5109140	5114020	The reason they have so much in their gizzard is because they will digest their food even faster
5114100	5116900	Then and the parents won't have to feed them for the rest of their lives
5117460	5120020	Right, so they want them out of the nest as soon as possible
5120260	5125780	So they put a lot of plastic which weighs a lot plastic and but plastic is never
5126340	5133380	A majority of what's in a young bird's gizzard never like it's shown in those staged photos is like all plastic
5133460	5137140	What this lady said was just as they were about to leave. I saw them
5137860	5142740	Eject the the the plastic back up and throw it back up just as they were about to leave the nest
5142980	5146020	And you think it's not just the plastic not just the plastic
5146020	5149220	But all the other items they have in there to do the same job
5149540	5152260	And it's all plastic is always a minority of it
5152260	5158260	And she's got all these plastic bags and big plastic plastic cloths and things that's all staged
5158340	5161140	Yeah, well, that's not going in there. It's not going to fit in a small bird. Is it?
5161220	5164340	No, well, they're not they're actually quite big because albatrosses are big
5164740	5166900	But it's not gonna it's not gonna work
5167540	5174020	They only if you see the photo in my book the only photo I know of of a adult albatross
5174740	5179700	Giving plastic to its chick you can see it in its beak going into the chicks mouth
5180180	5183540	And it's all nice little pieces of colored plastic
5184820	5189940	That are just the right shape and size. It's not plastic bags. It's not
5190580	5193460	Cigarette lighters like they show in the staged pictures
5193620	5198420	But when you read that when you read that article what you see is if you didn't know that
5198900	5202100	The birds needed the plastic to break up food in the stomach
5202340	5205940	If you didn't know that that was something that aids them with that digestion
5206020	5210340	And that it is common for them to throw up the plastic plus presumably all of the other stuff
5210420	5212420	That's been in there helping them to break up their food
5212580	5215540	You would read that article and it is it is accurate
5216020	5219780	What she says is correct, but the things that have been purposefully omitted
5220340	5225780	And the understanding about why some of the inclusions have been put in there and why biologically that might still be natural
5226740	5230660	That creates a situation and that was the moment I was reading it and I thought
5232820	5234660	This really is
5234660	5238420	This really is quite sinister. It does feel like it's quite a
5240020	5242020	Manipulative way
5242100	5248740	To tell people what has happened but frame it in such a manner that makes us again hate our own existence
5249620	5251620	You could say evil
5251620	5253620	as a synonym of sinister
5254580	5257620	And I believe it is because sir david attenborough
5258180	5262580	Also lied about the walruses committing suicide due to a lack of ice
5263460	5268100	That's the final chapter in my book. They committed suicide. Was this a harry carry thing?
5268740	5272500	Yes, they jumped off a cliff to their death in order
5273780	5277540	To avoid an attack by 20 polar bears. Oh
5278100	5281380	He didn't mention that part and that is well documented
5281460	5284820	There are photographs of the bears the people who live in a nearby town
5285060	5289860	Know that the reason the walruses left off a cliff was because they were being
5290340	5293860	About to be attacked and eaten by polar bears. What was the proposed reason?
5295380	5298500	Not enough ice as if you can put those two things together
5298580	5304340	It's sort of like polar bears are inbreeding because there isn't enough ice as if those two things are connected somehow
5304900	5311220	Right and he made it seem as though it was connected that there was because he said the reason the polar bears have come on the land
5312180	5314180	and got to a place
5315060	5317060	Where they could jump off
5317860	5321300	They did because there was no ice for them in the sea below
5321540	5325700	Which is always the case on the north shore of russia the ice recedes in the summer
5326340	5330180	And funny enough he says that the he says the ice is their home
5330980	5332980	No, the sea is their home
5333940	5338260	That's where the walrus lives and fishes. They don't fish actually
5338900	5341460	They dig clams on the bottom
5342340	5344660	And when the ice recedes away from the coast
5345300	5349140	And they are coming out of the water to haul out they come on the land
5349460	5354900	There's a reason why it is an officially designated walrus sanctuary this piece of land
5355300	5362180	And he implies that it's unnatural that they are coming on the land because there's not enough ice for them to get onto
5363140	5366420	When in fact they cannot exist they are a coastal species
5366740	5368740	They cannot exist deep sea
5368740	5373380	So if the ice recedes to where it's 600 feet deep or 1000 feet deep
5373860	5375380	It's no good to them
5375380	5378980	Because they are bottom feeders and as I say in my book
5379220	5386660	They are bottom feeders much like sir david attenborough and his tv crew on the planet earth or whatever our planet
5387060	5390260	right they they too are bottom feeders in this case
5391140	5396740	And they are lying because the reason the walruses left to their death
5397940	5399460	Fell to their death
5399460	5401940	They didn't walruses can't actually leap
5402580	5407540	But they plummeted to their death because a pack of polar bears was going to eat them
5408420	5414100	And instead the polar bears just walked down to where all the dead walruses were and ate them while they're dead
5414340	5419140	And i'm sure the walruses would rather be eaten while they were dead than while they were alive
5419620	5425300	So that's the deal there and he is bald face lying to the whole world about this and he continues to do it
5425300	5427300	He had people in davos in tears
5428020	5433140	Recently telling this story even though he now knows that I have busted him and so has
5433540	5435540	Susan crockford the polar bear expert
5436100	5441300	Who's also an expert in all arctic animals has busted him publicly
5441780	5445140	And he sticks to this story because bbc lets him
5446100	5446980	right
5446980	5451300	Patrick more ladies and gentlemen fake invisible catastrophes and threats of doom
5451780	5457460	Will be available on amazon in the links of the show notes below if people want to keep up to date with all of the other
5457460	5459460	Stuff that you're doing where should they go?
5460100	5463540	You will perish in flames. That's what I have to say about that
5466180	5472180	There's a little man on the front. Who's the little man? Who's the guy who was he supposed to be made up guy made up guru
5472820	5479220	Right, but you will perish in flames is I stole it from the ghostbusters. I don't know if you remember the scene where
5481460	5483460	The the short guy maranus
5484580	5490020	Approaches the horse and buggy in central park and first goes up to the horse and says
5490500	5496820	Are you the key master or something like that right to the horse and then runs off with his eyes blazing
5497700	5500660	Screaming at the driver. You will perish in flames
5501380	5505620	So, uh, that's a little guy. How many people have got how many people have got donald trump
5506740	5511140	Quoted on the back of their book talking about no, no, no, he's not quoted. He's quoting me
5511940	5518180	Yeah, yeah, but it's he that's him on the back of your book talking about your work. There's not many people that must have had that
5519860	5524260	Uh, I was very pleased that he recognized that I was telling the truth
5525860	5529540	About carbon dioxide being the primary element for all life
5530260	5535780	Etc and that there was no climate emergency or crisis as it may have been called at that time pretty impressive
5536260	5541780	That was an appearance on tucker carlson. Uh, yeah, what have you got a website? Do you have a twitter or anything like that?
5542420	5544420	Yeah, I got a twitter. It's ecosense now
5545300	5552100	Uh, and it's it's I got nearly a hundred thousand followers. They dropped back about ten thousand when a lot of people quit twitter
5552820	5559460	Uh, and but I've stayed on and I just recently I said I'm quitting twitter finally because the taliban is on it
5559540	5562740	and they're kicking all these other people off who who aren't the taliban
5563540	5569540	and uh, people I had about a thousand people come back and say stay man stay so
5570260	5577220	Because we need you here. And so it's very difficult these days to know when you should like with the the uh,
5577860	5579300	vaccine
5579300	5580260	issue
5580260	5583780	Uh, I I know that in law and in medicine
5584500	5592100	Informed consent has always been the rule that nobody is required to consent to any medical treatment surgery
5593300	5594500	needles
5594500	5596020	Uh pills
5596020	5598020	Right without their own consent
5598580	5601940	Everybody has a right as an individual to refuse treatment in other words
5602580	5606180	And they're trying to turn that on its head by threatening people with their livelihoods
5606660	5612180	And with their ability to be a normal person they might as well stamp a a brand on their forehead, right?
5612900	5614100	and
5614100	5617380	and make them second-class citizens is what they're doing and so
5618500	5621460	People are saying to me. Well, why did you get vaccinated then and
5622740	5624980	It's a trip. Well, because I want to be
5625940	5630420	But I respect the right of other people not to want to be and actually on gutfeld
5631140	5633620	uh, he had trump on the last two nights
5635220	5639380	And trump made that same point because his wife doesn't want to be vaccinated
5640340	5642020	and uh
5642020	5645780	Gutfeld and trump came to the conclusion that that was perfectly her right
5646580	5649300	That is the truth if we don't if we allow
5650180	5656820	Society to force us into medical treatments. Maybe next they'll want our skin to make lampshades, you know
5657460	5662980	So you this is a fundamental principle in medicine is informed consent and in law
5663860	5667460	And they're trying to bust it down so that they can have control over everybody
5667780	5670420	To say what they should have to have injected into their bodies
5670900	5677540	And personally, I believe the vaccines are efficacious. I also had covid was in the hospital for six days
5678260	5679620	Really sick
5679620	5685780	After I had my first vaccination it had not yet taken effect or I was one of those people who gets it anyways
5686340	5687460	but it's
5687460	5688580	normally
5688580	5691380	After two vaccinations at least you're 95 percent
5691940	5693780	Immune and now I'm
5693780	5696500	Must be close to 100 percent immune because I survived covid
5696740	5701460	But they don't take that into account. So the the fact that they're not taking covid survivors as
5702020	5709940	Equivalent to vaccinated people is also another travesty in this whole thing. So I it's like climate. It's like the climate issue in some ways
5710660	5712660	um, but it's even more
5713060	5715060	bizarre from a
5715060	5721380	Political control point of view because they're really pulling the levers here, you know and trying to make it so that
5721780	5723940	all all of their subjects are
5725140	5727380	Are subject to their whims
5728180	5730180	And we got to fight that
5730260	5734180	And so people are blaming me for not fighting it because I've got it vaccinated
5734420	5739060	So it's really complicated that way from an intellectual point of view as to I should should I join
5739620	5745620	Even though I've been vaccinated should I join the anti-vaxxers in a march? You know, no, I'm not anti-vaxxer
5746500	5747620	right
5747620	5749620	And neither is trump. He's vaccinated
5750100	5753140	Well, he brought us the product apparently
5754020	5756980	Maybe a conversation for another time patrick. Thanks so much for today
