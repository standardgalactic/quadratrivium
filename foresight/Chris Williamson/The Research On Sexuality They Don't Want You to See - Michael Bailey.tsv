0	2440	What happened with your recent article?
3160	7680	So the short answer is that our recent article has been
8480	11840	retracted by the publisher of the journal
12720	15120	Archives of Sexual Behavior where it was published
18040	24040	Retraction is something I've never had an article retracted before and it's something that I've associated with
25000	26200	terrible
26200	28200	things like
28480	30200	fraud
30200	32200	plagiarism
32840	34840	Grievous mistakes
34960	38400	None of that is true about our article
41560	43960	Frankly and honestly our article was
45200	52000	retracted because of the ideas and the evidence it presented that angered
53000	58400	Transgender activists and their allies who pressured the publisher who
60200	62200	Either agreed with them
63640	65640	based on politics or
66640	72120	Chickened out or were worried about business concerns. I can't read their mind obviously
72840	75760	But I will say that the retraction was a sham
77280	79280	I would also say that
80280	82280	The retraction has
83920	86320	Backfired entirely from their perspective
87280	92080	Our article has gotten far more attention than it ever would have
93160	96360	the publisher springer nature group
97200	99280	Keeps metrics on this
100000	105600	Our article has been downloaded almost 100,000 times, which is
106360	110160	You know, that's not perhaps a big deal for
111520	114800	Mainstream media, but for an academic article that is extreme
116000	119280	We have received more news coverage
120040	122040	we're about
122640	123720	40
123720	129480	Ranked 40 out of 400,000 articles of about the same age in terms of media coverage
130960	134680	Here we are talking, you know, I'm on a big podcast with you
135840	143840	And there have been articles and so on so I'm not hurting. I just want people to
145160	148520	download and read our article and
150840	157340	Don't pay attention to the retraction notice it it's meaningless if people want to get ahold of the now
158520	163400	Forbidden article, where are that? Where should they go? Same place? They ever did
163920	168920	Our article was published open access. That means we actually had
170120	172000	funding from
172000	175140	Society for evidence evidence-based gender medicine
176360	178360	Segem to
180480	182480	Published the article for
183280	189560	Free reading, you know most articles academic articles have a paywall that non academics
189920	192760	Can't get through easily. There's no paywall
193800	196400	The retraction simply means
197960	202320	For practical purposes that Springer stamped the words
203160	205660	retracted article on every single page of
206200	207840	the article
207840	211720	Which you could it doesn't affect your ability to read it and frankly I
213200	218240	Wear those words as a badge of honor now
218880	223920	That makes it kind of sexy it makes it it feels like it's a top-secret seal
223920	226360	So what's there's someone that's listening that wants to go and search?
226360	229920	What's what should they search for on the internet in order to get this article up in the right form?
231840	233840	So
234200	240920	What I search in order to go to the site to keep track on our current metrics
241240	246980	You know, I'm really waiting for when we get a hundred thousand dollar view. I'm sorry one hundred thousand views
247980	249980	Diaz DIA Z
250820	252820	Bailey B. A. I. L. E. Y.
254060	261100	Our O. G. D. for rapid onset gender dysphoria, which is what it's about and then you'll have
262060	267380	Links to choose from choose the one that says Springer and that'll take you right to the site
267380	272200	You can read the article right there. Okay, so we've flirted with it so far
272720	279040	What was in your forbidden study, which was so reprehensible that caused it to be
280080	282160	retracted and
282160	284160	stamped with a wax seal I
285640	286960	I'll
286960	291320	Tell you in a moment, but I just want to give a bit of background
292520	294520	this article was
295480	297480	published by me and
297640	299640	a co-author
299840	304680	Susanna Diaz that is not her real name. I don't know her real name
306040	308040	She is the mother of
308680	314720	A gender dysphoric child whom she believes has rapid onset gender dysphoria
315120	321880	Which is rapid onset gender dysphoria something we need to talk about I assume that your audience
322640	327440	Doesn't necessarily know what it is. It's very important and it is the reason
327440	329440	Why
330040	332560	The trans activists came after us
334400	336400	Rapid onset gender dysphoria is
337160	339160	the explanation of
339440	341440	the surge in
343640	349400	Cases of gender dysphoria that has happened over the past decade and especially the past five years
350920	352920	The idea is this a
354480	356480	subset of
356520	362520	Gender dysphoric cases and now it's by far the greatest percentage are
364760	366760	Adolescent girls
367680	374600	Who never showed any signs of gender dysphoria in childhood? They were not tomboy's they were not
375840	377600	masculine
377600	380560	They did however have issues a
381240	383240	lot of them had some
383520	387520	Mental health problems. They had some social problems and so on
390240	392240	In adolescence
393160	396400	They tended to hang out with a crowd that
397400	401480	was unconventional and progressive and ideological and
402840	404160	they
404160	406160	got the idea
406200	407640	Based on
407640	414120	Theology that all of their problems are due to underlying transgender that they never knew of before
415680	418480	They suddenly or rapidly
419280	425440	announced or they decided that they're transgender and they announced to their parents and
426520	433120	Many of these girls. It's mainly girls about three quarters. There may be some boys, too
433120	435480	But we should talk about them separately a
436120	441320	Lot of them are demanding very serious
443400	445920	Treatments including medical treatments
447280	449080	They want
449080	450960	testosterone
450960	452400	which
452400	454400	has very serious
455720	461960	Effects on the body and some of them want surgery like the amputation of their breasts
462680	465480	And some of them are getting this
467720	470560	Our evidence in our article is
472240	474240	Entirely consistent with that
474600	476600	We surveyed
478280	479880	1655
479880	481400	parents of
481400	484960	Youth whom the parents believed had this syndrome
486440	490040	Three-quarters were of the youth were girls
492000	494440	The parents said that indeed these
495720	497720	youth had
498160	500160	pre-existing
500200	505840	Mental health issues and that the mental health issues actually preceded any
506760	511200	indication of gender issues by four years. That's a long time
513640	515640	The
516640	523800	Youth who were most likely to socially transition now social transition means
525480	529160	Changing their pronouns changing their style of dress changing
530280	532280	What they call themselves boy or girl
533640	538280	The youth most likely to socially transition were the ones with the most problems
540240	544560	That was also true for medical transition which was
545760	548560	Thankfully rare only about seven percent
549800	555800	Had sought medical or had obtained medical treatment whereas about sixty percent had
556360	561200	Taken many steps to social transition parents said after they
562360	564360	Socially transitioned they got worse
565080	566280	and
566280	568280	The best is what does worse mean?
569160	571160	they
572160	575800	Became less happy they became less
577160	579160	Close to their parents
579640	581640	They decompensated and
582760	584760	the best predictor of
585400	587400	Transition was
591120	595440	That the family had received a referral to a gender specialist and
596440	605800	And if parents visited a gender specialist they usually felt that the gender specialist pressured them to transition their child
607440	613240	So there were some other interesting findings too, but those were the ones that got
615080	617640	People upset and I think those are probably the most
618280	623160	Important findings because they are consistent with the idea of rapid onset gender dysphoria
624160	630140	Rapid onset gender dysphoria was first proposed by Lisa Littman who published the first paper in 2018
630520	632520	She also received
632840	634840	tremendous pushback
634840	640160	Her the journal where she published her article did not retract it, but they did
641160	647280	make her make changes to her original article and she suffered personal
647800	650240	Consequences Brown University where she was
651080	653080	Cut off their ties with her
653840	655840	She you know she lost
656520	658520	contracts with Brown University
664480	672000	Activists cannot stand the idea of rapid onset gender dysphoria and I understand why
673520	678280	Because it is threatening to their belief system
679000	681480	They're strong. They strongly believe that
683000	685160	Gender dysphoria is always real and
686600	688600	that the best
688960	690960	Way to proceed is
691480	696560	To transition as quickly as possible and furthermore that youth are
697400	699440	Always right when they say
700240	702800	That they are gender dysphoric
703560	709480	That they're trans just believe them all of these are contradicted by the idea of
710440	712440	rapid onset gender dysphoria and
713000	715000	Our study was strongly
715240	717240	consistent
717240	719240	with
719840	723360	The existence of rapid onset gender dysphoria I
724040	726040	will admit
726200	728680	That ours is only the second
729560	737120	Major study of this phenomenon and there's plenty of work to do and I don't think that we've got this
737440	739640	Nailed shut so that everybody is
740440	744000	Obligated to see this world as we do
744640	746800	but it's an important study and
748600	753840	Instead of trying to silence our search it would been better
754680	755720	if
755720	758160	The skeptical had done their own studies
758960	763400	To try to clarify what they thought was going on but of course
765040	767040	They didn't want to do that
768960	773760	See if I'm right with my conception of this sort of two current
774280	780600	Explanations for what's going on with regards to the increase that we've seen over the last ten years or so
781280	783400	one theory posits that
783640	785640	The world's
786360	790800	Degree of acceptance of trans people at large has changed
791040	794800	It's called the left-handedness argument online sometimes
794840	800800	Which is that during the Middle Ages if you were left-handed you were often accused of being a witch or a wizard or something
800960	806200	And it would cause you to be ostracized or sometimes killed or punished socially in some form or another
806360	811800	Which meant that I think maybe only three percent of people were left-handed during the Middle Ages
812120	816120	But then when left-handedness is no longer seen as wicked and it's socially accepted
816120	822320	I think the true number of left-handed people is closer to maybe 12% let's say so you see an increase in the number of people who
823760	826720	Identify as left-handed I suppose they can be their true
826720	832800	So they're true left-handed selves because there is no longer social stigma attached to it. There is a camp that
833600	835600	argues that the
835800	843040	Rapid increase that we have seen in the number of people identifying as transgender over the last decades to two decades or so
843160	845160	Has been due to this
845680	849520	Releasing of the glass ceiling and and judgment by the group at large
849960	853520	The alternative theory which is being put forward is one of social contagion
854160	856160	That explains why
856760	862240	Females in particular the F to M transition are particularly susceptible to this
862960	864960	females are more
865960	872840	Socially aware socially malleable and influenced. It's part of their sort of intersexual competition and status
873960	875360	measuring
875360	877360	Apparatus that they have a greater
878320	881160	susceptibility to trends around them because they are
881520	884800	It's important for them to remain part of the tribe in that regard
884800	891240	Which would explain or be part of the explanation for why girls seem to be more impacted by this
892240	897360	Ever-increasing number. It's almost like a mimetic sort of feedback loop that's occurring
897880	902000	How far away am I and what have I missed in terms of that conception of the landscape?
902680	905240	You put it beautifully better than I did
906000	910240	So you should have got me on the paper. I could have been cancelled as well. Yes. Yes
910880	914400	You're considered yourself a co-author on future research
914840	920000	Well, I actually I can take it. I get enough stick on the internet as it is already. Okay, so
921240	923240	What is
925560	927320	First question is it
927320	934760	Impossible for these two worlds to exist together. Is there a blending of rapid-onset gender dysphoria with the
935640	940880	Activists theory about about this. Is there a way that those two worlds could coexist? It's certainly and
942400	947560	I suspect they do it's it's a question of which is predominating
948560	951240	Obviously we become
952760	957280	Much more tolerant of the transgender fairly recently I
958200	962600	Wrote a book in 2003 and people back then thought that
963520	968840	Transsexuals were really weird interesting but weird and people were uncomfortable around them
969360	973280	now I think if anything they're thought to be
974000	975520	cool
975520	977520	and
978560	980560	I'm glad that
981600	985280	Tolerance has increased for the transgender
986920	990320	But I also think that it's important to realize
992320	993680	That
993680	995680	There may be trade-offs I
996760	1002920	Don't think we need to be intolerant, but I do think that we need to be aware that
1004520	1007200	Attitudes affect what people choose to do
1008520	1010520	Being transgender is
1011840	1014400	Partly a decision that a person makes
1017480	1022400	Take a very for example a very masculine female
1023520	1028160	Well, she might decide well, you know, I'm not just a masculine
1029600	1034520	Teenage girl. I like playing baseball. You know, I'll just be a girl
1035520	1039760	But or she may say well gosh, you know, I
1042080	1044080	Could imagine being a boy plus
1045920	1051280	You know, I get a lot of cred if I am transsexual and
1053880	1062000	Also really something we haven't mentioned yet which is happening which I think is negative is the binding up of
1064720	1067240	transgender identity and victim status and
1068320	1070320	I just think that
1071280	1073280	That's a problem with our
1073800	1078640	World right now that we're promoting victim status not just among the transgender
1078640	1081880	But all kinds of phenomena and I just think it's very negative
1082800	1090640	It creates a perverse incentive for people to pedestalize things which are actually negative in the long term
1091200	1098320	Yes, self-harm, you know, if self-harm gives you a degree of prestige somehow in whatever
1098680	1100680	upside down vastal world it is
1101080	1106040	There is now an incentive for people to do a thing which there should be a disincentive for them to do
1107400	1113920	So you there is social renown now for self-harm or for
1114800	1117280	MP a
1117280	1121720	Multiple personality disorder. I don't know whether you saw on tiktok last year. There was a trend of people
1122200	1124800	They would have that others. I can't remember what the word was
1124800	1129720	It's like that other the other versions of them would would come out and I'm a this person and I'm at that person
1130200	1132200	Which again, you know
1132360	1137880	I'm pretty sure who was the guy that created eugenics who was the dude that did it in the 1900s
1138080	1140080	Francis Galton Francis Galton
1140600	1145160	Managed to make himself go insane by worshiping a doll as a deity
1145600	1146640	right
1146640	1153880	My point being that you can you can induce all manner of crazy psychological maladies if you believe them hard enough
1154520	1156520	that so I don't want to
1157560	1162800	Way in on Galton because I don't know what you're just talking about and I do know a fair about
1163960	1165880	Fair amount about Galton
1165880	1172200	But what the other thing that you said the key thing is absolutely true and really important and really fascinating that
1173560	1175560	If people believe
1176360	1178320	They can
1178320	1183720	Enact all kinds of things and when I say enact I don't mean they're pretending exactly
1184400	1186400	They're acting as if
1187960	1190360	They're acting in accordance with their beliefs
1190920	1194320	This is not the first go-around were for multiple personality disorder
1194320	1196320	We had an epidemic in the
1197160	1200360	early 1990s that was associated with an
1201640	1205400	Epidemic of recovered memories of sexual abuse. This was
1206600	1213000	young women typically who went to therapy with a therapist who believed in this
1213800	1215800	who persuaded these
1216880	1219240	Women that their fathers typically
1219920	1227920	Had sexual severely sexually abused them repeatedly over years despite these women never having any
1230120	1232560	Memory of this and of course these memories
1233960	1235960	These recovered memories were false
1236560	1238440	They didn't happen
1238440	1240440	and a subset of these women
1241240	1244600	also came to believe that they were more personality disorder and
1245480	1250720	I think that this what's happening now with ROGD rapid onset gender dysphoria is
1252400	1259320	The same thing and the women that the the big difference is that the girls this is happening to
1260120	1266520	Are getting it younger 14 15 16 instead of 24 25 26 and
1267280	1272000	They're getting it from their peers rather than a therapist. Otherwise I suspect
1272640	1274120	the same
1274160	1276960	kinds of people are involved at both
1277960	1280460	epidemics both times why
1282760	1285240	Why would it be the case that there are
1287120	1289120	Psychological risk factors like
1290160	1291360	OCD
1291360	1296640	autism spectrum disorder and a few others. Why would they be predictive of
1297640	1299640	ROGD?
1300400	1304600	Autism gets thrown around a lot as very common. I
1306480	1311280	Am not as impressed as many people are by the evidence for autism
1312440	1314440	for one
1314880	1316880	Diagnosis of autism
1317640	1325120	Has become so vague. I don't even know what it means anymore. It's become quite over diagnosed
1326000	1333120	The youth in our study did have an excess of
1334120	1337960	Formal diagnoses, but they were very general anxiety and depression
1340200	1342200	Why would
1343280	1346960	Women with these emotional problems have this susceptibility
1348240	1350520	I'm not sure the
1351520	1354680	1990s epidemic these were
1355760	1357560	somewhat older
1357560	1359400	individuals and so they had
1359400	1361400	More time to get accurate
1362160	1366320	Diagnoses and the number one associated diagnosis was borderline
1367080	1373680	Personality disorder which is associated with identity disturbance not knowing exactly who you are
1374240	1377240	What you want to be being manipulative being?
1377240	1381720	Prone to extreme emotions
1383160	1388760	Now do I have an explanation why it's they who
1390400	1397520	Are most susceptible to these false ideas. I don't think I do I don't think I do I
1399080	1405720	Had a conversation with David Geary a couple of months ago and David what do you fascinating guy?
1406240	1411360	Absolutely fascinating phenomenal episode and one of the things that I learned when speaking to him
1411360	1415640	He was the first person that introduced me to the concept of rapid onset gender dysphoria
1416400	1418400	the group
1418400	1419960	that
1419960	1421040	the
1421040	1427120	Another ideology that would be associated with some of the people who seem to be suffering rapid on debt gender
1427280	1432320	Rapid onset gender dysphoria would be a denial of biological differences between men and women
1433320	1439360	The fascinating thing that's oddly sort of recursive and cyclical and almost ironic if it wasn't so
1440160	1442160	odd is that
1442320	1448240	The very reason that we have a sexed difference in the number of F to M transitions is
1448760	1450760	precisely because of
1450760	1456400	The biological difference between men and women it is the biological difference between men and women that
1456760	1459920	predisposes these very goals to the
1460560	1464640	Increased susceptibility of transition and that's the same group that is denying it
1464640	1470240	So it's both the supply and the demand and the denial that kind of all rolled up into one. Do you know what I mean?
1470600	1472600	yeah, they have a very
1473000	1479280	strange set of beliefs that are mutually contradictory for example, they they believe in the
1479800	1481480	idea of
1481480	1488240	innate gender identity that may be hidden and so on but if it's an innate gender identity then and
1488840	1492960	That men usually have one and women usually have another
1493800	1496120	That's got to be a biological difference
1497960	1499960	Yeah, I I
1502040	1504280	Think that their science is
1505680	1507680	Not very
1507880	1511960	Coherent scientific. I don't think that's gonna be a very
1512680	1515920	Useful way to persuade them
1516600	1518600	What are the
1518680	1524280	Given you've had this relative landmark study, you know one of only two massive n-size of whatever it was
1525520	1527520	1655 pears
1529000	1536160	1655 parents okay reporting on each parent reporting on a child of theirs. Yeah, yeah
1536480	1537680	Um
1537680	1543180	What do you what are the implications of this moving forward? What have you thought about sort of next steps and such?
1543680	1549640	Well, I don't know my next step. I'm a you know, I'm an academic. I'm a researcher. I'm not a
1550640	1552560	clinician I
1552560	1554720	Think that we need to get
1555920	1558120	better and more detailed
1559720	1561720	Evidence and I'm involved in
1562080	1565720	What I think is going to be a really important
1567440	1572760	Study that is about to launch this summer it's in collaboration with Lisa Lippman
1572840	1580680	Who is the person who first studied rabbit on set gender dysphoria and Ken Zucker who is one of the world's leading?
1581160	1583160	experts in gender dysphoria
1584120	1586120	All three of us have
1587240	1589560	Been canceled at least once
1590520	1592760	Uh, so we're uh the
1594600	1596600	Collaborate cancelled collaborate
1597960	1603960	Collaboration, but uh, we also are experts who are unafraid to stay in here
1605080	1608360	We're in this study. We're going to be recruiting both
1610120	1614360	Gender dysphoric adolescents directly and their families
1615320	1620600	And we have a very extensive survey about you know mental health and
1621720	1625000	gender feelings about gender history of gender
1625880	1628440	Steps taken toward transition and so on
1629720	1635960	We hope to enroll thousands and we're going to follow these people up over five years at least
1637080	1640200	To see how they turn out and to see how that affects happiness
1641000	1647720	Are the ones who transition going to eventually be happier than the ones who didn't
1648760	1650760	For example, that's that's a big question
1652280	1655320	Fascinating. Yeah, fascinating. I suppose it's one of those things were
1657400	1658920	Being able to
1658920	1663000	Spin explanations without the scientific backing can be done at lightning speed
1663320	1667480	But being able to test the hypotheses with science is actually a pretty arduous task
1667800	1674040	So you are always going to be playing catch up behind whatever the wake is that's left in terms of people's bro signs
1675560	1677560	That's exactly right
1678040	1682200	We sometimes have been frustrated ourselves. The scientific process
1683800	1686840	Is slow in part for bureaucratic reasons
1687400	1689400	We have to be very careful
1689480	1694040	To get ethics approval for this which by the way was the reason
1694280	1699880	The ostensible reason not the true reason the ostensible reason why
1701000	1705960	My latest article was retracted. What's the story there? What what what was the reason that they gave you?
1707480	1709480	The reason was this
1710920	1713240	Susanna Diaz is not an academic
1715560	1718600	She just went ahead and put up a survey
1719480	1721320	She's allowed to do that
1721400	1723800	She's allowed to publish such a survey
1724920	1726920	I am an academic
1728040	1730040	I have constraints
1730360	1732920	Any research that I do I have to get approved
1733480	1737080	By something called an institutional review board IRB
1738280	1740120	for ethics
1740120	1742120	Now the data were already collected
1744280	1749640	It's too late to go through IRB I checked with my IRB and they said well
1751400	1753240	She didn't have to
1753240	1754280	and
1754280	1756280	You seem to be okay
1756520	1758520	Being a co-author on this
1759480	1764360	But Susanna have not done this very legalistic thing
1766600	1769320	That was a conventional
1770840	1773000	Informed consent which is basically
1773880	1775880	This is exactly what you're going to be doing
1776440	1778440	Do you consent?
1778840	1780840	That is
1781640	1783640	What springer
1783880	1789080	Said was lacking. That's why they retracted the article. Here's why that's ridiculous
1790920	1796440	She made it very clear to parents what the survey was about
1800120	1803800	They agreed by actually completing the survey
1804520	1806520	The last line of the survey said
1807240	1810360	We're going to publish this online when we get enough data
1810920	1814920	And that's something that springer also said she said you didn't tell them
1815720	1819480	That their data were going to be published. Well, of course, they want this published
1820120	1822120	they believe these parents
1822360	1824360	are sick
1824360	1826360	Of rogd being
1827800	1830360	Shoved to the side being silenced
1830680	1834680	That's part of the reason why they wanted to participate in the first place
1836440	1837560	So
1837560	1839560	That that's the reason they gave
1840280	1842280	I don't believe it for a second
1842280	1848840	But you know in our new research that we will be launching soon. We went through all the IRB
1850280	1852440	Procedure we are so covered
1853560	1858280	That uh, there's not going to be any chance of any problem like that
1859240	1865000	Moving on to some of the other work that you've done. What is the typical sexual orientation of
1865880	1869000	F to m and m to f people who identify as trans?
1873480	1875880	Well, I want to start with
1878360	1880360	What was typical
1882040	1884520	20 years ago and
1885400	1886520	And
1886520	1888520	Before which which was
1889960	1891960	Pretty well established
1892840	1897960	Back then most f2m's that is natal females who wanted to become
1899320	1901320	men first of all they were
1903080	1906280	Adults before they were able to achieve that there was no
1907720	1912120	transitioning of children or even adolescents
1914680	1917720	Almost all of the female the males were female attracted
1919480	1922360	Or in the vernacular of
1923560	1927320	Sexology homosexual female the male transsexuals
1928280	1930280	Uh, though about 10 percent
1931240	1933320	Were, um, attracted to
1935080	1937080	Men
1938440	1940440	For male the female
1940600	1943320	These are natal female. I'm sorry natal males
1944040	1946040	Who want to become women?
1946200	1948200	There were two types
1949000	1951000	The first type was
1951800	1957480	The type perhaps we are most familiar with the kind that comes to mind immediately it would be a
1958360	1961960	A male who was feminine from early childhood
1962600	1964600	Little boy who wanted to be a girl
1964760	1967080	Who became an adolescent who was
1968040	1973800	Basically a girl and then uh when he could get surgery he did in adulthood
1975560	1978440	That type uh was male attracted
1979640	1981080	and
1981080	1985240	Sexology called that a homosexual male the female transsexual
1988760	1995800	Jazz ginnings, I don't know if you know who jazz ginnings is she's a reality tv show
1997160	1998760	I
1998760	2001880	Have considered her that type though. I'm less sure now for
2003000	2005000	uh various reasons, but
2005560	2007160	the other type
2007160	2008360	is
2008360	2012360	At least as common, but it is quite unfamiliar because
2013960	2017240	Nobody talks about it and it is autogynophilic
2017880	2019880	male to female transsexualism
2020280	2022920	Autogynophilia is a sexual
2024520	2026520	Orientation I guess
2027320	2029000	whereby
2029000	2033640	A man is sexually aroused by the idea of being a woman
2037960	2039960	Most of these
2040040	2046440	Natal males are attracted to other people in the world and they're attracted to women
2048120	2050120	But they are also
2050120	2057560	Attracted to and sometimes much more attracted to a woman that they create inside themselves
2059640	2061640	It starts
2061720	2064040	typically in adolescence where they
2065240	2070440	Will put on their mothers panties and bra look at themselves in the mirror and masturbate
2072040	2074040	fetishistic cross-dressing
2074520	2079000	Many of them will have fantasies about having breasts and a vulva
2079880	2084920	And some of them will actually do what they need to to get those
2088120	2090920	Autogynophilia is very controversial because
2092920	2094920	Trans activists have tried to
2097880	2099880	Sweep it under the rug
2100040	2104920	They're embarrassed by it. I'm not I don't judge these people
2104920	2106920	Also
2108680	2110680	Many autogynophilic
2111640	2113160	transgender
2113160	2115160	persons
2115320	2117320	It experience
2117320	2119800	The theory as a narcissistic injury
2120440	2123000	Because it really means a lot to them
2123880	2126600	To think of themselves as like women
2128600	2131560	The theory says they're not like women
2132520	2136760	They're men with this weird sexuality
2138360	2140360	And so that hurts their feelings
2141800	2146120	So I published a book in 2003 called the man who would be queen
2146840	2148680	and
2148680	2150280	only
2150280	2151960	about
2151960	2153960	A third of the book
2154360	2155960	was about
2155960	2157800	adult transsexualism
2157800	2159800	including autogynophilia
2159800	2162360	And the trans activists back then
2163560	2167560	A few of them got so mad at what I wrote that they tried to ruin my life
2170200	2172200	Briefly, I thought they might
2175640	2178840	But you know, they did back then what
2180760	2184360	Is happening to our paper now they they caused a Streisand effect
2185400	2187400	so
2187880	2192200	More and more people have heard of autogynophilia including
2198760	2206680	Persons with autogynophilia and I want to stress that many of the many autogynophilic males are great people
2209000	2212440	In my experience if they are open and honest
2213160	2221080	They're admirable. I have many autogynophilic followers on twitter
2222520	2225880	I have some autogynophilic friends and so on
2228520	2231880	And these people are angry
2233960	2238920	Have the activists who have tried to censor any discussion of autogynophilia
2239000	2241000	It has
2243960	2246200	Prevented us from knowing
2247800	2252360	Things like the best way that autogynophilic individuals should live their lives
2253160	2256280	Should they transition should they not transition?
2259480	2262680	We don't know the study studies haven't been done because
2264280	2267160	People haven't even felt free to ask the questions
2268120	2270120	Is there a
2270520	2274280	natal female equivalent? Have you ever come across anyone?
2275240	2278120	That is the opposite of autogynophilia
2281000	2283000	This is controversial
2284120	2290120	That should be that should be the preface for every single sentence that you say this is controversial
2290280	2295400	I would say scientifically. I don't think anybody is politically upset about this at least yet
2296280	2301320	Give it time. So the word for that would be autogynophilia
2302600	2304040	and
2304040	2306040	I know
2308360	2310360	Trends gender
2312760	2318520	Persons who insist that there really is autogynophilia
2320520	2323720	There's a guy who named phil illy
2324680	2326440	i l
2326440	2327640	phil
2327640	2330680	illy il y I think he's about to
2331800	2333320	publish a book
2333320	2334600	called
2334600	2336600	auto heterosexuality
2337080	2339080	very smart guy
2339160	2342520	But he believes that autogynophilia
2344600	2348760	Occurs commonly among transgender females
2349560	2352600	I am less convinced. You know, I'm I'm being a hard-ass
2353560	2355560	scientist, you know, I
2356520	2358520	May be but I
2358600	2362600	I kind of doubt it because male and female sexuality are so different
2363560	2368040	Autogynophilia is something that requires a male type
2370440	2373000	Sexuality which is very focused and fixed
2374120	2375960	and strong
2375960	2377960	and autogynophilia
2378440	2380200	occurs
2380200	2382200	kind of
2382200	2386120	genetically a male finds out on his own and becomes
2386840	2388840	Even though he's never heard of it before
2389640	2392120	It dominates his early sex life
2393000	2395000	and I'm really
2395000	2397000	kind of skeptical that that happens
2397640	2399640	In natal females, but we'll see
2399720	2401160	we'll see does that
2401160	2403480	if someone and if it's common
2404280	2407880	That somebody that's never heard of it before kind of stumbles upon this thing
2408600	2410360	this particular
2410360	2412360	interest this orientation
2412680	2415400	Does that suggest that there is a biological
2416280	2418280	disposition precursor?
2420280	2422280	I would bet
2424200	2427160	More money than I have that we will
2428200	2434360	Find that eventually. I think autogynophilia is strongly biological. Now. Can I prove that? No
2435800	2437800	but
2437960	2439960	What is going to make
2441160	2443160	A 14 year old boy
2443160	2447800	Decide to put on his mother's panties and go into the bathroom and look at himself and
2448360	2450360	Become aroused and so on
2450920	2452920	Nobody teaches him that
2453160	2457160	You know, there's a lot of I should hope not. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of interest now
2457960	2459960	especially among
2460040	2462040	gender critical types about
2462680	2465400	something called sissy hypnoporn, which is
2466200	2470360	It's a type of pornography consumed by
2471400	2474440	Autogynophilic males and they're saying that
2475880	2480360	This porn is creating autogynophilia. Well, I don't believe it. I feel like
2481160	2482680	these guys
2482680	2489080	Have this interest and they're finding the porn. I I don't think anything plausibly is going to
2489800	2491800	To
2492120	2496280	Raise this idea in somebody that doesn't already have the interest
2498360	2502360	The other word that I learned when looking at some of your work is
2503320	2505320	morphophilia
2505640	2509480	One of the longest words I think I've ever said in my life. What's gynandromorphophilia?
2511320	2516440	Gynandromorphophilia, so I'm gonna say a word that I I think is fine, but
2516440	2518440	Um
2518760	2520760	Some people are touchy about it
2521160	2525160	Gynandromorphophilia is a sexual attraction to she males
2526120	2528120	What I mean by a she male
2528360	2530360	is a natal male
2532200	2537400	Trans woman who has both breast and a penis still
2539160	2541160	Um
2541640	2546040	You know, I I can see it. I can see I can I can see it in my mind's eye. Yep. Well
2547320	2549320	It's not hard to find it
2549720	2553480	online that that is a kind of pornography. I have come across
2554840	2556840	And it actually is
2557320	2559320	quite a common form
2559720	2561720	of pornography
2561880	2563880	and even I think just
2564760	2566920	Plano normal straight men
2567880	2569880	Get into that sometimes
2570040	2573080	But they're they're different than the kind of men
2573560	2577560	Who need that and prefer it and for example, I had a
2581080	2585480	I had a girlfriend at one time whose ex-husband
2589800	2594200	Had that preference and in order for them to have sex
2596840	2602600	They needed to bring a picture of a she male on the computer screen so he could look at it
2603720	2605560	and become aroused
2605560	2607560	That became a problem for her
2607560	2613640	I can imagine I can imagine that that would create complications. Yes. Yeah, but that's you know, I some other
2614520	2616520	Just plain old. I think
2617080	2619080	mostly just plain old straight men
2619560	2621720	They just I think don't have the hang up
2622360	2624520	about the penis being there too
2625800	2632440	This is what you know back in the 90s, you know on allen partridge, which is a famous british comedy show
2633080	2639080	One of his friends it turns out was going to thailand and he comes back and all he wants to hear about is the ladyboys
2639400	2644760	He all he wants to hear about is ladyboys. Tell me about the ladyboys. He keeps on saying. Yeah
2646040	2653160	That's right. The ladyboys. That's that's what they are. Yeah, they still tour as ladyboys of Bangkok in the uk
2653240	2658360	I don't know if that's the same in the u.s. But I mean there's posters everywhere for ladyboys of Bangkok
2659320	2661720	to my knowledge they don't come here, but um
2663240	2665240	You know, there are
2666120	2669880	She mail escorts that you can find online
2672680	2674680	I I knew
2676120	2678120	In writing my book
2678440	2684760	The 2003 book called the man who would be queen. I actually at that time knew some transsexual
2687400	2689400	Prostitutes
2690360	2692360	Some of whom had worked
2693240	2695400	as she mail prostitutes and then they
2696680	2699080	Uh got surgery and continue to work
2700040	2701160	as
2701160	2703160	female prostitutes
2703320	2704440	um
2704440	2709560	Opening opening up to as many markets as possible. Yeah. Yeah. Well the one that I'm thinking of
2710680	2712680	preferred the
2713640	2716600	The men who liked women to the men who liked she mails
2717720	2721720	I think she thought that the ones who liked she mails
2723480	2724600	Uh
2724600	2731720	I don't know that they treated her differently as as a very interesting. So this is this is an obvious
2732200	2733160	uh
2733160	2735160	follow-up which is
2735240	2740120	Is this a new category of sexual orientation? Are these people closer to gay?
2740760	2742680	People or are they closer to straight people?
2744360	2748440	Great question and so I can answer the second part of that question
2749160	2752920	They are very close to straight people. They're not at all gay
2753800	2755800	guys guys who get into she mails
2756680	2758680	So if we bring these guys in the lab
2759400	2767000	And we show them pornography featuring just women and the the kind that we use in this situation is two women
2767880	2769880	having sex with each other
2770040	2772040	female female porn and
2772600	2774600	male male male porn
2775320	2777320	uh, those are
2777320	2779320	the kind best kind of
2780440	2783720	Stimually because if somebody gets aroused there's no
2785080	2787560	Ambiguity about who they're getting aroused by
2788520	2789880	um
2789880	2793800	Guys who are into she mails get aroused to the females but not the males
2794600	2797000	But they get slightly more aroused to
2797880	2799480	videos
2799480	2801480	Of two she mails getting it on
2802200	2807720	And that's a little different than typical straight men who get more aroused
2808280	2810280	by two females
2810280	2812040	than two she mails
2812040	2812920	but
2812920	2814920	neither
2814920	2816920	Guy Nant Guy Nant or morphophiles
2817400	2818760	nor
2818760	2821240	regular straight men get aroused
2821800	2822680	to
2822680	2824200	two men getting it on
2824200	2825240	right
2825240	2830680	Next next obvious follow-up question to that is I've heard you say that heterosexual women are
2831080	2833080	Genitally indifferent
2833720	2835720	What does that mean?
2836200	2838040	I would say
2838040	2841480	Not just genitally indifferent. They're I think that they're
2843400	2845400	Conscious feelings
2845400	2847800	Are indifferent in the laboratory
2848600	2850600	to erotica
2851160	2852920	so
2852920	2854760	If we bring
2854760	2859880	Women into the lab and we show them the same kinds of stimuli two men having sex
2860360	2862360	two women having sex
2863720	2865720	Straight women
2866120	2868120	Show an indifferent pattern
2868360	2871880	Of genital arousal. They get equally aroused to both by both
2872680	2874680	And they get and they say
2875000	2877000	They get equally aroused by both now
2877640	2878680	they don't
2878680	2880680	get that aroused
2882280	2884120	Psychologically
2884120	2889160	They don't straight women do not get as aroused to watching either kinds of
2890440	2892440	erotic stimuli that I just mentioned
2893080	2895080	as either straight men do
2895720	2897720	or gay men do
2897960	2900680	But it is interesting that they seem to show this
2901640	2903320	flat pattern
2903320	2905320	lesbians in contrast
2905320	2906280	do
2906280	2907240	show
2907240	2908840	both a
2908840	2912440	genital preference and a subjective preference
2913160	2915800	for female stimuli is there
2916600	2918840	a vestigial arousal among
2919480	2921480	lesbians for men
2924600	2926520	lesbians do
2926520	2928520	get more aroused by
2928840	2930920	male stimuli than they do
2931720	2933720	to nature scenes
2934120	2939960	But what about do they get more aroused to gay men than gay men do to lesbians?
2943080	2945560	These questions are hard to answer
2946520	2950040	These are the studies that we need Michael. These are the these are the hard
2950680	2955080	charging questions that we need. Well, they're hard to answer because the kinds of
2957560	2959560	apparatus that
2959960	2965480	You must use to measure genital arousal and men differs from that
2966120	2970440	That you must use to measure it in women and the best evidence that we have
2971720	2973720	we've taken it out of
2974600	2977240	the genitals into the brain. We've done
2978280	2980280	fmri scanning
2980440	2982440	of
2982520	2984440	people
2984440	2986440	looking at erotic stimuli
2987400	2992600	And it pretty much shows the same patterns as the genital stuff does
2995640	2997640	And your excellent question I
2998440	3000440	I
3000680	3003960	Think I'm gonna have to hold off answering because I don't remember
3006040	3011240	That's fine. So we kind of I remember I um, I had a conversation with
3012200	3017640	Christina Durante and she taught me about a study where they brought
3020520	3023960	Women into a lab and they sat them down opposite
3024920	3032360	Two different guys one guy was really nerdy and one guy was kind of a bad boy leather jacket and sort of like quaffed hair and stuff like that
3033000	3033880	and
3033880	3035080	they
3035080	3037080	analyzed the
3037800	3039800	verbal responses and the
3040920	3044120	Physical responses that women had to each of these different men
3045000	3051240	Now they had a oscar winning film writer some award-winning film writer write the script that the
3051960	3057640	Gentleman actor was using so it's like, you know, if you were going to cut it the cool guys like if you come with me
3057640	3060040	I'll show you the best night of your life and it's going to be really cool
3060040	3065320	But I don't really care so it kind of it doesn't really matter so much very very high status prestige prestige prestige
3065960	3070440	Uh, whereas on the other hand the other guy was something else. Now the interesting thing is it was the same guy
3071080	3076520	The same guy was playing both roles. They just styled him differently in his mannerisms had been adjusted
3077160	3079320	one of the most interesting takeaways was
3080280	3084360	There was a a number of uh, lesbian female attracted women
3085080	3091080	Who were in the study and when they looked at their behavior with the lower status man
3092280	3097000	It seemed relatively straightforward when they looked at their behavior with the highest status man
3097240	3101560	even though they had a self report of not being attracted to him and
3101960	3107720	Their verbal behavior wasn't particularly forthcoming. Their non-verbal behavior was much more flirtatious
3108280	3114600	So they were playing with the hair more. They were kind of leaning in they were pouting a little bit more and what that kind of
3115560	3118680	Suggested to me, which I think kind of leads into some of your work
3119320	3121320	is that
3121320	3124200	Even for women who are not attracted to men for a very long time
3124920	3128600	Men have been the gatekeepers to so much with regards to
3129400	3132760	survivability reproduction protection resources, etc
3133400	3135400	that it feels like even
3136360	3138360	Exclusively female attracted women
3139720	3141560	Just keep this
3141560	3147400	Skill set in the locker room somewhere where if they need to deploy it because the chieftains come over
3147880	3152600	And she's just finished up with her girlfriend that nobody knows about secretly in a in a cave somewhere
3153080	3155080	uh, that she can still kind of
3155560	3158200	Turn it on and I thought that that was really interesting
3159160	3162680	That is really interesting. I wasn't familiar with that
3163320	3165320	also, I think that
3166040	3168040	lesbians
3168120	3171800	Women who identify as lesbians are not as exclusively
3173960	3178840	Female attracted as gay men are male attracted even if they
3180200	3182200	might deny that
3182520	3183960	lesbians
3183960	3185960	Are more likely than gay men
3186680	3187720	to
3187720	3189720	Become non-lesbian
3190360	3193480	You know relapse to go back. Yeah, there's
3195400	3201320	A researcher named lisa diamond who has studied something she calls female fluidity which
3202760	3204760	Refers to women's
3205400	3207400	greater propensity
3207640	3209640	to
3210040	3214760	I don't know become romantically interested in somebody regardless of their
3215400	3217400	natal sex and
3217720	3223080	Not all women do this and there are some, you know, let's say gold star lesbians who
3223240	3224360	Uh
3224360	3226360	would never
3226360	3228360	go for a man, but
3229080	3232920	I think there are more lesbians who have the capacity
3233880	3235880	For sexual attraction to men
3236440	3242120	Okay, so in your opinion, then is males sexual men's sexual orientation is more fixed and
3243000	3244600	Is more malleable?
3244600	3247960	Absolutely, and that's that's part of the reason why men but not women
3250360	3252200	Not many women
3252200	3255000	Have parapherias, which are these weird
3255640	3257240	sexual interests
3257240	3259960	Autogonophilia is a parapheria, but some others
3261000	3263000	are for example
3263240	3268440	Pedophilia sexual attraction to children. What's the what's the amputee one? What's that one?
3269080	3272600	That is called acrotomophilia. Thank you. Yeah
3273720	3274760	Right
3274760	3276760	Yes, which we've been studying
3277080	3282200	That there's um and zoophilia attraction to animals
3284120	3286120	Uh lipophilia, which is
3286680	3292760	Attraction to morbidly obese people and the guys who are into them tend to be just normal weight guys
3293640	3301720	Uh, and we just we have a paper that is about to be published. It's uh accepted and I'm working on the proof now, which I think is
3303400	3305640	He modestly says I think it's very interesting
3306520	3310760	But we studied we we studied guys into amputees
3311400	3315640	Guys into animals and guys into the really huge fat people
3316680	3320280	And for each of these three kinds of parapherias
3321160	3323160	A lot of these guys
3323320	3325320	also have the
3327640	3332520	Inversion they are sexually aroused by the idea of becoming
3333320	3335320	Yes
3335720	3337720	fat person and animal
3338760	3340760	uh, which you know
3342920	3346040	And and I think we have about 10
3347800	3351880	Guys into amputees who've actually managed somehow to get amputations
3352440	3355560	Wow, so I first learned this from dr. James Cantor
3356360	3362920	and spoke to him about it and and he described it in this really lovely way, which was um a lot of the
3363320	3369080	Sexual let's just call a lot of the parapherias that people have and and the odd fetishes that people are turned on by
3370040	3374840	Is reflected both outwardly and inwardly. So there are people who are attracted to amputees
3375160	3378920	There are people who see themselves as amputees. They have their limbs
3379160	3383560	They have all of their limbs, but they feel like they should not they feel like they shouldn't have that
3383800	3386760	He also, uh, I don't know whether you believe that this is true
3387160	3389560	Said that there are people who are attracted to children
3389960	3392680	And there are people who see themselves as children
3393080	3397880	There are men often who want to be dressed up as babies. We did the first study of this
3398600	3400120	Kevin my
3400120	3405160	PhD student Kevin sue and I did a first study of auto pedophilia and
3406280	3409800	That's right. Uh, and the most ethical form of pedophilia
3411000	3414760	Yeah, and when a really interesting finding of that, um
3415400	3417240	study was that
3417240	3421400	Men some of these men are attracted to boys. Some are attracted to girls
3422120	3425480	Well, the the guys who are attracted to girls
3426840	3431480	Are sexually aroused by the idea of being a little girl
3433080	3435080	Not a little boy, which is interesting
3436760	3440280	So you have it that is a great way to
3440760	3441880	prove
3441880	3445320	That the relationship outwardly and inwardly is the same
3445720	3452840	Yeah, because otherwise you wouldn't have this relationship between the two. That's so interesting. Why is everyone not a sex researcher?
3452920	3458920	Why is everyone not doing para paraffilia sex research the same way? Yeah, so interesting
3459800	3461800	Oh, okay. So
3461800	3469640	In your opinion does bisexuality truly exist in men like how how accurate do you think the stereotype is that bisexual women
3469960	3472360	Are really straight and that bisexual men are really gay
3475560	3480600	In I think it was 2005 we published a paper
3482360	3483720	Um
3483720	3486280	That failed to find evidence
3487480	3490280	That male bisexuality truly existed
3491000	3492120	where
3492120	3495880	By that, I mean that men in the laboratory would show
3496840	3499240	Arousal to both men and to women
3500760	3505000	Uh that did not did not make us popular. We were um
3505640	3508280	You know it got us into the news but not
3508920	3510360	liked
3510360	3514360	We have kept studying this by we I and my
3514920	3519080	Then graduate student now. He's a professor in england garyl freeger
3520680	3522760	And we've uh gotten
3524520	3526520	several hundred
3527160	3529160	Uh
3530200	3533160	Several hundred uh subjects in the lab
3533880	3540440	And uh two years ago we published in proceedings of national academy of sciences
3541400	3543400	A paper in which we
3545160	3550200	Showed beyond the shadow of a doubt that male bisexuality truly exists
3552360	3554360	Um
3554920	3557880	There is a subset of bisexual men who
3558520	3563960	Clearly produce arousal to male stimuli and to female stimuli
3566760	3571960	Most of them are somewhat more aroused by one sex than by the other. They're not exactly
3572520	3582280	Into predominantly gay or a predominantly straight bisexual man. Yeah. Yeah, but they're they're a bit bisexual. Yes. So I now
3583960	3586520	Believe for sure in male bisexuality
3587480	3589480	At the same time
3590040	3592040	If you talk to gay men
3593800	3597640	Ask just ask them this question. Did you ever say you were bisexual?
3598440	3600440	About half of gay men will say yeah
3600680	3603400	Then you say well, were you really bisexual in the same? No
3604440	3606440	So it really does
3607400	3609400	happen that
3609480	3611480	Some men misrepresent
3612440	3615400	Being bisexual, but it also seems to happen that
3616040	3622600	Some men are bisexual as I would understand that understood, but it's a small cohort and also
3623240	3626920	You it's difficult to stress test whether this is the thin end of the wedge
3627640	3629640	en route to becoming a
3630040	3636040	Fully fledged member of the gay community or whether you're actually going to just stop at the letter b. Yeah, that's interesting
3636600	3638200	um
3638200	3644760	What what about environmental influences on sexual orientation? So we have at the moment
3645800	3647800	in korea
3647800	3655160	A very sort of sex negative culture, which you'll probably be familiar with where there is the four b's movement women who are recanting
3656120	3659960	I can't remember what the four different b's stand for it in korean, but it's it's men
3660440	3665640	and patriarchy and family and work or kids or something like that and it is
3666280	3668280	downstream of a whatever
3668440	3673320	less than one birth rate and it kind of just it's everything's korea is just a mess, but
3673640	3677320	That seems like whether it be
3679240	3681800	outright celibacy slash abstinence or
3683720	3685960	Turning to lesbianism. I don't know whether that's true
3687880	3690920	That is a sexual orientation response
3691640	3698200	To an ecological or environmental cue right something has happened that has changed maybe the sex ratio
3698600	3699880	maybe the
3699880	3703640	Mate value of the potential available partners that are around
3705080	3708600	Downstream from that we have declining birth rates across the west, too
3708680	3714520	We have an increase in cohort of high performing women and an increase in cohort of underperforming men
3715720	3721080	Hypogamously that means that maybe women are going to be struggling to find men that are of the mate value that they would desire
3721400	3724760	Even though we're in a society which has been the most sort of sex positive
3725400	3729640	Ostensibly than it's ever been. I think that there is a bit of a sex recession going on. There's a great
3731240	3733240	Article in the Atlantic about this
3733560	3735560	So with all of this folded together
3735560	3741000	How how malleable is sexual orientation in response to the local environment?
3741000	3744440	And could you foresee a future given where we're at?
3745320	3749400	Sexually and with the mating crisis at the moment that this could continue in the future
3749720	3756840	This is another one of those times when it's important to distinguish
3759160	3761160	Male and female sexuality
3762920	3766280	And this is what i'm going to say is speculative because
3768040	3773000	This hasn't been established and there's a lot of disagreement, but my
3774200	3776200	gut sense is that
3776680	3779800	Men's sexuality is not going to be responsive
3781320	3783320	to
3783880	3785880	Cultural pressure much
3787400	3788840	I say much
3788840	3793640	Because there are parts of the world where men will have sex
3794600	3796600	with other men
3797160	3799720	Other males let's not call them men
3799880	3801880	Men
3802200	3808280	If the males are presenting as very feminine and perhaps
3809480	3810680	transgender
3810680	3813160	so for example in samoa, there's uh
3814440	3815880	natal males
3815880	3816760	who
3816760	3820040	are considered a third sex called the fa fa fina
3820840	3823880	And you got the lady boys and tylen and so on
3824360	3827800	It's pretty common for just plain old straight men
3828600	3833480	To have sex with these natal males now. I don't think that makes them gay
3834200	3837160	They're not having sex with men. They're
3838280	3841080	Seeing these people as female like
3843000	3844840	But
3844840	3847000	I don't think there's anything
3848200	3852920	Any kind of cultural change even if I could build society from the ground up
3853720	3855720	that would make
3856040	3858040	Straight men
3859160	3861160	Want to have sex with each other
3862520	3863960	uh
3863960	3869720	I think women are likely different and more responsive to cultural factors
3871480	3874680	Uh and perhaps also things like um
3876840	3881160	Bad experiences with men there's a uh, you know this belief
3882360	3883560	that
3883560	3886840	One route to lesbianism is being mistreated by men
3888120	3891400	We don't know that's true, but I find it plausible
3892040	3895240	But I don't think that uh women mistreating
3895960	3898360	Men is going to make them go gay
3900360	3905240	No, that's fascinating. One thing that I've been considering a lot as you've been talking about the
3906520	3909560	thin line between what being gay means
3910200	3911720	physically
3911720	3913720	And what it means
3915800	3917800	In terms of appearance
3917960	3919960	You know, there's an interesting question
3920200	3921880	is a
3921880	3923720	very voluptuous
3923720	3926040	big boob big lips long hair
3926760	3928600	um
3928600	3930040	Thailand
3930040	3932280	lady boy type presenting person
3933400	3935400	more female
3935480	3936440	than
3936440	3938440	a very shaven head
3938600	3939480	uh
3939480	3941480	sort of more androgynous body
3941480	3942520	type
3942520	3943960	but
3943960	3945800	vagina owning
3945800	3947240	woman
3947240	3951240	And there's a really interesting question going on here. You know that you highlighted there it is
3951800	3953880	In some or it's referred to as a third gender
3954520	3959800	You know, there's a lot of um accusations from the left of genital fetishism, which you might have heard of
3960280	3966620	Which is that you're actually being uh, you're addicted to the genitals as opposed to the presentation
3967320	3968360	but
3968360	3970360	There is an interesting question given that
3973480	3975480	Our sexuality is so
3975800	3978200	easily fooled. We are such
3979000	3981640	rampant sexual beings that a
3982440	3984440	six inch by four inch screen
3985160	3990760	That has a small depiction of sex happening on it is enough to fool our brain to think
3991720	3995880	There's some sex happening here. No, there isn't there was some sex happening there
3996440	4000120	A long time ago and now you can see around the side of it. You know that it's not here
4000440	4005480	You know that you're not getting any of this. It's and that that illusion is responsible for the internet
4006520	4008680	correct, correct. Yeah, so
4009960	4015960	My point being that you you already can see as soon as you accept the fact that porn is an effective stimuli
4016920	4022680	You accept the fact that it is not exclusively about the action. It's about the presentation, right?
4023480	4029400	Is it just a difference of degree not a difference of kind all the way down to
4030920	4032920	the more
4032920	4039000	Female presenting regardless of whether it's a xx or xy chromosome person
4040200	4044680	It it really starts to blur the line between what is and is not classed as
4045880	4049160	Same sex or an opposite sex attracted sexual orientation
4049880	4053320	Yeah, I think that all we have
4054280	4057400	for the most part are our senses are
4058440	4064360	And you know men especially but humans in general are very visual species and
4065640	4070600	You're absolutely right that some trans women even those who still have a penis
4072120	4074120	Can look
4074600	4076200	Quite
4076200	4078200	They look like really attractive women
4079160	4086040	Although often you can kind of see the remnants of their maleness and their bone structure or something like that, but
4088440	4090680	Yeah, I and I think that
4092120	4094120	In those cases
4094280	4096040	men who
4096040	4098040	don't feel
4098040	4100200	Attracted to them or say they don't
4102520	4104520	That's more likely to be
4105240	4112680	Uh mental, um, you know some kind of a version an idea like that person is
4113560	4118440	A man not a woman. So despite the fact that they look like a really attracted
4119160	4121160	Woman, I can't go there
4121880	4123320	um
4123320	4127720	Yeah, it's so fascinating because I've seen this, you know, I've seen this argument happen on on
4128920	4130920	dating shows or on
4131720	4134600	Right-wing commentary channels and stuff like that around
4135640	4138200	No, because that would be gay. I'm like, is it
4138920	4144280	Is it more gay to have sex with what looks like a nine out of ten woman
4145400	4148920	body shape size voice presentation actions everything
4149720	4151480	with a penis
4151480	4158360	Then it is to have the exact opposite all of the presentation factors of a man could be on testosterone could be all of the rest of it
4158920	4165720	But has a vagina that it and it's a really really fascinating question. You know, there's sort of
4166920	4173080	It falls in line with a number of other arguments. There's sort of more biological essentialism side of things, especially the people that would say
4173560	4177560	Um, unless you can change your chromosomes and even not then if you're a natal male
4177640	4181240	I'm calling you a man if you're a natal female. I'm calling you a woman for the rest of time
4182200	4184840	Um, so it's a a suite of beliefs
4184920	4190280	I suppose all of which are into play with each other and would also cascade down from that, but um
4191000	4193000	Yeah, it's a it's a really really fascinating
4193640	4196680	consideration around what it means and this is when you get into the
4197560	4203400	deeper and deeper into the layers of paraphernalia and and the nuances of sexual orientation it all kind of starts to
4204440	4206440	break apart. It's like the quantum level of of
4207400	4209400	sex research, I suppose
4210360	4215320	Yes, yes, we we are going on the outskirts here
4216680	4221960	Um, what about people's gay dars? Do you think that most of us have an accurate gay dars?
4223720	4226600	Yeah, this is again something we've studied quite a bit
4227720	4231880	And yeah, but people have a much better than chance
4234360	4235800	Gaydar
4235800	4237800	Now it's not perfect
4237880	4241240	but they are much better at than chance
4241880	4242840	at
4242840	4244840	discerning whether a man
4246040	4248040	Is gay or straight and they
4248920	4250360	rely
4250360	4253000	So gay men, you know just their
4254840	4256600	outward appearance
4256600	4259160	In the west currently is not necessarily
4259880	4261400	very feminine
4261400	4264120	Although I I think gay men might
4265080	4270680	present themselves more attractively than straight men, but it's more things like movement
4271800	4273480	you know
4273480	4280920	And speech speech patterns are yeah, you found there's like a gay accent. There's a gay accent. Yes
4281160	4283160	What is the gay accent?
4286840	4291720	So we we know it when we hear it and and you know actors can often
4292520	4294840	effect the gay accent even if they're straight
4296600	4300200	There's interestingly there's a lesbian accent too
4301000	4303000	I I think a gay accent
4303640	4305640	may tend to be more expressive
4305960	4309000	and gay men articulate more clearly
4309800	4316520	than straight men and lesbians have the opposite they're less expressive and they don't articulate as clearly
4317240	4323400	Do you think is that in any way gay men modeling female speech patterns? Are there any
4324760	4328440	Parallels there? Yeah, you you ask great questions and the you know
4329240	4333320	So nobody knows and I I think there are two at least two
4334600	4336920	good hypoxies there one is that
4339160	4342040	Unconsciously growing up gay men
4342520	4344520	And
4344840	4346840	You know some of them they had
4348520	4351480	somewhat feminine gender identity and they
4352360	4354360	did model
4355560	4358520	The other is that there's something about gay men's brain, which is
4359400	4362360	somewhat feminized and produces this speech pattern
4363640	4364840	Nobody know
4364840	4366840	well when it comes to the
4366920	4372280	Ability to present clearly my speech coach that I use for the podcast is gay
4373320	4376360	Classically trained in theater classically trained in improv
4377400	4383000	For not just an outrageous communicator and probably the best communicator
4383560	4386840	That I've had on the show is Douglas Murray who is also
4388360	4391640	Him and Miles my speech coach are like two peas in a pod that have never met
4393080	4395080	But just phenomenal like
4396040	4399320	Out of this world precision with his ability to
4400520	4404440	Remain cool under pressure to be able to communicate in a very precise way
4405000	4407000	to be able to use
4407080	4411720	inflection and drama and whimsy and to then be able to pull it back without being
4412360	4414360	Fragile just phenomenal and so yeah
4415240	4419320	I I wonder Andrew Doyle as well satirist from the uk that runs the titanium agrath
4420200	4422760	Twitter account. I wonder I wonder whether
4423720	4427720	Being gay is a competitive advantage in the world of online commentary, perhaps
4429640	4433720	But yeah, it's all of that stuff so interesting and you write as all that you kind of
4435080	4437480	I I don't think I've been around sufficient
4438520	4441720	Lesbians to be able to say that I would I could pick up on that
4442920	4444920	The only real things that I ever notice
4446520	4450040	With lesbians are sort of the it's the dress. I think that
4451000	4458120	Lesbian lesbians seem to dress significantly more differently to normal women than gays do to normal men
4458680	4461480	Yeah, the the plaid shirts the baggy jeans
4462200	4463880	um
4463880	4465880	Yeah gay gay men
4466280	4467320	dress
4467320	4470120	somewhat differently more stylishly at least
4470920	4474120	It's just better usually. Yeah, that's right. That's right
4475080	4477080	Yeah, very funny
4477640	4486440	What was that paper that you did about male mate value being more malleable than female mate value?
4487400	4489400	No, that's an old one
4489800	4491800	um
4492760	4496840	Yeah, the student who was the lead author on that was interested in the
4498360	4500360	Explaining the sex difference in the
4501160	4503160	In depression women are more likely to get
4503880	4505720	depressed than
4505800	4508520	Men are and she hypothesized that
4509720	4511720	it could be because
4513480	4516600	You know women's mate value is more tied to
4517720	4520680	their looks which she said you can't
4522360	4527000	Do that much about whereas men it's their accomplishments which you can and
4527960	4530200	um, and she got some evidence for that
4530280	4532280	I'm not sure that I
4532600	4535560	That's you know an old paper and I'm not sure I believe
4536360	4538360	the theory because you know
4539400	4542040	If women if women really can't do that much
4543560	4552200	About their looks what's the cosmetics industry doing? I mean, uh, and you know, it's it's not that easy for a man to
4553000	4555000	go out and double his income
4555000	4556840	so
4556840	4559400	Anyway, but that that's what the paper was about
4560280	4562780	Yeah, so I find I had a conversation
4563400	4566360	with ed hagan as well recently
4566920	4572200	And ed did a study where they controlled for upper body strength
4572760	4578520	When looking at differences in depression and anxiety and when you control for upper body strength the differences between men and women
4579480	4582120	Get smaller and smaller and smaller and then essentially go away
4582760	4585880	um, and the the the reason that I was interested in
4586440	4593560	Discussing a malleability of mate value is that it's it's a common discussion that's had on the internet and it's born out of
4594040	4596840	A contest between men and women about who's got it worse
4597720	4599720	It's like well, it's easy for you
4599800	4601800	because you just need to go and
4602040	4605640	Get a boob job, but I can't make myself any tall taller and women would say well
4605640	4606920	It's easy for you
4606920	4611480	Because you know at 21 I reached my peak sexual market value and it's all downhill from there
4611560	4616120	And you get to continue to accrue status and resources and it's very much sort of um
4617800	4620120	two people talking different languages that
4621480	4623480	the
4623560	4628920	Sexual brains that the sexual attraction mechanism that works for men what they want from women and for women
4628920	4632280	What they want from men are not the same. It's not you can't
4633160	4634920	play
4634920	4638760	A balancing act here. There is no ability to work out the equity
4638760	4643480	There's no exchange rate between these two like how many boob jobs is three inches of height worth
4644200	4646680	Do you know what I mean like there is no way of us doing it?
4646680	4652680	Oh, well, you could wear high heels and put makeup on but you can go out for five years and increase your earning potential by
4653480	4656760	40% like what what does that even mean when we're talking about this?
4657320	4659080	um
4659080	4663640	I had a theory which I think maybe total horse shit, so I'm going to try and bring it back up again
4664200	4666200	I had a theory that
4666200	4668200	um
4668360	4671480	Male mate value to the individual
4673640	4677560	To the individual is more malleable and to the group is less malleable and female
4678200	4683000	Individual mate value is less less malleable and to the group. It's more malleable that
4684520	4689480	You basically have as a man there are more degrees of freedom that you can move yourself on
4690520	4695080	And there is a longer timeline that you can do it on specifically because of the fact that you know
4695640	4697080	a guy who's
4697080	4698680	35 is
4698680	4701960	More attractive than a guy who's 25 to most women on average
4702280	4705720	And I don't know when that peaks probably in your mid mid to late 30s, perhaps
4706520	4713000	But even then, you know, Leonardo DiCaprio has been acquiring and disposing of under 25 year old girlfriends
4713480	4715480	regularly for like two decades now
4716280	4719880	So with sufficient status and resources you can continue to cycle through that
4720440	4721640	um
4721640	4727880	But yeah, what what do you what's your mindset at now when it comes to malleability, especially with us facing this mating crisis and
4728120	4730120	and people having concerns around
4730840	4733400	Being able to be seen by the other sex
4735240	4737240	Well, I I think that
4737640	4741320	In the sense that I understand you I think we're probably very malleable
4743640	4745640	The culture has changed tremendously
4746360	4750760	You know in a fairly short time and it's kind of
4751800	4753160	guessing it will
4753160	4760280	Change tremendously still I hope it changes back in certain ways because I'm not that happy with certain things now
4761160	4765640	But that's a different question than do I know how to change it and I do not
4767160	4769160	And that that
4769640	4771320	has to do with
4771320	4773320	male female interactions
4773320	4778360	As much as academic freedom both of which well the latter concerns me more now
4780760	4785160	Michael Bailey ladies and gentlemen Michael, I really really appreciate your work any opportunity to dig into
4785640	4792920	People that are looking into sex is is fascinating for me. I've immensely enjoyed talking to you. I I hope that we get
4795640	4800360	More chances either in person or back here whatever I have
4801080	4807960	I have a laundry list of things that we didn't get to talk about to do with sexual arousal patterns virtuous pedophiles
4808760	4809800	the
4809800	4815320	Birth order effect of homosexuality so we can absolutely run this back. Let me know once your new paper is out
