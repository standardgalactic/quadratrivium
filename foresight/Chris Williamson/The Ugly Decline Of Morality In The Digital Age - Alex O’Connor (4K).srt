00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Alex O'Connor, welcome to the show.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
How splendidly we progress.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first time on a Skype call,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the second time was in person in Austin,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and now it's something of a sort of cinematic production.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I fear that next time we'll be in 3D or something.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's good to see you again.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Good to see you as well, mate.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How are you feeling in the aftermath of Peter Hitchens?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Validated, vindicated.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I must say that I was a little bit...

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I was in two minds about uploading that interview.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There was a bit of a mixture of opinion coming from him.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He wasn't speaking entirely clearly.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It must have been something on his mind.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He said, as he's getting up to walk out,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't think you should run this.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And I'm thinking, look, if my guest tells me

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
that they don't want me to run an interview for any reason,

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
it could be because they've had a bad hair day,

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
then I'll respect that.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And so I thought, damn, am I really going to have to be the bigger man here

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and just not post this at all?

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But then he kept saying, oh, run it if you like.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I can't stop you from running it.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I just don't think you have any moral right to run it.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And I asked him why.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And he said it was because I am a propagandist for drug decriminalization,

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
a subject which prior to that, by the way,

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'd spoken about once ever.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And that I'd intentionally tricked him to appear on my podcast

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
in order that I might fool him into a conversation about drugs.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now, before the podcast started, I said, Mr. Hitchens,

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
you have about three subject areas that we both talk about

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
where I think there's a bit of crossover

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
that you've either spoken about or indeed written books about.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And those are the decriminalization of drugs.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I also mentioned this in my email.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The existence of God or religion, I should say,

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
God and religion is the topic.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And the third was monarchy.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
At this point, he says, you know, monarchy is a bit boring.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay, notice listener that he did not take this opportunity

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to tell me that he thought that drugs were a bit boring

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
or would rather not really talk about drugs at all or for too long.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, fine.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So I'm thinking, I agree with you, the monarchy is incredibly boring.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In fact, that's the entirety of my point about the monarchy

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
is that it's essentially just boring more than anything else.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So let's just do the other two.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So I say we'll run for about an hour ideally.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
He says, that's good, you know, and I say, but you know,

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
if the conversation flows, it can be an hour and a half.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It could be two hours.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And okay, he says, well, look, you know,

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I say sometimes they can be three hours long.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He says, well, three hours might be a bit long, but we'll see how we do.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So I'm thinking about an hour and a half.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
An hour and a half on what was now, in my view, two subjects.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So at about 40 minutes into this potentially 90 minute podcast

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
on the same topic when he told me that we've been going around

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
for too long on that topic, I was a little bit bemused.

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But I did think to myself, maybe I've done something wrong here.

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Maybe I have upset him in a way that obviously was not intentional.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You know, I wasn't trying to bring this out of him,

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
although, you know, it does do quite well for the channel.

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's not like it's something I would do intentionally.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So I did think to myself, well, maybe I've done something.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So I listened back and I sent it to some friends, including you.

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And thank you for listening to it and saying that like,

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
most people just said, you have to run this.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He's been completely unreasonable.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And so there have been criticisms.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
People have said, well, you know what, it was a bit boring.

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Or yeah, it was going around in circles.

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I submit that that was his fault, by the way,

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
because he does this thing which I've noticed

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
in a lot of philosophical and political discussion,

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
which is the sort of, I know this one attitude.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
When you do a lot of interviews, I find that you have a sort of,

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I know this one.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And so...

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They answered the question that they heard,

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
not the answer that was asked.

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Exactly.

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And it happens, especially when it's easy enough

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
to make that mistake if you're not listening carefully.

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So he was talking about the...

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Well, I asked him about the decriminalization of cannabis.

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And he says that, well, this will essentially mean

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
that a lot of more children will be smoking it.

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He had this contention that children would end up smoking cannabis.

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And I thought to myself, well, okay,

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I can understand that concern, of course,

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
but I think the tobacco industry has suffered quite a blow

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
in still being perfectly legal to buy as an adult,

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
but kids just aren't smoking cigarettes anymore.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's just not a thing that's really done.

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Why is that?

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
In other words, we've had quite a successful education campaign

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
whereby it's not popular for kids to smoke anymore,

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and yet it's still perfectly legal.

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Can't we have a similar approach to cannabis?

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Potentially, by the way, not a good view.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Potentially a perfectly rebuttable view.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm not sure, but I wouldn't know

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
because they didn't get a rebuttal to that view.

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Instead, I just heard, you know, all you can do is do the whole,

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
which by the way is a genuinely quite tired line in this debate,

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
the whole, oh, what about smoking?

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Or indeed another point where I brought up alcohol.

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
All you can say is what about alcohol?

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What about smoking?

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And that's not what I was doing.

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
At least I contend that's not what I was doing.

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Because that's what he heard.

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He goes, oh, I know this one.

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I've heard this before.

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, and you haven't read my book.

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It didn't seem to occur to him

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
that it is possible, Mr. Hitchens,

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
to read your book and yet still,

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
after having done so, disagree with you.

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, it's sometimes when you hear people speak,

125
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
especially guys that are a little bit older,

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I think there is kind of like reverse ageism that goes on,

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
which is who is this sort of young whippersnapper person

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
who I maybe have heard of or haven't heard of much.

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And almost like a blasé kind of discrediting of the thing.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's like, this is your show, but it's my show, so to speak.

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And yeah, it was like, I thought his attitude was pompous

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and unlikable.

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And my favorite part was when he threw the pillow

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
at the microphone.

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Throwing the pillow down.

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And he kept sort of walking back over.

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He says, you know, I don't want you to post this.

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And yet walked back over to the microphone.

139
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I've never told you about you before.

140
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I've decided that I absolutely do not like you.

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It was quite something.

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And a lot of people messaged me saying,

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
hey, like, I'm so sorry that happened.

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Like, you know, you're doing all right.

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And I'm thinking, sorry, sorry.

146
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I thought there's no way that this is happening.

147
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I mean, when it looked like he was about to get up,

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I thought, surely not.

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But then internally, I'm thinking, like, go on then, do it.

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Go on then, yeah.

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Do it, because I don't think I've done anything wrong here.

152
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It was the podcasting equivalent of, come on mate, have a go.

153
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, but you know, the weirdest thing was

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
because he sort of gets up to go and he walks out

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and he stands at the door.

156
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I wish you kind of could have seen his body language.

157
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It was very much, there's one point where you can see it

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
when he walks back into shot and he says something.

159
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And then after he said it, he just sort of stands there

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
looking at me as if to say, like, what have you got?

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Have a go.

162
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And so he'd keep going, like, I'm going to go now.

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm going.

164
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Right.

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm going to, I'm going and waiting.

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's just the podcast playing hard to get equivalent.

167
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It must have been something like that.

168
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, it was like, it was like the person who wants the fight

169
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
but wants to look like they didn't initiate the fight.

170
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Right.

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And I don't think it's my fault.

172
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll leave it up to the, to the judgment of the listener

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
or the viewer.

174
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't think it's my fault that he spent 17 minutes,

175
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
17 count them, 17 entire minutes stood at the door

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
telling me how much he personally dislikes me,

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
telling me how much he doesn't want to see me again.

178
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I've wanted to do that for as long as I've known you.

179
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So.

180
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Well, we'll see how we did.

181
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, today.

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're going to try and convince me of the existence of God today.

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You managed to convince chat GPT.

184
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's right.

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Which means, does it mean that I'm smarter than chat GPT

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
if you convince me more quickly or more slowly or not at all?

187
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't know.

188
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I do know that it, it means that, well, well chat GPT

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
if it's going to inherit eternal life,

190
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I sort of wonder how that's going to work in heaven.

191
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't know.

192
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I mean, I don't know if I've made it.

193
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Just this recursive nightmare for everyone as they walk around

194
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and they've got the chat GPT logo floating about.

195
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah.

196
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The interesting thing about chat GPT is that you sort of,

197
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
you can, you can essentially convince it of anything.

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And so I wasn't quite sure if it was even a very good video idea

199
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
because I'm sure I could just as easily convince it

200
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
that God doesn't exist.

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, at least you can be thankful that it wasn't able

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
to say it had no opinion of you before,

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
but it absolutely does not like you and then get up and walk out.

204
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Quite right.

205
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Some people in the comments did say that at least, you know,

206
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
chat GPT stuck around until the end.

207
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That would be a task.

208
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
In fact, that's another video idea.

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I got chat GPT to storm out of an interview.

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Even I probably couldn't do that.

211
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Didn't this get brought up?

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You debated Ben Shapiro yesterday.

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
How did that go?

214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I haven't even seen you.

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It went well.

216
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I think it will probably be out around the time of this,

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
this interview maybe slightly before or slightly afterwards.

218
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It was, it was a good conversation.

219
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We were discussing whether or not religion is good for society.

220
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It stands for young Benjamin to take at the moment.

221
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I suppose so.

222
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I mean, it was a very much sort of don't mention the war type,

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
type scenario.

224
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I mean, the producers had said that we want this to be

225
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
an evergreen conversation.

226
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We want this to be something that people can listen to at any point.

227
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And also Ben had just the night before been to the Oxford Union.

228
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And I haven't seen that yet either.

229
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I saw that.

230
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He went had at it with a bunch of people on the other side of the fence.

231
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah.

232
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He didn't have a very good time.

233
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He said to me that it was the most tense thing that he's ever done.

234
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The most tense thing he's ever, ever been a part of.

235
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Well, I saw something that was kind of interesting was the video

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
was only shot on what appeared to be iPhone.

237
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes.

238
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So there was no, maybe they just wanted to get it early as opposed

239
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
to waiting for the Oxford Union's official video to come through.

240
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Seems to be the case.

241
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
They do seem to be planning to upload it.

242
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
In fact, when I was recording with Ben,

243
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I think his team were in the green room,

244
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
sort of furiously subtitling to try and get it out

245
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
potentially before the Oxford Union.

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm not entirely sure.

247
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But I mean, it sounded like a hell of an evening.

248
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And so the next day he was saying that it sort of felt like a nice break from that.

249
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What to sit opposite you.

250
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Well, you are the comfortable leather pair of shoes that he can put on.

251
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think Ben relaxes in argumentation.

252
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I think he genuinely enjoys it.

253
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I think there's no contradiction to say that he was having some time off

254
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
by sitting there and having a spack.

255
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But he was having a break from the politics.

256
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
In other words, he was able to just argue about something a bit more perennial

257
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and a little less fiery, I suppose.

258
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What have you learned?

259
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So you are, I've been a massive fan of you since before you came on the podcast

260
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and since then we've become friends and you've come out to see me in Austin.

261
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We've spent a ton of time together.

262
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're probably my favorite person to watch debate people

263
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
because it's kind of a little bit like watching Batman versus Spider-Man or something.

264
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Because I know you well and we've argued a lot.

265
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And I know maybe Ben Shapiro, but I don't know what will happen when these two people come together.

266
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You were president of Socks Ock?

267
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The Socratic Society, yes.

268
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You were part of Debate Sock and all of this other stuff at Oxford.

269
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Given that you've got a relatively illustrious heritage of both formal and informal debates,

270
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
what is your assessment of Ben Shapiro's debating style, his ethical consistency,

271
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
his ability to deploy logic, et cetera, et cetera.

272
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Now that you've gone mano a mano in the ring.

273
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, he has obviously an incredibly high verbal IQ.

274
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He constructs a sentence out of nowhere and do it very quickly.

275
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And he's also very difficult to interrupt.

276
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Not that I particularly wanted to.

277
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I mean, he would throw sort of maybe two or three points out at once.

278
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And you want to butt in and do them one by one.

279
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You don't want to be rude, of course.

280
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So I let him finish, but it was amazing how they just glued together into one wall of text.

281
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I've seen comments on some of the videos that I was watching of him in preparation to talk to him

282
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
where people were not being funny in saying that they play the video on 0.75 feet.

283
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Because it makes him sound normal.

284
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
There was sort of an episode with Constantine and Francis Trigonometry

285
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and he's talking about religion and its relation to the fentanyl crisis.

286
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And people were saying that if you...

287
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And it was very fast.

288
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And if you play it on 0.75, you forget that you've done that

289
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and you're just hearing somebody talk at a normal volume at a normal speed

290
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and then Constantine comes in sounding like a blue whale or something.

291
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So he's very quick.

292
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But also I thought very charitable.

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is the thing.

294
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I think people get Ben Shapiro wrong.

295
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I went to his Cambridge Union event after this discussion slash debate

296
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
because it was in Cambridge.

297
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's why we were out there.

298
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So I went to this event and I was talking to a lot of the students afterwards

299
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and you hear a lot of people saying about Ben Shapiro that he's a bit of a grifter

300
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
or, well, I'm not really a fan, or you have the sort of secret fans

301
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
who are sat in the chamber going like,

302
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
well, I think it's important if you're going to disagree with someone.

303
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You sort of have to hear the thing that you're going to disagree with in the flesh.

304
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You can say that you like Ben Shapiro.

305
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's okay.

306
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But people see this side of him of the sort of slightly sneering, smarmy,

307
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
owning the college student kind of thing.

308
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But I think in many ways he matches the energy that he's given.

309
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And so taking him seriously and listening to what he's saying

310
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and being willing to concede a point to him, he will do the same thing.

311
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And I think that happened in this conversation.

312
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's steadfast.

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We're saying what we think to each other.

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
At one point, we both accuse each other simultaneously of being delusional.

315
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But in such a manner that if you say something, you get a sort of like,

316
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
yeah, no, that's a fair point, actually, maybe we should put it this way instead.

317
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Or, yeah, you know, actually, I see what you're saying.

318
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No, you're right.

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I should have said this instead, that kind of attitude,

320
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
which is the kind of thing that people think Ben Shapiro is incapable of for some reason.

321
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Humility.

322
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You know what I mean?

323
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah.

324
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And it's a kind of, it's a hidden humility because it comes out not in the attitude,

325
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
not in the, not in a sort of, he's not going to like give way to you emotion.

326
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He's not going to be like, oh, you're right.

327
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It would just be if you pay attention to the way he's constructing an argument

328
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and changing it subtly based on your responses, you know, that he really is listening

329
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and really is trying to engage with what you're actually saying.

330
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And that's the kind of humility that I don't think can really be faked.

331
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah.

332
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I am friends with a bunch of guys that have worked with him over the years.

333
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I know for a fine fact that part of his debate prep involves a number of break glass

334
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
in case of mass offense, sort of escape hatches,

335
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and that there's layers of how deep and how aggressive he can go.

336
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So I would love to know, actually, I might email him and find out what he's got on you,

337
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
just in case I ever need to actually pull that pin.

338
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Well, he said to me when he walked in, I saw the Peter Hitchens thing,

339
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
because everybody's been saying to me recently.

340
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So he'd at least seen that.

341
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So he knows how I behave.

342
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And he knows, in other words, that if he did start sort of screaming at me,

343
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
that I would probably just sit there and take it.

344
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Right.

345
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Okay.

346
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Like the philosophical cuck that you are.

347
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah.

348
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You're kind of a little...

349
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
There's another quote for the footer bio, I think.

350
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah.

351
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Have you updated it too?

352
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I absolutely do not.

353
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I've decided I do not like you, Peter Hitchens.

354
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's in there somewhere.

355
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I think it's I actively dislike you is the quote that's now on my bio.

356
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yeah.

357
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't think I'll ever get rid of unusually penetrating...

358
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What was it that you were doing,

359
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
what was it that you did for a while making theists question their beliefs

360
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and lesbians question their sexuality since...

361
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

362
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I remember that in your bio.

363
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

364
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We really haven't had each other a long time, haven't we?

365
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah.

366
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You know what I found yesterday?

367
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I was, I sort of stumbled across it while looking for an email trying to find out

368
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
where we were filming today.

369
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And I found the original email that you sent me in,

370
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
must have been 2019, when we first met.

371
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And it was amazing.

372
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It was this sort of, hi, Alex.

373
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Been watching your stuff for a while.

374
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Like it was sort of three, four paragraphs of texts.

375
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'd love to sit down and have a conversation with you.

376
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I think that your views will be of big interest to my view.

377
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And then I've already spoken to these people.

378
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And it was a bunch of people that I hadn't heard of.

379
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Wasn't really in my sphere.

380
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And it signed off Chris Williamson Voodoo events.

381
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Fantastic.

382
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah.

383
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Wow.

384
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
My previous life.

385
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah.

386
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I had a filling nightclubs in my signature until only six months ago.

387
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I realized that I needed to get rid of it.

388
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But no, it's, it's cool, man.

389
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I think, you know, if I could invest money in people,

390
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
you, George Mack, Zach, my housemate,

391
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Gwinda Bogle, Rob Henderson, you know, even Rory Sutherland,

392
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I don't think that the market has priced in his talent.

393
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And it's so funny because like what I did for almost all of my career in

394
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
nightlife was find different kind of talent, right?

395
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It was like degenerate party talent,

396
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
things that had good work ethic and some skill and then bring them in

397
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and sort of train them up.

398
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So keeping your finger on the pulse of what's happening with regards to

399
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
trends, if who is appropriate and blah, blah, blah.

400
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But yeah, man, I'm, you know, there is a point,

401
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I will happily say it now, there is a point that's going to occur

402
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
within the next few years where something happens with you being

403
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
involved that just catapults you into like superstardom.

404
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Like I would absolutely bet a shit ton of money that this is going to happen.

405
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What's that big thing you're doing soon?

406
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Can we announce the big thing that you're doing soon, that even bigger debate?

407
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I think not.

408
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Right.

409
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Only because it's still very much up in the air.

410
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Okay.

411
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
However.

412
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
If and when that happens.

413
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
If and when that happens.

414
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's going to break the internet.

415
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That could be it.

416
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah.

417
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Unless this does it for me.

418
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Very well might do.

419
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
This is the biggest platform you've been on.

420
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So when was the last time that you're aware of in your world of philosophy

421
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
that something like a step change, like the equivalent of the discovery

422
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
of the Higgs boson happened?

423
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
In philosophy?

424
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah.

425
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Every now and again something does come along that's a bit revolutionary.

426
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And a recent example and by recent, consider we're talking about the history

427
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
of philosophy here, 20th century, the theory of knowledge is completely

428
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
exploded by a man called Edmund Gettier.

429
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And this is actually, I think quite fascinating.

430
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'll be interested to hear what you think about this.

431
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So knowledge is really difficult to define.

432
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
People didn't used to have as much of a problem with it.

433
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Like if you had to give a definition of knowledge, what does it mean to know something?

434
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This isn't like a trick question.

435
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm just interested.

436
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What do you think?

437
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
To know something, to be able to accurately predict what happens in the world.

438
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Okay.

439
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So it's got something to do with it being true in the world and your ability to predict.

440
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
But you can also think about things in the past, right?

441
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Like you can know that Napoleon existed or something.

442
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And the ability to infer.

443
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah, to infer, to sort of have some kind of belief about the world.

444
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Which is accurate.

445
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Which is accurate, which is true.

446
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Sure.

447
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But then imagine, for example, you're in like a locked concrete box with no windows.

448
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And I don't know, like some voodoo mystic tells you that it's raining outside.

449
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And they're just like insane.

450
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
They're on drugs or something.

451
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And they just tell you that it's raining, they're convinced of it.

452
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And for some reason, you believe them totally irrationally.

453
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And it just so happens that it is, by coincidence, raining outside.

454
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Did you know?

455
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Right.

456
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So you have a belief about the world, which is true, but it would seem very strange to

457
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
say that you know there's raining outside, right?

458
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And so since Plato and the ancients, we've sort of had a consensus on the idea that knowledge

459
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
is justified true belief, JTB.

460
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So you need to have a belief that's true.

461
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You need to, of course, believe it to be true, but you have to also be justified in that

462
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
belief.

463
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And that's what makes it knowledge.

464
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So if you see that it's raining outside through the window and you believe that it's raining

465
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
outside and then it's true that it's raining outside, now you can say you know that it's

466
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
raining outside.

467
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And this is just essentially consensus for potentially thousands of years of talking

468
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
about here.

469
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And then Edmund Getty, and at least one account, this may be apocryphal, but it's said that

470
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
he sort of hadn't really published anything and was being compelled to get something in

471
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
a journal and he just sort of reaches into his papers of random things he's been writing,

472
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
pulls up the one on the top and hands it off for submission.

473
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
This is about two or three pages long.

474
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And it just upends the whole thing with essentially a counter example, which you're now known as

475
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Getty air cases.

476
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So his example was to say, okay, imagine that you're in a job interview and your interview

477
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
goes really quite well and the person says to you, you know, I shouldn't really be saying

478
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
this, but I think you've got it.

479
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And so you go back outside and you're feeling pretty good.

480
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
There are other candidates, but you've got a pretty justified reason to think that you're

481
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
going to get the job.

482
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Then the other guy goes in and while you're waiting for him, you know, you're just fiddling

483
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
around in your pocket and you take out whatever you've got in your pocket and you've got 10

484
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
coins and you're just fiddling with the 10 coins.

485
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So you develop a justified belief that the person who's going to get the job has 10 coins

486
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
in his pocket because you're pretty sure you're going to get the job and you've just by chance,

487
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
you just had a look and you've got 10 coins.

488
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So you got a justified belief that the person who's going to get the job has 10 coins in

489
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
their pocket.

490
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There's been some kind of like freak mistake or something.

491
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Maybe they've read your name wrong on the form or the person who told you they thought you

492
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
got it meant speaks the other person, but it turns out the other guy actually gets the

493
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
job.

494
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
But just by sheer coincidence, he also has 10 coins in his pocket.

495
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The question is, did you know that the person who would get the job would have 10 coins

496
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
in his pocket?

497
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You have a justified, true belief that the person who gets the job would have 10 coins

498
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
in his pocket, but it seems in this circumstance, you didn't know that.

499
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That just seems wrong.

500
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Seems like a wrong account.

501
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a bit of a sort of clunky example and he gives another one which is also maybe a

502
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
little bit clunky, but this sort of sparks this type of affair called a Gettier case.

503
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Well, you told me, I think over dinner, the best Gettier case, which was the person behind

504
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the hedge.

505
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yes.

506
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So this is better.

507
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I think so.

508
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So I think it's actually better.

509
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Firstly, it's better to experience them for yourself and there are simpler explanations

510
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
as well.

511
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So I was in a car driving around a bend and over the hedge, I see this small child sort

512
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
of bouncing up and down behind the hedge and I thought to myself, oh, cool.

513
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm about to see a horse.

514
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I mean, it looked like the kid was riding a horse and I was like, yeah, cool.

515
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
We're going to see a horse and we ride around this bend and the kid was actually on his

516
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
or her like dad's back and that's why she was high up and bouncing up and down.

517
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But just by sheer coincidence in the field behind them was a horse and I couldn't believe

518
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
it.

519
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I thought I've just experienced a Gettier case.

520
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I had a justified true belief that I was about to see a horse.

521
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The difficulty with that one is that it's probably not justified to believe that I was

522
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
about to see a horse because I probably should have thought that it could have been a father.

523
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
But a much more simple example and this actually happened to me once.

524
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I was in the US Capitol building in the crypt and they had the clock that used to be in

525
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
the house of representatives and they said that the reason they replaced it and brought

526
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
it down here was because they were fed up of winding it up.

527
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
They didn't want to wind it anymore.

528
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And I looked at it and I asked the tour guide lady.

529
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I said, well, do they still wind it while it's down here?

530
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And she said, no.

531
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And I thought, but it's the real, it's the time.

532
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It says the time right now.

533
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And she was like, oh, yeah, it must be a coincidence.

534
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And I was like the only one looking around like, hey, that's, that's pretty, that's pretty extraordinary.

535
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I mean, I guess it happens twice a day, right?

536
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But this is a Gettier case.

537
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
If you, if your watch breaks, but you don't know that it's broken, you've got a reliable

538
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
watch, but today it's broken and you look at the time and it stopped on half past three.

539
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And so you look at it and you think, oh, it must be half past three.

540
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And it does actually just so happen to be half past three.

541
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Did you know it was half past three?

542
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That's a Gettier case.

543
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Justified true belief.

544
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And yet it seems weird to say that you, that you know it.

545
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So Gettier's revelation here was something like what you're talking about.

546
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
A sort of genuine novelty in the history of philosophy.

547
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And they come about quite rarely, but they, they do occur.

548
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
This episode is brought to you by Element.

549
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Element is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with everything that you need and nothing that

550
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
you don't.

551
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's a healthy alternative to sugary electrolyte drinks.

552
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's got a science-backed electrolyte ratio of sodium, potassium and magnesium.

553
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You might ask, what do I want with an electrolyte drink?

554
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Well, it'll regulate your appetite.

555
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It'll curb cravings.

556
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It'll help improve your brain function.

557
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And best of all, it tastes phenomenal.

558
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
First thing in the morning, this orange element salt in water is outstanding.

559
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Your adenosine system that caffeine acts on isn't even active for the first 90 minutes

560
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
of the day.

561
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So it's pointless having a morning coffee.

562
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Your adrenal system, which is what salt acts on, is active.

563
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So this will make you feel more alert, more awake and improve your hydration.

564
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Best of all, they've got a no BS, no questions asked refund policy.

565
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So you can buy it.

566
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And if you do not like it for any reason, they will give you your money back.

567
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
That's how confident they are that you love it.

That's drinklmnt.com slash modern wisdom.

571
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
What happens downstream from that in the world of philosophy?

572
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Just a massive migraine, basically.

573
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
People start coming up with arguments, responses, you know, so people start saying,

574
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Oh, maybe it's not justified to believe.

575
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Maybe it's like causally related justification to the cause of the

576
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But presumably kind of in the same way that I guess a new scientific discovery is made

577
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
about the way that we metabolize glucose or about what happens if you take this amount

578
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
of nicotine or the role of metformin in preventing high blood pressure or something.

579
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
They're stacked on top of that one assumption, a number of other assumptions.

580
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But with philosophy, especially something I imagine like the philosophy of knowledge,

581
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
it's so foundational that having this entire universe built on this particular foundation

582
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
then means that the entire house of cards collapses down and people then need to rebuild

583
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
all of this nightmare on top of it.

584
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah.

585
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Well, most of philosophy is just a consistency test as it is in something like mathematics.

586
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It's just that we accept that there are certain axioms that even even mathematical axioms,

587
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
you know, you can you can you can question them.

588
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I mean, Veritasium just made a quite good video about Euclidean geometry and how it sort of

589
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
just accepted for a very long time that for example, you know, if you have a right angle,

590
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
then if you sort of join up the two lines coming off that right angle, you'll create a triangle

591
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
whose interior angles add up to 180 degrees.

592
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And then people start thinking about what about like curved geometric spaces?

593
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
What if you do this on a globe?

594
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
If you put a triangle on a globe, the angles aren't going to add up in that way.

595
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And these these are sort of like axioms of mathematics that essentially they don't necessarily get proved wrong

596
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
or thrown out, but people realize that you can think about things differently.

597
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And so most of what we're doing is actually just testing for consistency.

598
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And so it's actually quite difficult to prove an axiom wrong because you kind of need an axiom just to get off the ground.

599
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And the rest of everything you're doing is just consistency tests with that axiom.

600
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
This is one of the most interesting things I learned from you, maybe in the first ever episode that we did,

601
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
as you were teaching me about the difference between ethics and matter ethics as someone that isn't formally trained in either.

602
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And you I use this all the time.

603
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It's such an interesting mental model to think that in order for me and you to have a discussion about ethics,

604
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
our meta ethical foundation, we need to agree on that because out of that, if we don't,

605
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
the entire ethical discussion on top will just continue to fall back to definitional problems

606
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
and what you're presuming that so you can't discuss the stuff that happens on top

607
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
unless you discuss the stuff that's underneath.

608
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And this is it's the entirety of the trans debate, right?

609
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It's the entirety of lexical overwhelm that if you can't agree on the definition of words,

610
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,000
the argument about the words and what they then refer to just collapses in on itself

611
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
and continuously just falls back to an argument about the definition of words.

612
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yes, this happens with, for example, freedom.

613
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
There are lots of different ways of conceiving of freedom, famously freedom from and freedom to, right?

614
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Is freedom just being left alone or is freedom being empowered to do things that you should be able to do?

615
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And then when you have people arguing about nationalised healthcare, for example,

616
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
one person says to be free, you need to be healthy.

617
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And one person says to be free, you need to spend your own money as you please

618
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
and not be forced to fund other people's healthcare now.

619
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Both of these people can be right, they're just defining freedom differently.

620
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So you're quite right.

621
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And that's why metaethics is quite important.

622
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I mean, AJA I pointed out in Language, Truth and Logic that the vast majority of ethical debate is not ethical debate.

623
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's descriptive debate, it's factual debate.

624
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
If you look at the so-called ethical debate around gun laws in America, for example,

625
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
people are talking about statistics.

626
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
They're saying X many people die per year.

627
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh, well, don't you know that more children are killed by swimming pools?

628
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Don't you know that if we ban certain types of weapons or blah, blah, blah,

629
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
that this many less people will die, all these kind of things are just descriptive factual statements

630
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
that people like to dispute with each other.

631
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And that's why they like to say we have the facts on our side.

632
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
But the actual ethical question that undergirds it all is hardly ever even reached.

633
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And so most of the time people are actually arguing about that.

634
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I mean, the same thing with an abortion debate, for example.

635
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You know, questions about biology, when does consciousness emerge?

636
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Can it survive on its own outside of the womb this week or this week?

637
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You know, this kind of stuff.

638
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Will it increase the number of women who die or decrease the number of women who die?

639
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But none of these are ethical questions.

640
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And people think they're having an ethical debate when they're actually just having a debate about facts

641
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
that can be resolved in principle by scientific empirical inquiry.

642
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The ethical question is the more interesting one that's often assumed.

643
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And if people think that they agree with each other

644
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
or understand each other in the same way on that ethical first point,

645
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
then you're in for a disaster.

646
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
If they don't, I mean.

647
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Yeah, what do you wish that more people could realize

648
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
when it comes to understanding ethics and consistency in their own lives?

649
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Is there something that a little red pill or a particular insight that you wish you could deposit

650
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
into the mind of the populace that you think would make their lives a little bit more easy

651
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
or the sense making a bit more simple?

652
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I didn't know about making lives easier, but I do think that people should recognize

653
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
the extent to which emotions dominate our ethical thinking.

654
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I mean, I take a...

655
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I think it's seen as a relatively eccentric view that ethics just is the expression of emotion.

656
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
This was something popularized by that same AJ Ayer in a book that was so troubling

657
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
to the philosophical consensus at the time that there's a story of,

658
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I think it was like a...

659
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
maybe a dean of Balliol College or something who when a student came in,

660
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
everybody wanted to talk about this book and they were so scared of the implications of it

661
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
that he literally throws it out of the window because he just doesn't want to talk about it.

662
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Ayer is talking about how the only things that can be meaningful are those which are

663
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
analytically true or empirically verifiable.

664
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
If the statement you're making isn't something you can, at least in principle,

665
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
test empirically or something that's just a tautology, two and two is four,

666
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
then what you're saying is literally meaningless.

667
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And people came to him and said, well, what about ethical statements?

668
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You can't prove these in principle and they're not tautological.

669
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And he said, well, the way that they're meaningful is that they are expressions of emotion.

670
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And it gives birth to this view called emotivism,

671
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
which is really a philosophy of language more than a philosophy of ethics.

672
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It tries to describe what people mean when they say good or bad.

673
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And famously, he comes up with this analogy that saying murder is wrong.

674
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's like saying boo murder.

675
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And saying murder is giving to charity as good as like saying yay charity.

676
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's just an expression of emotion.

677
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's not even the same thing as saying I like charity or I don't like murder

678
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
because those things can be true or false.

679
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
They have truth value.

680
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It could be true that it is just a psychological fact that I don't like murder.

681
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
He means murder is wrong that statement.

682
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's just the expression of the emotion, boo murder.

683
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And I think even if you don't agree with him to that extent, as I more or less do,

684
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
if you begin to recognize the extent to which emotions are dominating your ethical conduct,

685
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
pay attention to what it feels like when you analyze something as wrong.

686
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I think it belongs in the same category as-

687
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Because you've got this sort of-

688
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Emotion.

689
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Sweet of a soup of stimulus going on inside of you.

690
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
What is it like to feel like something is wrong?

691
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And we know that people seem to change what they rationally do based on how they're feeling.

692
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I mean, I don't know if you've come across terror management theory before.

693
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It surprised me if you hadn't.

694
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
The idea that all human beings are doing is trying to manage their fear of death.

695
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And that's what motivates all human activity.

696
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And there have been some interesting studies and some of them are harder to replicate than others.

697
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
But I mean, the first one, the most famous was some, I think, Arizona state judges.

698
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And they were being asked to recommend a bond for the solicitation of prostitution.

699
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And what the researchers did was they asked them to fill out just a form first.

700
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And on half of the forms, they just mentioned death.

701
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
They just put in a few questions about death.

702
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
What do you think happens after death?

703
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Who would you put in your will?

704
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That kind of stuff.

705
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Nothing too extreme.

706
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And they found that the bond that was set by the judges-

707
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I mean, I think the average bond for the control group was less than $100.

708
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And for the ones who were reminded of their death was my $200 or $300 on average.

709
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
What does that imply?

710
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So the interpretation of terror management theory was that when we're reminded of our deaths,

711
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
we need to temporarily, more heavily reaffirm the sort of death-denying aspects of our culture.

712
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
The reason that we do things, the reason we create art, the reason that we get out of bed,

713
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
the reason that we have conversations like this is because in some way it's traceable back to trying to essentially deny our own death.

714
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Ernest Bakker wrote a book called The Denial of Death.

715
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And this is essentially the idea.

716
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And so for judges, it might be something like by participating in the legal system,

717
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
they're participating in something that's a bit beyond them and therefore it exists outside of their own mortality.

718
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And so the thesis, this mortality salience hypothesis as it's known, is that for a judge,

719
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,000
if they're reminded of their own death, what they will temporarily be compelled to do is more harshly reaffirm that thing

720
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
that is the death-denying aspects of their daily life, which is participation in the legal system,

721
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
so more harsh penalties.

722
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Now, the explanation seems a little bit tenuous.

723
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm not sure about that, but it does seem strange that when you remind people of their own death,

724
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,000
they will, like Muslims will become more derogatory towards Jews.

725
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
People of different nationalities will sit further away from each other.

726
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
When asked to draw pictures of currency, it will draw physically larger pictures of currency.

727
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
People's opinion on whether they prefer a picture of a forest or a picture of suburban neighborhood will change on average.

728
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
These things are extraordinary, just from being reminded of your own death.

729
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Of course, the biggest manifestation of the denial of death would be religion.

730
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:08,000
That would also explain why religion deals a lot with death and why if you remind people of their own death,

731
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
they also become religious, which by the way is true of atheists as well.

732
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
People who don't believe in God will still become more religious,

733
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
even if they don't ultimately believe in God when reminded of their own death.

734
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I've been thinking a good bit recently about how people do an awful lot,

735
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
especially in the modern world, that is death denialism masquerading as something else.

736
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I think the productivity movement very much is that.

737
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Trying to fit more into less time.

738
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
If only I could get more life, more work, more output out of my one unit of days or whatever.

739
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I think that a good chunk of the health and fitness world, the longevity movement, the biohacking movement,

740
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
all of that is absolutely death denialism.

741
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And you can see as well, nutrition, all of the arguments about is it better for me to be carnivore or vegan?

742
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Should I go high carb or low carb?

743
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Can I do intermittent fasting?

744
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Should I be using ketones exogenously?

745
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Ultimately, the reason that I think these arguments are so vehement and passionate,

746
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
especially when you think it's diet, guys, right?

747
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It's diet.

748
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
It's like, I want to have aspartame, you want to have sugar.

749
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
How does my aspartame consumption impact your sugar consumption?

750
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:39,000
But what it hits at for a lot of people is a certainty about I can predict and project out into the future

751
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
how long I'm going to be able to live or die and I'm going to be able to compare myself to this other person.

752
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And their conviction in their particular approach, which derogates my approach implicitly,

753
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
suggests to me, you're going to die sooner.

754
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And that causes me to be fucking terrified.

755
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And it's the same reason why people are so, how long do you need to do?

756
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's not VO2 max that's most important.

757
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It's HRV.

758
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It's resting heart rate.

759
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's not its galvanic skin temperature.

760
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
We're not looking at that.

761
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
We're looking at telomere length.

762
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
We're not looking at that.

763
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It's whatever.

764
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
All of the things, you know, the entire field of health and fitness, which I'm a big part of,

765
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I think is a good chunk of it is death denialism, just masquerading as getting big biceps.

766
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yes.

767
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So sometimes it is more obvious.

768
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I think we need more nihilist health influences who will sort of say, you know,

769
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
when the question is asked, you know, should you eat white bread or brown bread or whatever it is,

770
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
you know, that they'll sort of begin with the question.

771
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It sort of depends on your views on the intrinsic value of life.

772
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Also, if you're a bit of a utilitarian, I mean, people often say that being unhealthy might be unethical

773
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
because in a country with nationalised healthcare, you're a burden.

774
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But are you?

775
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I mean, who costs the taxpayer more, the person who eats a bunch of burgers

776
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
and has a heart attack and dies instantly, or the person who lives into old age

777
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and therefore has some kind of long-term health problem like Alzheimer's.

778
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I need to, I need to interject here.

779
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So you ring me probably three years ago, four years ago, you ring me and I'm in the gym.

780
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And you say something like, what are you doing?

781
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So I come in the gym.

782
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
What are you doing?

783
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Oh, just whatever.

784
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Whatever.

785
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Catch up a little bit.

786
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I was like, what's going on?

787
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And you said, I'm trying nihilism.

788
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And I said, what do you mean?

789
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And you went, as a life philosophy, I'm trying nihilism.

790
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And I still don't know what you mean.

791
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So how is your experiment to make nihilism great again going?

792
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Well, I was getting a bit fed up of people saying, oh, you're a nihilist.

793
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Oh, you're an atheist.

794
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
They wouldn't say it in the terms of nihilism.

795
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
They'd say, oh, you're an atheist.

796
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Yeah, right.

797
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah.

798
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I mean, there was a cliff of Jordan Peterson on the Lex Friedman podcast.

799
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And he says, oh, you're secular and you go to art galleries.

800
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah.

801
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Well, what makes you think you're secular?

802
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And the head turn is real.

803
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
He does that.

804
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I thought to myself, what on earth are you talking about, man?

805
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Do you think you can't be an atheist and enjoy art?

806
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Now, I tried my best to understand what he was getting at.

807
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And I think he was trying to basically say that in order to enjoy art,

808
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
you need to have some kind of value.

809
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And in order to have any kind of surface level value,

810
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
you can always ask the why that question.

811
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Why do you value this?

812
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
The classic sort of why do you go to school to get a good grade?

813
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Well, you don't just want the grade.

814
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Why do you get the grade?

815
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You do it to get a good job and so on and so forth.

816
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Happens with value.

817
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And so why do you value art?

818
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Because maybe you value beauty or something.

819
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And Peterson's whole thing is that whatever's at the top of this value hierarchy

820
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
is in his definition divine.

821
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
He just defines it as such.

822
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And so he essentially said that people claim that they are nihilists,

823
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
but they don't live like that.

824
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I thought, well, what would it mean to really live like a nihilist?

825
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And I guess I tried it on for size,

826
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,000
but he's right into the extent that I think most people don't live like they're nihilists.

827
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
What would the definition of living like a nihilist be?

828
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I think it would just mean the rejection of any such thing as a non-contingent reason for acting.

829
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Be more accessible.

830
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You would need to really think that there's no reason to do anything

831
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
outside of essentially your crude preferences in biological drives.

832
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Right.

833
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And I think the reason why people think that nihilism is unlivable

834
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
is because they have this image of somebody just immediately becoming a Raskolnikov type figure

835
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
and just committing a murder or something.

836
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
But they forget that these people still have their memory.

837
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
They're going to be embedded in a culture and an upbringing

838
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
that their preferences are essentially still going to be aligned.

839
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I mean, Pendulet was once asked, if you're an atheist,

840
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
why don't you kill and assault every person you want to?

841
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And he says, I do, I do kill and assault everybody I want to,

842
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
which is precisely nobody.

843
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And very clever, gets a bit of an applause.

844
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
But I mean, the difficult question ethically is what happens when somebody doesn't have that view?

845
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
What happens when somebody does just disagree with you?

846
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
But I don't know, it was kind of boring.

847
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Just to interject that, so you could see the meaning-making machine of society and cultural norms

848
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
as being useful to constrain the behavior of those outlier people,

849
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
the ones who would go out and commit the litany of mass murders.

850
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
But mum told me that I'm not supposed to squash bugs when I was five years old

851
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
and this is now carried on through.

852
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But yeah, I think for most people, we are the descendants of the people who avoided,

853
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
at least for the most part, killing people that were close to us.

854
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And we feel a lot of the time like we're now close to each other.

855
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yes, yes.

856
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I think that's probably true.

857
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
The issue is that the more that we try to explain away these mechanisms,

858
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
we try to understand why in our evolutionary history we might have evolved certain moral taboos,

859
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
this kind of stuff.

860
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It begins to essentially take the complete ethical force out of it

861
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and that's what people think leads to leads to nihilism.

862
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Once you have fully explained why something would be considered immoral,

863
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
just on evolutionary grounds, you've essentially taken out the moral factor altogether

864
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
and you're explaining it in terms of genetic preference.

865
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Yeah, there's no more meaning.

866
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
There's no additional fluff or feeling of anything.

867
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
But this is, you know, I've spent a lot of time over the last few years

868
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
talking to evolutionary psychologists, evolutionary biologists,

869
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
people that have looked at the evolution of culture as well from a mimetic standpoint too.

870
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And it does seem to me that culture is just like exclusively an adaptive response to coordination at large scale

871
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,000
and that all of the things that are encoded in that are effective ways for your tribe to not blow itself up.

872
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Would you say the same thing about morality in general?

873
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Yes.

874
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So then how do you escape this nihilist conundrum that you think all it is,

875
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
you know, the reason why you're not killing people is just because you sort of evolved that way.

876
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Doesn't that kind of take out some of the meaning?

877
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So I think if you are permanently self-assessing why you do the things you do and the inputs that you feel,

878
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
but what that doesn't account for is the fact that we are self-deceptive.

879
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Quite right, yeah.

880
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And the sense of being a human is one that is imbued with meaning.

881
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I often use this term about how you are not personally cursed as a reassurance.

882
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And it was something that was reassuring to me.

883
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
If I was spending a bit of time where I was feeling sad or down or whatever,

884
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
it would feel like whatever emotion I was going through,

885
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
whatever unpleasant emotion I was going through was like a personal curse.

886
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And this makes sense when you look back at how the gods were personified as different sorts of emotions, right?

887
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:18,000
That, you know, keep it had an arrow that hit you or that, you know, you had gods of war, you had gods of wrath,

888
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
you had gods of envy, you had gods of narcissism.

889
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Because the experience of a thing, of a thought, of an emotion, of a state is not just the confused chemical signals of your body.

890
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And now I can just reverse engineer this.

891
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Even the interest, the interaction of you and whatever's going on in the social group around you isn't just that.

892
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
It's imbued with meaning because you interpret things in this soup of experience,

893
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
which scales things up from just what's happening to,

894
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and it feels like there's something, it feels like there's some there, there, right?

895
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yes. Yeah, yeah, you can't escape that illusion if it is an illusion.

896
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
This is another thing that I spoke to Ben about first name, first name basis it seems now.

897
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Mr. Shapiro.

898
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I did try that.

899
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And, you know, when I was emailing back and forth about setting up that event,

900
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I went to type out sort of like, well, it would be great to talk to Mr. Shapiro about, it just didn't feel right.

901
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

902
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
At least not behind his back, not say that I'm rude behind his back,

903
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
but it felt even weirder that he wasn't there to sort of appreciate the courtesy.

904
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Anyway, he said, like, you know, that I don't believe in free will.

905
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't know if you believe in free will, perhaps we can talk about that.

906
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
He's like, look, you don't believe in free will, but you act as if free will does exist all the time.

907
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And I remember thinking, what do you mean?

908
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
What does it look like to act as though free will doesn't exist?

909
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:52,000
The very argument or one of the arguments against free will is that you are essentially driven by your biology,

910
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
your genes, your will, you know, the Arthur Schopenhauer line that you can do what you will.

911
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You just can't will what you will.

912
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
In fact, you have to do what you will.

913
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
That's what drives behavior.

914
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:10,000
If that's the case, then why do you have this vision in your head that if you lack a belief in free will,

915
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
you're like not going to get out of bed in the morning.

916
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
The very argument is that you will get out of bed in the morning because you desire to go and get some breakfast.

917
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
That's like the whole point.

918
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And so any argument of that form of people say, well, you don't live like that's the case.

919
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I was like to think, well, what would it look like to you then?

920
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
You know, if I could ask Jordan Peterson when he says the way you don't live like an atheist, what would that look like to you?

921
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I don't know if he might say something like, well, you'd probably be this morally depraved, you know, self-interested, blah, blah, blah.

922
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Like maybe, but is that really what you think?

923
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I mean, I don't know.

924
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Yeah, I think it forgets the fact that you are a product of your time, regardless of your beliefs from that time.

925
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Right?

926
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I understand the Judeo-Christian values that everything is based on, you know, it's like a common talking point from those guys.

927
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:08,000
But okay, how am I supposed to extricate me from that completely shake the etch-a-sketch of my value set and then take it from the beginning?

928
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
And let's not forget, like a lot of those values have grown out of what would have been an adaptive response in any case.

929
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yeah.

930
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
So the illusion is there.

931
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
The illusion is unshakable.

932
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
And so it sort of is a bit senseless to me to us, particularly on the free will thing.

933
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Like, oh, why don't you act like free will doesn't exist?

934
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
What do you mean?

935
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I literally, it's unintelligible to me.

936
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Did you listen to my Sapolsky episode yet?

937
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
No, I didn't think so.

938
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
So his new book determined the science of life without free will.

939
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Every time that I talk about free will, people get upset.

940
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Why is that?

941
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
That's the question for you.

942
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I think the reason-

943
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Insert joke about how it's not their fault.

944
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Yeah, yeah.

945
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
It's like my least favorite genre of joke that's done in philosophy.

946
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Every single time.

947
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Every single time.

948
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Without fail.

949
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I don't know.

950
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I don't know.

951
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And it's something that the conversation about free will is such a turn off for people that I actively push it further into episodes.

952
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I actively don't title episodes that have got that in it.

953
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I can surreptitiously coax people into thinking about it.

954
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:23,000
But the response is very, it's a high amount of dissatisfaction.

955
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
People don't like to think about that.

956
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Now, it may be because it's dry.

957
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I'm open to that.

958
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
That's true.

959
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It may be because it threatens their sense of agency and sovereignty,

960
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
which is something I've kind of built this channel off the back of,

961
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
like you can enact change within your own life, internalize your locus of control,

962
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
stop being such a bitch, etc.

963
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And so maybe I'm a victim of my own foundation in that regard that I've selected for a particular group of people.

964
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
But it's happened a few times.

965
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
A few different conversations about it, tangential.

966
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
One guy was a compatibility like quasi-compatibilist.

967
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Why are you shaking your head?

968
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
That it's just the most ludicrous compromise to me.

969
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Compatibilism.

970
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Am I right in saying that compatibilism just kicks the can down the road

971
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
and plays lexical overload with things?

972
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I think more or less.

973
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Right.

974
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
A lot of the time you're just also dealing with essentially a redefinition of free will.

975
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It's water.

976
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I don't mean that.

977
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I mean this thing.

978
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Yeah, Sam Harris has called it the Atlantis fallacy.

979
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
He had an extended argument with Daniel Dennett, a compatibilist about free will.

980
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And Daniel Dennett would talk about how this exists and this exists.

981
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And it sounds like, yeah, that's true.

982
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
But you're just not talking about what people care about in free will.

983
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
What you're doing is we're trying to ask if Atlantis exists.

984
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And you're pointing to Venice and you're saying, look, here's the city.

985
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
It's got a lot of water and it's kind of old.

986
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And these are all true, but it's just not Atlantis.

987
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And what most people are talking about when they try to bring free will back into the discussion is just not free will.

988
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
It's as straightforward as it gets in my view.

989
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I mean, there are versions of freedom that can be sensibly believed in.

990
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
It kind of depends on what your conception of freedom means.

991
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
But if you mean something like authorship over your actions,

992
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
if you mean that we could have rewound the clock and I could have done something differently,

993
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
but I could have won a different shirt.

994
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I don't think that the answer is yes.

995
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Logically, yes.

996
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
You know, the possible worlds discussion earlier.

997
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
There's a possible world where I'm in a different shirt,

998
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
but I guess like physically, possibly metaphysically,

999
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I couldn't have made a different choice.

1000
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Well, regardless of what you believe or don't believe about free will,

1001
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
the response, people's response to it is fascinating.

1002
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Absolutely fascinating.

1003
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And maybe, yeah, maybe it is that degree of control, almost like the denial of death.

1004
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Like I wonder, have they done experiments on when people are reminded that they do

1005
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
or do not have free will that their behavior adjusts?

1006
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Not that I know of, but I would love to see that because if it is,

1007
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
and maybe it is true, but I think if it is true,

1008
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I can understand why it might be quite like fatalistic.

1009
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I mean, it literally is quite fatalistic really to say that there's no freedom.

1010
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
And I can understand why that might make someone sad

1011
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
and that sadness might motivate their behaviors slightly differently.

1012
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
But I think that intrinsically, if there are a way to control for people

1013
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
who are sort of happy or sad about it,

1014
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
because you can believe in there's no free will and be like,

1015
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
thank goodness, it's all out of my hands.

1016
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
If you can control for that and show that people do, they are like less productive

1017
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
or they don't get out of bed as much,

1018
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
then I think that would be meaningful

1019
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
and it might be a sort of second order reason not to have this conversation.

1020
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I don't know if there's been such a investigation as there has to death,

1021
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
which by the way, I think a good example of the death denial thing

1022
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
is to think about your magnum opus

1023
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
if you were sort of working on the great life work or something

1024
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
and you're about to die and then you're just about to sort of to finish it off.

1025
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Suppose you found out that after you publish this and you die,

1026
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
a week later you found out that a meteor was going to come and destroy the earth.

1027
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Everybody dies.

1028
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Does that make you more or less enthusiastic about finishing your project?

1029
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Now, for most people, I think, it's going to make them less enthusiastic.

1030
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
It would certainly make me less enthusiastic.

1031
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
But why? What's the difference to you?

1032
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It doesn't make a difference.

1033
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
You're going to be dead beforehand anyway, nothing's going to change.

1034
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Seems to suggest that maybe the desire to get this done

1035
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
before you die in the first place isn't just as people like to claim

1036
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
for the love of the art and it's all in the process.

1037
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
No, it's because here's a work that's going to outlive you.

1038
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Here's something that's going to help you to escape your own death.

1039
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And when faced with the inevitability of the destruction of even that,

1040
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
the motivation goes down.

1041
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I wouldn't be surprised if simply reminding somebody who's writing a play or something

1042
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,000
that one day, heat death, everything evaporates including your new book

1043
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
if that would make them less motivated to finish the book.

1044
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Which to me implies that the reverse corollary

1045
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
is that the reason you are making the book is in some way indebted

1046
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
to the fact that you think it will outlive you and therefore is an exercise

1047
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
in the denial of death.

1048
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Didn't Ernest Becker die at an unfortunate time?

1049
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I don't know much about his personal life.

1050
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I think he did.

1051
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But there are interesting coincidences like that dotted across a lot of...

1052
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
The thing about coincidences is that so many things happen all the time

1053
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
that the only extraordinary thing would be if there weren't some extraordinary things like that.

1054
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Like Al Becker Mew was killed in a car crash

1055
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
and he was killed in a car crash with a train ticket in his pocket.

1056
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
So it seemed like he decided at the last minute to go in the car and said,

1057
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
and he had previously said that the most absurd way to die would be in an automobile accident.

1058
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And that's how he dies.

1059
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Sigmund Freud was terrified of...

1060
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I think it was the number 63.

1061
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It was like 63.

1062
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Or maybe it was like 48.

1063
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I can't remember.

1064
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
A number around that.

1065
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
He was just terrified of it.

1066
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Had a real sort of foreboding about it for some reason.

1067
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
He got a phone number that ended in that number and it freaked him out.

1068
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,000
He got a hotel room that had that number and he just became convinced that he was going to die at that age.

1069
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Guess when he died?

1070
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
48.

1071
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
No, when he was like 80.

1072
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Sometimes it goes wrong.

1073
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
You're a dick.

1074
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
You are a dick.

1075
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
The rest of that was true though.

1076
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
All right.

1077
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
What's your sexy paradox that you wanted to show me?

1078
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Yes.

1079
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Get your paradox out of the land.

1080
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Think about this, right?

1081
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Now, I can't remember what the source is and I want to attribute the person who does it.

1082
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Maybe I can find it.

1083
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Yeah, get it.

1084
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Let me find it because I want to make sure that they get the credit for it.

1085
00:54:51,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I was told about it by a friend and you have to give me a minute because I don't want to pass this off as my own.

1086
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
What do you do with everything else?

1087
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I think it's called the anthropic.

1088
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So it's a website called risingentropy.com is seemingly the origin of this paradox,

1089
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:21,000
but I was told about it by a friend and it's, I guess, okay, so imagine that,

1090
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:28,000
and what this does is it shows us that different ways of thinking give us wildly different answers to the same problem,

1091
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
different ways of looking at a problem.

1092
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:40,000
So imagine that there's a maniac who, and it's called the anthropic dice killer if you want to look it up.

1093
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
There's a maniac who is kidnapping people and murdering them.

1094
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And what he does is he kidnaps one person and he blindfolds them and he rolls a dice.

1095
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And if that dice is a six, then he'll kill you.

1096
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
If not, he'll let you go free.

1097
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,000
And what he'll do if he lets you go free is he'll go and pick up two people, kidnap them, blindfold them,

1098
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
roll the dice.

1099
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
If it's a six, kills you.

1100
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
If it's anything else, go free.

1101
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Then it's four people.

1102
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Then it's eight people and it doubles.

1103
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
So it's an exponential.

1104
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Until he hits a six.

1105
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Until he hits a six.

1106
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Now, you wake up knowing all this information, you wake up blindfolded and you know these facts

1107
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
and you know that a dice is about to be rolled, but you're blindfolded.

1108
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
You don't know how many people are there with you.

1109
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:36,000
You're given a button that you can press that will make the chances that you're killed half, one and two.

1110
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
So if you want to, you can press this button and a 50% of the time it will just kill you immediately

1111
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
and 50% of the time you'll get to go free.

1112
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Or you can let him roll the dice.

1113
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
What do you do?

1114
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Do you press the button or not?

1115
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:54,000
So at least on the surface, this is to do with the probability of one in six versus one in two.

1116
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
There is this escalating thing that's happening in the background.

1117
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So I would presume that you would say, don't hit the button because that has increased the chance of you being killed from one in six to one in two.

1118
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Right.

1119
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And this seems true.

1120
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
And it is true that, yeah, I mean, like you've got a one in six chance of dying.

1121
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
And if you press the button, you've got a one in two.

1122
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
So you're better at rolling the dice.

1123
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:29,000
But if you think about it as one big block, then something very strange happens because if you consider all of the people involved,

1124
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:38,000
if all you know is that you've woken up and you're somewhere in this process, then interestingly,

1125
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:46,000
say it gets to number two, it gets to round two, then there have been three people involved, three victims involved.

1126
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,000
And two of them end up dying and one of them goes free.

1127
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:00,000
So if you find yourself in this situation as a victim, you've got a more than half probability that you're in the second group that ends up dying.

1128
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I suppose that actually it ends in the third group.

1129
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Right.

1130
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Now there are how many people involved?

1131
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
You've got one than two.

1132
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Then four.

1133
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Then four.

1134
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So we've now got seven people involved.

1135
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Right.

1136
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Four people end up dying.

1137
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And so if you sort of wake up in this scenario, you've got a four in seven chance that you're going to die,

1138
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
that you're going to be one of the people who dies, which is more than half.

1139
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And this continues such that if you consider the fact that it doesn't matter where it ends,

1140
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:41,000
you're always going to have a slightly higher than half chance that you're in the group that ends up getting killed.

1141
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:50,000
But is it more than half given that each round of the dice roll is only one in six?

1142
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Yeah, because it's about like if in fact it gets to number three.

1143
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Right.

1144
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Like you know that you're going to be in the group that dies.

1145
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
If it in fact gets to number two, then there's a more than half chance that you're going to die.

1146
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So I'm going to hit the button.

1147
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Is that right?

1148
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Well, maybe.

1149
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I mean, it seems ludicrous to hit the button, but thinking about it this way,

1150
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
it seems like that's what you should actually do.

1151
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It's simultaneously the case that you have got a one in six chance of dying

1152
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
because you're doing it on the roll of a dice.

1153
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
But at the same time, if you think about the fact that one of these groups is going to end up dying

1154
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:35,000
and it doesn't matter where it ends, the chances of you being in that group are always going to be slightly higher than half.

1155
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Right.

1156
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
From a population level.

1157
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
The anthropic dice killer because it is the anthropic principle is thinking about.

1158
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yeah.

1159
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
What's that?

1160
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I once read a sci-fi book that was there was a threat of the end of the world.

1161
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
They were looking to get humanity off the planet.

1162
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:06,000
And there is a theory that uses almost this exact same idea which says that if you take the entirety of human history

1163
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:13,000
and you were to pick a time at which you were to live and you have this rapid increase toward humanity,

1164
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:21,000
it works out that it's more likely that you are within some percent of the end of humanity.

1165
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Right.

1166
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Yeah.

1167
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Because of the exponential growth.

1168
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Precisely.

1169
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Exactly.

1170
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Are you familiar with this idea?

1171
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I don't think so.

1172
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Right.

1173
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
But it's fascinating.

1174
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It works the exact same.

1175
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
If that graph is going up at the requisite speed, then yeah.

1176
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Right.

1177
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And this is the exact same thing.

1178
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I mean, the version on the website actually involves snake eyes.

1179
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So it's two dice.

1180
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And instead of it being one, then two, then four, it's one, then ten, then a hundred, then a thousand.

1181
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Right.

1182
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
So it ramps up more quickly.

1183
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And now you're rolling snake eyes.

1184
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So it's a one in 36 chance.

1185
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,000
And it turns out that if you add up the probability of like N number of cases,

1186
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
it's something like 90% chance versus the half that you get to press,

1187
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
which just seems ludicrous.

1188
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
And it seems that two things are true at once,

1189
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
depending on just how you look at the problem.

1190
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
So sometimes problems like this are just to do with the way you word them.

1191
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I mean, there are tons of like these sort of interesting math paradoxes,

1192
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
which aren't paradoxes at all.

1193
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
You must be familiar with the man who walks into the hotel,

1194
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
pays 30 pounds, goes up to his room,

1195
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
and the guy behind the bar says,

1196
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
the manager says,

1197
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
oh, no, he should have only paid 25.

1198
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
We've got a deal on.

1199
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
So he calls the bell boy and says,

1200
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
can you go and give him five pounds back to the man in the room?

1201
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And the bell boy thinks to himself on the way up,

1202
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
like this guy doesn't know any better.

1203
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
He doesn't know how much he owed.

1204
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I'm going to pocket three pounds for myself.

1205
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I'm only going to give him two pounds.

1206
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
So he goes back to the room.

1207
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
He says, excuse me, sir.

1208
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Sorry, you paid, you know, you paid 30 pounds.

1209
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
You paid too much.

1210
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Here's two pounds change.

1211
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
So how much has the man now paid?

1212
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
25 pounds.

1213
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
No, 28 pounds.

1214
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
28 pounds.

1215
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
And how much has the bell boy got in his pocket?

1216
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Two.

1217
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
He gave the guy two pounds back.

1218
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Right.

1219
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Where's that money come from?

1220
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Yeah, he's got three.

1221
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
So the bell boy, so the man's now only paid 28 pounds.

1222
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
He's paid 30 pounds.

1223
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
He gets two pounds back from the bell boy.

1224
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Yeah.

1225
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
He's got, he's paid 28 pounds.

1226
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
The bell boy's got three pounds in his pocket,

1227
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
which makes 31.

1228
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
So where's the extra pound come from?

1229
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Actually, no, he hasn't.

1230
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
The guy paid 25 plus now he's got two back.

1231
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
That's right.

1232
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
So it's the way you word it, right?

1233
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
So this like stumps people.

1234
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
And you can do it the other way around as well.

1235
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
You can say that the guy goes up and he gives,

1236
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
the bell boy gives three pounds back to the guy.

1237
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
So he's only paid 27 pounds,

1238
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
but the bell boy's got two pounds.

1239
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And it's only 29.

1240
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
And this, you know, it sort of goes viral on social media

1241
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
because people are like, how the hell does it work?

1242
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
It's the blue and black or green and gold dress.

1243
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
It's like, I mean, for those that, yeah, I guess there is,

1244
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
it's like those in that there is a real answer

1245
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
to what the actual war is actually going on there.

1246
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
It leads people based on how you word it.

1247
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It's how people, you know, shortchange it

1248
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
when they scan people at a bar or something.

1249
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I mean, the easiest way to visualise that particular problem

1250
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
is to imagine that the man was only supposed to pay two pounds.

1251
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
You know, so the bell boy goes up and gives him 28.

1252
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
He's supposed to give him 28 pounds

1253
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
and decides to pocket two pounds for himself.

1254
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
So he gives him, you know, gives him 26 pounds back.

1255
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
So how much is the man paid, like four pounds

1256
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
and how much the bell boy got, like 26 pounds,

1257
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
which is ludicrous.

1258
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
But you'd be amazed at how easily people can be

1259
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
completely nicely stumped by it.

1260
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
And it's all in the, it's all in the wording.

1261
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
So a problem like the anthropic dice killer,

1262
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I wonder how much it's just sort of to do with the way

1263
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
that you describe it, you know.

1264
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Have there been any paradoxes

1265
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
that sent you into a fugue state for a little while?

1266
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Was there anything that captured a particularly long amount of time

1267
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
that you sort of couldn't stop considering?

1268
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Most of the famous ones since,

1269
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
since I first started learning about paradoxes,

1270
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
like the famous Monty Hall problem,

1271
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
that obsessed me for, well, I wouldn't say obsessed me,

1272
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
but I was sort of blown away by it.

1273
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
There's also, you know the Monty Hall problem.

1274
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
You'll definitely have heard of this before.

1275
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,000
This, it's the game show and the three doors.

1276
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Right. Yeah.

1277
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
You know what I'm talking about.

1278
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
There are interesting paradoxes that aren't actually paradoxes.

1279
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
There's a book by Jim Alcalely called Paradox,

1280
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
which is a description of so-called paradoxes.

1281
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
So like, I think, I think all this paradox is,

1282
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
when people used to think that the universe was infinite,

1283
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
infinitely large, I mean,

1284
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
there was this problem that if empty space is filled up

1285
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
fairly randomly with stars,

1286
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I mean, we know there's a lot of stars in the sky

1287
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
and galaxies and objects that emit light,

1288
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
then there should essentially be no darkness in the sky.

1289
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
The sky should look kind of like an overcast day

1290
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
because like the gaps in the sky, you know,

1291
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
are all eventually going to be filled up

1292
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
and any amount, any small gap,

1293
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
you might think the stars are really far away.

1294
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
They'll also be like closer together,

1295
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
therefore emitting more light visually and they'll be bigger.

1296
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
And so if the universe is infinite,

1297
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
you should just see a sort of overcast day.

1298
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And it was a paradox.

1299
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
It was like, how does this happen?

1300
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And it basically became an interesting proof

1301
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
that the universe has a beginning,

1302
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
that the universe is not in fact infinite,

1303
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
just the fact that it gets dark at night

1304
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
because if it were actually infinite,

1305
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
there should be a sort of overcast view,

1306
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Alba's paradox.

1307
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
And like I say, it's sort of a paradox,

1308
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
but not really a paradox.

1309
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Are you familiar with the Buete's Void?

1310
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Do you know this? I think so.

1311
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
This is like my favorite part of the universe.

1312
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I'd say like I'm mapping it,

1313
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
like my favorite barbecue restaurants in Austin.

1314
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
And it's a huge, what's referred to as a super void,

1315
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
which is a period of the universe,

1316
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
an area of the universe which has way fewer galaxies

1317
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
than you would anticipate.

1318
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And given what's the principle of like,

1319
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
homogeneity across the universe that it should be,

1320
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
it should be relatively similar, right?

1321
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Like thermodynamics.

1322
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Yes.

1323
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Entropy and...

1324
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Now you're just saying the space words at me.

1325
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Well, you know, like when you spray in aerosol can,

1326
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
it will eventually spread at the room.

1327
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Dispaces equally.

1328
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,000
So the point is that there shouldn't be

1329
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
huge fluctuations in the way that we see the universe.

1330
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Everything should be spread relatively evenly.

1331
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Now, I found out that supposedly at the point of the Big Bang,

1332
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,000
there were one million particles of antimatter

1333
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
and one million and one particles of matter.

1334
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
And it is that one to one million and one ratio

1335
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
that is exactly where everything that we see comes from.

1336
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
And this minor imbalance is actually

1337
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
what's permitted everything to exist.

1338
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
But this particular Buete's B-O-O one with an umlaut T-E-S,

1339
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Buete's super void.

1340
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
It's just super fucking interesting.

1341
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
It's this gap where there's way fewer galaxies

1342
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
than there should be.

1343
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Why should this exist?

1344
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Given that we've got this sort of principle of homogeneity

1345
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
across the universe.

1346
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And that's one of my favorite things to like learn about.

1347
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Yeah.

1348
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
But is it that we know about this void

1349
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
because of the disbalance?

1350
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Or is it that we hypothesize the disbalance

1351
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
because of the knowledge of the void?

1352
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
We know based on mapping of, I think,

1353
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I'm not sure if it's telescopic or if it's microwave background stuff,

1354
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
but we know that it's there.

1355
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Right.

1356
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
And the question is, what the fuck is this thing doing there?

1357
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Yeah.

1358
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Well, that's a bit like sort of dark energy when we discover

1359
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
that galaxies are spinning a little bit too quickly on the outside.

1360
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
There seems to be something like pushing them along.

1361
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
What do you make of the fine-tune universe idea?

1362
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
A lot of people describe it as the most powerful argument for God's existence.

1363
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Christopher Hitchens in the back of a car once said

1364
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
that that was really what gave him pause.

1365
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I don't find that it moves me very much.

1366
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I mean, it does seem quite extraordinary that had any of the constants

1367
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
of the universe, the force of gravity, for example,

1368
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
if it was stronger or weaker by the most unimaginably small amount,

1369
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
then it would either be strong enough that the universe would collapse in on itself

1370
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,000
or it would be so weak that atoms couldn't even form

1371
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
or at least objects couldn't form

1372
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
and everything just gets blown apart at the big bang.

1373
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Three explanations for this.

1374
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
It's chance, it's necessity or it's design

1375
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
and chances seems like a ludicrous suggestion.

1376
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I mean, there are lots of different constants

1377
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
and it may be the case that we discover this sort of theory of everything

1378
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
that reduces it down to one.

1379
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Still a huge mystery as to why it has the constant that it does

1380
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
but would mean that we're not talking about lots of different constants in harmony.

1381
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Somehow happens to be unified in one way.

1382
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
But the idea that it's necessarily being that way

1383
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
doesn't seem that out of the question for me.

1384
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
People put it in the language of saying that

1385
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
had the constants been different by this amount,

1386
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
the universe couldn't exist.

1387
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And what people often hear is the chances of the constant being as it was

1388
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
was the same number, but I don't think that's the same thing.

1389
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
It might just be not possible that it could have had a different value.

1390
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,000
What's the observer selection effect of this?

1391
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
This doesn't work for the fine-tuning argument, I think.

1392
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
So the so-called like anthropic principle,

1393
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
the universe seems designed for human life.

1394
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
People might point to, for example,

1395
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
the Earth's perfect distance from the Sun in the so-called Goldilocks zone

1396
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
had it been a little bit further out or a little bit closer, humans couldn't exist.

1397
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And the easy answer to that is to say,

1398
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
well, yeah, but if you didn't exist,

1399
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
then you wouldn't be there to observe that it didn't exist, right?

1400
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And so you say, given the size of the universe,

1401
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
life might develop somewhere, possibly in multiple places,

1402
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
and the places where it's going to be observed coming about

1403
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
is where it comes about, so no surprise.

1404
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
That works there, but the fine-tuning concepts of the universe,

1405
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
we're not talking about like,

1406
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
we're not talking about like a potential billions of Earths

1407
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
that could all give rise to human beings.

1408
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
We're talking about if one of these constants was different,

1409
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
by the tiniest amount, nothing exists.

1410
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
And sure, it is still true that didn't not happen.

1411
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
We wouldn't be here to observe it.

1412
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
My friend Josh Perique has given me an example in the past of like,

1413
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I don't know, you can imagine like a series of highly trained knife throwers

1414
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,000
just lobbed like 100,000 knives at you in an attempt to kill you,

1415
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:56,000
and they all miss perfectly cutting out the silhouette of your body behind you,

1416
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
absolutely perfectly, just like uncanny.

1417
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
And someone says, well, they must have done that on purpose.

1418
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It's like a trick, right?

1419
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
And you say, no, no, I think it's just happened by chance.

1420
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
You say, well, that's ludicrous.

1421
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Oh, what if it didn't?

1422
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
And I wouldn't be here to observe that it did, would I?

1423
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
It still just wouldn't do it for you, even though that is true.

1424
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Had you been killed, you wouldn't be there to observe it.

1425
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
It just seems such an unlikely coincidence that that just doesn't work

1426
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
when we're talking about the actual fundamental stuff of the universe,

1427
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
which is why people are so troubled by it.

1428
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
But I do think, generally speaking, with all of these kinds of things,

1429
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
fine-tuning, consciousness is another example

1430
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
that's broadly in the scientific realm that people think,

1431
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
like this just can't be explained to that reference to a God.

1432
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Maybe they're right.

1433
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I don't know.

1434
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
But if you intuitively were to step into a time machine

1435
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
and look at some people having this conversation,

1436
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:48,000
and you said like, imagine them looking back and saying,

1437
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
gosh, can you believe it?

1438
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
They hadn't worked out fine-tuning yet.

1439
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
They hadn't figured out the constants.

1440
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Oh, they hadn't figured out the science of consciousness yet.

1441
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I can conceive of that.

1442
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Just intuitively, I can see someone doing that.

1443
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
But when I think about my arguments for atheism,

1444
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
the problem of evil, divine hidden, this kind of stuff,

1445
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I can't imagine somebody looking through a time machine similarly

1446
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
at a conversation that I have and going,

1447
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
gosh, can you believe it?

1448
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
They hadn't worked out the problem of evil yet.

1449
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
They hadn't worked out divine hiddenness yet.

1450
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I think these are perennial problems.

1451
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
So where you have these scientific arguments for the existence of God,

1452
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I guess I just have more of a trust that they will one day be explained

1453
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,000
in a way that won't require recourse to a divine author

1454
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:35,000
in a way that my criticisms of religion will probably not be similarly resolved.

1455
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
We had a great conversation in Austin

1456
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
as you explained to me about the potential historical accuracy

1457
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
or inaccuracy of Jesus' resurrection.

1458
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Can you go through that a little bit?

1459
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Yeah.

1460
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I mean, this sometimes is used as an argument for the existence of God,

1461
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
but I think more successfully is used

1462
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
once you've already established the existence of God

1463
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
to try to establish the truth of Christianity.

1464
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:04,000
And that is a bunch of historical facts surrounding Jesus' alleged resurrection

1465
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
that you sort of have to ask what the best explanation is for.

1466
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Now, you can't historically prove a resurrection,

1467
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
but you can historically prove events

1468
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
and then ask what the best explanation of those facts is.

1469
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
So people will often point to the fact that there was a man called Jesus

1470
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:26,000
walking around morally teaching people who was crucified by the Romans

1471
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,000
and that a few days after his death was seen,

1472
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,000
people made claims that they'd seen him after he'd died.

1473
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And the question is how do you explain these facts?

1474
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
The gospel reliability is an interesting question in general

1475
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
and people will often on the surface level say,

1476
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
look, the Bible contradicts itself.

1477
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
It's full of contradictions.

1478
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
And there are some seeming contradictions in the gospel story,

1479
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
but of course, what a lot of people neglect to consider

1480
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
is that when we're talking about a text as a historical document,

1481
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:08,000
contradictions shouldn't make us think that it's less accurate but more accurate.

1482
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
If historical sources contradict each other,

1483
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
that's evidence of their accuracy rather than evidence of the opposite.

1484
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Because if this is a mythical story that somebody's making up,

1485
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
you would expect the details to concur.

1486
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:31,000
That is, if you're questioning two suspects in some kind of murder trial or something

1487
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:37,000
and their stories match up perfectly, like to the tea, the timings, everything,

1488
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
it arouses suspicion.

1489
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It seems like somebody's inventing something.

1490
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Someone's coming up with a story here and trying to perfect it.

1491
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Now, people have this idea that a bunch of people got together

1492
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:52,000
and tried to fool the world into this mythical story of this man rising from the dead.

1493
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Do you think they would have made the mistake of just including these blatant contradictions?

1494
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I don't know.

1495
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
In other words, I think if somebody was making it up,

1496
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
they probably would have taken more care.

1497
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Is there a term for this?

1498
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I'm sure there is.

1499
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I'm not a historian.

1500
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I couldn't tell you what it is.

1501
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:14,000
But we do see contradictions on the minor points.

1502
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
We don't really see much disagreement about the major points.

1503
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
There is some enough disagreement, I think, to arouse suspicion.

1504
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I'm saying this as if I'm some kind of Christian or theist.

1505
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I put on that hat when I'm asked to have a conversation of this kind.

1506
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:33,000
It does seem to me suspicious, for example, that the Gospel of Mark, which is the earliest Gospel,

1507
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
contains no post-resurrection appearances.

1508
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Then the Gospel of Matthew does include post-resurrection appearances.

1509
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
The Gospel of Luke includes even more.

1510
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
It's only in the Gospel of John that we get, for instance, doubting Thomas,

1511
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
which is the latest canonical Gospel, I should say.

1512
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
That's where that arises.

1513
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,000
In fact, the story of doubting Thomas famously, he doesn't believe that it's the risen Christ.

1514
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Jesus says, come and touch my wounds.

1515
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:04,000
He touches his wounds and he says, my Lord and my God.

1516
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Jesus says, you believe because you've seen.

1517
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Blessed are those who believe without seeing.

1518
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:19,000
In my view, what we have is this so-called mythological development of no post-resurrection appearances.

1519
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:25,000
As the time goes on, as we get further away from the source, the stories get more fantastical,

1520
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:32,000
ending in a moral lesson to believe without seeing.

1521
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
This to me does seem a little bit suspicious.

1522
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
It is a fascinating mystery.

1523
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Something very strange happened on Easter morning.

1524
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
How do we explain the fact that this man gets crucified by the Romans

1525
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,000
and then people claim to see him after he died and were willing to be put to death for that belief?

1526
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Maybe he didn't die.

1527
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Unlikely, as they say, the Romans knew how to kill people and supposedly they check

1528
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:09,000
and they go to break the legs of the other prisoners as they're taking them down from their crosses.

1529
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,000
They were taking them down temporarily and they hadn't died yet,

1530
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
but when they go to break Jesus' legs, they realize he's already dead,

1531
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:23,000
which is why his legs don't get broken and they stab him in the side with a stick to make sure that he's dead.

1532
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
This was a very effective method of killing people and they knew how to do it,

1533
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
so it's unlikely that he somehow survived this.

1534
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Is that the guy that stabbed him with the spear and supposedly this blood on the spear?

1535
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Yeah, someone stabbed him with the spear after he's on the cross.

1536
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
And it's essentially to check he's dead.

1537
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Okay, so the likely hit is that he was actually crucified and then a few days later people are claiming to see him.

1538
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Maybe they're lying, but then you don't tend to go to death for something you know to be a lie.

1539
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
You're willing to be put to death for things that you think are true that are false,

1540
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
but very rarely are people willing to die for beliefs that they don't actually believe themselves.

1541
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
That doesn't really happen, so they probably weren't lying.

1542
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Maybe they were mistaken, fooled.

1543
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Yeah, now I've known you since about 2019,

1544
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:21,000
which is probably, it will have been slightly longer than Jesus was with his disciples,

1545
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:28,000
but imagine spending every single day with this person, living with this person, eating with this person.

1546
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
And then you've only seen him a few days ago.

1547
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,000
And somehow, imagine somebody managed to convince you that they were me.

1548
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Even if I had a twin brother, they probably wouldn't be able to convince you that it was me.

1549
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Or maybe they were hallucinating in groups.

1550
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:52,000
One of the earliest New Testament sources is the letters of Paul, the earliest.

1551
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And in one of those letters, Paul refers to Jesus having appeared to 500 people at once.

1552
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
And in some of the Gospels, you get at least some group appearances, at least more than one person.

1553
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And sometimes groups of disciples, the 12, all seeing Jesus all at once.

1554
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
You don't get group hallucinations like that.

1555
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And so it doesn't seem like they were mistaken either.

1556
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
And so if they're not mistaken, they're not making it up.

1557
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:21,000
What explains the fact that these people claim to see him after he had died?

1558
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:29,000
And the Christian apologists will say that the only real plausible explanation is that he really did rise from the dead.

1559
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Now, it's an interesting argument and it's quite powerful.

1560
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:40,000
However, my response has always been that this sort of process of elimination is very clever.

1561
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
And that's how it's usually run.

1562
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
But it can go the other way.

1563
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I mean, imagine I were trying to prove that there was such thing as a group hallucination.

1564
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I know it's extraordinary, but there was a group hallucination.

1565
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
And I tried to prove it by saying, well, what are the other explanations?

1566
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Or maybe they lied.

1567
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Well, they wouldn't do that because they wouldn't go to death.

1568
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Or maybe a man rose from the dead, but come on, that doesn't happen.

1569
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
That breaks all the laws of physics.

1570
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
So the only remaining option is this.

1571
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Kind of depends where you start.

1572
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
But it is weird.

1573
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Something very strange seems to have happened on that morning.

1574
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:12,000
I can see why philosophers go mad.

1575
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Because you were able to simultaneously convince yourself of something and then convince yourself of the opposite

1576
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
and convince yourself of everything that you've believed.

1577
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Yeah, but that's...

1578
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I think one of those famous quotes of Socrates is that the sign of wisdom in a man

1579
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
or something is the ability to entertain a belief without holding it

1580
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
or without becoming convinced by it or something like that.

1581
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,000
And I think it's something anybody can do if they want to.

1582
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And it's why philosophers are so...

1583
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
We think that philosophers are better at doing this.

1584
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I don't think that's true.

1585
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I think they're just talking about stuff that's far less political, far less real.

1586
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
And so they're less likely to get...

1587
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:56,000
They're less likely to be offended at the prospect of considering the falsehood of their beliefs.

1588
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Maybe.

1589
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Until you get into religion, I suppose.

1590
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:08,000
You definitely seem to be able to have an ability to drop into and out of arguments on both sides of the same fence

1591
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:13,000
and play with ideas in a way that I think is rare

1592
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
and presumably a bit of a disposition but also largely trained

1593
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:23,000
because you can sit and convince chat GPT that God exists

1594
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
or try and turn me into a theist

1595
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
and then stand on stage and do the exact opposite.

1596
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And just...

1597
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I think that there's probably quite a lot to learn from how people who have spent a good bit of time

1598
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
playing with ideas in philosophy

1599
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:47,000
dispassionately have that separation between themselves

1600
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
and the idea and the belief and what it means to them and the emotion

1601
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
and kind of that whole ambient mess.

1602
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Yeah.

1603
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
It's playing is a good word because it's fun.

1604
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
It's enjoyable.

1605
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
That's why it's fun to talk about theory of knowledge

1606
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
because who really cares?

1607
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
It doesn't grow corn as they say

1608
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
or make corn, however you are supposed to say it.

1609
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,000
And that's fine because if it did, then it would certainly all get a bit serious

1610
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
and it kind of really matters whether you get it right or wrong

1611
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
whereas here we're just sort of having fun

1612
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
but you can...

1613
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I don't know.

1614
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I can kind of see why heretics would get burnt at the stake

1615
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
when religion had social power

1616
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,000
because you become convinced that this is the source of meaning

1617
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
this is the source of truth without it we are nothing.

1618
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
It's now being threatened.

1619
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
And then it turns out that maybe there are actually some holes to poke here

1620
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
or what are you going to do?

1621
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I mean, you can't let them do that

1622
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:48,000
because this is literally societally calamitous

1623
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
and so they end up getting burnt at the stake.

1624
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
That's what also annoys me.

1625
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I mean, you mentioned earlier this recent resurgence in the idea

1626
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
that we're all sort of balancing on Judeo-Christian values

1627
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
may be kind of true in a sense

1628
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
but it does kind of get on my nerves

1629
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
that after...

1630
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I said this to Ben yesterday

1631
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
that the history of religious persecution

1632
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
against the very developments

1633
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
that those religious groups now like to claim as their own

1634
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I think the religion has shown to be wrong on a number of things

1635
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I listed them yesterday

1636
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
the position of women in society

1637
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
the fate of homosexuals

1638
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
at least practicing homosexuals

1639
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
the position of the earth in relation to the sun

1640
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
the age of both of those celestial bodies

1641
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
wrong about the common evolutionary ancestry of all animals

1642
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
including the human animal

1643
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
wrong about the ownership of other human beings as private property

1644
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
as it's explicitly condoned not only in the Old Testament

1645
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
but also in the new

1646
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
and now not only does religion sort of...

1647
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
I mean, religion fails to come to us with an apology

1648
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
and contrition and say maybe we were wrong

1649
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
it says, no, no, no, those things are ours all along

1650
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
it says, yes

1651
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
we may have shown the instruments of torture to Galileo

1652
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
because he suggested that the earth might orbit the sun

1653
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
rather than the other way around

1654
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,000
but hey, didn't you know that the scientific revolution

1655
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
is essentially Judeo-Christian in origin?

1656
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Yes, the Old Testament gives you explicit instructions

1657
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
about exactly how to either buy or steal other human beings

1658
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
and keep them sometimes as your sexual property

1659
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
but don't you know that the abolitionist movement

1660
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
is essentially Judeo-Christian in origin?

1661
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Yes, I know that St. Paul says that

1662
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
man is the glory of God

1663
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
but woman is the glory of man

1664
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
and that I suffer not a woman to teach

1665
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
nor to assert authority over a man

1666
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
rather she should remain silent

1667
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
for Adam was formed first then Eve

1668
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
but don't you know that social justice movements

1669
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
are essentially Judeo-Christian in origin?

1670
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Yes, we know about the stoning of homosexuals

1671
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
and the fact that even St. Paul says

1672
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
that they're not getting into heaven

1673
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
but don't you know that the LGBT movement

1674
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
is essentially sort of riding on Judeo-Christian principles?

1675
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
It seems to me relatively offensive

1676
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
to the people who've managed to secure these developments

1677
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
against the very religious traditions

1678
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
that now like to claim them as their own.

1679
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Yeah, both cause and effect

1680
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
it's like being punched in the face by somebody

1681
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
who then comes over and gives you a bandage for it.

1682
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I mean people like to refer to

1683
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
and this is, I'm sort of rehashing some of the stuff

1684
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
that I said yesterday here

1685
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
people like to point out that the people

1686
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
who really got the scientific revolution going

1687
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
or often believe as in God,

1688
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Galileo believed in God, Newton believed in God

1689
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
in fact Newton spent, but people were fascinated

1690
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
to discover his diaries to find that he spent more time

1691
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
writing about theology than science.

1692
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
A mad man for the last 30 years doing alchemy, right?

1693
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Right, but here's the thing, right?

1694
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Like if, and as I said yesterday

1695
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I don't claim that this is the case

1696
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
but if it were true that science had like undermined

1697
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
religion and Christianity, if it were the case that

1698
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
actually these things aren't compatible with each other

1699
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
then when somebody says, well that can't be the case

1700
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
because don't you know that the people who sort of founded

1701
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
the scientific revolution were religious?

1702
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Well what else would they have been

1703
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
if they hadn't yet invented the mechanism

1704
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
by which their beliefs would come to be undermined?

1705
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
It's like saying that it's amazing that the person

1706
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,000
who invented the motor car didn't own a motor car beforehand.

1707
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
You see what I'm saying?

1708
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
It's sort of, I don't know, it seems very strange to me

1709
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
and it's very recently that the popularity of this

1710
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
has increased as you say.

1711
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I mean you go back to the mid-naughties

1712
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
at the height of new atheism and it was very popular

1713
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
to talk about how religions sort of always getting

1714
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
in the way of science and maybe that was a bit crude

1715
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
but I think we're seeing an equally crude annexation

1716
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
of all of the beneficial social developments

1717
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
of the past 100 years as somehow necessarily standing

1718
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
upon the Judeo-Christian tradition

1719
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
as if it couldn't have happened without them.

1720
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Is this a scrabbling for something to hold on to

1721
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
given that the collapse of grand narratives

1722
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
has had some poor externalities over the last couple of years?

1723
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Is it just mass cope?

1724
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I think so.

1725
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I think that nihilism as it were carries with it

1726
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
the feeling of being naked.

1727
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
You sort of thrown off what were essentially

1728
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
optional clothes to reveal what was there all along

1729
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,000
but when you actually face it to nature

1730
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
it's embarrassing, it's scary

1731
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
and you will do anything you can

1732
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
if you find yourself naked in public

1733
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
to find any clothes to put on, not just your old ones.

1734
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
It doesn't matter what clothes.

1735
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Any clothes are better than no clothes

1736
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
and this is what people are beginning to realize

1737
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
and so they're scrambling for their old clothes again.

1738
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Trying to legitimate.

1739
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Yes, and trying to put them on

1740
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
and that's why it's easy as well

1741
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
for people to go around poking holes in other people's clothes.

1742
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
It's very easy to do

1743
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
but that's what the success of a movement like New Atheism

1744
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
consists in the fact that all they had to do

1745
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
was just tell other people why they're wrong.

1746
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
You only need to poke holes in other people's clothes

1747
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
but if you need to sew your own shirt

1748
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
that gets a little more difficult.

1749
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Yes, Lewis said that the purpose of philosophy

1750
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
is not the cutting down of forests

1751
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
but the irrigation of deserts.

1752
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
That's very interesting.

1753
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Yeah, I've thought about this for a good while.

1754
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,000
The seductiveness of being critic

1755
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
as opposed to being somebody that makes suggestions

1756
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
and the lack of preparedness of anybody

1757
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
to put forward any proposals for anything.

1758
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
And it's easy for both sides

1759
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
to accuse each other of being reactionary.

1760
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
The reactionary right, the reactionary left.

1761
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
For instance, a perfect example of this

1762
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
is in the world of dating

1763
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
and mate selection in the mating market

1764
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
everybody can provide criticisms

1765
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
about what's going wrong

1766
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
and almost nobody provides any actionable steps to improve it

1767
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
beyond something that is

1768
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
illimitative rather than additive.

1769
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
If we could just stop doing this

1770
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
then this would be fixed.

1771
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I don't think that's quite the way that it works.

1772
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
And there's another very unique protection mechanism

1773
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
that's given which is

1774
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
it's very hard to criticize someone's criticism

1775
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
or at least being a critic

1776
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
leaves you open to criticism

1777
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
way less than being a proposer.

1778
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
If I put something forward

1779
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
if I posit a potential solution

1780
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
for you to be able to come back and say

1781
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
this is shit and this is shit and this is shit

1782
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
it's very easy to do.

1783
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Whereas for you to say

1784
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
for me to critic what you did

1785
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
and then for you to come back and go

1786
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
actually this and this and this

1787
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
it gets all a little bit abstract

1788
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
and it's a few degrees removed from anything that feels real.

1789
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Simon Cowell can't write a song.

1790
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
If the world was full of Simon Cowell

1791
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
we'd end up with no music.

1792
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Somebody's got to do the building here.

1793
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
You can't just be a critic.

1794
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
And this is what I think

1795
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
has been the reason for the success

1796
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
of the sort of anti-New Atheist stuff

1797
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
that we've been seeing recently.

1798
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
You'll have seen this.

1799
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Even the New Atheist themselves

1800
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
sort of treat it like it's a dead animal

1801
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
and in many ways it is

1802
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
and I think it's got to do with the fact that

1803
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
they've done a very good job

1804
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
of cutting down the central pillar

1805
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
of what has traditionally been

1806
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
the reason for people getting out of bed

1807
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
in the morning.

1808
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
And then when people are there saying

1809
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
well, what do we put in its place?

1810
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
They're like, see ya.

1811
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
You know, I'm out.

1812
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
And they go off and do different things.

1813
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
And what are people to do?

1814
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
And that's why...

1815
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Was it the job of the New Atheists

1816
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
to provide something to...

1817
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Well, maybe not.

1818
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Some people are just good at diagnosing problems.

1819
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Karl Marx is a good example.

1820
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Karl Marx's diagnoses

1821
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
of the way the world works

1822
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
are fascinating to read

1823
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
and incredibly useful

1824
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
even if you disagree with them.

1825
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
But obviously attempts to

1826
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
sort of build societies

1827
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
on those ideas alone have failed.

1828
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Seems like you need something a little bit more.

1829
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I just don't think it's true

1830
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
the religion stuff, I mean.

1831
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
And so that's why I think

1832
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
we're seeing this

1833
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
because people are beginning to realize

1834
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
that it probably isn't true.

1835
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
They can't quite get behind

1836
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
the truth claims.

1837
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
But they recognize that there's some utility

1838
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
in having other people believe

1839
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
that it is true.

1840
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
And I don't know where that leaves us

1841
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
because in this discussion

1842
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
about whether religion is good or bad for society,

1843
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I said yesterday,

1844
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
look, I will accept your premise wholesale

1845
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
that religion is good,

1846
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
maybe even necessary for society.

1847
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
What do you want me to do

1848
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
if I just don't think it's true?

1849
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Am I just lying to my children,

1850
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
raising and believing something

1851
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
that I don't believe is the case

1852
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
because I think it will somehow be beneficial to society?

1853
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
I don't think it works like that.

1854
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
I don't think people can actually fool themselves.

1855
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Sure, you can act as if God exists,

1856
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
and that's what someone like Peterson says

1857
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
that people do already,

1858
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
but ultimately if you just say,

1859
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
well, I think that, you know,

1860
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
it should just act like a Christian

1861
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
because it's good for me.

1862
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Then when push comes to shove

1863
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
and you really have to make a moral sacrifice,

1864
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
if you're not actually a Christian,

1865
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
you're probably not going to do

1866
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
the actually Christian thing.

1867
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Well, I wonder whether this is afforded to people

1868
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
because of the convenience and comfort of modern life.

1869
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
The fact that having to really,

1870
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
really put something on the line,

1871
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
it's mostly lapping as belief systems

1872
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
and I'll pick up that piece of trash

1873
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
and I will give money to this person on the street.

1874
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Yeah, people have sort of forgotten.

1875
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
It's like bourgeois religious belief.

1876
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
It's so irregularly that we have to make

1877
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
genuine moral sacrifices of the kind

1878
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
that used to be commonplace

1879
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
throughout the history of humanity

1880
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
that we've sort of forgotten our ability to do so.

1881
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
And I think that if you push people now,

1882
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
they recognize that they probably wouldn't

1883
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
make those sacrifices.

1884
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Did you see the Mr. Beast poll where he asked,

1885
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
would you rather have like a million dollars

1886
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
or like a random person on Earth dies

1887
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
or something like that if you press this button?

1888
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
No.

1889
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
And like, I think it might have been

1890
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
a majority of people that's slim majority

1891
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
said they'd press that button.

1892
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Yeah, kill someone random.

1893
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I'll take a million bucks.

1894
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
And I actually kind of believe them.

1895
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I think they actually would.

1896
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,000
And people want to say that that's because

1897
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,000
we've lost our belief in God.

1898
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I don't know.

1899
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Maybe I think a better explanation is just that,

1900
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
like you say, we've become too comfortable.

1901
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
And so when somebody says in other words like,

1902
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
oh, well, this must be due to decline in religion

1903
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
and the fact that we've forgotten

1904
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
our Judeo-Christian heritage.

1905
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I mean, you'll probably hear that a lot

1906
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
from people that you might talk to on this podcast.

1907
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
They'll say something like that.

1908
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Just think to yourself like,

1909
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
is that really the best explanation?

1910
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Is that the only explanation?

1911
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Could it be something to do with the growth of technology?

1912
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Could it be to do with something

1913
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
to do with the growth of comfort?

1914
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Yeah.

1915
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
And is it more likely to do with that?

1916
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
And maybe it's not the lack of religion

1917
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
that's causing the other stuff,

1918
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
but this other source that's causing both of those things.

1919
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Yeah.

1920
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I've been thinking a lot recently about stuff

1921
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
that is literally true, but figuratively false

1922
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
and figuratively true, but literally false.

1923
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:08,000
And it kind of seems a little bit like the beliefs

1924
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
that you're talking about here.

1925
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
It may be comforting, increasing in happiness,

1926
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
adaptive to kind of act as if these things exist.

1927
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
The belief in free will, actually.

1928
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Believing in free will or sorry.

1929
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Yeah, determinism generally is something

1930
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
that may be literally true, but figuratively false.

1931
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Yes.

1932
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
And that's kind of where I've come to

1933
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
as an opinion with this,

1934
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
that largely it's through designed ignorance

1935
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
that I just don't think about it that much.

1936
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Precisely the reason it evolves.

1937
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
That that's why it exists as an illusion

1938
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
because it does something for us.

1939
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
And that's fine.

1940
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I've never had a problem saying that,

1941
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
but when the sort of auspices under which

1942
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I'm having a conversation with Ben Shapiro

1943
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
is that he made a video called The Atheist Illusion.

1944
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
And in that video, he says like,

1945
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
look, you can't have free will without God.

1946
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I say, yeah, I agree.

1947
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
You can't have free will without God.

1948
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
You just also can't have it with God.

1949
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
And he essentially says like,

1950
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
well, you know, there's sort of a,

1951
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I don't know how free will works,

1952
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
but it's sort of a mystery that I'm willing

1953
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
to accept wholesale.

1954
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
And I'm like, well, this is fine,

1955
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
but who's the delusory one here?

1956
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
You know what I mean?

1957
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Like I've got no problem with you saying like,

1958
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
well, I see that this is more Ben Shapiro, by the way,

1959
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
but I have no problem with somebody saying, well,

1960
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
yeah, I mean, maybe free will doesn't exist,

1961
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
but it's better to act as though it does.

1962
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
It's like, okay, fine.

1963
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
But then don't say that I'm the one acting under a delusion.

1964
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I mean, delusions can be good.

1965
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
They might evolve for a good reason,

1966
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
but I don't know.

1967
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
I guess I find it difficult to treat something as true.

1968
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
That isn't, it's a bit like the gun has always loaded.

1969
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
That's one of Brett Weinstein's example examples.

1970
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
It's, it's not true that the gun has always loaded,

1971
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
but we're just going to pretend that it is.

1972
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
And that's much better.

1973
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
At least we're good society.

1974
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
If we always act like that.

1975
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
They're truly false, but figuratively true.

1976
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:57,000
But like, you can't actually act like it's true.

1977
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Like if you ask me to put money on,

1978
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
like opening the gun and seeing if there's a bullet in that.

1979
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
You can behave in a way that functions as if it were.

1980
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Yeah.

1981
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
But then when push comes to shove

1982
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
and you really need to make a decision,

1983
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
you're not going to be able to do it

1984
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
unless you really believe it's true.

1985
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Right.

1986
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
So this only works in low stakes situations.

1987
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Exactly.

1988
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Yeah.

1989
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
So if, so, you know, it's all too easy to say, oh, you know, we,

1990
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
we'll just, we'll just sort of act as though it's true.

1991
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Good example here.

1992
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Using the, using the act as if the gun is loaded thing.

1993
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
You do not point it at anybody.

1994
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
You do not leave it around the children.

1995
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
You do not do the rest of it.

1996
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
If a robber breaks into your house,

1997
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
you don't go downstairs with said gun acting as if it's loaded.

1998
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Exactly.

1999
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Exactly right.

2000
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
And so the moment that it actually really matters,

2001
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
like in the prior case, it only matters when it goes wrong, right?

2002
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
But when it begins to matter when it goes right

2003
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:47,000
and that it goes right, this principle just doesn't work.

2004
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
And so I'm, I'm suspicious of its efficacy in other words.

2005
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I think we might need to actually start acting in accordance with what's true,

2006
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
which by the way is what people have been saying for a long time.

2007
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Oh, why don't we all just act in accordance with what's true?

2008
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,000
And then suddenly when you begin to realize that maybe free will doesn't exist,

2009
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
maybe morality is just a social adaptation.

2010
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Suddenly this idea of acting in accordance with what's true

2011
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
is a point of principle goes out the window.

2012
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:15,000
And it's amazing how I sort of see deontologists,

2013
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:20,000
virtue ethicists transform for my very eyes into utilitarians.

2014
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Out goes the principle of live in accordance with the truth,

2015
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
out go the principles of honesty

2016
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
and sort of lack of intentional self-deception.

2017
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Because, well, we want the greatest good for the greatest number.

2018
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
A better, more functional society comes about

2019
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
if we just pretend as though this is the case.

2020
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
What happened to the virtue? What happened to the principle?

2021
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,000
What happened to the deontological ethics?

2022
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
It's just out the window all of a sudden.

2023
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I think sometimes people like to have their cake and eat it too in that respect.

2024
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I like to act in accordance with what I think is true.

2025
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
And when somebody challenges me and says,

2026
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
well, you don't act as though you don't have free will,

2027
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
I just don't know what that means.

2028
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I don't know what that looks like.

2029
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
It probably looks something like this.

2030
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Alex O'Connor, ladies and gentlemen.

2031
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Alex, it's been a while since I've had you on.

2032
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
I think I'm going to be joining you on your show at some point soon.

2033
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I hope so.

2034
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
What can people expect of you over the next couple of months?

2035
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
What's coming up?

2036
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Hopefully that conversation with Ben Shapiro,

2037
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,000
which I'll mention for a 16 billionth time,

2038
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
will be out.

2039
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
I've got a few debates coming up.

2040
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Oxford Union, Durham Union,

2041
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
something at Cambridge on the monarchy.

2042
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
You're being known for that.

2043
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Piers Morgan's catapulted you to the forefront of the anti-monarchists.

2044
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I'm becoming something of a royal correspondent for that news channel.

2045
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
An anti-royal correspondent.

2046
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Hey, my Twitter bio is growing by the minute on this forecast.

2047
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Where should people go if they want to keep up to date with the stuff you do?

2048
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Just type in my name, Alex O'Connor.

2049
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I am technically still Cosmic Skeptic.

2050
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
That's my old handle.

2051
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I tend to go by my Christian name now,

2052
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,000
but the handles are still there, so you'll still find me that way too.

2053
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Alex, I appreciate you.

2054
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Thank you, mate.

2055
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Thank you very much for tuning in.

2056
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
If you enjoyed that episode,

2057
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,000
you will love my full-length, two-hour-long podcast with Douglas Murray.

2058
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Go on.

2059
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Press it.
