00:00.000 --> 00:07.840
No scientist who actually wanted to retain any credibility would claim that the correlation between rising CO2 and

00:08.160 --> 00:13.520
Rising temperature at this very tiny piece of time is proof of causation

00:13.880 --> 00:15.880
Correlation is not proof of causation

00:18.840 --> 00:22.080
Patrick Moore welcome the show nice to be with you Chris

00:22.640 --> 00:28.420
What is your background? How did you come to be involved in the environmental discussion?

00:28.900 --> 00:31.260
Well rather checkered I have to admit

00:31.260 --> 00:37.260
I grew up on a floating village on the north end of Vancouver Island with no road to that area

00:37.340 --> 00:40.620
It was a west coast inlet. So we were like

00:41.340 --> 00:43.340
Outlanders there and

00:43.820 --> 00:47.260
Everything was by boat the freight came on a boat once a week

00:47.980 --> 00:50.420
to a village of about a hundred people and

00:50.980 --> 00:54.020
in 1965 when the road came finally a

00:54.740 --> 01:00.060
75-kilometer gravel road from Port Hardy on the other side of the North Island

01:01.220 --> 01:06.660
Vancouver Island is the largest island on the west coast of the Americas from Alaska to Argentina

01:06.660 --> 01:09.340
So it's a 300 mile long Island

01:09.460 --> 01:15.100
and I was born on it and still live on it in a slightly more civilized part now

01:15.540 --> 01:20.180
but I have a home on the beach where I grew up so I'm really lucky that way and

01:21.180 --> 01:27.700
When the road came we thought wow now this place is just gonna explode half the people used the road to get out

01:28.900 --> 01:31.700
so we learned something of human nature that day and

01:32.220 --> 01:35.900
I then ended up being sent to boarding school because the one-room school

01:35.900 --> 01:38.660
I went to till grade 8 only went to grade 8

01:38.900 --> 01:46.060
So I was sent to Vancouver to st. George's school, which is modeled after the English public school and

01:46.340 --> 01:51.220
There I excelled in science and particularly life science

01:51.900 --> 01:57.700
Went to the University of British Columbia in an honors bachelor of science in biology and forestry

01:57.780 --> 02:04.100
Which is the industry I grew up in and it's what we have almost on the entire province is trees and

02:05.020 --> 02:11.340
much of which is in parks and much of which is in places where you're allowed to cut them and make lumber and paper and

02:12.020 --> 02:17.940
So I then discovered the word ecology before it had been in the popular press and

02:19.100 --> 02:27.700
realized it was an obscure branch of science going back to the late 1800s which basically dealt initially with soil forming processes and

02:28.300 --> 02:32.300
When you when you understand soil science you understand that all life

02:32.940 --> 02:38.140
emanates from soil on the land that is not it not in the ocean of course

02:38.580 --> 02:45.980
But it it then led me to realize that ecology was about the interrelationships among all the factors on earth

02:46.700 --> 02:52.740
Especially with relation to life, but life is made of rocks and air and water

02:53.260 --> 02:58.660
So it includes those two and all those factors that come into effect

02:58.660 --> 03:06.100
So it's almost like infinity the number of interrelationships there are and infinity is kind of a spiritual

03:06.180 --> 03:12.380
Concept because none of us can actually fathom it and so as an agnostic in my family

03:13.140 --> 03:20.900
My whole family was not particularly religiously oriented. I suddenly discovered religion in a

03:22.740 --> 03:25.920
Non-religious sense in a way in science I

03:26.900 --> 03:29.780
discovered the wonder of the infinity of

03:30.380 --> 03:32.380
life and the universe and

03:33.140 --> 03:38.820
Realized it was unfathomable at a certain level, but that we could know more about it

03:39.260 --> 03:46.900
By studying it and that's where I got my beginnings and then I learned about while doing my PhD

03:46.900 --> 03:52.740
I learned about this little group that was beginning to meet in the basement of the Unitarian Church in Vancouver

03:53.220 --> 03:57.820
to plan a protest voyage against US hydrogen bomb testing in

03:58.340 --> 04:02.020
Alaska taking on the world's most powerful organization at that time

04:02.460 --> 04:04.460
a bunch of hippies and

04:04.460 --> 04:07.380
But we were actually all professionals of one sort or another

04:07.380 --> 04:14.340
It just that of course we looked like hippies because it was the hippie era in the early 70s and we sailed on that boat

04:15.100 --> 04:17.100
12 of us and

04:17.740 --> 04:22.100
John Cormack and his 12 disciples as we called ourselves and

04:22.740 --> 04:28.100
We caused quite a ruckus and got on Walter Cronkite's evening news in the United States and

04:28.540 --> 04:31.900
Help change the course of nuclear weapons

04:32.980 --> 04:38.140
Development it was the cusp of the Cold War when they stopped increasing the number of nuclear weapons

04:38.140 --> 04:42.580
And we stopped those nuclear tests on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians

04:42.860 --> 04:47.180
Then went on to campaign against French atmospheric nuclear testing

04:47.420 --> 04:53.820
France was still detonating hydrogen and atomic bombs in the air in the southern hemisphere in French Polynesia and

04:54.100 --> 05:00.660
The French people didn't even know this was happening because France controlled all the media including Le Mans and we got in

05:00.660 --> 05:05.980
We got this issue in Le Mans for the first time in France and the campaign against that began

05:06.580 --> 05:08.580
domestically as well as internationally and

05:09.500 --> 05:11.500
Oh just

05:11.740 --> 05:19.380
The rest is history. We stopped the killing of 30,000 whales per year in the North Pacific when we turned from the nuclear issue

05:19.820 --> 05:22.140
having one two major victories

05:22.740 --> 05:25.900
And then three four years of campaigning

05:26.580 --> 05:34.860
Against the ocean killing of whales by big factory fleets. It took that long, but we ended that by 1981

05:35.540 --> 05:40.620
Deep Sea whaling was banned in all the oceans of the world by the International Whaling Commission

05:40.620 --> 05:42.620
which is a branch of the UN and

05:42.940 --> 05:49.820
So we lobbied at the UN and we went out on the ocean and got in front of the harpoon. So we had footage of people actually

05:50.660 --> 05:53.500
Trying to save the whale from being killed by a harpoon

05:53.620 --> 05:59.260
that's what made made it and that made us famous and then we started making a lot of money and

05:59.340 --> 06:03.140
Then we hired a lot of people and then we had a payroll to meet and then as

06:03.740 --> 06:09.980
Time went on the left sort of I guess realized that there was money and power in this new

06:10.300 --> 06:15.980
Environmental movement that we had helped create along with many other groups, but we were the only ones at one point

06:16.180 --> 06:18.180
We're talking about Greenpeace

06:18.180 --> 06:21.420
Specifically is the movement here at what point did it become Greenpeace?

06:21.820 --> 06:26.500
It became Greenpeace right at the beginning at the hydrogen test when you went up to Alaska

06:26.500 --> 06:34.060
Yes, when when one of the people in the church basement meetings said as we were breaking up the meeting someone said see you later

06:34.980 --> 06:38.940
and said peace because peace then meant sort of see you later and

06:40.060 --> 06:42.740
Someone's he said why don't we make it a Greenpeace?

06:43.340 --> 06:46.860
And so it started there. So we named our boat the Greenpeace

06:46.860 --> 06:51.700
We nicknamed our boat that we went to it was named the Phyllis Cormack after the captain's wife

06:51.980 --> 06:56.980
but we put a big sign saying Greenpeace on the front of it on the cabin and

06:58.860 --> 07:02.140
By the middle of next well early next year the same

07:02.980 --> 07:10.180
1972 we changed our name from what it had been that don't make a wave committee to the Greenpeace foundation

07:10.180 --> 07:13.420
That's much better. That's much better as it goes. Yes

07:13.580 --> 07:19.660
Foundation wasn't because we were wealthy like foundations are it was because of the Asimov trilogy

07:20.700 --> 07:26.580
About the small group of people on the opposite side. What star what Star Wars is fashioned after

07:27.060 --> 07:29.660
that that took on the Empire and

07:30.220 --> 07:35.340
We were taking on the Empire indeed and succeeded. What about your exit?

07:36.340 --> 07:40.260
My exit was unfortunate, but it was caused by the fact

07:41.300 --> 07:45.420
That as we became more well-known and powerful and political

07:46.340 --> 07:51.580
The we were basically hijacked by the left in the end who were more clever at politics than we were

07:52.140 --> 07:54.140
as that was their game and

07:55.100 --> 07:57.100
So I ended up being the only

07:57.740 --> 08:00.900
Director of Greenpeace International during the last six years from

08:01.540 --> 08:08.380
79 when we created Greenpeace International, and I was instrumental in the negotiations that brought that about

08:09.260 --> 08:12.140
And until 86 when I left I

08:13.140 --> 08:22.020
Was the only director with any formal science education and we were now dealing with toxic waste and issues of chemistry and

08:23.500 --> 08:25.620
You don't need to be a PhD

08:26.100 --> 08:32.740
Marine biologist to know to save the whales or you don't need to be a nuclear physicist to want to stop hydrogen bombs

08:32.900 --> 08:39.340
But if you're going to get into the issue of toxicology and now where they're calling plastic toxic, right?

08:39.340 --> 08:41.700
And calling carbon dioxide toxic

08:42.420 --> 08:44.420
Which is complete BS?

08:44.660 --> 08:48.660
you've got to know some chemistry and you've got to understand toxicology and

08:49.140 --> 08:52.900
Because toxicology is not just about something being poisonous

08:52.900 --> 08:58.540
It's about how much of it does it take to be poisonous which is known as the poison is in the dose

08:58.740 --> 09:04.740
Which is basically the first rule of toxicology such like do no harm is in medicine

09:05.300 --> 09:11.220
The poison is in the dose is and like for example table salt is one of the best examples

09:11.220 --> 09:19.060
It is an essential nutrient sodium chloride right with chlorine in it is an essential nutrient you die without it

09:19.060 --> 09:25.460
That's why Gandhi made salt at the sea so they didn't have to pay a tax on something that was essential for life

09:26.100 --> 09:29.180
well at a certain point it

09:29.580 --> 09:34.740
Gets to be too much and if you actually ingest four or five tablespoons of

09:35.620 --> 09:37.620
Table salt all at once

09:37.900 --> 09:45.340
You're likely to die because it becomes toxic at those higher levels and you also have you at four or five tablespoons

09:45.580 --> 09:47.820
Sitting on the counter isn't harmful to you

09:48.180 --> 09:50.860
It's only harmful if you're exposed to it

09:51.260 --> 09:54.100
So there's a lot of issues in toxicology

09:54.660 --> 10:01.580
That just got ignored in the whole thing and then suddenly I find my other five directors in Greenpeace

10:02.580 --> 10:08.780
Agreeing that we should have a campaign to ban chlorine worldwide that would be our next big campaign and

10:09.500 --> 10:15.060
It was based on the fact that chlorine was a constituent of dioxins DDT and

10:15.860 --> 10:17.860
Other chlorinated hydrocarbons

10:19.020 --> 10:22.140
Chlorinated hydrocarbons are a very common group of

10:23.460 --> 10:30.300
Molecules because carbon is the basis of life and chlorine is essential as in sodium chloride salt

10:30.580 --> 10:35.540
So there's lots of chlorinated hydrocarbons around and not all of them are toxic

10:36.060 --> 10:39.140
At at at low levels and some of them are

10:39.900 --> 10:42.620
But banning chlorine specifically

10:43.140 --> 10:45.140
Was such a stupid idea

10:45.380 --> 10:50.380
Seeing as though it is the most important element for public health adding it to drinking water

10:50.700 --> 10:54.820
Swimming pools spas as we use bromine also these days

10:54.900 --> 11:00.780
There was a time when iodine which is another one of the halogens in that group along with chlorine

11:00.780 --> 11:06.980
Was the most important thing in your in your medicine cabinet as it was when I was a child if you got a cut

11:06.980 --> 11:09.540
You put iodine on it to stop infection

11:09.540 --> 11:18.940
And so there's that reason for chlorine the other reason is that 85% of our pharmaceuticals are made with chlorine chemistry and

11:19.460 --> 11:25.540
25% of them actually have chlorine in them if you look at the ingredients in your cold or flu medicines

11:25.540 --> 11:30.820
Just for an example, you'll see a little cl after a lot of them. That's chlorine

11:31.220 --> 11:33.500
so at a purely

11:34.500 --> 11:41.020
Scientific perspective, I couldn't stay in a group that was going to launch a campaign to ban chlorine worldwide

11:41.060 --> 11:44.420
But that was just the sharp end of the stick for some years

11:45.340 --> 11:53.620
After a long evolution 15 years for me from the beginning of being involved in the beginning of the environmental movement or the modern environmental movement

11:54.620 --> 11:59.380
We actually had a fairly strong humanitarian orientation in the early years

11:59.380 --> 12:02.620
we were trying to save civilization from all out nuclear war and

12:03.140 --> 12:05.620
So that must means you care about people as

12:06.620 --> 12:09.860
Well as the environment which was the green part of Greenpeace

12:09.860 --> 12:18.020
But the peace part of Greenpeace was to end nuclear war or the threat of nuclear war and we did a pretty good job of helping with that and

12:18.780 --> 12:23.220
But by the time I had to leave the environmental movement

12:23.980 --> 12:26.980
Now controlled largely by the political left

12:27.740 --> 12:32.180
Had basically changed the tune to humans are the enemies of the earth

12:33.340 --> 12:39.940
Humans are the enemies of nature as if we are the only bad or evil species on the planet

12:39.940 --> 12:44.740
And everything else is either benign or good or whatever you want to say, but they're not evil

12:45.020 --> 12:51.060
Right just so this is original sin reinvented for environmentalism as it is in

12:51.820 --> 12:55.540
extreme Christianity and I suppose other religions

12:55.540 --> 13:00.180
I don't know much about other ones, but I do know that in Christianity

13:00.180 --> 13:05.100
There's a wing of it that considers humans to be born with evil in them

13:06.820 --> 13:12.100
Not that they don't have some good in them, but I don't believe that one iota

13:12.100 --> 13:18.620
I just think we're it's not even an irrelevant thing to discuss. Why do you think that transition happened?

13:19.100 --> 13:24.620
From it being about peace to this Alex Epstein calls it human racism

13:25.260 --> 13:32.420
Yes, it's the same reason why Americans now think America is evil even though they are Americans

13:34.100 --> 13:37.860
I it's self loathing is another way of expressing it

13:39.140 --> 13:41.140
It is a deeply

13:43.140 --> 13:49.300
Destructive mental condition to believe that you are evil even when you're good and

13:51.180 --> 13:53.820
So I what it is. So why is it?

13:54.620 --> 13:58.300
Why did it happen fear of death? I think is at the root of it

13:59.300 --> 14:01.300
That's why doomsday

14:02.460 --> 14:08.660
Predictions are made throughout history is because people believe that when they die the world will end

14:08.940 --> 14:11.500
Because they think they're so bloody important or something

14:11.500 --> 14:12.580
I don't know what it is

14:12.580 --> 14:20.060
But it is it is the fear of owns one own one's own death projected on the universe or or on the world

14:20.540 --> 14:24.300
End times apocalypse they keep saying it's going to happen

14:24.300 --> 14:31.180
They've been saying it for 10,000 years or more this little guy standing on a street corner with a sign saying the end is near

14:31.260 --> 14:33.020
Well, they used to say the end is nigh

14:33.020 --> 14:36.340
But I think that's an English term that nobody knows what it means anymore

14:36.660 --> 14:41.440
But the end is near right and that's what aOC is saying and that's what

14:42.340 --> 14:49.340
Greta is saying and that's what the ice IPCC is basically saying. That's what the World Economic Forum is saying

14:49.340 --> 14:52.980
That's what Biden is saying. They're all saying the end is near

14:53.700 --> 14:59.220
Because of climate change now now it used to be because of the devil or witches or something like that

14:59.220 --> 15:05.700
But now it's because of climate change that the end is near and I'm sure it's a projection of one's own fear of death

15:06.140 --> 15:10.820
One of the reasons I'm sure of that is that I don't think that way and I'm not afraid of my own death

15:10.820 --> 15:18.540
I have absolutely no fear of it because there's one thing that you must do in life is not to worry about things

15:18.580 --> 15:23.700
You can't do anything about because then you'd be worrying about way too many things and you'd never get anything done

15:23.700 --> 15:28.220
and so I only worry about things that I can do something about and

15:29.180 --> 15:35.340
As as far as I can see I can't do anything about the fact that I have a

15:36.420 --> 15:41.100
Short life on this earth short meaning under a hundred years or so

15:41.460 --> 15:43.460
it definitely does feel like

15:44.420 --> 15:46.420
there's a narrative at the moment of

15:47.420 --> 15:49.420
human racism of

15:50.100 --> 15:51.820
the

15:51.820 --> 15:59.420
descriptions of humanity being a scourge on the earth people are made to feel guilty about the cars that they drive or the flights that they take or

15:59.540 --> 16:02.620
You know, you have Greta Thumberg going back from conferences on a

16:03.340 --> 16:06.900
Rowing boat and it's taken a six months to get back across the Atlantic. I

16:08.140 --> 16:10.140
Don't know I

16:10.420 --> 16:12.420
Think I'm unconvinced that

16:13.140 --> 16:14.780
all of this

16:14.780 --> 16:16.780
Can be attributed to

16:16.780 --> 16:19.540
The denial of death, you know, Ernest Becker might agree

16:19.540 --> 16:23.460
But I'm not sure that all of it could be but I don't know where else it could come from

16:23.460 --> 16:28.180
It's definitely a you know fear is a very good control mechanism for people. So there are other

16:30.060 --> 16:32.140
There are other powers at play there

16:32.300 --> 16:37.220
However, I don't understand why people would take it and imbibe it themselves and then start to push it back out

16:37.460 --> 16:40.660
Because if it's something that is that makes you feel uncomfortable

16:40.660 --> 16:45.340
I even most people tend to shy away from it, but it really does feel like

16:46.100 --> 16:49.420
People have become their own torturers with this, you know

16:50.060 --> 16:51.340
It's almost

16:51.340 --> 16:57.420
Part for the course that humans are damaging the earth that we're causing harm and that we shouldn't be here

16:58.620 --> 17:01.740
You said it and I I too

17:02.140 --> 17:07.500
Don't know if I have the whole picture, but I think that's part of it now fear and guilt

17:08.460 --> 17:11.460
You see those are the two that when they're combined

17:12.220 --> 17:18.380
Are so powerful in controlling people the way I put it is you're driving your SUV down the road

17:18.460 --> 17:20.980
You're afraid that you were killing your grandchildren

17:21.940 --> 17:28.580
By putting out the toxic co2, which is actually the main food for all life on earth why they can't get that

17:28.580 --> 17:34.780
I don't know but it is it is a fact and it is not toxic

17:35.780 --> 17:42.580
Etc. But there is a fear and then that makes you feel guilty because you're killing your grandchildren

17:42.820 --> 17:48.140
right so fear and guilt that's why I call the chapter in my book climate of fear and guilt and

17:49.660 --> 17:55.380
Michael Crichton used the word fear in his book on climate change as well. I

17:56.380 --> 18:01.180
Forget the whole title, but the word fear climate of might have been climate of fear, but

18:02.620 --> 18:04.620
the the the fear

18:04.820 --> 18:08.100
That is put into people about the end times, you know

18:08.100 --> 18:16.540
And if people would just think straight they would realize that people have been predicting the end times since practically the beginning of time

18:16.540 --> 18:20.540
And they have never once been right

18:21.180 --> 18:23.180
They are batten zero on

18:23.860 --> 18:29.340
End times right so why should we believe the new end times story?

18:29.980 --> 18:34.140
Well because this one's backed up by science and it's got all of these people around the world

18:34.140 --> 18:41.660
They all agree with each other. There's research. There's studies that have been done and you have 80% of scientists say that climate change is real

18:42.500 --> 18:43.700
well

18:43.700 --> 18:47.820
This is because lying has become acceptable to a lot of people

18:48.140 --> 18:50.140
bald-faced lying

18:50.260 --> 18:55.500
It the 80% thing or the 97% thing is a lie

18:56.020 --> 18:59.700
It's been shown to be a lie in the they you know

18:59.700 --> 19:04.860
This one study that said it was 97% done by a psychologist from Australia

19:05.380 --> 19:10.100
And not a sign not really a scientist. That's a soft science at best and

19:11.060 --> 19:18.900
He came up with this 97% number when analyzed and this Christopher Moncton was involved in this reanalysis

19:19.740 --> 19:23.260
along with a couple of other really smart people on numbers and

19:23.980 --> 19:31.260
Statistics and it turns out to be 0.3% not 97% who actually in their paper

19:32.980 --> 19:34.980
Declared that humans

19:35.860 --> 19:38.860
Will cause a climate disaster basically

19:39.380 --> 19:42.660
Many of them said humans have a role in climate change

19:43.260 --> 19:45.260
But they didn't say it was going to be a disaster

19:46.260 --> 19:47.620
so

19:47.620 --> 19:52.660
That if you break down what people actually said or even inferred

19:53.460 --> 20:00.100
You will not find that many climate scientists who will outright come out and say this is a climate emergency

20:00.820 --> 20:04.520
The scientists are hiding behind the politicians who fund them

20:05.660 --> 20:13.460
That's where they get all their money. They get their money from politicians through bureaucrats in the deep state in the United States

20:13.460 --> 20:19.980
I don't know what you have as equivalent to the deep state, but having watched Boris rise to fame

20:19.980 --> 20:23.620
I can't fathom what caused that

20:24.180 --> 20:29.740
So it must have been some kind of weird political good hairdo. That's what that's what yeah, right

20:30.900 --> 20:32.900
Let's not talk about that anymore

20:33.660 --> 20:41.380
Is my attitude towards it because I just watched these things somebody came out today and said that polar bears are inbreeding

20:41.900 --> 20:47.220
Right and that's because there's not enough ice for them to find each other anymore. Is that same? Oh

20:48.100 --> 20:50.100
Yeah, right

20:51.540 --> 20:57.620
That's so weird is that true that it well first what is inbreeding, right?

20:58.420 --> 21:04.740
Is it beyond cousins or second cousins anything closer than that genetically? That's our definition of it

21:04.740 --> 21:11.620
Yes, but in plant breeding for example and animal breeding in breeding is commonly used in

21:12.100 --> 21:15.620
In order to maintain characteristics that are desirable

21:15.780 --> 21:21.700
But I've seen I've seen tigers that have got down syndrome from too tight inbreeding

21:23.700 --> 21:29.620
Yes, but inbreeding is absolutely necessary like you're not going to start breeding with snails

21:30.260 --> 21:32.260
right so

21:32.260 --> 21:34.260
How far out does it go?

21:34.340 --> 21:38.500
Well, it needs to be within your own species, but not within your own hereditary genetic pool

21:38.820 --> 21:43.940
Yeah, but it should it should always be someone of another race, right because that's the most outbreeding you can get

21:44.660 --> 21:48.100
Right, it should never be anybody in your own race because that's inbreeding

21:48.980 --> 21:53.380
You see inbreeding and outbreeding are flexible terms in that sense

21:54.180 --> 21:56.180
There's extreme inbreeding

21:56.500 --> 21:58.500
And there's extreme outbreeding

21:59.540 --> 22:00.820
right

22:00.820 --> 22:02.820
If you outbreed you water down

22:03.380 --> 22:06.100
The genetics if you inbreed you concentrate them

22:06.980 --> 22:12.340
A combination of those two things is always essential in species evolution

22:13.460 --> 22:14.660
and

22:14.660 --> 22:20.340
So therefore they're just using the word inbreeding as a political term rather than a scientific term

22:20.820 --> 22:23.380
There because inbreeding is bad period

22:23.860 --> 22:24.900
Right

22:24.900 --> 22:29.540
That's that's how they're getting away with that and the idea that they aren't finding enough of each other

22:29.860 --> 22:34.740
The the population of polar bears has grown by four or five times since the treaty

22:35.140 --> 22:37.220
Do you know about the treaty on polar bears?

22:37.620 --> 22:45.700
So you do but nobody else does because they never mention it. They never mentioned that in 1973 on the advice of wildlife biologists

22:46.180 --> 22:52.260
Because too many people were now able to go to the Arctic in planes and hire Inuit guides and get polar bear rugs

22:52.900 --> 22:58.980
There were too many people doing that it was had become too easy and rich people were able to easily do that

22:59.700 --> 23:03.380
So the polar bear population was declining due to over hunting

23:04.100 --> 23:12.020
So the all the nations with polar bears signed a treaty international treaty to and the unrestricted hunting of polar bears

23:12.180 --> 23:14.180
In other words, there had been no restrictions

23:14.580 --> 23:18.260
On killing polar bears up till then because there didn't seem to need to be any

23:18.500 --> 23:21.780
Because there was lots of polar bears and hardly anybody ever went up there and killed one

23:22.100 --> 23:25.540
Besides which they're really mean and horrible and they'll kill you if you don't watch out

23:26.100 --> 23:30.260
But with a high powered rifle the odds are turned in your favor

23:31.220 --> 23:37.860
So they signed that treaty and since then the polar bear population has grown from somewhere between six to 10 000

23:38.340 --> 23:40.500
to somewhere between 30 and 50 000

23:41.220 --> 23:42.740
those are the

23:42.740 --> 23:46.420
accepted figures by all the people involved in this except for

23:47.220 --> 23:51.940
Uh fakers, which are not scientists, right? They're political activists

23:52.980 --> 23:55.060
Give me your thoughts on extinction rebellion

23:55.620 --> 24:01.060
They're really really stupid and bad

24:02.820 --> 24:05.220
Elaborate on your thoughts about extinction rebellion

24:07.140 --> 24:13.060
Well, because you you come from right you come from greenpeace co-founder of greenpeace and extinction rebellion

24:13.700 --> 24:19.780
There there seems to be people could see some sort of lineage or progression or connection, you know, it's an environmentalist movement

24:20.340 --> 24:23.780
No, there's no lineage or progression. We didn't dress up like cult

24:24.660 --> 24:27.620
teams of a cult movement like all dressed in

24:28.100 --> 24:33.940
Really stupid looking red uniforms that are somewhere but across between the inquisition

24:34.660 --> 24:37.220
and uh a cartoon uh

24:38.580 --> 24:42.820
And spraying blood on buildings and this sort of thing actually

24:43.540 --> 24:47.220
I signed off when people started chaining themselves to other people's stuff

24:49.940 --> 24:51.940
Peace peacefulness pacifism

24:52.420 --> 24:54.420
Is non-violence, right?

24:54.820 --> 24:56.820
but

24:56.900 --> 25:02.340
It doesn't include inciting other people to violence against you. That is not pacifism

25:03.060 --> 25:05.060
in other words

25:05.060 --> 25:11.700
By you making the first blow or you chaining yourself to someone's tractor who is trying to make a living with it

25:12.660 --> 25:14.660
That is not peaceful

25:14.660 --> 25:15.860
And yet

25:15.860 --> 25:20.820
They they were basically saying that anything short of killing the other person is peaceful

25:21.060 --> 25:23.940
Almost, you know, it it's not peaceful

25:24.500 --> 25:30.100
To interfere with other people's livelihoods in a way that threatens their livelihood. That's not peaceful

25:30.100 --> 25:36.260
But they think that they think that this is a really important and just worthy cause they need to get attention and people aren't looking

25:36.260 --> 25:38.260
So they need to do more

25:38.260 --> 25:40.260
So why don't they go with the Taliban?

25:40.820 --> 25:45.940
That would be good. They then they'd have machine guns and they could kill anybody they wanted and have mass murder

25:46.900 --> 25:51.620
To destroy the human race, you know, that's more or less what they're

25:52.740 --> 25:54.740
Recommending as far as I can see

25:54.740 --> 25:58.100
Uh, so I think they are I think they are evil

25:58.740 --> 26:05.380
There are good people and bad people and people that are sort of in between like actually most people are a little bit good and a little bit bad

26:06.020 --> 26:08.020
But these people are evil

26:08.020 --> 26:14.180
That's what I think of extinction rebellion. What about Greta Thunberg the other one of the other horsemen of the

26:14.420 --> 26:16.420
environmental apocalypse

26:16.900 --> 26:22.820
Yeah, well, it's funny that people didn't notice right away that she is a young girl with pigtails

26:23.540 --> 26:26.580
Because uh, that's what Stalin and Mao

26:27.220 --> 26:29.700
And hitler all used young girls

26:30.340 --> 26:31.860
with pigtails

26:31.860 --> 26:34.500
In their photographs that's all been well documented

26:35.060 --> 26:38.820
um, I don't know what the pigtails has to do with it, but uh

26:39.540 --> 26:41.300
dictators all

26:41.300 --> 26:44.500
Often it seems almost always use children

26:45.620 --> 26:48.500
As as a front to make it look as though

26:49.380 --> 26:50.660
They're nice

26:50.660 --> 26:55.540
I suppose. I'm not sure what they're Danish though. Is there someone someone in Denmark sending her over

26:55.700 --> 26:59.460
Is there some totalitarian leader in Denmark trying to get Greta Thunberg to?

27:00.660 --> 27:05.220
No, the movement is totalitarian right and the movement the movement controls her

27:05.940 --> 27:11.220
Uh, green she she's she's there's all kinds of photographs of her on trains with the head of Greenpeace

27:11.940 --> 27:15.220
Etc. I mean and and of course Al Gore and

27:15.940 --> 27:17.940
The list is endless

27:18.180 --> 27:21.140
And her speeches are written for her obviously

27:22.020 --> 27:26.100
And she doesn't know anything much about climate change or science

27:27.220 --> 27:29.620
So what what is she then she's simply a tool?

27:29.620 --> 27:34.740
Right. She is just a tool nothing more. She is not a wise person

27:36.340 --> 27:38.340
Telling us what we should be doing

27:38.660 --> 27:45.780
She is being used by Hollywood actors and phony politicians like Al Gore

27:46.660 --> 27:50.100
Uh, none of none of whom actually have any science

27:50.740 --> 27:53.940
What scientist is behind Greta Thunberg?

27:55.140 --> 27:57.140
Thunberg I should say

27:57.700 --> 28:02.020
It sounds like you've got a problem with the delivery mechanism, especially for

28:02.180 --> 28:07.220
Extinction Rebellion and I can absolutely agree with you there. I don't think that going and

28:07.940 --> 28:13.540
Hammering and chiseling the front door of banks or trying to erect structures in the middle of London Bridge

28:13.540 --> 28:18.740
I don't think that that's a a fantastic way to get people on side simply from a human psychology perspective

28:18.740 --> 28:24.100
If you want to compel people to be a part of your cause you need to convince them not terrorize them

28:24.180 --> 28:26.180
Terrorize them that being said

28:26.580 --> 28:31.380
Yeah, yeah, but I mean gluing your breasts to the street for example. Has that happened?

28:32.100 --> 28:34.100
Yes gluing gluing

28:34.660 --> 28:37.220
Your breasts what like so lying face down

28:37.700 --> 28:42.820
And and gluing your breasts to the concrete so that you can't be moved so that you're blocking the traffic or whatever

28:42.980 --> 28:44.020
Okay, right

28:44.020 --> 28:49.460
So that that's the kind of thing they do and I agree that it's very sensational and everything

28:49.860 --> 28:54.180
But it has absolutely nothing to do with the issue whatsoever whatever the issue is

28:54.180 --> 28:58.900
I don't even know what their issue is. Is it that humans are should be exterminated?

28:59.300 --> 29:01.620
It seems to be that would be basically their issue

29:02.260 --> 29:03.060
and

29:03.060 --> 29:08.260
So I recommended that a man glue his penis to the top of a of a

29:09.060 --> 29:11.060
subway car

29:11.300 --> 29:14.920
And somebody did a cartoon of it on twitter as a result of my suggestion

29:20.100 --> 29:22.740
Right, so as you can disagree one of the five

29:23.540 --> 29:25.780
Unacceptable words either no no

29:26.740 --> 29:31.700
You can disagree with their methods, but there is an awful lot of

29:33.940 --> 29:40.420
Well-known people who appear to have credentials saying that we are in a climate emergency, which we are aren't we?

29:41.940 --> 29:43.940
No, we are not

29:44.180 --> 29:46.180
in a climate emergency

29:46.820 --> 29:50.420
I don't know people say to me well all you have to do is look outside

29:51.780 --> 29:53.780
To see that it's a climate emergency

29:53.780 --> 29:59.460
I I'm looking outside and I see a beautiful green mountain with a glacier on top of it where I live

29:59.940 --> 30:04.420
And a whole mountain range right next to me and the whole of vancouver island is as healthy as can be

30:04.820 --> 30:09.620
And yet they say it's been stripped mind of all its trees. No, it has not

30:10.180 --> 30:12.660
What do you think they mean when they say climate emergency?

30:13.060 --> 30:15.060
I

30:15.620 --> 30:21.140
Think they mean the end times are coming. It's just another way of saying we're all doomed

30:22.580 --> 30:24.580
Right because if there was an emergency

30:24.820 --> 30:27.380
It means that if you don't do anything about it, you're doomed

30:27.700 --> 30:33.540
We got upgraded right it was climate crisis and then within the last couple of years it is now climate emergency

30:34.180 --> 30:38.820
Precisely, and I can't imagine what more extreme word they could now invent

30:39.380 --> 30:41.380
after they've come from

30:41.380 --> 30:42.580
you know

30:42.580 --> 30:49.780
Crisis to emergency change crisis emergency. Yeah, there isn't you are right. There isn't much left, but there's there's so many

30:50.660 --> 30:52.260
differing

30:52.260 --> 30:55.620
Critiques around what the impact is that humans have had on the planet

30:55.620 --> 31:00.820
So the world getting too hot for instance increases in the temperature. That's something that's happening. Is it not?

31:02.500 --> 31:08.420
The world has been warming ever so slightly since about 1700 when the little ice age

31:08.900 --> 31:11.540
Stopped getting colder and started getting warmer

31:12.180 --> 31:18.660
There have been these thousand year cycles for the last 6,000 years of the interglacial period known as the Holocene

31:19.060 --> 31:22.500
Which we are in now, which is about 12,000 years long

31:23.140 --> 31:27.940
Since we emerged from the last major glaciation which peaked 22,000 years ago

31:28.260 --> 31:35.300
Which was one of 45 major glaciations that have occurred during the place to see an ice age over the last 2.6

31:35.780 --> 31:41.380
million years, which is the first ice age in 250 million years since

31:41.860 --> 31:43.860
The previous ice age

31:44.180 --> 31:47.220
Ended after a hundred million years

31:47.940 --> 31:51.780
From 350 million years ago to 250 million years

31:52.660 --> 31:56.420
There was another ice age the previous one to this one

31:56.900 --> 32:00.420
Since the last 250 million years until recently

32:00.980 --> 32:03.620
Which was 2.5 million years ago

32:04.500 --> 32:07.540
It was warmer than it is now at all times

32:08.900 --> 32:13.060
It is now colder than it has been even in this interglacial period

32:14.260 --> 32:16.260
During this place to see an ice age

32:16.660 --> 32:19.140
Which has gone up and down and up and down and up and down

32:19.700 --> 32:27.220
In cycles of 41,000 years for the first 1.6 million years and in cycles of 100,000 years for the last

32:27.860 --> 32:32.020
1 million years in concert with the two molankovitch cycles

32:32.660 --> 32:37.300
Related to the tilt of the earth changing and the orbit of the earth changing shape

32:38.340 --> 32:43.300
This is caused by the gravitational attraction of jupiter on our earth

32:44.500 --> 32:49.220
And so these people want us to think that the world began in 1850

32:49.860 --> 32:51.860
When we started using fossil fuels

32:52.580 --> 32:58.980
But for 150 years before that it was also warming and during one of those warming spurts because

32:59.380 --> 33:02.100
When the earth warms it just doesn't warm continuously

33:02.340 --> 33:06.900
It goes up and then down and then up and then down and then up and then down but net warming

33:07.540 --> 33:12.260
Net cooling looks like this down and then up down and then up down and then up

33:12.740 --> 33:15.140
There's cycles within cycles within cycles

33:15.620 --> 33:17.860
We understand very few of these cycles

33:18.580 --> 33:22.500
We certainly don't know what causes the onset of an ice age

33:22.980 --> 33:27.780
Such as the one we are in now and we have no idea when it will end

33:28.180 --> 33:31.780
Because actually at the bottom level it is still getting colder

33:32.580 --> 33:34.580
And until we came along

33:35.700 --> 33:37.700
Only 150 years ago

33:38.260 --> 33:42.340
We started restoring a balance to the global carbon cycle

33:42.740 --> 33:48.740
By putting some of the carbon back into the atmosphere that had been taken out by life

33:50.020 --> 33:55.940
And drawn down co2 to the lowest level it has ever been in the history of the planet

33:56.020 --> 33:58.020
Which is 4.6 billion years

33:58.660 --> 34:00.500
So when was the lowest?

34:00.500 --> 34:03.300
22 million years 22,000 years ago

34:04.020 --> 34:07.060
co2 sank to 180 parts per million

34:08.100 --> 34:11.140
Due to the cooling of the glaciation

34:11.700 --> 34:15.700
Causing the oceans to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

34:18.500 --> 34:21.940
Liquids hold more gas when they're cold and when they're warm

34:22.740 --> 34:24.980
Air holds more humidity

34:25.940 --> 34:27.940
In other words gas

34:28.580 --> 34:31.780
When gaseous forms of what can be liquids

34:32.260 --> 34:37.460
Holds more of it when they're warm like warm air holds more water than cold air does

34:37.460 --> 34:42.100
That's why fogs form when the air cools because it condenses. So it's the exact opposite

34:43.060 --> 34:44.180
water

34:44.180 --> 34:48.260
And in particular holds more gas when it's cold

34:48.820 --> 34:50.820
So when the earth cools

34:51.140 --> 34:55.460
The oceans absorb co2 from the atmosphere and the the total co2

34:55.540 --> 34:59.860
There's nearly 50 times as much co2 in the oceans as there is in the atmosphere today

35:00.260 --> 35:02.260
That wasn't always the case

35:02.260 --> 35:06.420
Because the atmosphere had a lot more co2 in it in the past

35:06.900 --> 35:09.220
Going back 200 million years

35:09.940 --> 35:11.940
It had about 2,000 ppm

35:12.820 --> 35:15.620
Today it's 400 because of our

35:16.900 --> 35:20.500
Increasing it from when we came along it was 280

35:20.820 --> 35:24.820
So you do agree that we as humans have had an impact on the climate

35:26.420 --> 35:30.180
No, just producing co2 doesn't mean you're having an impact on the climate

35:30.500 --> 35:33.860
The primary impact of increased co2 is more plant growth

35:34.500 --> 35:38.900
And that's called the greening of the earth and nasa has verified this with

35:39.620 --> 35:45.060
Maps on the internet and so has csiro in australia, which is the one they're the one that broke it

35:45.700 --> 35:50.180
in in 2014 or I think it was

35:51.140 --> 35:54.820
When they showed a map showing up to 30 increased photosynthesis

35:55.300 --> 36:00.340
Due to increased co2 in the atmosphere. So that is the main known fact

36:00.900 --> 36:04.020
From what has happened as a result of more co2 in the atmosphere

36:04.340 --> 36:10.980
There is zero evidence that the co2 increase in the atmosphere is the cause of rising temperature

36:11.700 --> 36:19.940
None whatsoever because it was already rising as I was about to say during the first 150 years of rising out of 1700

36:21.220 --> 36:24.500
There was a period of over 40 years

36:25.140 --> 36:31.460
Where the temperature increased more and faster than it has done since 1850

36:32.980 --> 36:40.500
Especially since 1950 when we were actually starting to put a significant amount more co2 in the atmosphere post war

36:41.700 --> 36:43.220
And today

36:43.220 --> 36:47.700
It's exponential. There's a wonderful graph. It's in my book which shows

36:48.660 --> 36:50.900
The temperature record in central england

36:52.340 --> 36:58.900
From 16 60 or so when the first first thermometer existed. So this is this is the longest

36:59.620 --> 37:05.140
thermometer record of temperature in the world because they were invented in england

37:06.100 --> 37:13.620
And so that shows a very steady continuous rise in temperature of a little over one degree celsius

37:14.340 --> 37:16.840
in 320 years

37:17.700 --> 37:19.700
It's not a big deal

37:20.260 --> 37:26.500
Certainly compared to previous like they they keep saying it's never gone this fast. It's never risen this fast

37:26.820 --> 37:32.020
That is a lie. It has risen this fast many times in the even recent past

37:32.420 --> 37:37.060
Especially from about 1690 to about 1730

37:38.180 --> 37:42.420
It rose faster and longer than it ever has done since

37:43.220 --> 37:50.260
It's all in the record. Now, they'll say, oh, that's just a local measurement. Well, all measurements are local measurements

37:50.820 --> 37:54.980
But not if you aggregate them across multiple, right? No, that's called the climate

37:55.300 --> 38:01.380
If you aggregate them across global except global is really badly skewed by there being by far the most

38:02.100 --> 38:08.420
Measuring centers in north america and europe and hardly any in many other places, especially africa. So

38:09.380 --> 38:14.820
It even that is skewed badly in terms of localism, but never mind that

38:16.740 --> 38:23.620
The fact of the matter is is climate is a 30 year average of each weather

38:24.500 --> 38:26.100
Event, right?

38:26.100 --> 38:32.500
Whether it's hurricanes or tornadoes tornadoes are almost non-existent in the united states this year compared to previous years

38:32.580 --> 38:35.140
For some reason the conditions just didn't happen

38:35.940 --> 38:38.820
Because united states has 90 of the world's tornadoes

38:39.540 --> 38:44.500
There's a reason for that. It's geographic. It's because from the arctic to the gulf of mexico

38:44.980 --> 38:48.020
There are no mountains in the way because that was an inland sea

38:49.380 --> 38:52.660
The prairies in other words of the united states

38:53.380 --> 38:57.220
Were end of canada that was that was the sea bottom at one point

38:57.220 --> 39:02.420
And so it's a straight shot for arctic air to come all the way down to the gulf of mexico and for hot

39:02.820 --> 39:06.500
Gulf of mexico air to come all the way up and they combine and boom

39:06.900 --> 39:14.500
And that's how hurricanes are formed too is the convergence of cold and warm air masses and that's why when the earth warms

39:15.940 --> 39:17.620
The tropics

39:17.620 --> 39:21.940
hardly changes when the earth warms the warming is is

39:23.620 --> 39:29.940
What's the not inadvertently is greater anyways the warming is always greater towards the poles when the earth warms

39:30.260 --> 39:35.380
It wasn't that long ago when all the arctic islands of canada were covered in forest

39:35.460 --> 39:39.620
And there was giant camels roaming there five million years ago. That's not very long ago

39:40.180 --> 39:44.900
That that's five million years is like an eternity to these people. They don't even know what it means

39:45.460 --> 39:47.460
right, so if we have

39:47.700 --> 39:52.420
Most of the effects of global warming or of any warming that occurs at the poles

39:52.500 --> 39:58.100
Presumably that is going to increase the melting of those ice caps. Is there a concern whether it is

39:58.820 --> 40:02.820
man-made or otherwise cyclical in nature or simply a trend over time

40:04.100 --> 40:07.940
Should we be concerned about increased warming rising sea levels?

40:08.420 --> 40:14.100
We have a lot of coastal cities. We have people who live there who may not be able to move very easily

40:14.900 --> 40:16.900
Is that a danger

40:16.980 --> 40:21.220
People who can't move very easily. Do you have some of those are the in wheelchairs or what?

40:23.220 --> 40:26.500
You have people who may I say I say two things about this

40:27.220 --> 40:28.500
number one

40:28.500 --> 40:30.500
You won't have to run

40:30.820 --> 40:36.660
Right, this is happening very very slowly and always will happen very very slowly. It doesn't happen quickly

40:37.300 --> 40:39.300
number two hire the dutch

40:40.340 --> 40:43.220
Right 25 of holland is below sea level

40:44.180 --> 40:46.180
And they're growing most of their food there

40:47.380 --> 40:52.180
On this land that is below sea level. It is not difficult to build dykes

40:52.820 --> 40:54.820
around pieces of land

40:55.220 --> 40:57.220
Especially if the land is steep

40:58.740 --> 41:00.740
Sorry, especially if the land is flat

41:01.060 --> 41:05.060
You can save a lot of land by building a foot of dyke or two

41:05.780 --> 41:07.780
If the land is steep

41:07.780 --> 41:10.260
You have to decide whether it's worth it or not

41:10.900 --> 41:15.780
To build a wall because you're only going to lose a small amount of land if it's coming steep out of the water

41:16.180 --> 41:21.380
So those are the basic situations the sea level has always been rising and falling

41:21.940 --> 41:25.940
We should not weep because we happen to be victims to this

41:26.660 --> 41:29.220
eternal factor in the earth's

41:30.180 --> 41:31.380
climate

41:31.380 --> 41:32.900
and sea level

41:32.900 --> 41:39.140
Right the earth sea level has been 40 meters higher than it is today in the past and it's been

41:39.780 --> 41:41.780
100 meters lower

41:42.740 --> 41:44.740
So it goes up and down

41:44.900 --> 41:50.980
But if you look at the islands at the equator in indonesia, which are made of limestone from ancient coral reefs

41:52.180 --> 41:55.380
They're all undercut sometimes up to 12 feet

41:56.340 --> 42:00.500
Undercut they've got this angle undercut. They look like mushrooms, right?

42:00.660 --> 42:03.700
You may have seen them in photographs. Vietnam has them too

42:03.940 --> 42:10.740
They're all through that part of the world where the islands are made of limestone, which is more erodible than granite by waves

42:11.940 --> 42:13.940
now

42:14.100 --> 42:18.260
If if the sea was constantly rising for the last 10 000 years or whatever

42:18.980 --> 42:25.700
Because it stopped rising pretty much around 7 000 years ago when the glaciers melted coming out of the last glaciation

42:26.420 --> 42:29.780
The most recent glaciation. It's not necessarily the final one

42:30.340 --> 42:35.220
As people think the last glaciation means the final glaciation. It just means the more recent

42:35.700 --> 42:39.780
Yes, the most recent one of 45 that have occurred in the Pleistocene

42:40.180 --> 42:43.860
So we have no guarantee that anything is going to change

42:44.340 --> 42:50.660
Another one should be here in 80 000 years according to the last million years of cycles all which is

42:51.380 --> 42:54.740
Thoroughly documented by ice cores from Antarctica

42:55.860 --> 43:00.180
So this sea level rise and up and down has been happening forever

43:00.660 --> 43:04.420
And people in the last 10 000 years have adjusted to it

43:05.540 --> 43:09.940
It's not going to like they're they're they're making it seem as though it will be a flood

43:10.580 --> 43:12.580
Like an inundation, right?

43:13.220 --> 43:15.220
That's the climate emergency

43:15.540 --> 43:19.060
Scenario that all of a sudden our houses will be under water

43:19.700 --> 43:21.700
It's not going to work that way

43:21.780 --> 43:27.540
And that's why Obama is perfectly happy to buy a 14 million dollar house right on the ocean

43:28.260 --> 43:30.260
in Cape Cod

43:30.260 --> 43:32.260
Because he also knows this

43:32.820 --> 43:34.820
That he's safe there

43:34.980 --> 43:36.980
there's some inland

43:37.300 --> 43:39.300
harbors in the uk

43:39.380 --> 43:41.140
isn't there and there's some

43:41.140 --> 43:43.140
Ruins of of roman

43:43.700 --> 43:48.100
Shipping places that are actually miles inland from when the sea level was higher

43:49.060 --> 43:54.180
Precisely and that was 2 000 years ago when the romans built docks on all across the south of britain

43:55.380 --> 43:57.380
And uh lewis

43:57.380 --> 43:59.380
You know where lewis is no

44:00.020 --> 44:02.340
Well, it's one of those castle towns

44:03.700 --> 44:05.700
On a river that flows south

44:05.700 --> 44:07.540
It's way inland

44:07.540 --> 44:09.300
It was on the sea

44:09.380 --> 44:11.380
Also, there's a place in france

44:12.580 --> 44:14.580
Called something sir lemare

44:14.740 --> 44:16.340
it's like

44:16.340 --> 44:19.620
Many many kilometers from the sea today. It used to be a harbor

44:20.420 --> 44:22.420
so it appears as though

44:23.380 --> 44:25.380
The sea level is lower today

44:25.780 --> 44:27.780
And that would be worldwide

44:27.940 --> 44:29.940
than it was 2 000 years ago

44:31.300 --> 44:32.420
and

44:32.420 --> 44:37.460
That is because the world was warmer 2000 years ago during the roman warm period

44:37.780 --> 44:39.780
That's why they have a name for it

44:39.940 --> 44:45.060
Because it was the roman warm period and in the roman warm period 2000 years ago

44:45.620 --> 44:47.620
It was warmer than it is today

44:47.780 --> 44:51.540
In addition during the medieval warm period 1000 years ago

44:52.180 --> 44:57.300
Interestingly a thousand years a thousand years a thousand years. This has been the trend

44:57.460 --> 45:01.940
There was also a thing called the minoan warm period before the roman warm period

45:03.540 --> 45:07.300
The earth has been cooling for 6 000 years net cooling

45:07.620 --> 45:10.900
We are in a slight upward tick now. It's just an upward tick in

45:11.620 --> 45:14.980
A downward movement. Do you think that we've got further to go down?

45:16.420 --> 45:18.420
Yes, 80 000 years further

45:19.380 --> 45:22.980
The malankovitch cycle so 100 000 years so you think that

45:23.620 --> 45:24.580
realistically

45:24.580 --> 45:26.580
We are seeing this upward tick

45:26.740 --> 45:30.900
What has happened is it has coincided with an increase of releasing carbon dioxide

45:30.980 --> 45:36.500
Which has led some scientists to associate the increasing temperature with the increase in carbon dioxide

45:37.220 --> 45:43.060
Which justifies blaming it on humans, but that if you were to roll it forward by another

45:43.940 --> 45:45.940
500 years

45:45.940 --> 45:50.420
You are going to see the crest of that thousand year cycle actually

45:51.060 --> 45:52.900
diminish

45:52.900 --> 45:56.260
And we're going to start to cool again and then cool again to a lower level

45:57.220 --> 45:59.540
Than we would have seen previously at the previous low

46:00.420 --> 46:01.860
You got it

46:01.860 --> 46:06.180
If things continue on the same pattern they have for the last 6000 years

46:06.580 --> 46:11.220
Which is typical of an interglacial period through the Antarctic ice cores

46:12.020 --> 46:18.660
We have a really good picture of the last 800 000 years and now they're starting to go back more than a million years

46:19.140 --> 46:22.740
Into the times when there was a 41 000 year cycle

46:23.460 --> 46:27.780
Right now we only have really good information for the 100 000 year cycles

46:28.420 --> 46:33.540
Especially going back through four of them. They all have names. The previous one was the emion

46:34.260 --> 46:38.020
I'm forgetting the other two right now, but they have names on a chart

46:38.980 --> 46:41.620
And they were a hundred thousand years apart

46:42.900 --> 46:44.900
In quite perfect synchronization

46:45.300 --> 46:47.940
We know the co2 levels and the temperature

46:48.660 --> 46:52.420
At the Antarctic during those cycles because we can measure

46:52.900 --> 46:58.260
proxy measurements of isotopes and actually the co2 is measured directly from bubbles in the ice

46:58.980 --> 47:00.260
down

47:00.260 --> 47:02.260
400 000 years in ice

47:02.980 --> 47:05.300
And so we've got that and we know

47:06.100 --> 47:08.100
that the interglacial periods

47:08.980 --> 47:10.660
come out in

47:10.660 --> 47:12.660
10 000 years

47:12.660 --> 47:18.740
Whereas and then there's a 10 000 year these these are not all equal exactly right, but approximately

47:19.300 --> 47:21.300
10 000 year interglacial period

47:21.940 --> 47:27.540
Where the temperature remains higher for a period of time and then a gradual 80 000 year

47:27.860 --> 47:30.580
Decline into the next major glaciation

47:31.140 --> 47:37.700
So it appears as though and the and the interglacial periods are virtually always warmer at the very beginning

47:38.260 --> 47:40.340
Of them in other words as you come out

47:41.060 --> 47:42.500
Of the previous

47:42.500 --> 47:44.420
glaciation

47:44.420 --> 47:46.100
It goes up

47:46.100 --> 47:49.700
To what we call the Holocene climatic optimum

47:50.500 --> 47:52.500
Meaning it was warmer then

47:52.660 --> 47:54.660
For the first 6 000 years

47:55.300 --> 48:01.780
Of the Holocene interglacial period and since then it has been cooling. This is well documented the graphs are in my book

48:01.780 --> 48:04.260
They're from Iceland and Antarctic ice cores

48:05.940 --> 48:11.300
And they're also from marine sediments marine sediments can take you back half a billion years

48:11.700 --> 48:15.460
Because stuff has been falling on the bottom of the sea from all the life in the ocean

48:16.180 --> 48:19.540
And the stuff and the sediments flowing into the ocean

48:20.020 --> 48:26.660
In addition so the life that dies falls to the bottom and is embedded in the sediments that come from the land

48:27.380 --> 48:33.300
And that record is in layers and we can date all of that with radioactive techniques

48:33.860 --> 48:34.820
So

48:34.820 --> 48:36.420
We've got that

48:36.420 --> 48:39.220
What do people mean when they say that we've got 50 harvests left?

48:41.780 --> 48:45.300
Is that like 50 years of crops apparently yeah, I think so

48:45.300 --> 48:48.900
I don't know why they wouldn't just say 50 years of crops as opposed to 50 harvests because

48:49.540 --> 48:53.540
That's just confused me but yeah, let's call it 50 years of crops left. What do they mean? Is that

48:54.020 --> 48:58.100
Something to do with soil microbiome stuff or biome stuff and virum stuff

48:58.740 --> 49:02.340
No, it's it's simply a cult doomsday prediction

49:03.060 --> 49:04.660
Is what it is

49:04.660 --> 49:07.300
They have absolutely no reason to say that

49:08.020 --> 49:10.020
Topsoil degradation none of this

49:10.820 --> 49:15.940
Oh, yeah topsoil degradation. It's happening everywhere. No, we're our farming methods are

49:16.420 --> 49:20.820
So improved now that soil conservation is so improved now

49:21.540 --> 49:28.100
That we're not losing soil like they say we are and yes soil gets washed into the sea by rivers, right?

49:28.820 --> 49:33.540
New soil is created. It's not as if soil creation has ended

49:34.260 --> 49:38.020
And people think that trees use dirt to make themselves

49:38.980 --> 49:43.060
And therefore if you take the trees away over and over and over again by harvesting them

49:43.300 --> 49:48.420
The soil will eventually go away, right? No, the soil is made by the bloody trees

49:49.300 --> 49:53.620
That's how soil gets there if there was no trees that would be rocks there no soil

49:53.940 --> 49:55.940
Soil doesn't just happen by itself

49:56.340 --> 50:00.660
It happens because of the leaves falling and the branches falling on the ground and decaying

50:01.300 --> 50:03.300
And some of it turns into soil

50:03.380 --> 50:08.100
soil forming processes was the beginning of ecology in the steps in the ukraine

50:08.500 --> 50:15.220
Studying the grasslands of the ukraine, which are very productive deep churnizem soils have been created by grass

50:16.420 --> 50:20.100
Doesn't it's not just trees that make dirt. It's all plants

50:20.740 --> 50:22.740
make dirt and

50:22.740 --> 50:29.540
When you look at a tree and you see this huge say at a big mature tree you see this huge solid thing

50:31.060 --> 50:34.900
It's hard to believe that it's 99% made from air and water

50:35.860 --> 50:43.700
Right the carbon and the hydrogen and the oxygen in that tree, which is over 99% of that tree's biomass

50:44.500 --> 50:48.260
Came from carbon dioxide and H2O water

50:49.220 --> 50:54.980
That's what made it trees are basically carbohydrates. So are we except for our bones

50:56.660 --> 50:58.660
And so

50:59.220 --> 51:02.660
The knowledge of of life is so poor

51:03.300 --> 51:09.700
Science has progressed so far and yet the average person's knowledge of science has degraded

51:10.260 --> 51:12.260
Because they're being told all these lies

51:12.980 --> 51:17.700
That carbon dioxide is poison when in fact it is the primary food for all life

51:18.100 --> 51:20.660
And there isn't enough of it right now

51:21.460 --> 51:25.460
And there certainly wasn't enough of it when we first started putting some back

51:25.780 --> 51:32.180
It's important to note that all the carbon that we are releasing was made by life

51:33.220 --> 51:39.140
In the form of fossil fuels and much more importantly in the form of carbonaceous rocks

51:40.260 --> 51:45.700
Now have you heard of carbonaceous rocks? I have not of course you have it's called limestone

51:47.140 --> 51:49.620
Yes, and limestone is what we make cement with

51:50.820 --> 51:52.820
And limestone is calcium carbonate

51:53.860 --> 51:55.860
It is a carbonaceous rock

51:56.340 --> 51:59.300
The carbon in limestone came from co2 in the ocean

52:00.260 --> 52:02.580
And the co2 in the ocean came from the air

52:04.420 --> 52:06.020
So as

52:06.020 --> 52:11.140
The shelled creatures evolved what we call the marine calcifying species

52:12.820 --> 52:15.300
All life in the sea was microscopic

52:16.100 --> 52:18.100
Invisible and unicellular

52:18.260 --> 52:22.340
Until about 600 570 600 million years ago

52:23.380 --> 52:25.620
Then the Cambrian explosion occurred

52:26.420 --> 52:30.420
Which was the advent of multicellular life in the sea

52:31.460 --> 52:33.460
And large creatures this big

52:34.580 --> 52:36.580
Came into being if you read

52:37.380 --> 52:39.380
Stephen

52:40.020 --> 52:41.540
ghouls

52:41.540 --> 52:44.660
Book a wonderful life. You will see the history

52:45.780 --> 52:48.820
Of early life as discovered through the Burgess Shale

52:48.820 --> 52:55.300
Which is a fossil deposit in the rocky mountains at Yoho national park in canada the chinese have a parallel one

52:55.940 --> 52:58.580
Where soft bodied organisms were preserved

52:59.860 --> 53:02.260
That because most fossils are bones or shells

53:03.060 --> 53:04.820
Because they were hard parts

53:04.820 --> 53:08.020
And they could be preserved more easily soft parts would normally decay

53:08.580 --> 53:13.620
But because of mudslides which immediately ended oxygen exposure

53:16.340 --> 53:19.300
Ancient creatures that were only soft like jellyfish

53:20.100 --> 53:21.860
Were preserved as fossils

53:21.860 --> 53:25.940
So there's a record of these species evolution in the early times of the Cambrian

53:27.140 --> 53:31.780
At a certain point many different species somehow from a common thread

53:32.500 --> 53:36.820
Developed the ability to combine calcium and carbon dioxide

53:37.620 --> 53:39.620
calcium like sodium and

53:39.700 --> 53:41.700
potassium is in the salts in the sea

53:43.220 --> 53:44.340
And

53:44.340 --> 53:47.700
Combined calcium with carbon dioxide to make calcium carbonate

53:48.340 --> 53:49.940
to form shells

53:50.020 --> 53:57.540
Armor plating around their soft bodies like oysters and mussels and crabs and barnacles and shrimp

53:58.020 --> 54:04.020
And tiny coccolithophores, which are a plant phytoplankton and a little bit larger for eminifera, which are about

54:04.260 --> 54:07.540
They're an animal they're about the size of a very tiny grain of sand

54:08.500 --> 54:11.380
And they are all marine calcifying species

54:11.940 --> 54:13.780
coral reefs are actually

54:13.780 --> 54:20.260
The predominant one which is about 50 of all the calcification going on in the world and was much more before

54:20.580 --> 54:26.500
When coral reefs were much more widely spread when the earth was warmer. They've been reduced to basically

54:28.340 --> 54:30.980
Small places where the ocean is still warm enough

54:31.540 --> 54:35.780
For the high biodiversity of corals the particularly indonesian coral triangle

54:36.420 --> 54:37.620
and so

54:37.620 --> 54:39.140
today

54:39.140 --> 54:44.740
We have a situation where these coral species and other calcifying species are still

54:45.380 --> 54:49.540
Using the carbon dioxide out of the ocean and it's raining down on the bottom

54:50.100 --> 54:55.700
As dead shells right as shells from dead creatures and that has built up and formed all of the

54:56.500 --> 55:01.460
All of the limestone in the world over the years and that's where most of the carbon dioxide has gone

55:02.100 --> 55:06.020
90 approximately only about 10 of it has gone into fossil fuels

55:06.340 --> 55:10.980
Now the fossil fuels are also the result of forest being buried and turned into coal

55:11.700 --> 55:16.900
Of species sinking to the bottom the the soft parts of species turning into oil and gas

55:17.460 --> 55:22.180
In and now we find them on the land in places like texas, which was once a sea bottom

55:23.140 --> 55:25.140
and and the fracking

55:25.540 --> 55:28.500
Deposits all were at one time a sea bottom

55:29.220 --> 55:33.540
Whereas the coal deposits were a terrestrial environment where forests

55:33.860 --> 55:39.060
But all of the fossil fuels were made with photosynthesis. They were all created by solar energy

55:39.380 --> 55:44.180
They were all created by carbon dioxide being drawn out of the atmosphere and locked away

55:44.660 --> 55:50.420
For hundreds of millions of years where the plants on the land and in the sea could no longer use it because it was gone

55:50.820 --> 55:54.180
Into these locked up sediments. They call it sequestration

55:55.300 --> 55:58.500
Or sequestered carbon it is out of the cycle

55:59.380 --> 56:02.020
That's why co2 came down to such a low level

56:02.500 --> 56:07.300
At the last glaciation when the oceans cooled and pulled it out of the atmosphere to 180

56:07.540 --> 56:10.180
Which is 30 parts per million above the death of plants

56:10.740 --> 56:13.860
Plants don't just need co2. Just like us

56:14.420 --> 56:18.100
They need a certain level of co2 just like we need a certain level of oxygen

56:18.500 --> 56:22.100
If you have an an atmosphere with 5% oxygen you die

56:23.060 --> 56:25.060
Actually, you die at 10% oxygen

56:25.380 --> 56:29.940
I think it's even higher than that whereas oxygen is around 20% in the atmosphere

56:30.580 --> 56:32.580
But you go up to the top amount Everest

56:33.220 --> 56:37.620
And you've got to be a sherpa who's been doing it for their whole life before you can breathe up there

56:38.180 --> 56:39.940
And successfully live

56:39.940 --> 56:43.460
So that these are true true isms about life

56:44.020 --> 56:49.700
That they need a certain level of their essential nutrients and carbon dioxide being the key

56:49.860 --> 56:51.860
Essential nutrient for all plants

56:53.780 --> 56:57.540
They need it at one one third one fifty and they start to die

56:58.020 --> 57:04.020
And it is believed that during some of the last major glaciations because of ash layers that are associated

57:04.500 --> 57:10.340
With the peak of those glaciations that high altitude plants did all die and burn

57:11.060 --> 57:13.060
Because they were dried out

57:13.300 --> 57:18.260
And that would be because when you run when you the higher you go the thinner the air gets

57:18.980 --> 57:22.900
So even though co2 is still at the same parts per million

57:23.300 --> 57:26.020
Compared to the other gases. It's more dispersed

57:26.660 --> 57:30.260
And therefore more difficult for plants to obtain that

57:32.500 --> 57:36.740
Everything i'm saying is thoroughly documented on the internet

57:37.460 --> 57:41.300
The and the most important point is that no scientist

57:42.100 --> 57:44.980
Who actually wanted to retain any credibility?

57:45.380 --> 57:53.140
Would claim that the correlation between rising co2 and rising temperature at this very tiny piece of time

57:54.020 --> 57:56.020
Is proof of causation

57:57.220 --> 58:00.660
Right correlation is not proof of causation

58:01.380 --> 58:04.260
Correlation just means two things are going in the same direction

58:04.660 --> 58:10.180
And very often the reason they are is because of a third common factor and let me give you an example

58:10.420 --> 58:16.260
The relationship between ice cream consumption and shark attacks

58:18.740 --> 58:20.740
They are perfectly correlated

58:21.140 --> 58:26.740
When ice cream consumption goes up shark attacks go up ice cream consumption goes down

58:27.300 --> 58:30.340
Shark attacks go down. It's a perfect annual cycle

58:32.020 --> 58:38.820
Do ice cream consumptions cause shark attacks? No. Do shark attacks cause ice cream consumption? No

58:38.820 --> 58:45.540
This is a correlation which is not an example of causation because temperature

58:46.420 --> 58:50.740
A third factor is the cause of both of them going in the same cycle

58:51.780 --> 58:54.420
When the temperature gets warm people go to the beach

58:54.820 --> 58:58.820
Eat an ice cream and go swimming and some of them get attacked by a shark

58:59.540 --> 59:01.540
In the winter neither happens

59:01.620 --> 59:08.500
So this is correlation is far more common than causation and there's a a website called

59:09.460 --> 59:14.020
Something correlations spurious correlations. Yeah, that one. It's very very good

59:14.500 --> 59:16.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like Nicholas Cage

59:16.660 --> 59:20.420
Correlated with the number of people that die by being caught up in their bedding every year

59:20.740 --> 59:24.900
There's a statistically significant. All right, so what's the third? What do you think is the third?

59:25.860 --> 59:30.500
Factor in that case. Is there something that there doesn't have to be one? Yep

59:31.620 --> 59:33.860
There doesn't have to it's just that they're both right

59:33.940 --> 59:39.060
There could be a a separate factor causing temperature to change and a separate factor

59:40.580 --> 59:44.260
Causing co2 to change and the fact that they're both going up at this time

59:44.500 --> 59:46.500
But they're not going up in sync

59:46.820 --> 59:52.500
If you look at there's one graph in in my book that shows that in this interglacial period

59:53.140 --> 59:58.900
We came before humans started emitting we came to a point where co2 was at 280

59:59.380 --> 01:00:03.700
And temperature was at a certain point. I don't know what exact Celsius it was

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:10.580
And then suddenly co2 just shoots up off the chart if you put it in a hundred thousand years graph

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.460
this little bit of time right now

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:21.460
150 years and really only the last 60 or 70 where it's been substantial 60 years of

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:24.580
Radical increase in co2. I won't

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:30.420
You know say that's wrong. It is a radical increase. We don't need to do it this quickly

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.580
And that is why in my book

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:37.780
I make it very clear that reducing fossil fuel consumption would be an excellent strategy

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.100
If you had something reliable cost effective to replace it with

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:44.980
Right and that is nuclear energy

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:50.180
With nuclear energy we could easily take out half the fossil fuels being used today

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:55.780
Not because of climate change, but because they're precious and should be conserved because they're

01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:02.580
Non-renewable they don't they're not being made as quickly as we're using them by orders of magnitude

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:08.740
Right, so we should be conserving fossil fuels for the essential things like flying airplanes

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:12.020
It's not easy to fly an airplane with anything else

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:20.020
Besides a liquid fuel and liquid fuels are hard to come by as our gaseous ones like methane natural gas

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.260
so

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:24.020
electricity

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.860
Is mostly being made by fossil fuels today not just in china

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:33.780
It's only in france that more than 50 of the electricity is being made by nuclear energy

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:40.180
And they they diss france for this and they hold up germany as a shining example of green

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:45.700
When in fact germany is emitting nearly two times the co2 per capita of france

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:50.020
And their only reason france is emitting less co2 is because of nuclear energy

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:52.820
Why is the world so averse to nuclear energy?

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.060
Because they're idiots

01:01:55.060 --> 01:02:00.180
And they're they're brainwashed and whatever else, right? I have nothing but

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.300
Contempt for people who just

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:09.300
Reject nuclear energy when almost no one has ever been killed by it except chernobyl

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:13.060
Which was a stupid reactor design that the russians made

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:18.580
From their plutonium production reactors to make nuclear weapons. They just cookie-cuttered the same

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.140
cheap reactor all across

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:25.940
The former soviet union all of which have been shut down in any of the former satellites

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.140
They still have 10 running eight or 10 running in

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:33.540
In russia, but they have modified them so that can't happen again

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:40.100
They should have done that in the first place because they had a negative void coefficient or a positive void coefficient

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:42.980
I never get them right, but one is good and the other is bad

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:44.820
and

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:49.140
Their reactor was a design that could theoretically

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:51.780
Go critical in other words

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.940
Become a nuclear bomb

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.700
And that a slow one

01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:57.700
That was a slow nuclear bomb that explosion

01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:59.780
They happened faster in real nuclear bombs

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:07.860
And do more damage than that one did but it blew a 2000 ton lid off itself a concrete lid and then burned because they had a huge

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:11.780
Carbon moderator in there. That was 2000 tons or something

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:15.620
To I mean there's big numbers involved in Chernobyl

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:19.540
And that burnt for 10 days while firefighters tried to put it out spewing

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:22.500
More and more radiation into the atmosphere the whole time

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:27.060
Whereas Three Mile Island wasn't even worth talking about

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:33.140
It was a bad accident to cord a core meltdown, but it didn't cause any damage to anything or any one

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:40.660
And no one died in Fukushima from radiation and no one will because no one received a sufficient dose to cause any harm

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:45.940
And this is confirmed by the radioactive effects research foundation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki

01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:51.380
Formed after the second world war by macArthur and the japanese to study the life history

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:57.940
Of people who were exposed to the radiation and survived aren't there some tuna or some fish in the sea

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:04.260
Who are showing higher levels of radiation and ten eyes to yes ten eyes imagine that

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.060
No, there are not

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:09.060
there's higher levels means

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:13.140
Infantesimal higher levels if that's what they mean

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:20.020
They did have a ban on fishing in the region because a lot of liquid was going into the water that was contaminated as they say

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:24.980
Had radioactive substances in it. There are radioactive substances in you and me

01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:28.820
Potassium 40 in particular if you eat a banana

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:35.060
Which is radioactive we have radiation stuff wasn't from a banana was it that was from something much more dangerous

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:43.380
Well, what do you mean what was more they nuclear reactors are not inherently dangerous they are if you eat them

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:49.620
Yeah, but we we we don't eat them and nobody ate anything from Fukushima because they stopped

01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:52.180
Taking crops from the land nearby

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:59.620
I mean they took the Fukushima was one of the stupidest accidents that ever occurred in the world and the japanese are so insular

01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:04.900
In their culture that they did not take the the lessons that were learned

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.300
From other accidents that occurred

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:13.700
They just didn't and the the difference in culture can be explained this way in the united states or britain

01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:16.260
When a reactor has a problem

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:20.900
The operator phones the prime minister and tells him what the problem is and what he's doing to try to fix it

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:25.620
In japan the operator phones the president asks the president what he should do

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.820
Right because he's the president

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:34.100
And he doesn't know what the heck to do so those three explosions that happened one day after another i think

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:40.260
Approximately at Fukushima could all have easily been prevented even after the meltdowns occurred

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:46.340
Because they were hydrogen explosions people think those were explosions in the reactor

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:54.020
They weren't they were explosions of hydrogen gas that was not released as it should have been to prevent it from becoming concentrated at eight percent

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.340
hydrogen almost spontaneously

01:05:56.580 --> 01:06:00.180
Ignites with any spark and causes a huge explosion

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.420
So and then they evacuated

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:11.380
All the people even though they were not subject to sufficient radiation to require evacuation and over 2000 people died from the evacuation

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:20.580
Because they evacuated five intensive care wards into gymnasiums in other communities where they did not have the facilities to keep them alive

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:24.340
So that that's the kind of overreaction

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:29.060
That happened to in Fukushima, which was a bad accident

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:36.740
It was a huge industrial accident that it did not cause death what caused death of almost 20 000 people was the tsunami

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.700
And I saw on cnn

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:44.580
A headline written across the screen during the Fukushima disaster

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.900
Which said nuclear crisis deepens

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.700
As bodies wash ashore

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.940
That's what it said

01:06:55.540 --> 01:07:00.420
And that was to me the beginning of fake news all the way when they started showing

01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:04.500
smog and calling it carbon dioxide basically

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.980
And showing backlit

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:09.220
chimneys of factories with black

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:16.180
smoke coming out of them supposedly but no it was water vapor and that's what water vapor looks like when you backlight it

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.900
so the

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:22.500
And you know and the same with the inbreeding polar bears

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:27.060
I mean they are just making up one story after another now and floating it in the media

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:30.340
And it all comes back to the fact that the politicians

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:36.580
Are funding the scientists to give them what they want, which is something that they can instill fear

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:42.580
And guilt into the population about in order to have power

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:48.660
And then the media and the activists are the bullhorn right the megaphone

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:53.700
That puts that into just a giant global story and nothing else matters

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:57.940
The truth doesn't matter one bit anymore in this discussion

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:02.580
What about the people that say we're seeing the beginning of the next big extinction event?

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:07.460
It's so stupid

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:10.420
We're not seeing the beginning of the next big extinction event

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:15.220
Okay, if a big extinction event was happening and it was being documented

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:20.820
I could get it but read the chapter in my book on extinction where I appeared before

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.700
a committee of the u.s. House of Congress

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:28.340
With three people there claiming to be united nation scientists

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.460
Saying that yes

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:40.180
We only know of 1.7 plus million species which have been identified named photographed written up, etc

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:44.100
But there are very likely 8.7 million species

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.220
That's what they said

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:52.580
There's probably 8.7 million species and this is our best estimate

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.020
Where did they get that estimate?

01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:00.980
In air there's no way you can turn 1.1.7 into 8.7

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:05.300
Without having any actual observation of any real thing

01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:08.900
So they were saying there's about 7 million

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:17.300
Unreal species that we don't know about and then they say and a million of those will go extinct in the next few decades

01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:21.540
Right, how many of the how many of the observed creatures?

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.180
Have they seen go extinct?

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:32.340
An ever decreasing number as humans in around 1920 when the passenger pigeon became extinct

01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:34.820
suddenly

01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:38.660
The general population took an interest in the issue of extinction

01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:42.420
Prior to that which wasn't very long ago 100 years

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:47.700
Nobody cared about extinction. They thought it was a normal thing except a few naturalists who

01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:54.500
Bemoaned the extinction of the dodo bird or other species that went extinct as a result of human activity

01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:58.900
And most people don't realize that the the main cause

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:03.140
Of species extinction is not hunting

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.500
Right it it is actually agriculture

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:12.100
And the changing of habitats so that is why most

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:20.100
Species recovery programs are based on habitat and making sure that there's a place for these species to exist

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:22.340
That's key

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:28.420
but we have not like overrun 90 percent of the world's habitat and much of the

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:32.180
Area that we are using especially for forestry

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:36.900
Is perfectly suitable for most of the species that always lived in the forests

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:38.900
agriculture is different

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:43.780
Agriculture creates a monoculture on purpose and that's pretty hard to get away from

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:49.060
People who preach that you should have 17 different species of plants growing on the same plot of land

01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:53.060
I'd like to see them do it successfully. It's not possible

01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:58.100
So they the farmer wants to get rid of every insect every animal

01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:04.020
You know everything other than every other plant all other all other plants are weeds

01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:06.340
in this case

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:09.380
And so agriculture is is where you have to really

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:16.820
Look at what you're doing in the landscape and make sure that in that landscape and it usually happens naturally if you fly across the

01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:22.100
Whole agricultural area of the united states. You see lots of forest

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:27.540
Burst among the agricultural land because and and in europe too

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:29.940
I mean most people don't realize that

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:35.300
200 years ago 250 years ago less than 10 percent of europe remained forested

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:38.900
Because the trees were being used for everything to do with fuel

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:44.500
They were being used to heat all the buildings to to smelt all the iron and copper to do the glass works

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:49.620
And steam engines everything was fueled by wood and all the building of everything

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:55.780
So forests started to disappear in central europe initially and then spreading out over the whole of europe

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.060
The first time in the history of humans where forests

01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:03.460
Were disappearing if we were cutting them faster than they were growing back

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:09.780
That's why agriculture was invented 10 000 years ago and forestry wasn't invented until about 1750

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:14.180
In central europe because they realized they had to start planting some trees

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:17.620
And then silviculture otherwise known as

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:24.500
As as forestry scientific forestry came into being and now there's 43 forest cover in europe

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:28.100
Well speaking of trees. I thought I thought the amazon rainforest was wrecked

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.540
10 percent of it has been modified

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:35.460
That's quite a lot that could be quite a bit. It's a fair big forest, isn't it?

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.900
It's a huge forest and it's not in any way endangered

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:45.700
The the problem with the you know my book is titled fake invisible catastrophes and threats of doom for a reason

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:47.700
I put the word invisible in there

01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:53.380
Because to most people the amazon is invisible they show you a picture of a fire that takes up the whole screen

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:55.700
Right, it might be about 10 feet

01:12:56.020 --> 01:13:01.700
Of the you know of the amazon which is almost as big as the continental united states brazil itself

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:06.500
Is almost as big as the continental united states and amazon is a huge part of brazil

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:09.620
And there are parts of the amazon

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.260
That have been developed

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:14.260
But most of it is intact

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:21.140
And even where it's been developed it is only small areas if you just look at a satellite photograph of it

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:24.180
You can see it. I've flown over it in an airplane at

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:29.460
Fairly low elevation and you go for five hours and you hardly see any people

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:32.900
It's called a human desert by people but even

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:38.260
You know the the leader of brazil now is under attack over the amazon

01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:41.140
from the left

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:48.340
And one of the reasons you can get away with that is almost no one in brazil has ever been to the amazon even though it's in their own country

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.780
People don't go there. What would you do there?

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:58.580
It's got manouse, which is basically a manufacturing hub for electronics. So it's a sort of a

01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:01.380
Tax-free zone of some kind

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:07.220
You've got bay lamb at the mouth of the river, which is i've been to that city. It's not very interesting

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:11.700
It's just a city at the mouth of the amazon and there's not much else to do there

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:14.260
You can go on a boat up and down the river

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:20.420
Then you see all you see is trees the whole way and the amazon

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:25.620
Is 300 miles wide during the flood period. It will never have a bridge over it

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:28.420
It doesn't have a road anymore

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:35.540
Because the road the plants grew up through the pavement and destroyed the road within 10 years when they did build one to manouse

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:40.660
And i'm going to guess that if we continue to increase the concentration of carbon dioxide that's just going to happen quicker

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:49.860
Yes, the amazon is is growing faster, but interestingly it's the drier places that benefit most from increased co2

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:51.700
because

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:56.180
Increase co2 has two effects one more co2 for growth

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:58.180
like

01:14:58.180 --> 01:14:59.620
I'll give you the second one in a minute

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:05.380
But first i digress to say that i used to laugh at people who said their plants grew better when they talked to them

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:10.500
As if plants have ears and can hear you and are empathetic or whatever

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.140
And i saw i sort of chuckled at that

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:20.580
Then i realized that when you're talking to your plants you're breathing 40 000 parts per million co2 on them

01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:22.340
That's our breath

01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:25.300
Is 100 times the level it is in the air

01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:32.100
So you're basically breathing super concentrated fertilizer onto your plants when you're talking to them

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:39.460
And they do grow better because of that because they would like to have more co2 than exists in the natural world today

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:46.900
The second thing that increased co2 does is it makes most plants more efficient with water

01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:54.100
Because now it's easier for them to get the carbon dioxide they need because it's more concentrated in the atmosphere

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:59.380
And therefore they don't need to make as many holes in the bottom of their leaves. They're called stomata

01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:07.300
It's where they take in the air with the co2 in it, but it's also where they lose water through transpiration

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:11.540
So the fewer of those holes there are the less water they lose

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:18.900
Therefore the more efficient they become with water and gives them ability to survive in places that have less water than they could before

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:26.180
That's why trees are marching out onto grasslands in many parts of the world the southwest of the us for example and australia

01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:28.820
the very eastern part

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:30.660
of

01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:34.180
Sorry the very western part of australia western australia as it's known

01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:38.260
Is the driest part of australia the nalabar desert is there too

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:40.740
Which doesn't have much of anything growing on it because it's so dry

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:44.420
But in the in the west like around perth and down to albany

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:48.900
The the trees are growing much faster now and so are the crops because

01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:52.260
You know if if you're a farmer

01:16:53.060 --> 01:17:01.140
Today and you are giving your plants all the water and all the fertilizer they need the mineral food

01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:07.860
The limiting factor to the plant's growth is carbon dioxide because of how low it is in the atmosphere even today

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:12.740
And the the proof is in the pudding here because all commercial greenhouse growers

01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:15.140
in the world

01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:19.300
Inject carbon dioxide into their greenhouses because they haven't enclosed space

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:25.620
Where they can increase the level of co2 and they generally go up to between 800 and 1200 ppm

01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:30.900
Which even above that the plants grow faster, but there's a curve because economics is involved

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:35.300
They have to buy the co2 so at this level at right somewhere in the curve

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:42.580
They say okay 1200 is optimum for us because above that buying more co2 has an ever decreasing increase in yield

01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:46.180
And so 1200 works really well in greenhouses

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:51.700
That's four times sorry three times what it is today in the global atmosphere and that is

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:54.260
We should not even be concerned

01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:57.940
Until co2 gets up to 20 000 ppm

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:02.580
Because that's what submariners survive in for three months under water

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:11.700
and the the the people who uh had the trouble on apollo 13 where the co2 was building up it went up to at least 20 000 in there

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:14.580
See we our breath is 40 000

01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:18.820
We have 40 000 ppm co2 in our lungs

01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.260
Just before we breathe out. I don't want to be breathing that in though

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.140
Yes, you do

01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:29.140
But the same air that I breathe that well in that case you can no no just once just once

01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:33.540
Yeah, yeah, but you don't want to be a closed system of breathing that back in when you put your mask on

01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:37.940
You are breathing a significant portion of the air. You just breathed out back in again

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:39.940
so

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:46.980
We we can survive at a whole different bunch of levels of co2 just fine and plants are happy with it at

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:51.540
10000 ppm or they wouldn't be here because that's what it was back

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:57.540
500 million years ago one of the things that I decided to fact check you on or internet check you on

01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:00.900
was photos of the great pacific garbage patch

01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:04.660
And photos of birds with plastic inside of their stomachs

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:11.380
Now I'd seen these floating around on the internet and when I was reading your book and listening to you

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:15.780
I found that you'd said try and find me a photo of a big patch of garbage

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.260
That doesn't have mountains in the background

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:22.900
Because in the middle of the pacific there aren't any mountains that are nearby

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:25.460
So if someone was to take a photo of it something that's supposed to be

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:31.780
Didn't someone say it was nearly the size of texas or something like that size of texas and growing faster than anyone ever predicted

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:34.740
Yes, and I thought well if this thing's so big

01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:36.740
That seems ridiculous

01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:42.180
I'd seen photos of big clumps of plastic floating together bottles and and and stuff

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:43.460
In the middle of the ocean

01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:49.540
So I did a search and I kept on looking in the background and people have re cropped numbers of different photos

01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:52.180
And twisted them so that they look like they're at different angles

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:54.740
I thought oh, that's

01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:59.220
That's kind of interesting because I thought I was pretty sure that that was there and then the other thing that you mentioned was

01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:06.580
Birds that birds don't have teeth so the way that they digest their food is actually by putting little stones or nuts into their stomach

01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:09.940
And they kill it and then they use that to grind up the food

01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:13.380
And then they eject the little bits of plastic back out

01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:16.820
So I thought well I'll have a bit of a read about that and I'll have a look and I'd seen a photo

01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:21.460
It's sort of a carcass of an albatross and it's laid on the floor and it's really just sort of

01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:24.100
bones and some feathers

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:28.900
And it's got like a thimble like a full reel of string inside of it and other stuff

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:32.020
And you'd mentioned that a lot of these might be staged and I thought yeah

01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:37.700
Not a lot of them not a lot of them chris all of them. Okay. I looked and I thought with a skeptical. I was like

01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:45.380
Yeah, I mean that that one does look a bit ridiculous and then a few of the other ones do and I read an article from

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:47.940
I want to say it was a bbc

01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:50.740
one of david attenborough's documentaries about life or something

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:56.900
And it's one of the write-ups that's a partner to one of the episodes and the episode you see one of the birds eating plastic

01:20:56.900 --> 01:21:01.540
And I was like, right, okay. Well, maybe they're doing this thing. Maybe they know you don't not in his episodes

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:06.020
You don't see a bird eating plastic. Oh, it might have been it's definitely a documentary on the bbc

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:10.340
And he's holding up a plastic bag next to a chick in a nest

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.660
Okay, and saying and saying

01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:19.060
Adult birds are feeding plastic to their chicks. There's no pick. I've I've searched the internet thoroughly

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:24.660
He's actually removed one sequence that sequence where he's holding up the plastic bag

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:27.700
It no longer is available on the internet. I don't know why that's interesting

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:33.300
Yeah, it why did you say it the first time if about a year ago if sir before I wrote my book

01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:35.540
I I think he's on to me

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.620
uh, and

01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:43.060
He's he's an absolute liar in many many cases and I've made three of them in the book

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:48.420
One of them is that albatross adults are feeding plastic to their young

01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:55.140
Mistaking it for food greenpeace says the same thing the smithsonian institute in the united states is saying the same thing

01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:57.620
They are pushing this lie

01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:00.340
That albatross can't tell plastic from food

01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:05.540
Sir david attenborough never mentions the word gizzard anywhere

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:08.980
He wrote the bloody secret life of birds book

01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:13.220
He did a ten part series on bbc on birds

01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:19.780
Right and he doesn't know that birds all have gizzards that need to have solid objects in them to grind their food

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:27.620
Because they have no teeth and therefore have two stomachs all birds every bird in the world. That's why all land birds

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:33.940
Take pebbles into their stomach and when their chicks are in the nest and can't go and get pebbles for themselves

01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:35.940
They put pebbles in their chick

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.980
So if you have a more convenient pebble that is made of plastic

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:41.460
And it's able to do the same job then

01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:47.220
No, the land birds do not feed bits of plastic to their chicks as far as I know because there's plenty of pebbles

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:51.620
But out in the ocean where birds are actual marine animals that

01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:57.060
Nest on rocky islands barren rocky islands where all there is is a bit of grass

01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:05.380
Right, there's no pebbles there either. Yeah, so traditionally their favorite. Well, naturally they feed their chicks squid

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.220
little squid

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.300
In those squid is a beak

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:13.940
That beak is retained in the gizzard as part of the digestive aids

01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:19.300
Right, it's like a ball mill in mining where they put steel balls into a mill to grind the ore

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:23.540
It's exactly the same concept in many ways, but in the in the gizzard

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:31.940
It's a muscular motion where they go like this with their gizzard and grind the food with these solid objects in there to help with it

01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:34.900
And so the other thing they'll take is pumice

01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:41.860
Which is volcanic lava from undersea volcanoes and because it's spongy it floats

01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:45.940
It's got air in it or gases in it. So it floats so little bits of

01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:51.060
Pumice will come to the surface sometimes in huge layers when a undersea volcano goes off

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.140
But they're not it's not always there

01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:58.820
So they have to resort them to hard bits of wood and nuts that have dropped off a plant

01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:02.740
In a river or by the seashore and come out in the ocean

01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:06.180
So it they have to work really hard

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:12.180
To find enough digestive aids that are suitable in size and and hardness

01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:17.460
It's not easy for them. And when plastic started showing up in the ocean 60 years ago

01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:25.460
They started choosing pieces of the right size not plastic bags not cigarette lighters

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:28.660
Not spools of yarn. That's all staged

01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:34.020
They don't feed them those kind of things and they're actually they're not feeding the plastic bits

01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:39.220
They're giving it to them to ingest so they can put it in their gizzard. That's where it goes

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:42.180
They know how to decide which goes in which stomach

01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:48.740
So the story that I read had this lady explaining about the situation and that the parents she'd used the word feed

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:52.740
She'd parents would come back and given the chicks these plastic pebbles

01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:55.060
And I can't remember the word that they used

01:24:55.540 --> 01:25:00.820
To describe what happens as they're just about to fly the nest some bird word

01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:03.380
They the bolus

01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:08.580
Maybe they cough up most of the hard objects in there. Yeah

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:14.020
The reason they have so much in their gizzard is because they will digest their food even faster

01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:16.900
Then and the parents won't have to feed them for the rest of their lives

01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:20.020
Right, so they want them out of the nest as soon as possible

01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:25.780
So they put a lot of plastic which weighs a lot plastic and but plastic is never

01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:33.380
A majority of what's in a young bird's gizzard never like it's shown in those staged photos is like all plastic

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:37.140
What this lady said was just as they were about to leave. I saw them

01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:42.740
Eject the the the plastic back up and throw it back up just as they were about to leave the nest

01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:46.020
And you think it's not just the plastic not just the plastic

01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:49.220
But all the other items they have in there to do the same job

01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:52.260
And it's all plastic is always a minority of it

01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:58.260
And she's got all these plastic bags and big plastic plastic cloths and things that's all staged

01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:01.140
Yeah, well, that's not going in there. It's not going to fit in a small bird. Is it?

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:04.340
No, well, they're not they're actually quite big because albatrosses are big

01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:06.900
But it's not gonna it's not gonna work

01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:14.020
They only if you see the photo in my book the only photo I know of of a adult albatross

01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:19.700
Giving plastic to its chick you can see it in its beak going into the chicks mouth

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:23.540
And it's all nice little pieces of colored plastic

01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:29.940
That are just the right shape and size. It's not plastic bags. It's not

01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:33.460
Cigarette lighters like they show in the staged pictures

01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:38.420
But when you read that when you read that article what you see is if you didn't know that

01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:42.100
The birds needed the plastic to break up food in the stomach

01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:45.940
If you didn't know that that was something that aids them with that digestion

01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:50.340
And that it is common for them to throw up the plastic plus presumably all of the other stuff

01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:52.420
That's been in there helping them to break up their food

01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:55.540
You would read that article and it is it is accurate

01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:59.780
What she says is correct, but the things that have been purposefully omitted

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:05.780
And the understanding about why some of the inclusions have been put in there and why biologically that might still be natural

01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:10.660
That creates a situation and that was the moment I was reading it and I thought

01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:14.660
This really is

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:18.420
This really is quite sinister. It does feel like it's quite a

01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:22.020
Manipulative way

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:28.740
To tell people what has happened but frame it in such a manner that makes us again hate our own existence

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.620
You could say evil

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:33.620
as a synonym of sinister

01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:37.620
And I believe it is because sir david attenborough

01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:42.580
Also lied about the walruses committing suicide due to a lack of ice

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:48.100
That's the final chapter in my book. They committed suicide. Was this a harry carry thing?

01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:52.500
Yes, they jumped off a cliff to their death in order

01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:57.540
To avoid an attack by 20 polar bears. Oh

01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:01.380
He didn't mention that part and that is well documented

01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:04.820
There are photographs of the bears the people who live in a nearby town

01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:09.860
Know that the reason the walruses left off a cliff was because they were being

01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:13.860
About to be attacked and eaten by polar bears. What was the proposed reason?

01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:18.500
Not enough ice as if you can put those two things together

01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:24.340
It's sort of like polar bears are inbreeding because there isn't enough ice as if those two things are connected somehow

01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:31.220
Right and he made it seem as though it was connected that there was because he said the reason the polar bears have come on the land

01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:34.180
and got to a place

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:37.060
Where they could jump off

01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:41.300
They did because there was no ice for them in the sea below

01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:45.700
Which is always the case on the north shore of russia the ice recedes in the summer

01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:50.180
And funny enough he says that the he says the ice is their home

01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:52.980
No, the sea is their home

01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:58.260
That's where the walrus lives and fishes. They don't fish actually

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.460
They dig clams on the bottom

01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:04.660
And when the ice recedes away from the coast

01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:09.140
And they are coming out of the water to haul out they come on the land

01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:14.900
There's a reason why it is an officially designated walrus sanctuary this piece of land

01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:22.180
And he implies that it's unnatural that they are coming on the land because there's not enough ice for them to get onto

01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:26.420
When in fact they cannot exist they are a coastal species

01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:28.740
They cannot exist deep sea

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:33.380
So if the ice recedes to where it's 600 feet deep or 1000 feet deep

01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:35.380
It's no good to them

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:38.980
Because they are bottom feeders and as I say in my book

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:46.660
They are bottom feeders much like sir david attenborough and his tv crew on the planet earth or whatever our planet

01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:50.260
right they they too are bottom feeders in this case

01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:56.740
And they are lying because the reason the walruses left to their death

01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:59.460
Fell to their death

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:01.940
They didn't walruses can't actually leap

01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:07.540
But they plummeted to their death because a pack of polar bears was going to eat them

01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:14.100
And instead the polar bears just walked down to where all the dead walruses were and ate them while they're dead

01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:19.140
And i'm sure the walruses would rather be eaten while they were dead than while they were alive

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:25.300
So that's the deal there and he is bald face lying to the whole world about this and he continues to do it

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:27.300
He had people in davos in tears

01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:33.140
Recently telling this story even though he now knows that I have busted him and so has

01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:35.540
Susan crockford the polar bear expert

01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:41.300
Who's also an expert in all arctic animals has busted him publicly

01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:45.140
And he sticks to this story because bbc lets him

01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:46.980
right

01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:51.300
Patrick more ladies and gentlemen fake invisible catastrophes and threats of doom

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:57.460
Will be available on amazon in the links of the show notes below if people want to keep up to date with all of the other

01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:59.460
Stuff that you're doing where should they go?

01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:03.540
You will perish in flames. That's what I have to say about that

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:12.180
There's a little man on the front. Who's the little man? Who's the guy who was he supposed to be made up guy made up guru

01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:19.220
Right, but you will perish in flames is I stole it from the ghostbusters. I don't know if you remember the scene where

01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:23.460
The the short guy maranus

01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:30.020
Approaches the horse and buggy in central park and first goes up to the horse and says

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:36.820
Are you the key master or something like that right to the horse and then runs off with his eyes blazing

01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:40.660
Screaming at the driver. You will perish in flames

01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:45.620
So, uh, that's a little guy. How many people have got how many people have got donald trump

01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:51.140
Quoted on the back of their book talking about no, no, no, he's not quoted. He's quoting me

01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:58.180
Yeah, yeah, but it's he that's him on the back of your book talking about your work. There's not many people that must have had that

01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:04.260
Uh, I was very pleased that he recognized that I was telling the truth

01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:09.540
About carbon dioxide being the primary element for all life

01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:15.780
Etc and that there was no climate emergency or crisis as it may have been called at that time pretty impressive

01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:21.780
That was an appearance on tucker carlson. Uh, yeah, what have you got a website? Do you have a twitter or anything like that?

01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:24.420
Yeah, I got a twitter. It's ecosense now

01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:32.100
Uh, and it's it's I got nearly a hundred thousand followers. They dropped back about ten thousand when a lot of people quit twitter

01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:39.460
Uh, and but I've stayed on and I just recently I said I'm quitting twitter finally because the taliban is on it

01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:42.740
and they're kicking all these other people off who who aren't the taliban

01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:49.540
and uh, people I had about a thousand people come back and say stay man stay so

01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:57.220
Because we need you here. And so it's very difficult these days to know when you should like with the the uh,

01:32:57.860 --> 01:32:59.300
vaccine

01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:00.260
issue

01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:03.780
Uh, I I know that in law and in medicine

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:12.100
Informed consent has always been the rule that nobody is required to consent to any medical treatment surgery

01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:14.500
needles

01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:16.020
Uh pills

01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:18.020
Right without their own consent

01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:21.940
Everybody has a right as an individual to refuse treatment in other words

01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:26.180
And they're trying to turn that on its head by threatening people with their livelihoods

01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:32.180
And with their ability to be a normal person they might as well stamp a a brand on their forehead, right?

01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:34.100
and

01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:37.380
and make them second-class citizens is what they're doing and so

01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:41.460
People are saying to me. Well, why did you get vaccinated then and

01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:44.980
It's a trip. Well, because I want to be

01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:50.420
But I respect the right of other people not to want to be and actually on gutfeld

01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:53.620
uh, he had trump on the last two nights

01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:59.380
And trump made that same point because his wife doesn't want to be vaccinated

01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:02.020
and uh

01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:05.780
Gutfeld and trump came to the conclusion that that was perfectly her right

01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:09.300
That is the truth if we don't if we allow

01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:16.820
Society to force us into medical treatments. Maybe next they'll want our skin to make lampshades, you know

01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:22.980
So you this is a fundamental principle in medicine is informed consent and in law

01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:27.460
And they're trying to bust it down so that they can have control over everybody

01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:30.420
To say what they should have to have injected into their bodies

01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:37.540
And personally, I believe the vaccines are efficacious. I also had covid was in the hospital for six days

01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:39.620
Really sick

01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:45.780
After I had my first vaccination it had not yet taken effect or I was one of those people who gets it anyways

01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:47.460
but it's

01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:48.580
normally

01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:51.380
After two vaccinations at least you're 95 percent

01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:53.780
Immune and now I'm

01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:56.500
Must be close to 100 percent immune because I survived covid

01:34:56.740 --> 01:35:01.460
But they don't take that into account. So the the fact that they're not taking covid survivors as

01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:09.940
Equivalent to vaccinated people is also another travesty in this whole thing. So I it's like climate. It's like the climate issue in some ways

01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:12.660
um, but it's even more

01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:15.060
bizarre from a

01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:21.380
Political control point of view because they're really pulling the levers here, you know and trying to make it so that

01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:23.940
all all of their subjects are

01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:27.380
Are subject to their whims

01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:30.180
And we got to fight that

01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:34.180
And so people are blaming me for not fighting it because I've got it vaccinated

01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:39.060
So it's really complicated that way from an intellectual point of view as to I should should I join

01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:45.620
Even though I've been vaccinated should I join the anti-vaxxers in a march? You know, no, I'm not anti-vaxxer

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:47.620
right

01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:49.620
And neither is trump. He's vaccinated

01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:53.140
Well, he brought us the product apparently

01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:56.980
Maybe a conversation for another time patrick. Thanks so much for today
