0	2880	We're on the brink of war with China for various reasons.
2880	4800	I hope we make it to 2050.
4800	7120	The demographics is as I describe it.
7120	10320	And by the way, them losing doesn't make us winning.
10320	12800	So I think you're in the part of the cycle
12800	14880	where you've had the tightening
14880	17760	and the dominoes are beginning to fall.
17760	20640	And I think that that's going to produce more problems.
20640	22800	The most important thing is to have
22800	26320	this basic, well-diversified portfolio as important.
26320	32000	Two years ago, you made some predictions
32000	35280	about the future for America and the global economy.
35840	37040	How accurate do you think you've been?
38320	41280	Uncomfortably accurate, given the whole picture.
43040	46400	It's like watching the movie over and over again.
47360	48560	Maybe I should explain.
51600	55200	For about 55 years, I've been a global macro investor
55200	59040	and I learned that many of the things that surprised me
59040	61520	never happened in my lifetime before.
61520	66640	So when I would see certain things happen that were like that,
66640	71280	I would go back in history and study prior periods.
71280	74320	And studying, for example, the Great Depression
74320	77840	allowed us to anticipate the financial crisis in 2008.
77840	82880	Anyway, there are three big things that I observed happening
82880	86560	that didn't happen in our lifetimes,
86560	90320	but happened during the 1930 to 45 period.
90320	94560	And they are the creation of enormous amounts of debt
95120	98800	and the printing of money to pay for those debts
98800	103680	and it having its economic effects on inflation and growth.
104560	107920	The second is internal conflicts
108800	114400	over the largest wealth gaps we had since then, values gaps.
115680	120320	And the rise of populism of the right and the left,
121760	127200	those conflicts, again, largest since that 1930 to 45 period.
127920	132720	And then the rise of a great power,
133680	137680	producing a great powers conflict internationally
138880	141280	with the rise of China as a great power,
142080	145200	challenging the United States and with Russia.
145200	149440	So the great power conflict, that also is the most
149440	152960	that that's happened since the Great Depression.
152960	157280	So because those three things are happening now,
158000	163040	and I didn't study them, I went back and I needed to study
163040	166800	the cycles, what's happened over longer periods of time.
166800	171040	So I studied the last 500 years because these big cycles
172080	176800	take about 75 years and give or take about 50.
178480	182000	And like the rise and decline of the British Empire,
182000	183280	the rise and decline of the debt.
184240	189920	And that dynamic I shared in the book, and I also shared it
189920	195520	in an animated video, which is called The Changing World Order.
196880	199600	And that creates a path.
199600	202880	Now, it's not just because they repeat in this way,
203440	206240	but one can see the cause-effect relationships
206880	208080	that are happening.
208080	214400	And so that has pretty much transpired according to script.
214960	219680	We can get into those pieces, but I'd say those are the three main ones.
219680	222880	There were two others that had big effect
222880	226400	that I paid more attention to that I'll mention.
226400	232000	One was acts of nature in the form of droughts, floods and pandemics.
232880	235840	They were very disruptive when they happened, killed more people
235840	240960	and toppled more empires or waters than others.
241520	244400	And then also, of course, over a period of time,
244400	247280	there's learning and producing new technologies
247280	249440	that raises living standards.
249440	252880	You know, it's raised per capita income life expectancy and so on.
252880	259760	And so, but those five factors transpire in ways that we've seen before
259760	261600	to create this big cycle.
262160	265840	And if we can look at the cause-effect relationships,
267440	269280	that's what I want to pass along.
269280	272960	Because I'm 74 years old and I'm in a phase in my life
272960	275520	that I want to pass along the things that are of value.
275520	277120	And I think this is an important thing.
277120	279760	But yes, it's transpiring according to script.
280560	282960	Cassandra, yet again, unfortunately.
283520	287040	What do you think is the likelihood of the meltdown of the dollar?
287040	289040	Is America going to be wiped out at some point soon?
289600	296480	I don't want, histrionics, you know, just, I don't want to overdo it.
296480	300800	And I also don't want to just jump to conclusions.
301600	307680	My goal here is to show people how the machine works,
307680	309280	the cause-effect relationship.
309280	312480	So I'm going to answer your question by explaining certain things.
312480	322560	The dollar is held by countries in the form of debt.
322560	324880	In other words, when you say, I'm holding the dollar,
326160	327920	you're holding a debt instrument.
328880	332960	And when we have a problem with the debt instrument,
333520	337040	a few problems with it holding the debt instruments.
337760	340800	And those problems are that, first of all,
341520	346880	as a result of what the United States was in the world,
346880	351920	the largest trading country, the dominant empire, and so on,
351920	359840	there's been a huge accumulation of dollar denominated debt and dollars, therefore.
360480	366640	And there's also been a lot of deficits that had to be funded,
366640	370480	which happens by selling dollar denominated debt,
370480	374080	which a lot of foreigners and banks and others bought.
374800	378000	And so they have a lot of dollar denominated debt.
378800	384640	Now, if you're a creditor, meaning an owner of dollar denominated debt,
385360	392720	you need to have an interest rate that is high enough to more than compensate you for inflation.
393520	400720	And so the production now of a lot more debt and them having a lot of debt,
401360	404640	and then also sanctions internationally,
404640	408160	which means freezing dollar denominated debt,
408960	414960	all have created a reduction in the demand for dollar denominated debt.
415600	421440	There's also concerns in the world about some of the things that are going on in the United States,
421440	424960	and that's reduced that. As a result of that,
426400	431120	you're seeing more transactions take place in other currencies.
431840	439920	And if they take place in other currencies, then others want to save in those other currencies
441120	444800	because that's how they pay for it. So if you want to save in what you pay for,
444800	451600	you save more in it and less in dollars. And so that's the dynamic that is reducing
452160	460080	the demand for dollars and dollar debt at the same time as the supply of it keeps coming,
460080	465920	because we have large deficits. So the underlying value that those dollars
466960	471440	represent isn't increasing, but the number of dollars spread across that is.
472240	477600	Yeah, so that there's a supply-demand issue. That supply-demand issue, by the way,
478160	485040	also exists in European currencies. Okay, they have too much debt and they're financed the same way.
485760	490960	And Japanese currencies. And so what you're seeing is the movement,
492400	500560	all that weight of money and debt is causing prices to go up, inflation. And that's also
500560	512240	being worsened by the supply chain deteriorations that are due to the international conflict.
512880	521120	So for example, in the case of, let's say China and the United States and other countries,
521120	528400	as they prepare for the possibility of war, they want to be self-sufficient. And so
530160	538000	as a result, they work on being self-sufficient more than integrated and efficient. And so
538000	544400	that dynamic is playing an important role too. What do you think the next few years have got in
544400	554720	store for us? Well, I'm going to take all three of those influences and answer it because they're
554720	564320	all related. There's a business cycle or a short-term debt cycle, I call it,
565200	572480	that sort of recession to recession and the way it works is you have a recession in weak economy,
572480	580080	central banks stimulate credit growth, credit gives you buying power, you go out and buy,
580080	587520	the economy picks up, and then that continues until you start to have inflation. Then they
587520	594800	tighten monetary policy and then the economy weakens and it goes into the next recession.
595600	603120	Since 1945, when the new world order began, in other words, we had the currency and also the
603120	610240	American world order beginning in that, we've had 12 and a half of those cycles. They typically
610240	619120	last about seven years, give or take about three. And so we are now about halfway through this cycle
619120	627440	in which they did the stimulation, inflation rises, they tighten monetary policy,
627440	634880	and we're in the phase of the cycle where there is going to be then the cracks occurring and the
634960	644160	negative impact on economic activity and the like. And it's going to be more difficult than normal
644160	652640	because there's so much debt outstanding and what we just talked about. So that is likely
653840	662000	to happen over, let's say, the next year and a half, which means that it will take us
662080	668160	in through the elections. And what we have is a situation where the second of those influences,
668160	677600	the internal conflict influence, is bad and you have a lot of populism. So populists are people
677600	685200	who will fight to win at all costs. They're not compromisers. I will fight and I will win for you
685200	694960	and the rules be damned, compromising be damned. And so you're going to have a political situation
694960	700080	in terms of that kind of environment. It's a bad time for that, but it'll end up
700080	708640	paying an impact on the nature of the elections, I think. And then you have the international
708640	722080	conflict. We are much closer to a big conflict, a war of sorts, either a sanctions and economic war
722080	729760	or even possibly a military war with China. And because of the politics also, that that
729760	737040	will be pushing its limits too because there are the one thing that most Americans are united on
737040	747200	and both Democrats and Republicans are united on is anti-China. And as a result, and they all want
747200	755600	a strong man or woman, strong person on that. And so I think you're going to see pushing of the limits
755600	764720	there and that becomes a dangerous set of circumstances. So I think that if we take the next,
765680	771920	you know, let's call it one, two, three years, I think that those are going to be riskier years.
772640	777120	I spoke to an evolutionary psychologist and an evolutionary anthropologist a little while
777120	782320	ago on the show and they were teaching me about the values and the type of characteristics that
782320	788000	ancestral tribes would have preferred in leaders at different states. And in times of warfare,
788000	792320	more dominant leaders were the ones that were preferred. In times of peace, more prestigious
792320	797840	leaders were the ones that were preferred. Makes complete sense. If you are facing a scary tribe
797840	802400	from the other valley, you want someone that's going to stand firm and is going to not take any
802400	807040	shit and they're going to go for it. When times of peace, that person becomes a bit tyrannical.
807040	811920	It's a little bit too much energy when there's not anybody else to fight. And it's so funny how
811920	818720	you see this just same dynamic to me. It seems play out, no matter how big the populations get,
818720	826720	it's essentially the same physics. That's right. It's happened repeatedly. If you're in a war,
826720	835200	what you want is the commander and everybody to goddamn follow the instructions and just do what
835200	842640	you're told. And it's not like we're going to sit there and argue, debate, and so on. So what you
842640	850880	see is the breakdowns. And particularly, you see the breakdowns also when they're at odds.
850880	857280	There's a lot more to argue about. Like now, the populace of the left and the populace of the right.
857280	866320	And so in the 1930s, you saw four democracies become dictatorships. Choose to become dictatorships.
866320	873680	They had parliaments that chose to become dictatorships. Germany, Italy, Spain, and Japan
874240	881360	chose that because in order to fight, that's what you need. And your anthropologist friends are
882480	883280	right on that.
883280	888320	Yeah, they're consolidating power in an attempt to try and be able to enact more change more easily.
888320	892160	It's not, we haven't got time. We haven't got time to get this across the line diplomatically. We
892160	895200	haven't got time to get everybody on the same page. We'll have one person who knows what they're
895200	898400	doing and they'll push it forward. One thing that I...
898400	907760	And another thing that's common is the foreign enemy. When you have a situation where you have
907760	917680	internal dispute, it's very, very common to try to bring the country together, get support by the
917680	927040	leader by having the common enemy. And so we'll all rally around the leader and you could see...
928480	938160	It was like when 9-11 happened and the president, Bush gets a standing ovation and we're all behind
938160	943920	you in that fight. And so that's timeless and universal dynamic.
943920	949120	If you can't bond yourselves together over shared love of an in-group, shared hatred of an out-group
949120	956320	is a close enough proxy, I suppose, for that interim. Was there anything over the last two years
956320	961760	that you didn't anticipate or is there anything particularly unique about the situation that
961760	968720	we're in now? Every time people say it's going to be different this time. Is there anything that
968720	972160	could make things different this time or is there anything that you've been surprised by?
974400	981040	By and large, I haven't been surprised by... I mean, I didn't anticipate that we were going to have
981040	992320	the war with Russia, but I did anticipate that we were likely headed in a war-like environment.
992320	1002160	It's very much fell with as expected there. The economic and the financial very much is the same.
1002480	1012960	So I'd have to, by and large, almost exactly, it's transpired the way described. And that's why,
1012960	1020640	again, look, I did the video for free on YouTube, the changing world order.
1022560	1028640	What I'm trying to do is to just pass it along for people's consideration to understand the
1028640	1035920	cause-effect relationship that goes there. But yes, it's unfortunately going according to script.
1035920	1043920	That doesn't mean it's destined, but it's difficult to take off track. What do I mean by that?
1047520	1056560	Each stage is the logical consequence of the stage that proceeded it. So let's take the
1056560	1067840	existing situation. The United States has a lot of debt, and it has deficits. So it has to sell
1067840	1075920	debt. Now, if you say, and others are holding debt, and if you say, how do you get healthy,
1076000	1089040	you have to spend less than you earn to not borrow money and get financially strong.
1090800	1096160	That's difficult, and particularly when you have a lot of debt, because you have to take a portion
1096160	1102320	of your income and you have to pay the debt. And also you're living in spending more than
1102320	1108320	you're earning. And so how do you rectify that? What? Cut spending? I mean, it's very difficult
1108320	1117040	to cut spending. Or raise income? That's not easy. So cut spending? What do you cut? Okay.
1117040	1125440	So we're living in a world now where policymakers don't think, how much money do I have to spend,
1125520	1136480	and what should I prioritize it on? They think, how much money do I need to spend without regard
1136480	1144800	to how much they have, and then they go spend it, and then they have deficits that central banks
1144800	1150480	can print. It's just like the same as individuals. They have the deficit, but in their case,
1150480	1157120	they have the capacity to print the money to pay the deficit. So it's not easy to fix the financial
1157120	1165120	problem. The internal problem, you know what it's like. Can you get people to come together
1165920	1173040	to say there's a common problem? Let's have the left and the right and people. Very difficult.
1173040	1182080	People have big differences in values and conditions. And so it's very difficult to bring
1182080	1188560	them together to deal with the problems. And the same is true internationally, you know?
1188560	1198000	Easier said than done. So given that dynamic, there is then the stages. And so it's pretty clear
1198080	1206320	normally what comes next. Given all of these changes, what do you think people can do
1207040	1210720	to best prepare themselves financially for the next few years?
1211840	1225360	Well, I think that in saving, let's talk about that, there is, I think of savings in
1225920	1234640	tiers. The first tier is to secure your well-being, tone a portfolio of assets that are going to
1235440	1242000	secure your well-being. And then after you have that taken care of, then you can go to the next
1242000	1250720	level, take more risk and so on. That well-being, that purchasing power has to be viewed in terms of
1250720	1260160	inflation-adjusted dollars. If you're holding a debt instrument and a cash-paying instrument,
1260160	1268080	and it gives you a 2% interest and you have a 5% or 6% inflation, you lose money at 3% a year.
1268080	1275680	So you have to look at that in real dollars. And you have to hold that portfolio in a way
1276640	1283200	that is balanced to any kind of economic environment. And then the way I do it, and I
1285200	1291920	remember I didn't have anything, and then I start to acquire money. And I start to think,
1291920	1302800	okay, how many weeks do I have, months do I have, or years that I'm financially safe?
1302880	1308400	And what do I hold it in? And then once you've got that taken care of, you can go beyond it.
1309760	1318480	And I wanted it in a very well-balanced portfolio, that type of portfolio that does
1318480	1325360	equally well, no matter what happens. I can explain that a little bit more if you want.
1325760	1336480	That'd be good. Okay. There are basically two big influences on markets,
1340000	1351040	the growth rate and the inflation rate. Like, if you know that growth is going to be
1352000	1358960	faster than expected, and inflation is going to be higher than expected,
1359840	1368720	you know that bonds are going to go down and vice versa. So the way I give that as an example,
1370960	1377360	so the way I look at it is there are those two big influences, and then they can,
1377920	1381520	four environments, and each one of them can go up or down. So there are four
1383360	1390160	quadrants that I think of, rising growth, falling growth, rising inflation, and falling inflation.
1390960	1398000	And I want to have a portfolio that will be 25% of my risk in each one of those,
1398640	1406080	so that I don't have any bias. And so I pick the assets that are going to do well in each of those
1406080	1414240	four quadrants, and I hold them in a balanced way. And I've tested that going back actually to 1900
1414240	1423680	and so on, and you'll actually increase your buying power. And so that's the kind of thing
1423680	1430560	that I think in the beginning. Then you have to also make provision for taxes to some extent.
1431120	1437360	So I say whatever that amount of money is, I want twice as that. So in case it goes in half,
1438080	1445200	and I want to build a portfolio that looks like that for, I don't know, X number of years,
1445200	1451040	that I have that, and that's the safe savings. And then when I go beyond that, then I'll take
1451040	1458960	more risk. But I think that being safe, particularly in this kind of an environment,
1458960	1465600	is important. And I would take a perspective of how to do that. That's like the one I'm just
1465600	1470880	describing. What would be an example of an investment for each of those four quadrants?
1471680	1477280	Well, I'm worried that we're going to take a long time to explain it. I've explained it
1477520	1489840	elsewhere. But let me give an example. I'll take it. If growth, so there's these four quadrants,
1489840	1498560	growth and inflation. If growth is less than expected, and inflation is less than expected,
1498560	1507440	you would like to own bonds. If it's higher than expected, you would not want to own bonds.
1510720	1519920	If inflation is higher than expected, you would want to own assets such as commodities and gold
1520240	1534560	and inflation index bonds. If growth is faster than expected, particularly if inflation is less
1534560	1541040	than expected, you'd want to own stocks. So you get the idea.
1543600	1548960	One of the things that you brought up earlier on was the changing internal structure. This is
1548960	1554640	driven by a number of factors, but one of them being increasing wealth inequality. At the moment,
1554640	1560640	it seems like there is a decline in praising work ethic, especially in the US. Do you think that
1560640	1568000	that is a symptom or a cause of what we're seeing at the moment? Well, I think the,
1568480	1585760	I'm referring to the wealth gap. I think that there's a lot of particularly unproductive people,
1587680	1594560	for various reasons. But I live in the state of Connecticut, and my wife tries to help
1595520	1603680	students in the poorest neighborhoods have the worst conditions. I'll give you this example.
1607760	1612960	The state of Connecticut is usually number one, two, or three in the richest state in the country,
1613600	1619840	but 22% out of the last survey, it's actually higher than this, 22% of the high school students
1619920	1626880	in Connecticut have either dropped out of high school or have absentee rates of greater than
1626880	1636480	25% in our failing classes. There's a great deal of poverty and the breakup of the families and
1636480	1646800	the guidance. There's a cycle that takes place. You're seeing the general competitive education
1646800	1655600	levels, the conditions. In Connecticut, so we operate philanthropically, and I'll give you
1655600	1665040	an example, there was COVID, and the kids have to get educated, and 60,000 kids didn't have
1665040	1673040	computers or connectivity, and no government was going to do anything about it. We had to buy
1673040	1681200	60,000 computers to give it to kids in order for them to have education. Well, and there's hunger,
1681200	1689360	and there's poverty, and there's drugs. It's how the educational system is funded.
1690800	1698560	Education is a state issue by the Constitution, and then within a state, it's a tax,
1698800	1705680	typically within a state, it's a tax district issue. I live in Greenwich, Connecticut, which is
1705680	1715280	relatively, it's a rich town, and the public education gets about $24,000 per student. The last
1715280	1722560	number I looked, it's probably higher than that now, gets $24,000 a student up the road at Bridgeport,
1722560	1729760	Connecticut, 10 minutes up the road, they get $14,000 a student, because there's no tax base,
1731840	1738640	and they need more money because the expenses of raising a kid are, you also have to get them
1738640	1745200	the computer, you've got to get them the food, the clothes, all of those things, and they have
1745200	1755840	less food, less clothes, all those things. But in any case, what you can see is the
1755840	1762480	education test scores and measures of how we're doing in education relative to other countries
1763280	1774480	have declined. So part of it is education and circumstances, part of it is drugs, part of it
1774480	1781440	is, you know, there are lots of parts of it, and then there's a certain element of it, which
1782400	1790880	let's say because of COVID or other reasons, that people have moved around and say, you know,
1790880	1796880	I don't have to work as hard anymore. So, you know, just for example, the change in the attitudes
1796880	1804320	of restaurant workers, you know, okay, I can, I found another way to live and so on, and that's
1805120	1815520	playing a role. Of course, also, people as the baby boomers are older, you know, they drop out of
1815520	1821600	it, nor they want to retire earlier, and they do. So there are a number of factors that affect,
1823920	1837840	you know, this kind of set of circumstances. The wealth gap is very much due to a self-reinforcing
1837920	1846640	cycle in which if you earn a lot of money, you can't afford to take care of your kids' education,
1846640	1854800	you can raise them in a better way. If you don't earn a lot of money, you don't have that privilege.
1854880	1867360	So, you know, so all through history, during those such times, wealth gaps have increased.
1868960	1875680	So you look at the cycles, you have a new, you know, like a new world order,
1875680	1881600	like in the 1850s, you know, you have the Civil War, and then you have that, and then you have
1881600	1886320	new technologies in inventing, you have the Industrial Revolution take place,
1886960	1895120	and things go great, but what it does is it also increases the wealth gap. Some people make a
1895120	1902480	lot of money, others don't, and it also increases the level of indebtedness, and you make the turn
1902480	1912480	of the century, then you see big conflicts over wealth. You have the Panic of 1907, and so what
1912480	1920800	you see is the Industrial Revolution turns into what's called the Gilded Age, in which there are
1920800	1929280	very rich, decadent, you know, while there's poverty and, you know, in the early turn of the
1929280	1936080	century, they're living, people are living very, very lavishly, very decadently at the same time
1936640	1943200	as their, you know, sweatshops and all of that, and then there's kind of a revolutionary reaction
1943200	1947440	to that. So these things happen over and over again, for the same reasons.
1948320	1951760	What would you tell young people then, at the moment? What advice would you give them?
1952720	1968800	Well, first of all, learn how, say a few things. First, know your nature. Everyone has a different
1968800	1978480	nature, a way, a pull, what's their pull, toward. I created a personality profile test called
1978480	1985200	Principles U. I put it online for free, and it tells you a lot about, you know, what your nature is,
1985840	1992400	and it also shows if you take the test and you put somebody else's in, they take the test,
1992400	1997680	it'll tell you about your relationship. So you want to know what your nature is, what your pull
1997680	2005360	is going for, and then you go through your journey of learning experiences that, you know,
2005360	2011840	has its ups and downs, and, you know, you learn, you have your, you know, your painful experiences,
2011840	2017920	but have a principle, pain plus reflection equals progress. You learn, you get that.
2018640	2028640	And then to have perspective, to understand that all of these things, events,
2028720	2036320	transpire, you know, know the whole cycle, see the whole thing, gain perspective, and understand where
2036320	2043200	you are in the cycle, understand where you are in the life cycle. There's a life cycle, you know,
2043200	2048720	from birth to death, and let's say it on average, it lasts about 80 years, and you know that at
2048720	2053360	different parts in that cycle, certain things are going to happen. You're going to, you know,
2054080	2061040	first third of it, you're going to be dependent on others and you're learning. Second third of it,
2062320	2066320	you're going to be independent of your parents and so on, and you're going to be,
2067200	2072240	others will become dependent on you and you're working to be successful. At the various ages,
2072240	2078400	you get married, you have kids, you, all of these cycles, there's a life cycle, that happens over
2078400	2085200	and over again, and then there are these other cycles, these cycles of, you know,
2087200	2096080	you know, let's call it almost from, from war to war, whether that's an internal war to change
2096080	2101600	as the internal order or an external war, it changes the external order. And there's a cycle
2101600	2110800	that has to do with a debt cycle and those others, and you have to know what those cycles are like
2110800	2116720	and kind of where you are in those cycles, and you navigate it well. I mean, the main thing,
2116720	2122160	you know, is being strong, smart, capable, and adaptable. But that's why I put out
2123600	2128800	these, you know, videos and books to try to help people understand that.
2129520	2135600	You mentioned one of the common life landmarks that people get to is having kids and getting married.
2136160	2141840	At the moment, especially in the West, but also even more so in Asia, birth rates are falling
2141840	2148160	through the floor. We've got 0.78, I think in South Korea, we've got just around about one
2148160	2154720	in Japan, China also looking really bad at the moment. What, how concerned are you about
2154720	2158480	current population decline and future demographics?
2159360	2167840	Well, it's a real burden. And also depending on where it is, it's a real burden,
2168960	2176720	because the young have to take care of the old. So let's say, for example, in China,
2177600	2186720	with the one child policy, a married couple has four old adults that they have to take care of.
2186720	2195920	There's not an adequate social program. And that takes time and money. And it makes it,
2195920	2205440	you know, a great burden makes productivity a problem. And so you see, you know, like you say,
2205760	2214480	you know, you see this, you know, that that is a, these are burdens, costs, because the,
2214480	2223520	those who need taking care of and are not earning money need, you know, those resources and it's,
2223520	2234480	and it's sapping. You know, one hopes that productivity increases faster than this burden.
2234480	2240560	And that, but then it requires you, you have to, if you raise that, you have to then divide the pie
2240560	2246240	well. So it's, you know, it's demographics is a burden.
2247280	2255280	You are maybe alluding there to stuff like AI, robot, robotized workforces assisting in terms
2255280	2262800	of getting more juice out of the smaller demographics that we do have. And the potential
2262800	2268880	gains of that accruing to a small number of people that own that organization, you need a
2268880	2273920	relatively small group to be able to, I don't know how many people are in the open AI company,
2273920	2278560	but something tells me it's a significantly smaller number than the amount of impact that
2278560	2284640	it's had and is probably going to have. Right. So that's exactly right. So if you,
2284640	2290720	if the society as a whole can do that, what it will do is it'll naturally make the people who
2291680	2299280	some people very rich and some people very poor, but it can raise productivity enough
2299280	2305120	that it can raise living standards. Let's just imagine robots always work there and you don't
2305120	2311920	have to have people in doing the jobs. Then what you can have, then what you have to deal with is
2311920	2319520	how do you redistribute the wealth and opportunity? Because as I say, it'll be concentrated in some
2319520	2328400	and others will lose jobs and there's more productivity for the whole, but you have a
2328400	2333040	distribution issue. Are you familiar with Nicholas Eberstadt? Do you know him? He wrote
2333040	2338320	Men Without Work? No. He came on the show last week. I think he'd be really interested. The
2338320	2345680	book's very, very short and he's discovered this odd cohort of men that are lurking inside of the
2345680	2352000	unemployment statistics. There's 7 million men age 22 to 55 in the US who aren't working and
2352000	2359680	aren't looking for work. Only 10% of that number of students from the remaining 6.7 million.
2360240	2366320	About 2000 hours is the average amount of time that they spend watching screens and 50% of that
2366320	2372640	time on average is spent whilst on either prescription medication or weed recreational drugs.
2373600	2379840	Two thirds of those men are living in homes that claim at least one disability benefit. Basically,
2379840	2385520	lurking inside of the low unemployment numbers is this cohort of prime working age men who don't
2385520	2393120	have a job and don't want a job either. One of the potential downstream implications for that
2393120	2399200	is what does this mean for universal basic income? That if these men are able to be supported by
2399280	2405680	social welfare, but they're not going out and enacting poetry, staring up at the stars,
2406720	2411360	speaking their truth forward and dealing with the existential pain of living in a good way,
2412160	2417040	this doesn't seem like they're flourishing particularly. Given the automation that's
2417040	2419760	potentially coming down the pike, I wonder what that means.
2420480	2428400	Well, I think you paint or he paints an accurate picture and obviously it's not good.
2431440	2439120	As my wife was describing when she was dealing with that population, now it's very common for
2439200	2449120	kids to come to school high and then they have... What ages? Oh, young ages, 10.
2452080	2456480	Wow, okay. Well, marijuana is readily available.
2459360	2462960	And so, yeah, we have a number of these issues.
2463920	2470640	We've brought China up a couple of times and I think based on what I know about your work,
2470640	2477600	the conflict between the USA and China as China, the ascending new power that may be overtaking
2477600	2484640	the USA. However, we do have this perhaps unprecedented demographic collapse that China's
2484640	2488880	facing. The best predictions that I've seen suggest that it's going to go from about 1.1 to
2488880	2496080	1.2 billion now to about 650 to 700 million by 2050. So, it's pretty much getting chopped in half.
2497440	2504400	Does that change the way that the world orders change moving forward?
2507200	2513600	I think the main thing with China right now is we're on the brink of war with China for various
2513600	2526800	reasons, like I hope we make it to 2050. So, yeah, the demographics is as I described it.
2528320	2535680	And by the way, them losing doesn't make us winning just so we're... Look at that.
2536240	2546000	We hope everyone gets better. And the world economy, we hope everybody has a better way.
2547520	2556560	Everybody loses in wars. And so, that's their set of circumstances and it'll be what it'll be.
2557360	2563600	I think the most important thing is how do we deal with our circumstances? How do we become
2563600	2571040	strong and healthy, financially healthy, productivity healthy and so on. So, yeah,
2571040	2579680	we could talk about the demographic problem in China, which is just what we talked about before
2579680	2586240	in terms of just robotics and productivity and all that makeup for that, I don't know. But I really
2586960	2593600	think we're projecting too much on the outside world. Okay, what do we do with China?
2593600	2600800	What relevance? Well, we trade with China. We don't have to go to a military war with China.
2602400	2614480	Why would we? We shouldn't do that. And then if that's the case, what's the problem with them
2614480	2623520	growing? Okay, it's not very much... Okay, let them grow and invent and let us grow and invent
2623520	2631040	and share the inventions. That would be good. But the problems that we're facing are pretty much
2631040	2638480	our own problems, the things we're talking about and the breakdown of infrastructure and all of that.
2639040	2647280	So, really, I think we should focus on that and maybe their demographics as a big burden
2647280	2654480	or not. They have other big burdens too. We all do. But let's focus on how we can be as good as we
2654480	2662640	can be. Yeah, as opposed to presuming that this zero sum game is China finds life harder,
2662640	2669120	therefore America finds life easier. That doesn't work. Yeah, I understand. You might have seen
2669120	2675360	the Restrict Act, which was brought up recently. It's lining up a potential ban for different types
2675360	2683600	of online services. And it seems like one of the potential bases for banning TikTok from America,
2683600	2692640	which, again, to me, just further embeds this them and us, China is enemy. If we can remove
2692640	2696720	that influence from the West as much as possible, then we are going to end up in a better situation.
2698640	2700240	Well, that's the dynamic, yes.
2702000	2707520	What do you think about the Fed's messaging about this soft landing thing? Is that possible? Like,
2707520	2712560	historically, I don't think it's really happened. But do they have enough control over the economy
2712560	2721760	to be able to make this work? The big issue is that a lot of debt was created. A lot of it is
2721760	2733840	government debt, but it is also corporate to a lesser extent household debt. So if you look at
2733840	2740880	the Silicon Valley, Valley Bank issue, it's not so much their issue as much as a worldwide issue.
2741120	2753600	What happened is that what's a bank? A bank takes in deposits, and then it takes that money and it
2753600	2761440	invests it in things. And so they bought a lot of government bonds that had a higher yield than
2761440	2768400	they were paying out in the deposits. There's a tightness of monetary policy, and those yields
2768400	2776720	went up and the bonds went down in value. And then the amount they have to pay out went up in value.
2777440	2786400	And so they went broke. And that is happening all over. That happens not only through banks.
2786400	2793760	Banks as a whole did a lot of that. But insurance companies and so on, all around the world,
2793840	2798240	same sort of thing happened in Europe. Same sort of thing happened with Japanese
2799280	2809440	companies even buying US dollar bonds a lot. And so if you were to mark those to market,
2810400	2819920	you would have a terrible calamity. But what's going to likely happen is they don't want any
2819920	2827440	more of those bonds. And we're going to have to sell more bonds because we're going to have a deficit.
2828000	2835520	So when you have a deficit, you have to pay for it through selling debt. And there's a lesser
2835520	2843840	demand for that debt. And I think that that creates a problem in which either interest rates
2843840	2848400	go up or the Federal Reserve's got to come in and print. And this is a problem that exists
2848400	2856080	also in Europe with the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, all of them. So that's where
2856080	2865360	we are. And it has knock on effects. It's like dominoes that fall. So it will produce less credit.
2866480	2873840	And as it produces less credit, less demand, less credit, that'll produce less spending.
2873840	2879360	It'll come in certain parts of the economy. For example, commercial real estate.
2881360	2893760	For example, venture capital and private equity. For example, low grade bonds where they have a
2893760	2900400	heavily indebted company and the interest rate goes up a lot and that causes problems. So I think
2900400	2907360	you're in the part of the cycle where you've had the tightening and then the dominoes are beginning
2907360	2916000	to fall. And I think that that's going to produce more problems. So I think when it comes down to
2916000	2922400	it, there's just too much debt and we're adding it to it too quickly. And so it's going to,
2924000	2929600	either that debt will be paid off with hard money, in which case there's not much printing
2929600	2937040	and so on, or it'll be paid off with printing a lot of money to make it easier to pay off.
2937040	2943520	I think in the end, it's always the case that they print a lot of money in and make it easier
2943520	2949440	to pay off, but you have the reduced value of money. So that's how it looks to me. You'll have
2949440	2956800	probably a stagflation environment. And because you have that dynamic going on at the same time
2956800	2961120	as you have supply chain disruptions because of the geopolitical,
2962400	2964400	I think it's going to be a difficult environment.
2966960	2974400	Let's say that we do hit quite an aggressive recession. What are some of the ways that people
2974400	2980480	could even look to benefit financially from that happening? Are there any things that individuals
2980480	2990720	can do? The most important thing, as I say, is to have this basic, well-diversified.
2991680	2999200	And there are some assets and think about a small percentage of your money,
2999840	3009040	even in asset like gold, and diversification for countries to just to create a diversified
3009280	3015840	portfolio is important. One of the things that did occur, you mentioned Silicon Valley Bank there,
3015840	3021040	there was a big bump in terms of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies around about that time.
3021040	3026320	And it seemed like one of the first periods where people genuinely saw crypto as a store of value,
3026320	3033120	as a way to just, I need to put my money somewhere that I feel is safe. And given the last 18 months
3033120	3039200	of what's happened with crypto, considering that as that's the place I'm going to store my assets
3039200	3045920	in order for it to be safe, I think said quite a lot about how people sort of perceived the
3045920	3051840	state of the dollar and the security of banks and stuff at the moment. What's the role of
3051840	3055840	Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in the current economy in your eyes?
3055840	3068960	I think cryptocurrency or Bitcoin doesn't move in a reliable way related to almost anything.
3069600	3080720	It moves up and down because of this mood and that mood. And unlike gold, let's say,
3080960	3086000	I would prefer gold and I would prefer crypto for various reasons. Crypto,
3088640	3095200	it's very easy to track the owners and transactions in it. It's not liked by the government.
3100080	3107840	It doesn't move in a way that's consistent with any of the environments. And it's a fairly small
3107920	3118080	asset class. We talk a lot more about it, but its size is about 30% of the size of Microsoft.
3118080	3125360	And Microsoft is one stock among many stocks. So it's given probably a lot more attention.
3126880	3134400	I don't know who knows. Maybe there's some element of it. I don't understand why people
3134400	3142800	are more inclined to go to Bitcoin than gold. If you look internationally,
3143840	3152000	gold is, for central banks, the third highest reserve asset. First is dollars, then euros,
3152000	3160800	then gold, then Japanese yen. And central bankers are buying gold and they're not buying bonds.
3161520	3176000	And it's timeless and universal. It's been there. So I'm not a big fan of it. As I said before,
3177440	3182320	having a little bit, I have a little bit of it. But if you have a little bit of it, you have to
3183440	3189680	think about those things. And like I said, you have to be prepared for it to fall a lot.
3190480	3196000	If it goes down 80% or something, but that limits the amount that you can have in it.
3196000	3200240	So I don't know. I don't think a lot of Bitcoin.
3201040	3207520	I think what's interesting there is holding crypto essentially has a cognitive load on you,
3208640	3213680	using it as somewhere that you're using for investment as a store of value to just put
3213680	3219120	assets that you've got. There is a price that you pay because of the volatility,
3219120	3222960	but the price that you pay is with your own sanity with regards to that,
3223840	3231840	which is something that I hadn't quite considered. There are less sanity sapping forms of investment.
3231840	3239200	Yeah, that's a good way to do it. I mean, I've seen so many people. I've seen people get very
3239200	3243280	rich and I've seen people get very broke with it. I have friends in both camps.
3243360	3251200	Yeah. So we've spoken about today this very quickly changing highly volatile environment that we're
3251200	3256400	in, whether that be socioculturally, politically, globally, locally, financially.
3259440	3268000	Where should people go in order to find some solace in this, given the fact that it is
3268960	3281120	difficult to exist in this world? Go to places or spend time where there's not as much of this
3281920	3290320	junk going on. I mean, first of all, I think recognize, let's go to some of the basics.
3290560	3299120	What do you really need? You need a bed to sleep in. You need food to eat.
3302160	3310000	Most depressions, most people remain employed. Most wars, most people don't get
3310640	3324720	die or get injured. So let's calm down and put all this in place. Let's be in places where there's
3327440	3334240	goodness and harmony and beauty. Maybe you spend more time in nature or you go out there and
3334640	3347040	meditate. Meditation has had a big effect on me. So don't get all stressed about it.
3348240	3359840	Navigate it well. Enjoy life, enjoy those things. I think that's most important.
3360400	3363920	What would you say to the people that say, how am I expected to enjoy life when there's
3363920	3368960	all of this chaos going on? There's so many bad news stories and headlines. What about the financial
3368960	3379600	collapse? Well, first of all, if it's really having that impact on you, don't get so hung up on the
3379600	3387360	financial stories. Don't watch the television or something. Go out for a nice walk in the nature,
3387760	3395520	all that story. You don't really need all that story. Now what's going to happen to you, like I
3395520	3403360	say? Don't get so hung up on expectations of having the most amount of money or whatever. Just
3404240	3416400	think about it. Like I say, will you lose where you live? What matters? Your friends, your family,
3417360	3423920	your, give a good bed to sleep in for adequate food, make out into nature.
3425920	3433440	My own view is sometimes the most luxurious thing I can do is take a tent and be out in a beautiful
3433440	3447520	spot. Avoid it. Don't get stressed out. Understand it. Be prepared.
3450720	3455120	Redefining success and what happiness means and what we should be aiming for in life,
3455120	3459520	I think is a very worthwhile pursuit. Right. I'll tell you,
3462960	3472720	this idea of success being measured in the amount of money and status you have is really screwed up.
3475520	3482320	Like if you think about money, and this is shown in Measures of Happiness,
3483280	3490640	past a basic amount of money so that you don't have the misery, there is no correlation between
3490640	3495520	the level of money you have and the level of happiness you have. Lots of studies show that.
3496240	3503360	And the highest correlation is do you have a community? That's the highest source of
3505600	3510880	happiness and also longevity. It has a big effect on longevity, stress.
3510880	3515120	More than smoking, more than stopping alcohol, more than going to the gym and exercising.
3515120	3526000	Right. And then you think what is money for? It has no intrinsic value. It only has a value of
3526000	3536240	what it buys. And so it has a limited marginal ability, benefit. You add more and more to it.
3537120	3542160	And like what are you going to do? Okay, so you're going to get a bigger house or a bigger car?
3544960	3551040	And what does that really mean incrementally relative to spending time with friends and
3551040	3558000	family and all of those things? Most of the good things in life are not expensive. Right.
3558720	3568160	Friends, family, nature, sex, anything. It's not going to get better with more money,
3568160	3576400	right, materially better. And so it seems to me that it then can become an obsession
3578480	3585760	and that's not healthy. So I think it's by and large you handle it well and it's
3585760	3590240	all going to be okay. It's all going to be okay.
3592400	3596000	Ray Dalio, ladies and gentlemen, if people want to keep up to date with the work that you're
