1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
Best guess is that China only has 1.3 billion people now the population probably peaked more than 10 years ago

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,600
And by 2030 there will be more retirees than workers and by 2050 the entire population of China will have dropped below

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,320
650 million

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,040
That's wild. It's beyond terminal

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:27,520
How real has the progress and prosperity of the last century been in your opinion? Oh, it's been fantastic

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,300
This has been the greatest time to be alive the combination of the American security umbrella plus globalization

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,080
Has changed the way we lived. It's allowed everyone to benefit from global trade

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,480
Before we had that if you didn't have oil locally

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,520
You didn't have transport fuel if you didn't have coal locally you didn't have electricity if you didn't have good food

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Locally you didn't have a population

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,440
globalization safe globalization enabled anyone to trade anything that they could produce

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,960
Even if it wasn't a commodity and join the system. It was like everyone had one World War two all at once

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,360
It's it's been a great ride

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
And now it's ending

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,100
Was it inevitable that it was going to end if you'd gone back a century ago and being able to change

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,280
Policy globally could you have done something differently back then?

17
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,760
A century ago probably not there's a there's a couple problems here

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,400
So first of all when globalization really got going in the 50s

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,560
We started moving off the farms and into the cities to take manufacturing jobs now when you live

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,840
On a farm kids are free labor. You have a whole scat of them

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,800
But when you move into a condo kids are just really loud expensive mobile pieces of furniture and adults aren't idiots

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,160
So we had fewer you play that forward for 70 years

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,680
And it's not that we're running out of children that happened 40 years ago

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,680
It's that we're running out of mature adults

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,400
And so the economic model of globalization is consumption based and it just doesn't work without people

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,160
So we've always known we were going to get here in the end just happen

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,560
The Americans forced the issue at the end of the war

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,400
We told everyone that we would patrol the global ocean so that anyone could send any cargo ship anywhere to trade in any product with any partner

29
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,000
That's what made globalization work now. We didn't do this because we were nice

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,040
We didn't do this because it was a trade program. We did this as a bribe

31
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,680
This is what we gave everyone so that they would join us against the Soviets

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,720
Soviet Union collapsed in 1992

33
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,760
So Americans have been electing ever more isolationist and populist leaders ever since

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,760
So for you to believe that globalization can continue you have to believe that a it doesn't require consumption anymore and

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,400
Be that the Americans will continue to bleed and die so that the Chinese can get

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
You know, that's a bad bad

37
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,440
Before we start talking about where we're at and what that means for the future

38
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,480
Is there anything else that we need to understand about how we got here about any of the fundamental principles that we're going to be talking about?

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,720
We'll bring them up as we go

40
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,000
But those are the two big things the demographic flip well past the point of no return and the Americans have largely checked out

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,760
You said that 2019 is the best that the world will ever be what was particularly special about that one year

42
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,960
so think of your demographic profile as a pyramid children on the bottom retirees at the top

43
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,140
mortality built it into a pyramid as we

44
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,240
industrialized and urbanized it became more of a column and then and eventually an inverted V with more mature adults than children in

45
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,200
2019 was the last year before the baby boomers really got into retirement in a big way

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,960
So we had this massive post-war generation throughout the Western world that were all on average

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,000
63

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,240
so

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:02,600
They hadn't retired yet and all of their investments and all the retirement savings were churning along providing capital for the whole system

50
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:10,080
We still had a huge amount of consumption out in the world, but you fast-forward three years this year on average they turn 66

51
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,280
So it's over we've lost their consumption. We lose their investment

52
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,080
They have to liquidate all their stocks and bonds and go into T bills and cash because they won't have the ability to recover from a crash

53
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,000
and we're also seeing some of the fastest demographic aging in human history throughout the

54
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,000
Developing world with China being the far most advanced. So we're losing the investors. We're losing the workers

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We're losing the consumers all at the same time

56
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,760
On top of that we had Trump and we had COVID and now we've got Biden

57
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:48,280
And then we had Brexit and everything that used to tie it all together has been broken apart either on purpose or just because of the

58
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,240
Strategic trends that were already in play. We're never going back

59
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,240
consumers

60
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,400
Investors and workers those are the three main things that people of working age and above school age give us

61
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,640
Absolutely, and we're running out of all of them and you need those to continue to grease the system

62
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:12,320
They're the people that drive not only creativity in terms of pushing technological progress forward and bits and pieces

63
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,520
But they also inject capital into the system. They're the ones that are spending on consumer goods so on and so forth

64
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,640
so they just provide lubricate like financial lubrication and also the

65
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,160
Worker power the employee employee power, right?

66
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,400
You can kind of split it into two general categories for people roughly aged 18 to 40 maybe 45

67
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,480
Those are your young workers relatively low value add

68
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,440
Relatively low cost, but they're at the height of their consumption because they're raising kids and buying homes

69
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,760
So that's where most of the economic activity that drives a modern system comes from

70
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,760
Once you passed 45 up until 65 the kids are moving out the house has been paid down

71
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,560
But your income keeps going up so the delta between your income and your expenses gets very very large

72
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,120
And that's where all the financial heft comes from

73
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,840
but these are also our most productive workers because they literally have decades of experience and from roughly

74
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,920
1985 until

75
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:14,640
2015 the world was in kind of the perfect balance because we had a lot of those countries with the mature worker

76
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,920
Demographics and then a lot with the younger worker demographics

77
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,480
What's happened is that countries who joined globalization in the second wave in 1990s mostly the developing world

78
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,360
They urbanized and aged out much faster than the rich world did

79
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
So when we hit 2015

80
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,800
That big chunk of developing world workers the experienced workers the productive workers the ones who saved

81
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,760
They're now moving into retirement. We're losing their money. We're losing their skills

82
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,360
But because the developing world is aging so much faster

83
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,320
They're moving into their 40s in their 50s, but they haven't been able to build up the skill set because their systems were not as established

84
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,280
But their birth rates dropped faster than the West's did

85
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,920
So they actually have lower birth rates in many cases in most of the advanced world

86
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,720
So we've lost children on both sides of the ledger and now our new mature workers

87
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,480
Just don't have the skill set to keep it up. And even if they did they wouldn't have anyone to sell to

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,600
When old people die, do they not pass their money down as either inheritance or inheritance tax?

89
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,660
Does that not go back into the system in one way? They do and if they died at age 66, that would be great from an economic

90
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
Unfortunately, if that's the right word

91
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,880
This people continue on for 20 25 years after retirement now. This is gonna sound really weird

92
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,880
But in the United States, this is less of a problem

93
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,000
Number one, our baby boomers actually had kids. So we do have a replacement generation. We know them as millennials

94
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,760
We can talk about them later in all their faults, but ultimately they're there and that's a good thing

95
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,520
Second

96
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,600
We have a really high mortality rate among people over age 55 in the United States

97
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,840
The the delta between the average age of mortality in Europe versus the United States is in excess of 10 years

98
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,040
So we will get that churn a lot faster than Europe will

99
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
That's interesting

100
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,640
okay, so

101
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:20,120
What which countries at the moment have got the worst demographics which countries should be yeah

102
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,360
Which countries should be very concerned about the ratio of young to old?

103
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
The worst in the world is China

104
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,440
They've been in the process of updating their data over the course of the last couple years and they're now starting to publicly admit

105
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
That they over counted by a hundred million people

106
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,720
All of those people would have been born since one child so age 40 and under the young worker demographic that

107
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,520
Childbearing demographic and two-thirds of them are probably women

108
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,960
So we best guess is that China only has 1.3 billion people now

109
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,320
The population probably peaked more than 10 years ago and by 2030

110
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:02,280
There will be more retirees than workers and by 2050 the entire population of China will have dropped below 650 million

111
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,600
That's wild it's beyond terminal yeah, so the Chinese system collapses this decade for sure

112
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
I

113
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,700
Assuming nothing else goes wrong, and there's plenty other competitors to put the bullet in China's head

114
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,520
Dude, that is crazy. Okay, so

115
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,760
Yeah, all the way from pre-industrial to post-industrial collapse in 45 years

116
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:38,680
Just for the people that don't understand about how the one-child policy and the preference for boys over girls and stuff created this landscape

117
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,280
What's the what's the high-level view of that sure? Well, there's two things

118
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,640
First of all of course is one child Mao was concerned that they had a young upcoming generation after World War II that was going to eat the country alive

119
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,480
So they went to a two-child policy ultimately to a one-child policy, and that was not loosened until 2015

120
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,360
But by that point the damage was already done because there was a second factor

121
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,560
Remember countries that industrialized later can follow the path of those who came before they can skip some steps

122
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,400
So China was the fastest ever industrialization experience

123
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,480
What the United Kingdom did in seven generations the Chinese did in one?

124
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,720
And so they crammed seven generations of economic growth and development into one and that's why their growth rate has been so impressive

125
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,720
But you can only do that once and now it's behind them and now they have no children and they have very few people under age 45

126
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Mmm

127
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Is this is

128
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,720
Population growth and collapse similar to an r-naught number in a way that more people

129
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,520
Allow you to have more children which gives you more people to have more children

130
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,520
But if the reverse is happening then it causes a nose dive

131
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,720
You're absolutely right there now. I don't want to say that

132
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,960
Unchecked population growth is necessarily the way to go. That's not what I'm after here

133
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,520
I mean you require a balance between children young workers and mature workers

134
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,680
If you don't have enough mature workers, you don't have the capital

135
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,160
You don't have enough young workers. You don't have the consumption. You don't have the children. You don't have a future

136
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,560
China is already out of those last two categories. And so we know where this leads. It leads to zero

137
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,640
Given the fact that

138
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,360
Humans are being I think it's every three generations lives for another generation at the moment around about every generation lives eight years

139
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,720
Longer than the generation before increased health care health span

140
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:36,520
Better access to that is only true in the shift from pre-industrial to industrial so you get that once

141
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,680
Well depends upon how you apply the lessons to your system in the case of Europe. I'd say they got it three times

142
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:49,360
But there's definitely an upper limit one of the things to keep in mind especially when you're talking about European demographics

143
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,240
Is that Europe in Europe people are not living longer?

144
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,000
Overall lifespan has not improved. What's improved is we've gotten rid of a lot of mortality

145
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,400
So the things that used to kill you when you were zero to sixty five don't kill you anymore

146
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,320
Right, okay

147
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,280
That is going to change the shape of demographics as well

148
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Right the fact that young people are able to get old more easily say more safely more safely

149
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,520
Yeah, precisely, so I guess there's just a lot over the last hundred years. We've seen such change

150
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,440
It's not just been technological change, but downstream from that is what's happened

151
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,080
Demographically and how that's how that's influenced the demography. Okay, so if I'm medicine electricity sewage

152
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:37,560
Yeah, if China's got the worst who what are some of the areas that have got better-looking demography

153
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:45,520
The three countries in the world in the in the advanced world actually in the advanced and in the developing world

154
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,840
New Zealand France United States

155
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,300
And largely for the same reason there are countries that have a little bit more physical space

156
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,280
So their cities tend to be more of a sprawl

157
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:02,320
You're more likely to have a backyard more people can live in the countryside and be economically viable

158
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,840
So when these three countries urbanized they did it at a slower rate

159
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,000
And they remain the three advanced countries with the lowest urbanization rates in the world

160
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,480
In the advanced developing world the closest one was is going to be Mexico and for similar reasons

161
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,320
I'm in central Mexico, which is on a highland massive is just one giant suburban sprawl

162
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,640
And that means that people can have more children now all of these countries still have their own demographic hiccups

163
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,880
They all have the baby boomer problem. It's just that they all have replacement generations

164
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,200
I saw I had a conversation with Jordan Peterson about this at the start of the year and I did some research before is the

165
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,760
country with the highest

166
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
current birth rate per

167
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:54,720
Family Chad be somewhere in Africa. I'm gonna guess probably somewhere in central Africa. Yeah Chad, Nigeria that cluster

168
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:02,320
But I'm gonna guess that just lots of children isn't necessarily a good answer either because you then lock yourself into potential futures

169
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:09,760
You can't birth any more or fewer five-year-olds now. It's what whatever happens this year is now. Yeah, yeah, precisely

170
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,800
Precisely, so in the case of sub-Saharan Africa, and you know, this is a very broad array of countries

171
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
It's very difficult to make a generalization

172
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:25,880
They've started to industrialize and so they're going down the same path that everybody else did and the first step of that path is

173
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,000
lowering infant and child mortality and so when one out of three children don't die

174
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,320
You have an explosion in your birth rate

175
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
But if you play that forward 10 15 years

176
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,600
Then you start having adjustments and family planning and you get smaller and smaller families as urbanization kicks in

177
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,920
The danger for countries that are in this category who've taken the first but not the second step is

178
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,200
That they've imported a lot of the technologies of industrialization

179
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,440
Which has helped them out, but they have not developed the systems to sustain that

180
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,740
Themselves so if something happens to the outside environment, they lose all of the benefits what like

181
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,120
Healthcare medicines

182
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,560
fertilizers

183
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,480
It's very easy for me to see a lot of these countries facing famine in the not too distant future

184
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,160
Because if you break down globalization, you know, yes, that means it's difficult to get oil or manufactured goods

185
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
I'm more concerned about agriculture

186
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
Agriculture is by far the most

187
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,240
Delicate and vulnerable of the economic sectors because it needs the equipment it needs the finance and needs the fertilizers

188
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,080
It needs the trade options you break any of those the whole system falls apart

189
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:40,360
And with the Ukraine war we are seeing massive disruptions to the fertilizer sector with some of the decisions the Chinese have made same thing

190
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,480
So we're already looking this year at losing

191
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,200
Roughly a third of global fertilizer supply. That is going to haunt us for a decade

192
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,080
Wow, okay

193
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:58,080
so for the people that maybe haven't been able to work out why it is that increasing urbanization and

194
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,600
Education and development causes a reduction in birth rate. Can you just explain that for sure?

195
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,640
It's a wide array of factors

196
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,640
So when you move into a city you have less room and that just changes the mechanics of raising kids

197
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,680
When you move off the farm kids are no longer free labor. You have fewer of them when you urbanize when you have electricity

198
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,280
You've generated time and so people can do things after sunset

199
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,720
This is important for everything in terms of economic development, but it's most important for women

200
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,040
Because if a woman moves off the farm into the city and all of a sudden can do something after hours

201
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,080
You have the opportunity for mass education and freeing them from doing more than just being mothers

202
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,320
Nothing wrong with being a mother

203
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,120
But it's a full-time job on the farm in the city

204
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,560
You're gonna have fewer kids that's less time allotted and you have a greater chance to you know read

205
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:57,080
And so the entire women's right movement is basically linked indelibly to electricity and

206
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,800
Once you have it women have fewer kids because they now have other things going on in their lives that compete for attention

207
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:10,160
They can go and get jobs. They can pursue careers. They can do research. Yes interest

208
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,040
We absolutely so I mean the the British example with the the cotton mills was probably the best example

209
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:21,600
The first group of people to urbanize weren't the men. It was the women and we saw the impact on birth grades

210
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,400
Going back to what you said there about food shortages and the delicacy of agriculture

211
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,240
I'm seeing a lot of videos come out shaky phone videos come out of China at the moment. Just how bad is there any

212
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,600
Reliable information about how bad food and the future of food will be in China

213
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,000
It's getting difficult to get good information out of China. It's really demand

214
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,720
Devolved into a cult of personality state even stricter than what Mao Zedong had

215
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,000
I don't think that the Chinese having a food crisis that is impacting their ability to have calories at the moment

216
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Chinese land is among the worst in the world

217
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,280
And so it requires a huge amount of fertilizer to grow anything specifically phosphate for rice

218
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,040
By far the world's most phosphate hungry crop in the Chinese traditionally

219
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,280
Because of that have been the world's largest producer and exporter of the stuff

220
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,240
The problem is actually with Africans swine fever. Now, you may have heard of that a few years ago

221
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,240
They had a big outbreak. They ended up culling more hogs from their farms and the rest of the world's commercial

222
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,640
farms have hogs

223
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,880
Just give you an idea of just how lopsided the pork market is. It's two-thirds of it is China

224
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,840
They went to rebuild their herds, but they never abrogated the debts for the farmers who went out of business

225
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,480
They just offered subsidies to bring in new people. They thought that would be cheaper

226
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,800
Well, you have now two million new hog farmers in China who have no idea what they're doing

227
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,840
And let's just say that phyto sanitary does not

228
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,200
Translate into Mandarin well in the first place. So we're probably in the early stages of a second wave of ASF

229
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,400
That'll probably be just as bad if not worse than the first one

230
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:03,000
So pork just like it did two or three years ago is about to fall off the market in China completely

231
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
That just leaves rice

232
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,600
So the Chinese have banned the export of phosphate fertilizer in the short term

233
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:18,120
This is causing massive problems in agricultural producers in East and South Asia Australia, especially Western Australia is probably the part

234
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
That's getting gotten hit hardest

235
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,360
Brazil is feeling the impacts because these are Western Australia and Brazil basically can't grow without fertilizer

236
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,640
They don't have soil on the way that we think at the term. It's a weird geology

237
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,900
But you interrupt the input flows

238
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,960
And it's very difficult to grow food at volume

239
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:45,120
And China in the best of times is on a razor's edge in terms of food sustainability

240
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:53,040
And they use about three to six times as much fertilizer as is used in the global average just because their land is so poor

241
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
Luckily phosphate they've got covered

242
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,080
They produce that themselves, but the nitrogen is all made with imported natural gas

243
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,560
and the uh

244
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,240
The phosphate half of i'm sorry the potash half of that comes from a different continent

245
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,080
so

246
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
Yeah, china demographic collapse

247
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,160
unavoidable

248
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,360
food collapse

249
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,120
highly likely

250
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,240
And that's before you start talking about things like energy manufacturing and trade

251
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,160
Does this not make china unbelievably dangerous?

252
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,440
The question is what would you do if you're china? Where would you go to get what you want?

253
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,880
If you go into kazakhstan fine, but you know, what does the winner get?

254
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,600
You can't go to india

255
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,040
Nabila is on the way

256
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:43,360
You could go into vietnam, but when the vietnamese when the um, sorry when the chinese did that last in 1979

257
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,120
They got treated just as well as the americans were and so that was a quick war

258
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
They don't have the navy to push out

259
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,200
Japan and taiwan could go nuclear in a month. Hang on that just leaves russia. We heard this

260
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,400
China are taking over the south china sea

261
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,640
There's all of these small islandettes that they're putting together. They've got this scary big armed

262
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,040
Forces that's going to come and take over everything in the is that not the case

263
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,200
So they're not as strong militarily as they have been have we been told really not

264
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,800
Um, they have made significant strides over the last 30 years

265
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,400
I don't mean to belittle that

266
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,520
But everything they're doing in the south china sea was designed to intimidate vietnam and the philippines into

267
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,320
Cowering and it had the opposite effect and both countries just ran to japan and now have defense packs

268
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,960
It doesn't really allow the the chinese to project power very far either

269
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,640
They do have a lot of ships. They've got like a 650 ship navy

270
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,360
But 90 of them are really small and can't sail more than 1500 kilometers from the coast

271
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,880
And that assumes they're going slow in a straight line and no one's shooting at them

272
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,200
In actual combat conditions. They can maybe make it 600k

273
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,480
So it's they don't have the power projection

274
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,560
And they're the country in the world that is most dependent on reaching the world in order to reach markets

275
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,880
and resources

276
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,960
Okay, so that's demographics. How does globalization play a role?

277
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,200
well

278
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,840
If the chinese can't reach europe, they lose their largest market if the united states throws a trade war

279
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,720
They lose their second largest market if they can't reach africa. They lose raw material resources

280
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,200
If they can't reach the persian golf the lights go out

281
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:30,480
They're completely dependent on globalization as maintained by the americans for the entirety of their economic and cultural system

282
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,120
What do you mean when you say as maintained by the americans?

283
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,560
The united states is the country that guarantees freedom of the seas or traditionally that has been our role since world war two

284
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
That's what we're getting out of

285
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,960
And we're there's going to be this little fun thing with ukraine war that's about to happen

286
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,680
So i don't know how much you've been following that but the europeans have done an insurance ban

287
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,720
Which has dissuaded most reputable carriers from taking russian crew to china

288
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,920
So the chinese and the russians rented a bunch of super tankers

289
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,120
Alashed them together into a raft off the coast of portugal

290
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:08,400
And they're bringing shuttle tankers from russia's ports, which can't take super tankers and doing sea to sea transfers in the middle of the atlantic

291
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,680
I can't wait for somebody just to do

292
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
And just grab it

293
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:20,000
It could be portugal the chinese don't have the naval capacity to put anything that far out neither to the russians

294
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,280
But someone soon is going to do that and that's going to shut down the entire energy trade out of russia

295
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,520
I'm a little surprised it hasn't happened already, but it's going to be a fun day when it does go down

296
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,600
Dude, that's wild. I mean how much how much oil are you talking about here? Because presumably if someone was going to

297
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,800
Do a small act of war in order to take it it would have to be a worthwhile amount of

298
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,200
Well, you wouldn't you probably wouldn't do it just because you wanted the oil

299
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,200
You would do it because you want to disrupt the russian financial system because this would destroy it

300
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,880
One super tanker the insurance policy on one super tanker is going to run about a billion dollars

301
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,400
The russians only have five billion dollars put aside for this

302
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,000
So not only would you disrupt the immediate transfer, which probably would affect

303
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,360
I'm just spitballing here because the russians aren't talking but let's call it two to three million barrels immediately

304
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,720
But anything else that was in the chain going back to the russian ports probably another 10 or 15

305
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,960
Million, I'm sorry. I said billion early two to three

306
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,440
Million barrels. There's probably another 10 to 15 million barrels on shuttle tankers on their way there now

307
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,600
And then all of a sudden the ports get clogged and then the pipes get clogged

308
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,440
And the pressure builds up into Siberia into the permafrost and the wells freeze

309
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,080
And that's it for russian energy for 30 years

310
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Dude everything is so interconnected

311
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,680
Mm-hmm and fragile

312
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,880
Okay, so that's globalization for china you mentioned that the us was kind of like the police of the sea

313
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,880
And they're getting out of it. What does getting out of it mean and what did police of the sea mean?

314
00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:00,000
Well part of globalization was making sure that everybody's commerce could go anywhere in the pre-world war two environment

315
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,280
Unless you were an empire with a navy you didn't trade

316
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,840
You couldn't because the empires were in charge

317
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,840
When the empires died in world war two and the americans took over the global structures

318
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,840
We decided that rather than having a single american-led structure that was designed to siphon off

319
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,760
energy and food and resources and money to the united states as an empire would we would instead

320
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:31,440
Prioritize security versus the soviets and so we provided the economic backdrop the security backdrop

321
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,680
That was necessary for everyone to play

322
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,280
And that's the world we know that's what we've been living in the americans make sure that piracy is under control

323
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:44,240
They make sure that hostile countries can't rage commerce and they generally provide policing actions

324
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,400
Not to say that we've done it great in any given day, but that that's been the plan and it's broadly worked

325
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,400
Since 1992 we've been backing away from that. We've been closing down our overseas bases

326
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,600
We've been retooling our military so it's not destroyer heavy and designed to patrol

327
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,760
It's carrier heavy and decide to and design to hammer things

328
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,080
So we now have 11 super carriers by the end of this decade. We'll have 14

329
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,400
one of them

330
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,800
Is more powerful than all but nine of the air forces on the planet

331
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,640
And that assumes a fair fight and the whole idea of a navy is it's never a fair fight?

332
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,720
Because chips move, you know, we learned this from you

333
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,080
Uh, and so it's really one of our new super carriers can take on any but one of three

334
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,280
Air forces in the world and we have you're gonna have 14 of them

335
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,720
Uh, so that's great if you want to knock off a country

336
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,680
If you want to patrol the global oceans, no, no, no, no, no

337
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,840
Because you can only be in 14 places at once and that assumes they're all at sea, which never happens

338
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,000
So we no longer even have the military structure

339
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,200
That is necessary to guarantee global commerce. No country in the world does

340
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,080
So the most likely outcome of this is we'll get a series of regional powers

341
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,600
That have military force that is capable of kind of making a bubble a little sphere of influence

342
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,560
And there will be trade within those bubbles

343
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,480
But the trade between the bubbles is going to be very very sketchy

344
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,080
Difficult to regulate difficult to protect and by definition can't really be very long distance

345
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
That eliminates a lot of what's out there

346
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
What are you protecting?

347
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,920
The seas from is this

348
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,600
Criminals and people that are going to steal ships is is that the risk that happens?

349
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,840
I'm trying to work out the difference between the current state and the state where there are few destroyers

350
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,280
patrolling the seas

351
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,920
Well pre-world war two is usually imperial competition

352
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,640
If you didn't have something that you thought you needed you went out and you took it and if somebody else had it

353
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,800
You have a nice little war with a naval component

354
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,360
During the cold war it has been i'm sorry just during the post-cold war era piracy has come back in a very big way

355
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,520
It's

356
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
more an irritant

357
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,320
But if you look back to pre-world war two privateerian was all kinds of fun

358
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,400
And the idea that you didn't have to go out and raid your opponents shipping yourself. You get as high or someone to do it

359
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,840
I expect to see a lot more of that. Oh, so that was what I was thinking. I was thinking this sounds very

360
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,920
primitive

361
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,920
very medieval that

362
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,600
countries that

363
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
publicly are at peace and

364
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,680
have their

365
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:30,320
Diplomats going to visit each other and conversations and they're sat around tables together agreeing about stuff that they would try and steal

366
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,960
Shipments of potatoes or whatever it is that's going on or metals that seemed a little bit unlikely

367
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
but what you're saying is that

368
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,120
There are ways around committing outright acts of naval war

369
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,160
By I mean you can have state piracy basically using your military to grab things direct

370
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,520
You can have privateering where you rely on third parties to do it and provide safe harbor

371
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
And then you can have flat-out piracy

372
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,320
We've dealt with all of them in the past. We're going to have to deal with all of them in the future

373
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,880
Do you think that's is that realistic though in the current state where?

374
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,880
Information is able to be pushed around the world super quickly and

375
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,440
sanctions and public

376
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:17,920
lambasting and so on and so forth would someone really come out and try and steal some ships whether under the cover of

377
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,760
A bunch of guys that rush has been doing it for six months

378
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
Okay, yeah, yeah

379
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,960
They are at war though, right when you break down the rules of action and when you remove the security guarantor

380
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,120
Countries do what they feel they need to whether it's out of opportunity or desperation

381
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,880
Interesting. Okay. So that's globalization globalization. Let's say that it does

382
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,400
Start to slow down. What are the knock-on effects of that? Oh, dear god. Okay

383
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
So I just wrote this book

384
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:02,240
The book split into six big chapters based on the various economic sectors so transport finance energy industrial commodities agriculture manufacturing

385
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
Everything that we understand

386
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,920
About all six is dependent upon the idea of global security

387
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,240
And so you remove the global security and all six of them have to unwind and reform in different ways

388
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,840
So really it's kind of pick your poison with transport long haul goes out the window

389
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,960
That's an end to among other things super tankers. So if you are getting your oil from 3 000 or more miles away

390
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,240
You're out of luck

391
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:40,160
Ships are going to have to be smaller and go faster because the concentrated risk that a giant container vessel has

392
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,880
You lose one of those and the shipping company goes away

393
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,000
If you're doing smaller tankers or smaller ships that are going faster, they can't carry as much

394
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,840
You just lost most intermediate goods trade. That's an end to electronics manufacturing in its current form

395
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,840
So you can play this on really any topic that you want

396
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,480
But the structures that have all held it together and made it work are dependent upon the ceiling not falling

397
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,640
And it's falling

398
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,640
It seems to me like the current way that the world's setup has got most people myself included

399
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,960
To believe that everyone's just a bit nicer now

400
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,680
Than we were for most of human history

401
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,000
Do you understand what I mean that it's uh, how would you say?

402
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,080
it's

403
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
global policing masquerading as

404
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
virtuous human nature

405
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,400
We established penalties for people who didn't play

406
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,680
And because the americans started with europe, which was the headquarters of most of the empires

407
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
It's stuck

408
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,080
The only non european empire that mattered at the time was the soviet union, which was the target of all this

409
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,640
And japan, which was subjugated

410
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,160
So everyone who in the past had been a bad actor if you want to use that very loaded term

411
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,560
All of a sudden was on the same side everyone who had ever had a projection based military throughout human history

412
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
Was in the same coalition

413
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,840
It worked

414
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,840
for a while

415
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,120
You've said that energy is one of the sub components of globalization

416
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,040
Presumably because in order to get the energy you need to move it around the world in order to take it from where it's taken from

417
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
To where it needs to be used

418
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,080
Is just how crucial of a port a point is energy because alex epstein's been on the show nate haigans been on the show

419
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
Richard betz from the ipcc has been on the show

420
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,920
I understand that they have their priors with regards to where their research lies

421
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,280
But obviously their focus is that especially with nate, you know energy is is absolutely everything

422
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,360
What are your views on the current sort of state of the energy climate and then moving forward to climate change as well?

423
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,200
I would say that there's not a lot of light between me and those names

424
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,560
I mean obviously when you get into the details analysts can quibble about everything

425
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,040
And they can they do absolutely

426
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,200
But the the core idea that without energy none of this works is solid

427
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:05,280
We've spent the last 70 years bringing the energy from where it's produced to where it's consumed which means primarily from the middle east

428
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:12,160
To europe and east asia north america is more or less the self-contained component even was before the shale revolution now

429
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,760
It certainly is

430
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,440
That was one of the prices the americans paid in order to get their alliance is making sure the energy would flow

431
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
In the environment we're in now

432
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,320
We're at a risk of losing all russian crude

433
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,320
Now i've always thought this was going to happen eventually. I didn't think it was going to happen this soon

434
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,880
Russian crude is what has largely fueled

435
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,000
The global economic expansion since 92

436
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,120
Because when the soviet system collapsed their energy production did not and all of their commodities were just dumped on the international market

437
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,920
And that has kept prices relatively low for 35 years

438
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,760
That period is now closing and so we're going to lose

439
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,400
Five percent of global crude which doesn't sound like a big deal

440
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,520
Until you remember that energy demand is inelastic

441
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,960
And a five percent loss in crude can easily generate a tripling in price

442
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,160
So an energy induced depression that is broadly global in scope

443
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,920
Will start because of the ukraine war at some point

444
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,920
And this is probably the reason that no one's gone after that raft yet

445
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,640
Because that would be the death blow for the russian energy sector. So that would kind of be like have you seen a

446
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
Margin call the movie

447
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,400
Not recently now, but do you remember what it was about? Was it a 2008 financial crisis?

448
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,920
And it's it's semi-fictional and they bring everybody in overnight

449
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,240
And they say look if you decide to do this if you decide to dump all of everything into the market you are choosing to begin

450
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:55,200
The most armageddon like financial situation that anyone's ever seen. So that that's interesting

451
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,120
That for somebody to go and do that. They're aware that downstream

452
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,600
Five degrees of separation. There are a bunch of externalities that are basically going to ruin everyone the whole system. Yeah now

453
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
The math is going to be different for everybody

454
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,720
Like take take latvia latvia has the capacity to do this

455
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,320
All they have to do is grab one shuttle tanker as it's leaving st. Petersburg

456
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,160
That would do it and the latvians have already managed to wean themselves off of russian crude

457
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,880
And while it would crush most of the european partners

458
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,840
They would see the destruction of the primary income stream for russia as an unalloyed good

459
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,800
Or consider the americans. We're self-sufficient. We have the capacity of putting a wall around our energy exports

460
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,320
So they stay at home

461
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,400
So we could actually see energy prices in the us go down because of this

462
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,840
But then the rest of the world would lose access to russian and american crude at the same time

463
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,880
So everyone has their own math to run

464
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:57,840
And a lot of it is going to depend upon how everyone interprets the loyalty or the actions of their allies

465
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,400
So i mean look at germany the russians are in the process of jerking with the

466
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,200
Germans on natural gas and you know for those of us and the rest of the world like yeah natural gas

467
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,720
It's an energy source. Whatever. No biggie. That's not what it is in germany

468
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,400
The entire german economy is based on taking a cheap russian gas

469
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,360
Processing it to petrochemicals and then using those inputs in the entire manufacturing sector

470
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,280
If they lose that gas, it's not just that the electricity prices go off. It's that the german manufacturing model fails

471
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,960
So the germans are being presented with the choice

472
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,080
Leave the coalition

473
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
And keep the lights on

474
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,920
Or lose your gas and no longer be modern. So what's more important to the germans being western or being modern?

475
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
That's a that's a shit choice

476
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,640
But it has consequences and people will judge them down based on what they do

477
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,800
Peter you need to give me something positive here, man. I'm just i'm

478
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,560
Terrified this this doesn't sound like a very good situation

479
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,560
At all. What are the bright lights? What are some of the bright lights?

480
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,160
There are countries that were damaged by globalization

481
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,280
The empire specifically if you were a country that had a pretty good geography at the start of this

482
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,760
Then when the americans came through and changed the rules so that everyone can play you saw a massive drop in your overall power

483
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,040
If you are one of those countries

484
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,560
and

485
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,560
You have a positive demographic structure

486
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,600
You could actually make a lot of hay out of what's coming because you could I don't want to use the word imperial narrow imperial might be the right word

487
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,640
You can definitely make a bid for your own neighborhood

488
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,840
So the two countries that are on the top of my list is regards that are turkey and france

489
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,160
decent demographics good manufacturing base largely not integrated into their neighborhoods economically

490
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,760
The french actually trade less with the eu than the brits do

491
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,040
Fun fact

492
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,080
And I can see part of western europe becoming part of a french fife toman obviously parts of the middle east

493
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,240
For turkey. I would have put japan on that list

494
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,800
But the japanese managed to cut a deal with both donald trump and joe biden

495
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,040
Which makes the japanese the only people who have been able to get on with both sides of the american spectrum of elate

496
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,960
So I think they've basically agreed to partner up with the us rather than go the wrong way

497
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,560
Which I think will be the best for everyone in the long term unless you're chinese, of course

498
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
How's the uk gonna do?

499
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,920
That's up to you. Uh, you really need to figure out this brexit thing

500
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,960
I mean, it's just yes, you've left, but you still don't have any plan for what's next and that is really hurting you

501
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,480
Uh with every day that that is pushed off

502
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,480
Your negotiating power with whatever the structures of the future

503
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,960
End up looking like are going to be weaker and weaker

504
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:49,040
And you're very rapidly getting to the point where the only option you're going to have is a trade deal with the united states on america's terms

505
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840
There are worse things that could happen

506
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,920
but uh, we will be as um

507
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
It's best way to phrase this

508
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,640
We believe be as gentle in the negotiations as we were during the lend lease talks

509
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,080
Where you basically had to give up half of a hemisphere of military presence in exchange for 40

510
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,880
destroyers that you're used to laugh at because they were so bad

511
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,440
Not good it doesn't seem no, it's not a good negotiating position. That's for sure

512
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,800
Okay, you think that mexico is going to be a big part of america's future. Also, canada's good because it's able to

513
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,040
Yeah, uh, because it's able to do good immigration. It's able to keep its demographics pretty well

514
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,680
What's the future for america look like in your opinion?

515
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,560
Well, the united states is starting this process with very little trade exposure to the wider world outside of

516
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,440
manufacturing in asia, uh, a net energy exporter of all forms

517
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,920
A the largest refining power in the world the largest agricultural power in the world

518
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,400
So a lot of the things that every single country in the world is just going to have to stress about us

519
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,600
It's just kind of a no brainer. It's already there. Uh, in addition

520
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
successful manufacturing requires

521
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,920
proximate

522
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:02,000
Labor that is at different skill sets and price points. So the person who's doing the injection molding is not the

523
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Same guy who's making the microchip

524
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
With mexico, we've got that already

525
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,680
So for us a lot of the hard work has already been done

526
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:15,840
And while i'm not a huge fan of donald trump by any measure his renegotiation of nafta was a stroke of genius

527
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And it got ahead of a lot of these issues

528
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,560
um

529
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,200
Because of that north america's a unit looks pretty strong and we're already seeing

530
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:33,280
Established linkages to other powers that might be useful. So we for example already have free trade deals with columbian chile

531
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,800
Which are in my opinion the two most dynamic south american economies

532
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,280
We already have a long-term agreement with both the koreans and the japanese

533
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:47,360
The australians have a free trade deal with the united states and we're in league with the australians and the japanese

534
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,840
Really starting to become engaged with southeast asia, which is another part of the world where the demographics and the geography line up

535
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
so that kind of

536
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,760
greater american co-prosperity sphere

537
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,720
Is about as good as it's going to get

538
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,480
I mean, you'll have to deal with the americans when you tend to be a little twitchy sometimes

539
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,000
But we're twitchy in a different hemisphere for most of the partners, which most people really like

540
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,520
In your neck of the woods, france is just going to be completely insufferable

541
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,040
Because they're going to become the broker for the germans

542
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,320
They're going to become the the first power in iberia and in italy

543
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,120
And they're probably going to make a bid for the low countries too

544
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,600
And the longer it takes the uk to become a self-sustaining power again

545
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,360
The more advantage the french are going to have in rewriting the local rules

546
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:41,280
So a good example is that, you know, you've you've built these two super carriers. They're top-notch pieces of equipment

547
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,400
But between budget cuts and austerity and the financial crisis

548
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,880
You let the rest of your navy die

549
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,640
So you've got these two fantastic vessels with no defensive rings

550
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,960
Which means the only way that you would ever let them leave port is if they're sailing as part of an american battle group

551
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,080
Again, not a good negotiating position

552
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,320
What ways could america mess this up? Oh, so many so many

553
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,360
We're in one of our once in every generation or two politically shufflings and as long as that is going on

554
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,360
We really don't have eyes for the rest of the world

555
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,760
So there's a huge strategic and economic opportunity here for the long run if the united states would chose to leave and kind of

556
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
Define what the new world was going to be

557
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,160
What i've outlined here is probably what's going to happen on autopilot and in many cases because the australians

558
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,720
And the canadians and the japanese are doing most of the diplomatic heavy lifting. Thank god. They're there because it would be a mess otherwise

559
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,000
One of the great things to keep in mind about the united states

560
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,920
Is because the population is so big and so young and because the land area is so huge and so fertile

561
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,640
We've never had to be at the top of our game

562
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,520
We can rely on geography and demography to do most of the heavy lifting for us

563
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,800
And that allows our politics to be completely batshit

564
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,640
And that's where we are now there are many degrees of freedom that you can mess up within yes

565
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,960
This this isn't france where if you screw up you have to pay for it for two generations

566
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,160
If the us population is big and young

567
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,360
Does that not mean that downstream from that you need to have an even bigger younger

568
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:27,760
population in order to not end up with that inverted pyramid shape on your

569
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,120
Demographics it's definitely possible um our our

570
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:38,720
What while most of europe and japan and korea have that v shape in their demographics ours is more of a double hour glass

571
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,680
because we've got a bulge where the boomers are and then a bulge where the

572
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,640
Millennials are but then a big cut out for gen x and a big cut out for the zoomers

573
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,000
The ins and outs of that are going to dominate our economic and our financial world for forever

574
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,680
So right now we're about to go through a capital crunch

575
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,720
In 15 years when the millennials are in their 50s, we will be going through a capital boom

576
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,960
As a rule large generations make large generations and small generations make small generations

577
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,960
So we would expect this

578
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,960
wave to continue

579
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,880
What that means is that the american propensity for

580
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
Overdoing things and then over correcting

581
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,880
That's just part of our dna now and it's backed up by our demographics. That will take us

582
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,720
All number of bizarre directions and we will drag along a lot of other countries with for the ride

583
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,800
I was with jonathan height a few months ago. It's the heterodox academy conference and he was talking about the

584
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:43,680
dangers in the dating market for gen z at the moment the high levels of social anxiety the fact that you've got

585
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,920
One third of people aged 18 to 35 is still living at home with their parents the number of 18 to 30 year olds

586
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,080
Reporting no sex is tripled in the last 10 years from about 10 to 30 percent

587
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,840
A bunch of things that are causing young people to be less socially out there

588
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,760
Presumably to have children later. I think it's 2019 that for the first time ever more women had children over the age of 40

589
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,200
Than under the age of 20 for the first time ever in history more women at the age of 30 were childless

590
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,720
Rather than with child. So all of these things

591
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,520
seem

592
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,400
Like they would predict a ever aging gen generation or an ever-ranging demographic

593
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,960
What your suggestion is that you have this sort of hourglass shape and there will be some sort of inflection point presumably with the

594
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,600
15 year capital boom

595
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,280
Probably that would should hopefully encourage

596
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,080
More families more children more population

597
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:45,360
Offset this going from an hourglass into a inverted pyramid. That's what the data we have today suggests

598
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,320
But I've got to underline. We're in uncharted territory here

599
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,800
The world has never had a population bust without having some sort of massive endemic disease or war event

600
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,640
So when I say, you know, the chinese collapse has to happen

601
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:04,640
You know, I don't know how you make it work without kids or young adults when I say that the americans are going to experience a

602
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,160
Another baby boom as the millennials really come into their own

603
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,840
History and data suggests that but we've really never seen this combination of factors before

604
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,360
The zoomers

605
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,280
I have concerns

606
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:24,000
They are not like millennials. Millennials are very outgoing. They're very social

607
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,480
Because they were raised by the baby boomers and they were always told that they were special

608
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,480
That's one of the reasons why a third of them still live at home

609
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,440
The zoomers were grazed by gen X my generation

610
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,680
And we took a very different view of things, you know, we kept track of the score at the soccer game

611
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,560
We wrote it down. We showed it to him before each game

612
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,000
We read it to him to bed so that they wouldn't forget and when they turn 18, they're the hell out of the house

613
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,240
Uh, they're they're insular. They're competitive

614
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,640
They don't like relying on anyone for anything

615
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,720
And so the whole group dynamics and managerial dynamics that the millennials are positively known for and recognized for

616
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,240
They're the antithesis their dream job is to code alone in the dark in a closet

617
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,600
And that makes it hard to have kids

618
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,200
So I think we can guarantee that when it's the zoomers time when they're in their 30s

619
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,360
That their birth rates are going to be low their marriage rates are probably going to be the worst we've ever had

620
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,320
Their suicide rates are already the worst we've ever had

621
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,960
Which just means that the millennials will save us all

622
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,520
Okay, right. You're relying on you're relying on me and my heart fantastic

623
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,960
Given given the current state and obviously there's lots of

624
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:45,440
Contributing different countries. What's going on with demographics people talk about a population collapse overall globally

625
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,240
What is your view of global population?

626
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,560
uh

627
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:56,400
Before we start talking about de-globalization so assuming that globalization continues from its height onward

628
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,560
We were already in the process of revising down our estimates

629
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:06,400
So it used to be 15 years ago that we thought by 2050 we were going to have 11 to 12 billion people

630
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,760
That number is now under 10 and as the data continues to get upgraded will probably

631
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,240
Assuming nothing goes wrong peak at just below nine and then start falling back gently

632
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,520
If i'm right about de-globalization

633
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,200
We're going to have a significantly sharper drop-off and as soon as globalization hits agriculture at large

634
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,280
Which may be in the fourth quarter of this year

635
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,400
population peaks

636
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,400
Wow, okay positive stuff

637
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,680
Looking at the ways in which

638
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,640
Population collapse and the reduction of that could be tied in with automation

639
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:54,320
Is there any technological savior that can come through and assist us with the problems that we're facing at the moment?

640
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,760
There's always unknown unknowns when it comes to technology. I'm aware of that, but

641
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:05,760
Are there things that you can foresee if we get particular advancements that may alleviate some of this absolutely so pros and cons

642
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,280
Uh, there are a lot of technologies with automation AI and robotics that look really good now

643
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,080
AI the whole idea of general AI and skynet

644
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,520
Decades away from that. So I was put that in a box. I'll let Ian must talk about that

645
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,280
AI is all about image recognition today

646
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,720
And getting it so that machines can recognize different things and then

647
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,080
Do pre-program tasks? There's no there's no real autonomy, but it's automated

648
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,960
That allows manufacturing to reshape, but it also requires massive economies of scale

649
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,000
The most expensive thing a country can do isn't industrialize. It's to automate

650
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,960
And it's not a one-off cost

651
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,240
You have to constantly update it because every time there's a change to the production line

652
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,440
You more or less have to start over with the programming. So it's a very expensive way to go

653
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,640
It does use different labor and less labor

654
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,240
But it's not clear to me that it really moves the needle in a huge way

655
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,800
And if we're breaking down

656
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:11,600
global transport and intermediate goods trade, then we're losing the economies of scale that make that model work

657
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,000
In north america where you've got one third of global consumption

658
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,960
We'll probably still be doing that, but I see that broadly leaving the east asian sphere

659
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,080
Which combined with their bad demographics are awful

660
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,920
We also have the baby boomers leaving so that we know that the capital crunch is coming

661
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,960
That means less money is available to do this sort of upgrading

662
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:37,840
The technology I was most interested in are the combination of automation and agriculture

663
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,040
We're very close to having facilities that you can latch on to a tractor

664
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,240
That identify each individual plant

665
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,840
And identify if it needs water or fertilizer or pesticide or if it's a weed or whatever

666
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,840
And then it gets a squirt of whatever is appropriate

667
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:59,120
So you do like six passes of stuff in one pass and each plant gets individual attention

668
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,000
That suggests that we would be able to reduce fertilizer and pesticide use by 80 percent

669
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,960
And maybe even double yields

670
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,840
But again economies of scale

671
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,960
It only works on mega farms where you can afford the equipment cost

672
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:23,360
So if you've got giant farms in the united states or the netherlands or argentina or australia

673
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,600
Sure

674
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,600
Doesn't work for most of the world

675
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:35,280
Talking about technology. I've heard that we are unbelievably reliant on getting cheap technological parts out of china

676
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,920
Silicon chips and other such stuff

677
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:44,080
How much of an issue is it going to be if china is facing demographic collapse and then can't make anything anymore?

678
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,360
How much is that going to have downstream effects for the rest of the world's technology?

679
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,120
Well, we've been a little bit lucky that the chinese have kind of become a bag of dicks and really

680
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,920
Encouraged everyone to outsource and resource everything that they can

681
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,800
It's that's bought us a lot of time

682
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,440
Now in the united states everyone is paranoid about

683
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:10,080
Semiconductors and we all see that 12 percent number that the us now only produces 12 percent of global chips as a panic point

684
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,480
But that's by number

685
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,200
By value we produce 60 percent

686
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,600
So all the chips are designed in japan and the united states

687
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,560
They might be manufactured somewhere else if they're further down the the scale

688
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,520
But in terms of cell phones and server farms the important stuff that that's already safe

689
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,800
The problem is going to be the mid and the lower land the mid ones are usually malaysian thailand the lower ones are almost certainly china

690
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,480
So when you're talking about the lower tech stuff the internet of things

691
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,240
Yeah, that's just going away

692
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:52,320
But i'd argue that i don't really need a meat thermometer that is going to tell my phone what the temperature of the meat is

693
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,040
I mean we can get by without that. I think

694
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,040
It's overall electronics manufacturer. That's going to be the big issue

695
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,960
As remember differentiated labor forces is what makes manufacturing work

696
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,720
China is a huge place

697
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:10,400
It's got a lot of that internally and then it has access immediately to taiwan japan korea and southeast asia

698
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,440
That's what's breaking down that whole ecosystem

699
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,840
Uh, we can't rebuild all of that. I mean just just to serve

700
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,440
Electronics needs for north america probably would require a workforce of four million people in manufacturing

701
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,920
We're already in labor shortage

702
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,240
And the mexicans are kind of tapped out already. So there is going to be a huge amount of pressure

703
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,360
americans do well at the really high-end manufacturing

704
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,400
And the very low end because we're energy rich

705
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,200
It's the part in the middle that we're really reliant on the mexicans to save us for

706
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,080
What ways could you be wrong about all of this stuff?

707
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,960
You know, like I said, this is perspective. We're dealing with an environment that we've never been in before

708
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,960
uh

709
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,960
The way I would like to be wrong

710
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,560
Is that the americans would actually do what george herbert walker bush wanted to do back in 1991?

711
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:04,480
And have a conversation with ourselves about what sort of world we wanted to live in and how to get there

712
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,280
We weren't interested then I would argue that we're really not interested now

713
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,760
So the risk here from my point of view is that globalization does manage to persist because of some

714
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,160
Green american commitment

715
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:24,320
I'm not seeing that. I'm certainly not seeing that with the ukraine war. Yes. We're seeing nato having a new lease on life

716
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,120
But the whole guns for butter deal that we made during the cold war

717
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:36,640
None of the economic stuff is on the agenda all the sanctions that the trump administration enacted are still there with one exception

718
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,640
that the airbus case

719
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,920
uh

720
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,160
I don't see it's very likely and then on the demographic front

721
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,280
That's just math if you want more 30 years 30 year olds. You had to start 31 years ago

722
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,560
What difference would it make if china invaded taiwan?

723
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,080
Uh, that would probably lead to the end of the chinese system as an industrialized economy in less than a year

724
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,720
Um, why that's fascinating

725
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,320
It's an open question of whether or not the chinese could pull it off

726
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,960
And with the ukraine war, we finally got some good signposts of what it might look like

727
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,440
The chinese have always assumed

728
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,840
That the war would be a walkover

729
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:19,360
That no one else will get involved and that china is such a big place that everyone will just suck it up and move on

730
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:27,120
Well, that clearly hasn't happened with ukraine and the united states and the west have a much tighter relationship with taiwan than they do with ukraine

731
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,160
ukraine was only preparing for this war for eight years taiwan has been preparing for 60

732
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,400
Uh ukraine can you can walk to ukraine from russia? It's a bit of a swim to get to taiwan

733
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:45,040
The sanctions that are in place against russia would absolutely devastate china because well russia has a lot of faults

734
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,120
It's a major exporter of food and energy

735
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,520
china imports those things

736
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,880
75 percent of their oil is imported from a different continent

737
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,160
Uh, and 75 percent of the oil is imported

738
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:03,760
And then i think it's really the boycotts that have really scared the chinese the most

739
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,080
The idea that individual citizens might have any say on policy

740
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,200
They had they did not see that coming. They have no way to process that in a one-man state

741
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,960
Because it's so different to the setup that they have. Yeah, exactly

742
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,760
So every assumption that they've based the last 40 years of military planning on is proven to be wrong

743
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,280
And then of course there's the question of whether they could actually do it

744
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,880
If they did a slow-motion mobilization like the russians did took three months

745
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,280
The taiwanese would see that

746
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,520
they built a few nukes and so

747
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,600
The cost of capturing taiwan would be losing shanghai and beijing

748
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,920
That doesn't seem like a good plan

749
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:49,040
So the only battle plan that i've seen that might work is if they just text every member of the army and say go to a port

750
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,040
Get on a fishing boat and sail

751
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,400
You'd lose a million people in the crossing

752
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,520
Just to get to the beaches

753
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,760
So there's nothing about this that works

754
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,440
And if they did pull it off even if they do capture taiwan

755
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,920
They are now cut off from global manufacturing global investment global energy and global food

756
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,840
Truck stop running within a couple of months the lights go out in less than six and that is all she wrote

757
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,080
Remember agriculture is an industrial sector. So you're talking about mass famine in under a year

758
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,200
dude

759
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,080
Now normally i'd say the chinese aren't stupid they wouldn't do this

760
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,400
But it's a one-man show now

761
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,320
And nobody wants to bring ji any information because they don't know how he'll react

762
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:35,200
He's shot the messenger literally so many times that everything is a surprise to him

763
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yes, I understand what you mean

764
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,200
I suppose

765
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,840
There's a lot of criticisms around the fact that the vote of a stupid person is worth as much as the vote of a

766
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
While educated person in a democracy

767
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:49,280
But the problem is if you condense all of that

768
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,040
Power down to a single individual the decision of an angry or grumpy

769
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:00,960
Individual is the same as them on a good day or them if they were less idiotic or somebody else had got to power

770
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,280
So yeah, I suppose it's a

771
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:09,280
Forcing function that condenses all of these things down to one individual human that is just as fallible as the rest of

772
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,760
Maybe even more fallible human is perfect

773
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,040
Every time okay

774
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,080
But even a minor mistake just cascades through the system and it's a full cult of personality

775
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:25,360
So, you know, we've got basically people who are zealotously trying to do what they think ji wants them to do

776
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,360
And just one of the more inane ones is seeing teams of people in hazmat gear

777
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,920
disinfecting airport runways

778
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,240
Because they think that's what you have to do for covid

779
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:40,480
Just that people talk about the americans now in a fact-free zone. That's nothing compared to what's going on in the chinese system

780
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,840
Okay, so what do you think uh for most of the people that are listening to this uk us some in australia

781
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,600
What is life going to be like? What is the quality of life going to be like over the next 10 to 20 years?

782
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,040
What can people expect?

783
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:01,280
Well, the next five years are going to be rough. We basically in the west need to at least double the size of our industrial plant

784
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,200
Um, let me correct that in the west minus germany

785
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,760
Germany is its own special case

786
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,520
Everyone else has largely hollowed out their manufacturing as part of globalization

787
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,680
We focus on the really high end stuff in the design

788
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,600
But a lot of the middle and the lower stuff is now done in other countries. That's got to change

789
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:23,040
If you are part of a network where you can access lower skilled labor like the americans are with the mexicans

790
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,080
Great, if you're not you either need to attach yourself to another system

791
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,600
Or find some way to go without

792
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:37,120
Now if you are in that kind of friends and family network of the americans

793
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,440
energy is covered

794
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,720
Food is covered

795
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,720
Investment will be tight but available

796
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,160
And there's a degree of security that you won't have in the rest of the world

797
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,120
So the biggest problem is going to be building out that industrial plant

798
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:57,040
That means we should expect inflation in the us of maybe nine to 15 percent for the next five or six years

799
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,920
Is that's what it's going to take to get through this?

800
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,080
And if we do succeed at building that industrial plant over that time frame

801
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,160
Then that inflation rate will come down and we'll have supply chains that are shorter

802
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,680
simpler

803
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,040
Cheaper and closer to the end consumer so better all around

804
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,680
So if you're part of that network

805
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,120
And you can get through over that hump it looks pretty good

806
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,240
If you decide to go your own way

807
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,800
Things are going to get a lot tougher

808
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:30,160
Unless you are one of those regional powers who actually has the geography and demography to make it work

809
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,160
France

810
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,040
After the financial collapse of say the euro might not notice the rest of the world going to hell

811
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,320
Uh, their manufacturing is already in place their energy system is fine. They've got oil just across the Mediterranean

812
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,240
They're going to have subsidiary economies in spain in italy. It's a fairly good setup

813
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,560
That means that cost of living is going to increase that means cost of energy is going to increase quality of life going to go down

814
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,760
I mean, are we going to see civil strife in your opinion? What's going to go on?

815
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,080
I think we'll see a lot of governments collapse

816
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,240
But again, it depends upon where you are

817
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:07,920
The americans will always complain more than what the problem is worth

818
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,800
Uh, and the fact that we're going through our political transition at the same time we're doing this is, you know

819
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,960
Awkward to say the least

820
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:20,240
We're going to blame a lot of things on a lot of things that have no direct connection. That's very american

821
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,560
Uh, if you're talking about britain, that's up to you guys

822
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:30,000
Because like, you know, if you can figure this out and figure out a relationship with the united states or the french

823
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,440
Before the break that would be your best bet

824
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:39,280
Is that because after the break bargaining power goes through the floor? Yeah, exactly

825
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:44,640
Now is the time to cut a deal. You've just had a change in government. The ukraine war is hot and heavy

826
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,920
If you were going to have a lead or take the country in a more sustainable direction now is the time

827
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:54,560
If people want to keep up to date with the stuff that you're doing with the work with

828
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,240
Keeping themselves abreast of all of everything that's happening at the moment. Where should they go?

829
