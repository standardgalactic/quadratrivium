WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
What do you make of the last few months of fallout from Yale and Harvard and such?

00:04.880 --> 00:11.600
I mean, yeah, we saw that big testimonial from the presidents. Yeah, it was Harvard, MIT, Penn.

00:13.120 --> 00:16.640
I mean, I wasn't surprised by it. I mean, a lot of people, I think, are finally fully

00:16.640 --> 00:19.360
realizing they're coming to their senses. People have been saying this for a while now.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.640
Oh, you know, eventually the pendulum will swing back and people will finally figure out what's

00:24.640 --> 00:29.760
really going on in these institutions and this sort of ideology that's been spilling out of the

00:29.840 --> 00:35.280
universities. And now I think they finally are actually truly realizing it. But yeah, I saw the

00:35.840 --> 00:41.200
it's kind of the birth of what a lot of people call wokeness in 2015 when I arrived on campus at

00:41.200 --> 00:46.400
Yale. And that was my first semester. I saw what was happening there. And yeah, I mean,

00:46.400 --> 00:51.200
I think you can draw a straight line from some of those events in 2015 to what we're seeing now.

00:51.200 --> 00:56.080
And yeah, it's been really ugly, but, you know, kind of kind of amusing, you know, from my perspective,

00:56.080 --> 00:59.360
because I, you know, I was one of the, I'd like to think that I was one of the sort of

00:59.920 --> 01:04.640
early observers and people who could recognize what was occurring. And then later on, you know,

01:04.640 --> 01:10.320
so Jordan Peterson was another and there have been other critics of higher ed and especially

01:10.320 --> 01:16.960
these elite universities. But yeah, it's been really, really amusing and also sort of disheartening

01:17.760 --> 01:27.040
It's this sort of odd blend of fatalism, shard and Freud, nihilism, sort of pleasure,

01:27.040 --> 01:33.040
displeasure, like, ick, pity. It's a real concatenation of things. And obviously,

01:33.040 --> 01:37.920
we've got a couple of mutual friends that have either been directly or tangentially involved,

01:37.920 --> 01:42.640
Vincent, our mutual friend, I managed to get removed from a higher education institution

01:43.280 --> 01:48.080
because of him appearing on this podcast, Carol Hoeven, who is, you know, a really good

01:48.080 --> 01:53.280
mutual friend, has kind of been thrust into the middle of this. She told me that she basically

01:53.280 --> 01:58.880
felt like she'd been used like a football. And for the people who know who Carol is,

01:58.880 --> 02:03.280
she went on Rogan, I think she cried like six times on Joe's show, she cried at least three

02:03.280 --> 02:07.280
times on mine. We went for breakfast, I'm pretty sure she cried like three times at breakfast.

02:07.360 --> 02:12.720
She's just a very sort of emotional person. She is, she's really sort of feeling this.

02:13.600 --> 02:22.320
Yeah, you realize in a sort of proxy fucking battle like this, the people that are useful

02:22.320 --> 02:26.240
political footballs to be kicked around often end up paying a pretty high price and no one ever

02:26.240 --> 02:30.400
thinks about them because you're like, oh, no, but you're, you know, you're a flaming warrior

02:30.400 --> 02:34.160
for free speech or whatever. And you go, well, yeah, but I didn't ask to be.

02:34.240 --> 02:39.280
Yeah, very few people want to be fired. I mean, a lot of people may not be familiar with just

02:39.280 --> 02:43.760
how difficult it is to get an academic job in the first place. I mean, I'm friends with Vincent,

02:43.760 --> 02:49.840
I saw, I mean, he was hustling hard. And he had a very impressive academic record. And no one

02:49.840 --> 02:54.880
wants to be in that position. I think their critics or their detractors say, like, oh,

02:54.880 --> 02:59.040
you know, oh, pour me with your cancel culture. And now look at you going on all these podcasts

02:59.040 --> 03:03.200
and playing up your victimhood and all of this. But that's not what it is. I think it's, for some

03:03.280 --> 03:06.640
people, it's just a consolation that while I lost my dream job, at the very least, I can sort of

03:06.640 --> 03:11.680
communicate. Let me salvage fucking something. Exactly. And yeah, I was observing all of this

03:11.680 --> 03:16.880
from afar. I mean, one thing that I've pointed out before is that for every, like public academic

03:16.880 --> 03:22.720
cancellation you see, there are probably five to 10 others that are not covered in the media.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.560
Most people actually don't enjoy the limelight that much, especially academics who tend to be

03:26.560 --> 03:29.760
kind of weird nerds with their obscure niche interests, they just want to keep their head

03:29.840 --> 03:34.720
down, do their research, be left alone. And then suddenly they are accused of X, Y, or Z,

03:34.720 --> 03:40.400
and they just want to silently, you know, have it blow over. And that's like the sort of modal

03:40.400 --> 03:47.600
case, that's the usual case. And so yeah, it's been, we can see it now that finally people

03:47.600 --> 03:51.680
are recognizing that there's a there's a serious issue. I didn't even want to an academic job.

03:51.680 --> 03:57.360
I mean, by the time I was probably about halfway through my PhD, I saw what was happening.

03:57.360 --> 04:03.600
I remember, yeah, I would have very contentious discussions with other PhD students and postdocs

04:03.600 --> 04:08.480
and kind of early career researchers. And I would tell them like, I don't think that, you know,

04:08.480 --> 04:13.840
if you color outside the lines, if you are an independent thinker, it will be very difficult

04:13.840 --> 04:20.560
for you to get a sort of typical tenure track academic job now, not impossible, but just much

04:20.560 --> 04:25.040
harder than it would have been maybe 10 or 15 years ago. And people say, Oh, no, that's ridiculous.

04:25.040 --> 04:29.440
It's ridiculous. And now, you know, four, four plus years later, I'm seeing like some of those

04:29.440 --> 04:34.160
friends are having difficulty, some of them have been hired and fired by now. I mean, it's been,

04:34.160 --> 04:37.920
you know, I've seen the whole the whole spectrum of outcomes, some of them have successfully obtained

04:37.920 --> 04:42.640
jobs and just, you know, keep their mouth shut. But for me, I just, that wasn't what I thought

04:42.640 --> 04:48.240
academia was going to be like. I thought it was going to be, you know, this little kind of contained

04:48.240 --> 04:52.080
a bubble, you know, the, I guess some people call it the ivory tower, right, where you can live that

04:52.080 --> 04:58.720
life of the mind and communicate interesting ideas and debate and disagree, but still sort of

04:58.720 --> 05:01.760
inch your way towards the truth, or at least inch your way, inch your way towards interesting

05:01.760 --> 05:06.720
ideas. But, you know, that's interestingly happening more on places like podcasts and

05:06.720 --> 05:12.480
sub-stack and alternate sort of parallel institutions. Yeah, it's fascinating to think

05:13.120 --> 05:18.000
as well about, I guess, soft cancellations. I had Ricky Schlott on who co-authored the

05:18.080 --> 05:23.600
Canceling of the American Mind with Greg Lukyanov. And she was talking about all of the different

05:23.600 --> 05:31.120
ways that people kind of get soft cancelled. And it's just not being invited to the end of your

05:31.120 --> 05:36.480
party, you know, it's people sitting in different locations to you. I think she went to maybe NYU

05:36.480 --> 05:42.960
Stern. And she was hiding Jordan Peterson books under her bed, you know, like fucking Anne Frank

05:43.040 --> 05:48.880
in the attic, that philosophical Anne Frank. And she was saying that, you know, there's lots of

05:49.760 --> 05:53.280
sort of ideological shit tests, she called them, which I thought was a really great name.

05:54.080 --> 05:58.960
You know, what do you think about Ben Shapiro? You know, just like fucking throw that hand

05:58.960 --> 06:03.520
grenade into the room and see if anyone pipes up. Or it doesn't pipe up. That was something

06:03.520 --> 06:06.720
that I learned when I was in grad school was does anyone just remain silent and not say,

06:06.720 --> 06:10.320
oh, he's so, he's an evil right wing, whatever, right? If they just kind of keep their head down

06:10.320 --> 06:13.360
and don't say anything, you know, I sort of, oh, I observed that.

06:13.360 --> 06:18.320
Silence is compliance or whatever. Silence is violence or whatever it is.

06:18.320 --> 06:22.000
What about the, you had this interesting idea about the hidden hierarchies

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
of the Harvard extension school thing. Yeah, well, I saw that with, you know, I was, you know,

06:28.000 --> 06:34.560
observing what was occurring on Twitter slash X with Christopher Rufo, who was one of the

06:34.560 --> 06:42.240
sort of architects of pointing out and removing the Harvard professor after her comments about,

06:43.040 --> 06:48.080
you know, kind of condoning antisemitism on campus and then discovering her plagiarism and all of

06:48.080 --> 06:54.080
this. But, you know, after he, you know, he was perceived to be successful, I mean, she was,

06:54.080 --> 06:59.840
she was ousted, she was pressured to resign and she did all of these professors at elite universities

06:59.840 --> 07:04.960
and all of these, you know, this, you know, university supporting members of the chattering

07:04.960 --> 07:10.400
class were saying, oh, Christopher Rufo got a degree from the Harvard extension school. And,

07:10.400 --> 07:15.360
you know, are people aware that that's not the real Harvard and people, do people understand that

07:15.360 --> 07:21.360
that's not typically what we think of as a real graduate studies degree at a master,

07:21.360 --> 07:26.720
it's not a real master's degree from Harvard. And they just wanted people to be very aware that this,

07:27.280 --> 07:31.200
you know, this sort of outsider, this pleb who got this degree from this

07:31.200 --> 07:35.520
extension school, he's not a real academic, he's not a real serious thinker. Yeah, he's written

07:35.520 --> 07:40.080
books. Yes, he works at a very prominent think tank. And yes, he's like very successful in the real

07:40.080 --> 07:44.320
world, but he has his degree, which is sort of getting things backwards, right? You want the degree

07:46.080 --> 07:49.200
in order to signify that you're capable in the real world. But, you know, they have the, oh,

07:49.200 --> 07:54.080
this guy's capable in the real world, but now they're looking at the degree as if it's somehow,

07:54.080 --> 07:58.400
it's fraudulent and therefore this nullifies all of his accomplishments. That's indicative of his

07:58.400 --> 08:03.760
real value. Exactly. Yeah, they're placing his value on the educational credential rather than

08:04.400 --> 08:09.680
on his effectiveness in his life and in his career. So, you know, I'm watching this and I'm

08:09.680 --> 08:14.720
thinking like, yeah, this is exactly, I mean, I've seen this, you know, since entering college,

08:14.720 --> 08:20.240
since entering higher ed, this strange status anxiety, particularly among people who attend

08:20.240 --> 08:23.920
these kind of institutions. I mean, the people who are pointing this out about Rufo's degree

08:23.920 --> 08:28.480
were professors or graduates of whatever, Harvard or Oberlin or Stanford, whatever.

08:28.480 --> 08:32.240
Look at these kinds of places. People that knew the language, they understood what an

08:32.240 --> 08:37.520
extension school was. Yes, exactly. And it's just amazing to me that Harvard even has

08:37.520 --> 08:41.520
this program in the first place because it relies on that duplicitous game of,

08:42.880 --> 08:47.360
you know, if you're a member of the unwashed masses and you go to the Harvard Extension

08:47.360 --> 08:51.200
School website, it actually says, we are Harvard, you will have the Harvard degree,

08:51.200 --> 08:54.640
you can put it, it even says something like you'll have the, you know, you'll be able to put

08:54.640 --> 09:00.240
Harvard on your resume. This is on the official website. While simultaneously communicating

09:00.240 --> 09:04.160
the coded message to everyone else at Harvard and everyone else in this sort of rarefied segment of

09:04.160 --> 09:07.600
society that, you know, we have to do that, you know, we have to put that on the website,

09:07.600 --> 09:10.720
but it's not really Harvard. You're not on the main stage, you're kind of on the second stage

09:10.720 --> 09:14.480
in the festival. It's like the overflow room. Why would, like, it's just, it shocks me that

09:14.480 --> 09:19.680
they're willing to take the reputational hit to operate a degree mill. I mean, to me, it's just

09:19.680 --> 09:23.360
very, like, tawdry. Like, it's almost like, you know, I have this, maybe this judgmental attitude

09:23.360 --> 09:26.880
about, like, this is, like, very kind of vulgar that you guys would even do this in the first place

09:26.880 --> 09:31.200
that you're playing this game. And yeah, I thought it was very, yeah, very ugly the way that they were,

09:31.200 --> 09:35.760
they were pointing this out about Rufo. And it also ended up backfiring, I think, because

09:36.880 --> 09:42.880
they felt this sort of, this faction of cultural elites and these legacy institutions felt threatened.

09:42.880 --> 09:47.680
They felt like they had received an L. And so they had to lash out and get back at him.

09:47.680 --> 09:53.600
Well, it's the same as, you know, someone does something to you, a really cutting jibe. And

09:53.600 --> 10:00.160
you're like, shit shoes. Like, it's just, you know, it's the only thing that you're like,

10:00.160 --> 10:03.600
fucking just grappling at something. I remember once there was this guy, it's so funny,

10:03.600 --> 10:07.520
there was this dude stood in the front door of a nightclub complaining about the fact that he

10:07.520 --> 10:12.880
couldn't get in. And he just kept on chirping and kept on chirping and kept on chirping. And I

10:12.880 --> 10:16.560
was feeling particularly pissy that day or whatever. So I said something back to him.

10:16.560 --> 10:22.160
And I've got like two or three, six foot four Geordie guerrillas either side of me that are

10:22.160 --> 10:27.200
working. And I'm busy trying to organize clipboard to something else. And he couldn't think of anything

10:27.200 --> 10:31.760
to do. So I had a necklace on of some kind, like on the outside of a t-shirt, and he sort of reached

10:31.760 --> 10:36.320
forward and like, grab, grab that. And like, that was the one thing. And then sort of scuttled

10:36.320 --> 10:44.160
off. And I was like, like my 35 pounds, like fashion net necklace isn't a big deal. But just

10:44.160 --> 10:47.200
that that's the one thing. And it's kind of the same as Christopher Rufo's like,

10:51.520 --> 10:54.640
extension school, like it's not, you're not part of the real chattering classes.

10:54.640 --> 11:00.000
Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, it was very like short-sighted. And, and ultimately, I think it was

11:00.000 --> 11:05.280
damaging to them. Oh, anyone else that's got that degree, always thinking about going to that place

11:05.280 --> 11:09.040
is like, Oh, well, they said that ultimately, when the rubber meets the road, Chris Rufo's

11:09.040 --> 11:14.000
like just one of the fucking, like peasants, the same as the rest of us. So maybe I shouldn't

11:14.560 --> 11:18.720
think about, Oh, that's interesting. So you're saying that, that anyone who might want to apply

11:18.720 --> 11:22.960
for the Harvard extension school will see that. And so they'll have fewer applicants, you know,

11:22.960 --> 11:27.440
the institution will ultimately be less profitable. I didn't even think about that part.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.560
Definitely less prestigious. I was, I was thinking more on the reputation end of it rather than the

11:30.560 --> 11:35.120
sort of economic end. But yeah, this, this idea that, that people will observe, I mean,

11:36.000 --> 11:39.920
I thought it was an error for two reasons. One was that it was most people don't like snobs,

11:39.920 --> 11:43.280
right? So they see this and they just feel like icky about it, that they're even pointing this

11:43.280 --> 11:48.640
out in the first place, or that they think that they're somehow superior. They don't like that

11:48.640 --> 11:53.120
attitude. And then the second was that it, to me, it kind of exposed the, the hollowness

11:53.680 --> 12:00.080
of the egalitarian dogma, the supposed egalitarian dogma of elite academia that, you know, oh,

12:00.080 --> 12:06.000
we're all for equity and, you know, DEI or whatever it is that we're so accepting and tolerant and

12:06.000 --> 12:11.600
welcoming. But by the way, like, you know, your, your aristocratic title is fraudulent and you're

12:11.600 --> 12:16.320
a fake. And, you know, so, you know, I was texting a friend earlier about this. He's, he's actually

12:16.320 --> 12:20.160
a grad student at Harvard. And I was like, my impression of this was basically like,

12:20.160 --> 12:24.720
the attitude at elite universities is everyone is equal, but some people are less equal than others,

12:24.720 --> 12:29.280
right? It's a sort of a spin on, on the, the animal farm idea. We're all equal, but some people

12:29.280 --> 12:34.240
are more equal. You heard that George Orwell quote. You said how in The Road to Wigan,

12:34.240 --> 12:38.960
Pierre George Orwell is explaining how upper class snobs, while theoretically pining for a

12:39.040 --> 12:43.920
classless society cling like glue to their miserable fragments of social prestige.

12:43.920 --> 12:47.840
I love that. Yeah, I love that line. I mean, the whole, yeah, the book is great. Orwell was so

12:48.480 --> 12:54.240
astute in his analysis of class, but that was just, yeah, I mean, this has been going on for,

12:54.240 --> 12:58.560
you know, a hundred years now. And that was the first thing that came to mind when I was seeing

12:58.560 --> 13:04.080
this, that, you know, these, these supposedly open-minded, tolerant, welcoming people were

13:04.080 --> 13:08.560
suddenly pointing out that he got a degree from, from the institution, right? Like it's your website.

13:08.720 --> 13:13.280
You've got over the, you've got over the bar that everybody asked for, but you kind of landed in

13:13.280 --> 13:16.960
an awkward place on the crash mat. Yeah. You know, and yeah, you're so right. It's this,

13:17.920 --> 13:24.320
and this is why fundamentally, I think that people are so skeptical and critical of anyone who

13:25.040 --> 13:30.480
proselytises about their morality or how ethical or how caring they are publicly. You should go,

13:30.480 --> 13:35.120
what are you covering up for? I don't believe that you actually think that. And sure enough,

13:35.120 --> 13:39.840
when the gloves are off and you see someone in a little bit of pressure or receiving a little

13:39.840 --> 13:45.920
bit of heat, where did they go? Well, all of the inclusivity and egalitarianism and care for the

13:45.920 --> 13:50.800
beauty of academia overall, all of that's out the window. Yeah. Yeah. When the pressure is on,

13:50.800 --> 13:55.200
right? When people feel threatened, when they feel in a sense of sort of emotional intensity,

13:55.200 --> 13:58.880
a lot of negative emotion, suddenly, you know, the mask slips and you can see what they really

13:58.880 --> 14:06.320
like. Toys are out of the pram. They're just as, and, you know, this is the concern that people

14:06.320 --> 14:11.040
had all along. Yeah. It's like, oh, that's what we thought you were like. We thought that you were

14:12.160 --> 14:19.040
highfalutin, not actually caring, adrenicone drinking, long hooded nose, pentagram dancing,

14:19.040 --> 14:23.280
like dickheads. Yeah. And sure enough, your, your mask has slipped. So I mean, this,

14:24.160 --> 14:26.720
you've got your brand new book out, which everyone can go and buy right now,

14:26.720 --> 14:32.080
as you're going by this very second. We haven't ever spoken about this because pretty much since

14:32.080 --> 14:36.400
I've known you at some point, you've been working on your memoir, Troubled. Yeah.

14:37.040 --> 14:43.760
Luxury beliefs. Yeah. That is a kind of example of luxury belief, although it's not patient zero.

14:43.760 --> 14:47.520
How do you explain to my audience that hasn't yet heard you talk about a

14:47.520 --> 14:51.680
topic that you've repopularized? How do you explain luxury beliefs?

14:51.760 --> 14:56.960
Right. Luxury beliefs are ideas and opinions that confer status on the affluent,

14:56.960 --> 15:02.800
while often inflicting costs on the lower classes. And a core component of a luxury belief is that

15:02.800 --> 15:08.720
the believer is often sheltered from the consequences of his or her belief. And, you know, we can get

15:08.720 --> 15:12.400
into specific examples. But yeah, I like this one that we've been sort of touching on this

15:12.400 --> 15:17.280
snobbish attitude about higher ed and how, yeah, so on the one hand, I mean, you're,

15:17.280 --> 15:20.640
when people are pointing out that this school or that school is better than the other,

15:21.840 --> 15:25.840
you are sort of boosting your own status, right? Especially these people who are

15:25.840 --> 15:29.280
already graduates of or teaching at these institutions, they're bolstering their own

15:29.280 --> 15:34.000
status. And then, you know, by speaking in this way about the hierarchies and,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.280
you know, which school is actually above which other school they are sort of

15:37.280 --> 15:40.560
inflicting costs on everyone else who would like to ascend the educational ladder,

15:40.560 --> 15:46.000
who would like to get a degree. But a lot of these people just don't interact much with people who

15:46.880 --> 15:50.880
are upwardly mobile or trying to be upwardly mobile, who are trying to go to university,

15:50.960 --> 15:55.600
trying to get a degree. The vast majority, and I talk about a lot of the statistics in

15:55.600 --> 16:01.360
my book about this in the later chapters, about how more than 80% of Ivy League graduates have

16:01.360 --> 16:05.040
at least one parent who went to university. I mean, that's, they're sort of a mercenaries from

16:05.040 --> 16:09.680
birth. They've never actually interacted with a person or had a 15 minute conversation with

16:09.680 --> 16:14.800
someone who doesn't have a degree or on their way to getting a degree. And it's just not on their

16:14.800 --> 16:19.760
radar. And so in their world, you know, everyone went to university or everyone should go or,

16:19.760 --> 16:23.440
you know, anyone who doesn't go to the same category of university that they went to,

16:23.440 --> 16:29.120
there's something wrong with them. And I noticed this a lot when I arrived on campus. I mean,

16:29.120 --> 16:34.000
and it's very subtle. I mean, at first, I was sort of, you know, to some degree, I think I was

16:34.000 --> 16:38.320
duped because I fell for the, oh, everyone's equal, everyone's fine, everyone. And, you know,

16:38.320 --> 16:42.880
also the other thing about these institutions now is that they don't, they don't look the same,

16:42.880 --> 16:48.400
right? One of the ideas about, or one of the components of the luxury belief idea is that

16:48.400 --> 16:53.840
luxury beliefs have to a large extent replaced luxury goods, which isn't to say that luxury

16:53.840 --> 16:58.240
goods don't still signify status, brand names and all of those things still matter. But my claim is

16:58.240 --> 17:03.840
that luxury goods have become a noisier signal of status. You can't tell right away necessarily

17:03.840 --> 17:08.320
anymore when you just go about your life in public, who's rich and who's poor just by how they look.

17:10.160 --> 17:14.560
And so, you know, I build on these sort of sociological frameworks in my writing and in my

17:14.640 --> 17:19.520
book, work from Thorsten Wablin at the turn of the 20th century, here with the theory of the

17:19.520 --> 17:24.400
leisure class, he wrote about how, you know, the upper class, the aristocrats of his time,

17:25.200 --> 17:30.240
they demonstrated their status through, you know, tuxedos and evening gowns and pocket watches and

17:30.240 --> 17:38.160
monocles and expensive and intricate hobbies and attending lavish events, hiring servants,

17:38.160 --> 17:43.360
those kinds of things. And then by the mid 20th century, there was a sociologist named Pierre

17:43.360 --> 17:47.280
Bourdieu who wrote a book called Distinction, a social critique of the judgment of taste.

17:48.080 --> 17:55.040
And one of his insights in that book was that rich people, affluent people, they'll convert their

17:55.040 --> 17:59.280
economic capital into cultural capital. And so they'll spend money in order to

17:59.840 --> 18:05.280
demonstrate their class or exhibit their membership to this rarefied strata of society.

18:05.280 --> 18:09.040
And so in his day, you know, again, in the mid 20th century, and he was mostly commenting on

18:09.040 --> 18:12.720
French culture, but people can sort of understand what, you know, what he's getting at, where people

18:12.800 --> 18:18.800
would spend money to learn about the subtleties of wine or the intricacies of art or

18:19.360 --> 18:24.160
falconry or something. Yeah, falconry or beagling or golf or these kinds of, you know,

18:24.160 --> 18:29.680
that you have to have money, you can't be the kind of person who works a manual job or who,

18:29.680 --> 18:36.000
you know, soft hands. You see the same thing in almost the reverse in Asian societies at the

18:36.000 --> 18:39.840
moment when I went to Thailand for the first time, all of the receptionists were wearing

18:39.920 --> 18:45.120
lighter makeup on their face. I thought to myself, why, because it's so silly because,

18:45.120 --> 18:49.440
you know, the face finishes on whatever the jawline here and, you know, the blending between

18:49.440 --> 18:54.240
the face and the neck is difficult to do. And I thought, why, and I asked someone, why the

18:54.240 --> 18:57.840
fuck are they, they're making their faces pale at this at all? Well, it's because the

18:57.840 --> 19:01.760
indigent laborers, the people that work out in the fields are heavily tanned. So the higher

19:01.760 --> 19:06.960
class jobs are the ones that are inside, which means that the paler you are, the more status

19:07.760 --> 19:13.120
you is conferred on you by your profession. But then I also realized how stupid of me

19:13.120 --> 19:18.960
and how, you know, myopically Western of me to do that, coming from Newcastle upon Tyne,

19:18.960 --> 19:24.960
the Jersey shore of the UK, where girls turn themselves orange to signify, I have all of

19:24.960 --> 19:29.280
this leisure time, I'm able to go away on holiday to exotic places and lay by the beach and get

19:29.280 --> 19:32.880
sun on me. I like that. Yeah, yeah, that's very interesting. Yeah, yeah. So if you,

19:33.600 --> 19:37.520
if you live in like Northern Europe or somewhere cold where there isn't a lot of sun,

19:37.520 --> 19:41.440
having a tan is the signifier status. So yeah, I think, yeah, that's, that's an important point

19:41.440 --> 19:45.680
here that, you know, it does vary from culture to culture. I mean, I point, you know, I point

19:45.680 --> 19:50.800
this out the research and everything in my writing about how status itself, the specific

19:50.800 --> 19:55.280
examples and manifestations can be ephemeral, they can be, they can vary by time and place and

19:55.280 --> 20:00.400
culture and generation and so on. But the desire for status, the desire to exhibit it to show other

20:00.400 --> 20:07.520
people how prestigious or how dominant or how, you know, how important you are that that remains.

20:07.520 --> 20:12.320
And so my, my claim is that luxury beliefs, I mean, they're mostly confined to that sort of

20:12.320 --> 20:16.240
highly educated people who attend all the universities, people who study there, people who

20:16.240 --> 20:25.280
are graduates of these places, who tend to operate legacy institutions who run media and,

20:25.280 --> 20:31.120
and academia and who generate knowledge, people who work in sort of culturally influential

20:32.000 --> 20:35.920
organizations. And a lot of them hold these luxury beliefs. I think we saw this

20:36.880 --> 20:41.520
in 2020 and 2021 with the Defund the Police movement. I mean, I coined the term luxury

20:41.520 --> 20:47.920
beliefs in 2019 and started to write about it and do the research to sort of support this idea

20:47.920 --> 20:54.880
and point everything out that sort of all of, all of the, the, the sociological concepts

20:54.880 --> 20:59.200
undergirding it. And then the, like six months later, people started talking about defunding

20:59.200 --> 21:04.000
the police. I was like, I don't even have to, I felt like I didn't even have to like, you know,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.720
here's the reasoning behind luxury beliefs is just defund the police. Like it's right there,

21:06.720 --> 21:10.320
you don't even have to. It's the most, whenever somebody brings up your work to me and talks

21:10.320 --> 21:16.720
about luxury beliefs, the patient zero example is defund the police. Yeah, because it's so

21:16.720 --> 21:22.160
intuitive. Of course. Can you explain why that encapsulates luxury beliefs? So structurally or

21:22.160 --> 21:27.360
functionally so well? Yeah, yeah. So, so, yeah, the luxury beliefs idea, if you say defund the

21:27.360 --> 21:31.760
police, you are increasing your own status because I mean, you look like a caring person,

21:31.760 --> 21:40.320
you look open-minded and interesting and, and, and highly educated. And so, and it also signifies

21:40.320 --> 21:43.120
that you're the kind of person who went to certain kinds of schools, you consume certain

21:43.120 --> 21:49.120
kinds of media, you listen to certain kinds of podcasts and so on. And so it makes you look

21:49.120 --> 21:56.400
a certain way to your peers. But once the support for defund the police becomes implemented into

21:56.960 --> 22:03.040
policy, once police stations and police departments have reduced funding, once you

22:03.040 --> 22:06.480
cultivate an attitude, so it's not just the policy, but you're also cultivating the culture

22:06.480 --> 22:11.760
and the attitude around law enforcement that, oh, we don't need police. You sort of give permission

22:11.760 --> 22:17.920
to people to be suspicious of police or to be derogatory towards police. As a result, we saw

22:17.920 --> 22:24.320
that a lot of, a lot of police officers started retiring in large numbers. There's reports in,

22:24.320 --> 22:28.720
in major US cities that they're having difficulty with recruitment because if you're a smart,

22:28.720 --> 22:32.480
capable young person who wants to make a difference in your community, like, why would you want that

22:32.480 --> 22:39.600
job? If you know that people are going to view you with suspicion or with some kind of, you know,

22:39.680 --> 22:45.120
that you're sort of malicious or evil, cops, I mean, they get paid okay, but it's not like

22:45.840 --> 22:49.440
considering the potential danger they face in their job. Part of the reason why people would

22:49.440 --> 22:57.120
want to do it is because cops formerly used to be seen as respectable and admirable and people

22:57.840 --> 23:00.960
conferred a lot of status onto them. Well, think about the difference between when

23:01.520 --> 23:05.360
a policeman currently in the sort of current defund the police era that we're in,

23:05.360 --> 23:12.800
policeman turns up at a scene versus a firefighter or an ambulance A&E person. You know,

23:13.440 --> 23:18.880
the other two emergency services are seen heralded as heroes and the police like,

23:19.600 --> 23:26.240
ACAB, ACAB, all cops are bastards. I got about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so who wants that job?

23:26.240 --> 23:31.680
And so gradually, and we saw this in the aftermath of the defund the police movement that violent

23:31.760 --> 23:36.800
crime spiked all across the US, especially major cities, homicide rates increased to levels not

23:36.800 --> 23:43.360
seen since the early 1990s. And so when all of this was unfolding, I actually, I tried to find

23:43.360 --> 23:47.120
some survey data to see like who's actually, you know, like, because I don't know anyone in my

23:47.120 --> 23:50.560
personal life who thinks that we should defund the police. I mean, other than, you know, some people

23:50.560 --> 23:55.920
at Cambridge and other elite universities, but ordinary people who are outside of these institutions,

23:55.920 --> 23:59.440
I didn't know anyone who was supporting this movement. So I had a suspicion this was,

23:59.440 --> 24:03.040
you know, actually, a legitimate luxury belief. I looked at survey data for it,

24:04.080 --> 24:09.360
found one in YouGov in 2020, which found that they collect the data from a representative

24:09.360 --> 24:13.760
sample of Americans, and they broke down the data by income category. And it was the highest

24:13.760 --> 24:18.080
income Americans who were the most supportive of defunding the police. And it was the lowest

24:18.080 --> 24:24.560
income Americans who were the least supportive. And then when later, the different, different

24:25.520 --> 24:32.880
findings were reported for major US cities, Minneapolis and Detroit, one in New York City,

24:33.600 --> 24:37.040
they found that white Democrats were far more supportive of defending the police than black

24:37.040 --> 24:45.120
and Hispanic Democrats. And so it was like the people who were supposedly so kind and so sympathetic

24:45.120 --> 24:49.680
towards the marginalized and the dispossessed and the poor and so on, they were supporting

24:49.760 --> 24:54.560
something that actually those groups didn't even want. And I mean, an increased number of them

24:54.560 --> 25:01.760
were being victimized as a result of it. In my book, I point out that if you compare

25:02.320 --> 25:07.680
the lowest income Americans to Americans who earn the median income, there's, what is it,

25:07.680 --> 25:14.720
they're two to three times more likely to be victims of violent crimes, they're seven times

25:14.720 --> 25:19.040
more likely to be victims of assault, they're 20 times more likely to be victims of sexual assault,

25:19.040 --> 25:23.440
like essentially across the board, the lower your income, the more likely you are to be a

25:23.440 --> 25:27.680
target of crime. Could do with the police. Yes, exactly. You could, yeah, it would be nice to

25:27.680 --> 25:34.000
have someone you could call if you're being burglarized or assaulted. And so yeah, it was a

25:34.000 --> 25:41.120
complete sort of backfiring. And I haven't seen, you know, there hasn't really been any sort of

25:41.120 --> 25:45.920
accountability or any kind of acknowledgement of what happened in the aftermath of that movement.

25:45.920 --> 25:51.600
Yeah, it's wild. And then obviously the big elephant in the room here is that

25:51.600 --> 25:57.520
the people who are supporting it are the ones who are the most likely to live in a gated community,

25:57.520 --> 26:04.400
in an area or a neighborhood that has not called the police in a decade since the last time that

26:04.400 --> 26:08.480
someone from the community that they're probably talking about trying to protect accidentally

26:08.480 --> 26:15.520
wandered through their gated community. So it's rules for the but not for me. And let me explain

26:15.600 --> 26:22.800
to you, poor, underclass peasant person, what is best for you from my vantage point out here in

26:22.800 --> 26:26.960
my very comfortable home? Yes, yes, yeah, yeah. So that's, yeah, that's one of the components

26:26.960 --> 26:31.280
of the luxury belief is that the believer sheltered from the consequences of the belief. And so yeah,

26:31.280 --> 26:36.320
the people who were supporting the defund the police movement, largely college educated,

26:36.320 --> 26:41.280
living in safe communities, living in gated communities, there were reports during the

26:41.280 --> 26:47.200
the political unrest in 2020, and all of the BLM demonstrations and so on, all of the riots that

26:47.200 --> 26:51.520
people in like rich people in Chicago were hiring private security to patrol their neighborhoods

26:51.520 --> 26:56.560
because you know, the police were either distracted due to all of the social unrest and crime that was

26:56.560 --> 27:00.560
occurring, or because police were retiring and so on. And so they were hiring private security in

27:00.560 --> 27:05.920
these rich neighborhoods. And then in New York City, there were reports of people just fleeing to

27:05.920 --> 27:10.320
the Hamptons, like, you know, if you have money and you have resources, you can just flee to your

27:10.320 --> 27:16.240
private little gated area and from home start tweeting about defund the police and get all the

27:16.240 --> 27:21.600
likes and plot it. Oh my God, you're so caring. I know the cops are so wrong. Like they're

27:21.600 --> 27:26.400
treating these poor black people so badly. And you can, I mean, I think people who are

27:27.520 --> 27:33.120
sort of affluent upper middle class people, they have a mistaken view of what sort of poverty

27:33.120 --> 27:39.440
looks like. Their only exposure to it is when they see, when they see it reported in the media,

27:39.440 --> 27:46.080
when it's a criminal who's committed some kind of transgression, and that surfaces up, and then

27:46.080 --> 27:49.600
they learn about the criminal's backstory, and they start to feel sympathetic and so on and so

27:49.600 --> 27:55.760
forth. And there's not nearly as much time spent on the victims of that person's crime. And so in

27:55.760 --> 28:00.960
often what happens is that in at least the imagination of this strata of society that,

28:00.960 --> 28:06.080
you know, they conflate poverty with criminality. And the reason why someone commits crimes is

28:06.080 --> 28:09.280
because they're poor without really digging into the data or the research and understanding that

28:09.280 --> 28:13.120
the vast majority of poor people never commit any crimes. They're more, they're far more likely to

28:13.120 --> 28:18.880
be victims of crime than a perpetrator. And they don't really think about this. And then through

28:18.880 --> 28:24.960
the sort of portrayal of poverty, I think in pop culture is kind of mistaken to at least in more

28:24.960 --> 28:31.760
sort of recent media, where, you know, very few TV shows, it's just not exciting to see

28:32.320 --> 28:36.480
some working class person making, you know, minimum wage, going to work,

28:36.480 --> 28:39.920
clocking in, clocking out, going home to their family and living a normal life.

28:39.920 --> 28:44.000
But it's more interesting to see, you know, the struggling school teacher who decides to break

28:44.000 --> 28:47.680
bad and start cooking meth and lashing out at the system. And that's just a much more

28:47.680 --> 28:52.720
interesting story. And so that is, I mean, there was this movie that came out, I think it was last

28:52.720 --> 28:56.800
year, the year before Emily the criminal with Aubrey Plaza, I don't know if you saw it, but

28:56.800 --> 29:00.960
it was, I mean, it was like the perfect kind of movie for this, for this, you know, the luxury

29:00.960 --> 29:06.560
belief class. It's this young woman who works in food catering, and she has this dickhead boss.

29:06.560 --> 29:10.240
And she has dream, I think she is a college graduate, she has dreams of being an artist,

29:10.240 --> 29:14.720
but she has difficulty monetizing her artwork. And so she caters food. But then she like gets

29:14.720 --> 29:19.280
hooked in with this gang and like, learns how to shoplift. And, you know, the whole thing is like,

29:19.280 --> 29:22.880
you know, well, you know, screw the system, you know, I can't make money off my artwork,

29:22.880 --> 29:26.560
and I have to work in food catering. And this is just ridiculous. And so I'm gonna,

29:26.560 --> 29:31.440
you know, start stealing and robbing people. And the movie is portraying this as like a

29:31.440 --> 29:36.080
perfectly reasonable course of action, right? And this is like, it's basically like breaking bad,

29:36.080 --> 29:40.880
but the young woman version for art. Yeah, yeah. And yeah, I just think it's that's,

29:40.880 --> 29:42.960
that's part of what drives the luxury beliefs phenomenon.

29:43.920 --> 29:50.000
Yeah, it's wild, man. And when you see that, you really can't unsee it. Mary Harrington had this

29:50.000 --> 29:58.160
about a lot of the advances that were proposed by the feminist movement in the 50s, 60s, and 70s

29:58.720 --> 30:06.800
were put forward by women for whom the impact wouldn't affect them. So a perfect example is,

30:06.800 --> 30:12.960
I guess, the push toward independence and the derogation of chivalry by men, because chivalry

30:12.960 --> 30:17.200
in some ways can be patronizing, must be patronizing to women, like I can open the door for myself,

30:17.680 --> 30:21.760
I can carry my own bags, right? Like I can pull my own chair out, I can pay for my own dinner.

30:21.760 --> 30:28.720
And in a world where women are trying to find and establish themselves socioeconomically as

30:28.720 --> 30:33.920
independent agents, aside from the husband or partner that they're supposed to need,

30:33.920 --> 30:38.800
I can understand why that would be the case. But as she said, it is a direct line from

30:39.680 --> 30:44.480
men shouldn't open the door and don't need to, to why you shouldn't hit your wife,

30:44.480 --> 30:50.080
right? Because the consensus is women are more fragile, vulnerable, and need to be protected,

30:50.080 --> 30:56.320
and men should be the ones that do that protecting. And it's the women who are married to men who had

30:56.320 --> 31:01.440
a two-pound household, who had a relatively good example of how to treat women when they were growing

31:01.440 --> 31:08.320
up, who have been through all of the institutions that have kind of softly embedded what chivalry

31:08.320 --> 31:14.160
is in any case, because that's just the way that a more sophisticated social life goes.

31:14.880 --> 31:19.680
But that doesn't think about women who are in an underclass or working-class environment,

31:19.680 --> 31:23.760
who are in a relationship with a guy who never knew his father, whose mom was cycling in and out

31:23.760 --> 31:28.240
of different boyfriends or partners or whatever in the house, who was maybe abused physically or

31:28.240 --> 31:33.040
verbally or emotionally or whatever while they were growing up, all of whose friends are

31:34.000 --> 31:37.840
ruffians that are going about and anti-social behavior and all of this stuff. And it's like,

31:37.840 --> 31:44.240
well, I know that for you, lady that drives a Mercedes-Benz, you might like the idea of being

31:44.240 --> 31:49.280
liberated from men holding the door open for you, but downstream from that, you've also liberated

31:49.280 --> 31:53.120
women from being protected from their underclass partner from hitting them when he gets annoyed

31:53.120 --> 31:58.320
on a nighttime. And I really, I just thought that that was such an interesting frame. The same thing

31:58.320 --> 32:06.800
goes for support for abortion rights, right? When you think about that, I think that it is skewed

32:06.800 --> 32:13.840
toward the people in the upper class believe that it is a great idea to restrict abortion rights

32:13.840 --> 32:23.680
overall, to give less access. But you think, well, maybe if you were woman 213 of one particular

32:23.680 --> 32:31.200
village somewhere who's six kids deep to three different men, maybe easy access to birth control

32:31.200 --> 32:36.720
would be a good thing for them to have. And yeah, it's just, it's so interesting how it can be

32:36.720 --> 32:41.200
split up by race or it can be split up by class or it can be split up within gender.

32:41.200 --> 32:45.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was, I mean, it's interesting because I think that

32:46.480 --> 32:50.480
a lot of the people who promote these views or who think that these are sort of progressive or

32:50.480 --> 32:55.920
fashionable or enlightened, they don't think about how it would affect someone outside of

32:55.920 --> 33:01.120
their social strata, or they mistakenly overextend the way that they think to everyone else that,

33:01.120 --> 33:03.920
well, here's what would be good for me, or here's what would be good for my

33:04.560 --> 33:10.160
class or my group, and therefore would be good for everyone, or the only reason why other people

33:10.160 --> 33:14.080
aren't thinking like me or aren't pursuing the same kind of life as me is because they don't have the

33:14.080 --> 33:19.600
same, or because my preferences aren't aren't implemented in society or throughout culture.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.960
I mean, yeah, what you said earlier about Mary Harrington's point is interesting. I mean,

33:22.960 --> 33:29.120
I saw this firsthand that where I grew up, basically anyone, anyone like, you know,

33:29.120 --> 33:34.240
who was remotely sort of academically inclined, you know, went off to some state university,

33:34.240 --> 33:40.160
everyone who wasn't, but still had some sort of restlessness or ambition, they joined the military,

33:40.160 --> 33:44.160
and then all the guys who were left behind, I mean, there's, you know, not much left for

33:44.160 --> 33:49.280
the women there to pick from. And a lot of these guys did grow up without dads or without good

33:49.600 --> 33:54.960
sort of male role models around. And yeah, I mean, yeah, what ends up happening often is like,

33:54.960 --> 33:58.720
you know, women get, you know, they have children with multiple men, or the men,

33:59.360 --> 34:03.600
you know, they have multiple partners and don't interact with their kids. I mean, I, you know,

34:03.600 --> 34:08.880
I now have friends that I graduated from high school with who are these guys. And yeah, it's

34:08.880 --> 34:14.000
just, it looks very different, right? Like that, the sort of liberation and the belief that, you

34:14.000 --> 34:18.880
know, women don't need a man or men shouldn't, you know, women can live the same kind of life as

34:18.880 --> 34:24.160
a man. And maybe it's true if you are affluent and you go off to college and you're going to be a

34:24.160 --> 34:30.400
young professional career driven person, but if you're just working a menial job and you're,

34:30.400 --> 34:36.720
I mean, most people aren't going to derive a ton of satisfaction from the way that they make money.

34:36.720 --> 34:42.320
Well, there's a story that you, I remember you telling me maybe about some lady friend that

34:42.320 --> 34:47.920
you'd spoken to about, she said that we should be able to move beyond the nuclear family because

34:47.920 --> 34:54.240
it's restrictive and constraining. Yeah, yeah, this was someone I graduated from Yale with. We were

34:54.240 --> 34:58.960
somehow got on the topic of family and future and this kind of thing. And she was basically telling

34:58.960 --> 35:06.160
me that, yeah, marriage is this outdated patriarchal institution and we should society should move

35:06.160 --> 35:12.720
beyond it. We should evolve, get past it. And so I asked her, well, how did you grow up? What was

35:12.800 --> 35:19.920
your family life situation when you were a child? And she said, I was raised by my mom and my dad

35:19.920 --> 35:26.400
and I did have that kind of conventional family. And then I asked her what she planned to do later

35:26.400 --> 35:30.480
in her, because she was planning to, she was working at a technology firm, she was going to

35:30.480 --> 35:34.000
go to law school, but I asked her in her future when she has a family or if she wanted a family,

35:34.000 --> 35:38.080
what would she do? And she said, oh yeah, I do want a family someday and I'll probably get married

35:38.080 --> 35:44.320
and have a husband and essentially get married and like partake in this outdated patriarchal

35:44.320 --> 35:51.920
institution. And so I was thinking that, okay, you benefited from this age old, ancient sort of

35:52.560 --> 35:59.280
patriarchal, but this institution and you plan to carry the benefits of that arrangement forward

35:59.280 --> 36:04.240
for your own children. But your official public position is no one should do this, it's outdated,

36:04.240 --> 36:08.640
she was sort of denigrating it, trying to downplay it, saying other people shouldn't do this.

36:08.640 --> 36:15.200
And to me, it seemed very duplicitous that this clearly marriage has positive benefits. I mean,

36:15.200 --> 36:19.520
that was something that I learned when I got to college was almost every single one of my classmates

36:19.520 --> 36:25.200
and peers came from two parent families, whereas where I grew up, it was basically zero. And so

36:25.200 --> 36:34.160
clearly marriage had some kind of effect here. And yet the place, the group that is the most

36:34.240 --> 36:38.320
likely to downplay the benefits of marriage are the most likely to be products of successful

36:38.320 --> 36:45.040
marriages under the most likely to form marriages themselves. How come you're not more bitter

36:45.040 --> 36:52.800
about your childhood? I mean, I used to be, I used to actually be more angry when I was

36:53.600 --> 37:00.640
in my late teens, early 20s. I mean, I think part of it was just getting older. I think just age,

37:01.200 --> 37:07.840
things just kind of tend to like burn out in dim over time anyway. And I think the other was just

37:07.840 --> 37:19.520
a lot of sort of self focused work, self improvement, trying to get past it and put it all into context

37:19.520 --> 37:27.600
and realize that on the one hand, people are responsible for what they do in their lives.

37:28.160 --> 37:37.040
But on the other, I mean, to understand the sort of, to understand the genealogy of the ideas that

37:37.040 --> 37:41.520
led us to this point, that's been helpful too, to understand that, yes, like day to day we have

37:41.520 --> 37:48.640
agency over our lives, but the sort of, there are these decisions and cultural trajectories and

37:48.640 --> 37:53.440
all of these other forces that are in place that play a role too. And so, you know, when I start

37:53.440 --> 37:59.600
to dig at the root of this of who is responsible for some of these ideas, who promotes the luxury

37:59.600 --> 38:05.680
beliefs and so on, and entering into institutions where I can see it, it helps me to just understand

38:05.680 --> 38:12.000
it. And I think that sort of settles my anger a bit too. It's very interesting thinking about that.

38:12.000 --> 38:20.000
I had a sea traveler on, she's a psychotherapist pushing back very hard against what she calls

38:20.000 --> 38:25.680
Instagram therapy, which is identifying everybody as a victim and that they've got trauma and stuff.

38:25.680 --> 38:26.240
And she said,

38:30.640 --> 38:35.360
remembering that you experience trauma isn't being a victim, making your identity out of it is.

38:36.240 --> 38:40.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that's well put. I mean, I didn't really, I didn't really think

38:40.480 --> 38:44.400
of myself as a victim and people didn't call me a victim. I never thought on those terms until

38:44.400 --> 38:48.800
I got to college. Before that, it was just day to day life. I mean, it was just, you know,

38:48.800 --> 38:53.600
trying to struggling to get by trying to make money trying to whatever living paycheck to

38:53.600 --> 38:58.720
paycheck and then later joining the military and you know, I just my, my plate was full later.

38:59.760 --> 39:06.400
You know, sort of towards the end of my enlistment before I entered college, I did do a stint in

39:06.400 --> 39:13.120
rehab and I talked to therapists and you know, I did sort of address a lot of the issues that

39:13.600 --> 39:19.920
I had experienced when I was a kid. And that was helpful too, I think to just sort of contextualize

39:19.920 --> 39:25.840
it and also to just sort of be more open with the people I grew up with and close with, you know,

39:25.840 --> 39:30.560
my sister and my mom and all these people to just my adoptive family to talk to them about all of

39:30.560 --> 39:37.680
this. I mean, that's helpful too. I think there is this, this tendency for young people, young

39:37.680 --> 39:42.480
men in particular that, you know, self-sufficiency will solve all your problems to just be completely

39:42.480 --> 39:48.560
self-reliant. You don't have to rely on anyone, you know, your, your relationships are sort of

39:48.560 --> 39:55.520
peripheral. And I lived that way for a while and it probably did help to sort of, I don't know,

39:55.520 --> 40:00.720
led me to equip myself to be, you know, a self-sufficient person. But later, you know, I did

40:00.720 --> 40:06.080
realize that actually relationships are important. I mean, I went through the first six years

40:07.440 --> 40:11.920
after I left home. I never visited. I never visited for the holidays. I never visited her

40:11.920 --> 40:16.400
for any kind of special occasions. I mean, I did visit like, you know, on and off whenever,

40:16.400 --> 40:21.840
you know, really whenever it suited my schedule, I was very selfish. But then later, you know,

40:21.840 --> 40:26.560
now I make an effort, now I make an effort to do all of those things and realize that actually,

40:26.560 --> 40:29.920
you know, all of these things, relationships are more important than you think, especially when

40:29.920 --> 40:35.840
you're young, right? There is, there's value there, even if you think there isn't.

40:35.840 --> 40:43.040
Yeah, there's a degree of romanticism about monk mode and loan-rangering it. And I think my

40:43.040 --> 40:47.440
current theory on this is that monk mode is a great tool, but a bad master.

40:48.960 --> 40:55.760
Because if you continue to pray at the altar of it over a long enough amount of time, the reason

40:55.760 --> 41:03.520
that you're doing some equivalent of monk mode, right, which is a over-reliance on self-sufficiency,

41:03.600 --> 41:08.320
introspection and isolation so that you can focus on making yourself into a better version of you,

41:08.320 --> 41:10.960
because quite rightly, there are a lot of distractions out there in the world. And if

41:10.960 --> 41:14.560
you're trying to do a ton of self-work, are you going to therapy or you're in rehab,

41:14.560 --> 41:17.920
you're probably not going to have the most flourishing social life. It's going to be difficult

41:17.920 --> 41:21.520
for you to juggle all of these plates. And if you do try and juggle all of the plates, you're going

41:21.520 --> 41:26.480
to restrict your progress in that area. Like committing yourself to one thing or a very narrow

41:26.480 --> 41:31.520
band of things is more than, it's not additive, it's multiplicative, right? It allows you to

41:31.520 --> 41:36.160
triple down, quadruple down all of your efforts into one very tight area. And I found myself

41:36.160 --> 41:42.880
toward the end of my twenties, through my manopause, that I really, really enjoyed monk mode. But I

41:42.880 --> 41:48.320
saw, especially for someone that has introverted tendencies, and I get my energy mostly from

41:48.320 --> 41:53.840
being on my own a lot of the time, that it started to become more alluring to me than being back out

41:53.840 --> 41:58.400
into the world. But the problem with that is the reason that you're doing the monk mode thing or

41:58.400 --> 42:03.120
the rehab thing or whatever, is to form yourself into a functional member of society who can then

42:03.120 --> 42:08.400
go and reintegrate. And that's the problem that the progress can become addictive to the point

42:08.400 --> 42:14.240
where it stops you from doing the thing you're like, the thing that you're doing is sacrificing

42:14.240 --> 42:19.680
the thing that you were doing it in order to get. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you sort of mistake

42:19.680 --> 42:25.600
the, the means for the end, the end goal, you're sort of, yeah, yeah, it's, I think it's difficult

42:25.680 --> 42:28.960
to keep that in mind. I think a lot of people have difficulty with that, especially when you're

42:28.960 --> 42:33.680
young, you, like, what, what are your actions attempting to accomplish? What's your overarching

42:33.680 --> 42:38.400
goal? You know, Robert Green makes that distinction between tactician versus strategist, right? The

42:38.400 --> 42:41.920
tactician is just what's directly in front of you? What do you need to do next? And the strategist is,

42:41.920 --> 42:47.040
well, what's all of this for? Like, what are each of those steps trying to get you to? And I think,

42:47.040 --> 42:50.000
yeah, when you're young, you just think, oh, I want to make money. And like, money becomes the

42:50.000 --> 42:53.200
thing. And it's like, well, what's the money for? Like, what do you want to do with that money

42:53.200 --> 42:57.360
when you build up your bank account? What is that the goal is just to have a big number

42:57.360 --> 43:02.160
on your balance? Or is it to take care of your loved ones, to have the freedom to be able to

43:02.160 --> 43:07.120
interact with people that you care about and to provide and those kinds of things. And I think I,

43:07.120 --> 43:12.000
I mean, I kind of came to that realization when I was in my mid 20s, but it wasn't until in my

43:12.000 --> 43:19.360
later 20s, really probably right, not until I was about to start grad school, I was like 20, 28,

43:19.440 --> 43:24.400
but I really had that realization that, oh, the reason why I'm working so hard and trying to

43:24.400 --> 43:29.040
get educated and successful and trying to make money and all these things is so that I could

43:29.040 --> 43:33.120
take care of my, my current family, my adoptive family, but then also for if and when I have a

43:33.120 --> 43:38.880
family later, we'll say when, that I'll be able to take care of them too in a way that I lacked

43:38.880 --> 43:44.480
when I was a kid. And that's what ultimately, all of these things are for. It's not just to

43:44.480 --> 43:49.360
whatever, increase the numbers on my social media or on my balance or something like that.

43:49.920 --> 43:55.120
So your background, the life that you went through to where you ended up,

43:57.520 --> 44:03.200
Air Force? Yeah, Air Force. Air Force, US Air Force, GI Bill, Yale, Cambridge,

44:04.640 --> 44:09.520
PhD book, you know, it's going to be an amazing selling book, all the rest of the stuff.

44:10.160 --> 44:17.200
What do you attribute that trajectory to, given that your friends with so many of the

44:17.200 --> 44:21.120
people that you grew up with that are still, they're the guy, they're that guy with

44:21.680 --> 44:26.560
three baby mamas and a bunch of alimony or whatever, and they're in the same town in the

44:26.560 --> 44:33.200
same whatever, what was formative or what, what do you attribute the change in you to that the

44:33.200 --> 44:38.320
other people didn't? I mean, there are probably, you know, there's a variety of factors. I think one

44:38.320 --> 44:48.080
is, you know, you do need to have like a certain amount of like innate drive or ambition in the

44:48.080 --> 44:52.800
first place. And that I'm not entirely sure you can, you can, you can drill that into people.

44:53.760 --> 44:57.440
So you have to have that sort of raw material in the first place. But one point that I try to

44:57.440 --> 45:02.560
make in the book is that things could have very easily gone a different direction. I think having

45:02.560 --> 45:07.120
sort of aptitude and drive and ambition, those are necessary but not sufficient that there are a

45:07.120 --> 45:11.040
lot of guys I think who are sort of smart and talented and ambitious, but they're just surrounded

45:11.040 --> 45:16.800
by chaos and disorder and, you know, lack opportunity or, or they've just been sort of beaten down by

45:16.800 --> 45:20.880
life so much that they don't even think to like spot the opportunities that are around you

45:22.720 --> 45:26.960
and capitalize on them. And so, so that was there. So I think some of the raw material was

45:26.960 --> 45:31.920
probably there. And then the other thing was just making this, you know, kind of halfway impulsive

45:31.920 --> 45:37.440
decision when I was 17 to just enlist and get out of my hometown. And I kind of knew that,

45:38.720 --> 45:42.320
you know, I, at this point, you know, I'd had two jobs when I was in high school,

45:42.320 --> 45:46.400
I was a dishwasher at a restaurant. And then I was a bag boy at a grocery store. And

45:46.400 --> 45:49.760
I kind of looked around at my coworkers who were a little older than me. These were guys,

45:49.760 --> 45:53.840
you know, this kind of guy in their early to mid twenties, you know, maybe they like some of them

45:53.840 --> 45:57.600
like they were like 24, but had a girlfriend in high school. And they were just like kind of creepy,

45:57.600 --> 46:03.600
weird stoner guy or the guy who, you know, would ride a dirt bike and, you know, just like smoke

46:03.600 --> 46:07.920
a lot of weed in the parking lot and just, you know, kind of aimless and adrift. And I thought

46:07.920 --> 46:13.120
like, I, I think now when you're 17 or 18, that's kind of cool to live that life. But when you're

46:13.120 --> 46:18.240
24 or 28, like that's kind of pathetic. And even when I was a teenager, I had that thought that,

46:18.880 --> 46:22.320
you know, sometimes my friends and I would ask these guys to like get us beer, hook us up with

46:22.320 --> 46:26.640
weed or whatever. And, you know, some part of me, I was, I was like happy they were doing it. But

46:26.640 --> 46:31.200
on the other hand, I was like, why are you doing this for us, man? Like, what kind of loser is

46:31.200 --> 46:34.960
hanging out with a bunch of high schoolers? And I don't want to be like the weird old guy at the

46:34.960 --> 46:43.280
high school party when I'm that age. And so, you know, a variety of factors led me to just enlist

46:43.280 --> 46:48.480
right away. I barely graduated high school. I mean, I was smart. And that's the other point that I

46:48.480 --> 46:52.880
try to make in the book is that a lot of people want to blame the school system or that there's

46:52.880 --> 46:56.080
something wrong with teachers or we aren't paying them enough. And so, and maybe some of those things

46:56.080 --> 47:01.120
are true, but teachers aren't dumb. Like most teachers get into that profession because they

47:01.120 --> 47:04.880
care about kids and they want them to do well. And they're usually pretty observant about like,

47:04.880 --> 47:11.440
which kids are sort of curious and academically inclined. And my teachers could see that in me,

47:11.440 --> 47:16.960
but I just had no motivation or desire to do well in school. It just wasn't there for me.

47:17.520 --> 47:26.480
And so, my teachers were just continually frustrated by me. And so, yeah, I enlist,

47:26.480 --> 47:31.360
I get out of there, basic training, I get stationed, I spend some time overseas and sort

47:31.360 --> 47:37.040
of have that structure around me. A couple of days ago, I spoke with a mutual friend of ours,

47:37.040 --> 47:41.440
Polina Pompliano. And she asked me this question of, when I read your book and I read about what

47:41.440 --> 47:44.960
you were like when you were a teenager, when you were in high school, and then I meet you now,

47:44.960 --> 47:51.280
like it just doesn't, like there's a disconnect, I don't understand it. And I explained that I was

47:51.280 --> 47:56.800
in the Air Force for eight years. Like that's a long time. Like I was in from 17 to 25. And,

47:56.800 --> 48:00.400
you know, the book, I kind of like gloss over because it's kind of mind-numbing and boring,

48:00.400 --> 48:04.640
but it's like, you know, make your bed, you know, like make sure your uniform is, you know,

48:04.640 --> 48:09.120
perfect. Jordan Peterson bootcamp. Exactly. It is kind of like that, especially for the first

48:09.120 --> 48:13.120
six months to a year when you're in training, it's like, you're not a, you're not a person,

48:13.120 --> 48:20.000
you're just like a cog in this machine of just like, you know, like cleaning and being meticulous

48:20.000 --> 48:25.600
about every little aspect of your existence. And I hated it. I hated every second of it.

48:27.520 --> 48:33.360
But it was important for me to go through that, to like learn the skills that I kind of lacked

48:33.360 --> 48:37.200
when I was growing up of just like, here's how to be an adult, here's how to take care of yourself,

48:37.200 --> 48:40.720
here's how to dress properly, and like even basic things, right?

48:40.720 --> 48:44.480
What were the most surprising, I think this would be a nice framing, actually,

48:46.160 --> 48:50.400
as you move up through the cacophosphere of different social strata,

48:51.200 --> 48:59.040
what were the most surprising realizations going from Rob 1.0 to Rob 2.0, which is, I guess,

48:59.040 --> 49:03.600
from teenager to being in the Air Force? What were the things where you're like, oh my god,

49:03.600 --> 49:08.800
like that's an expectation or a social convention, or that's a way of operating,

49:08.880 --> 49:13.200
or it's a belief or whatever? I mean, I think probably one of the bigger ones was

49:14.320 --> 49:18.480
just like learning the distinction between like self-discipline and motivation,

49:19.360 --> 49:25.920
because I lacked, I really lacked both when I was a teenager. You know, I didn't feel motivated to

49:25.920 --> 49:30.000
do well, but I also had, I had no external discipline around me really. I mean, I had it in sort of

49:30.000 --> 49:34.400
fits and starts in different periods. It was just a very sort of chaotic early life. But

49:35.040 --> 49:39.120
I had no self-discipline, certainly. Like I couldn't impose on myself. It just, you know,

49:39.120 --> 49:43.120
I didn't, I didn't have the tools to do that. But then in the military, I learned it that,

49:43.120 --> 49:47.200
you know, at first it was imposed from on high that this is how you will do things.

49:47.200 --> 49:50.720
And then it gets drilled into you. And then you just learn on your own, like, oh, this is how

49:50.720 --> 49:56.000
you get things done is motivation is, you know, so they're the distinction, the motivation is just

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
a feeling. It's like, do I want to do this or not? And if I don't want to do it, I lack the

50:00.000 --> 50:03.760
motivation and I'm just not going to do it. Whereas self-discipline is, I'm going to do this

50:03.760 --> 50:08.800
regardless of how I feel. And so, you know, for some people, it may make sense in the context of,

50:08.800 --> 50:12.880
like, going to the gym, that I don't feel like going to the gym today. But self-discipline is,

50:13.600 --> 50:17.040
it doesn't matter how you feel, like, oh, you have a feeling who cares, like, what are your

50:17.040 --> 50:21.600
actions? What are you actually going to do now? Ignore those feelings and do what you've set out

50:21.600 --> 50:26.960
to do. And so it was like that for my work, for things like, I mean, even showing up to work on

50:26.960 --> 50:33.280
time. I mean, it's kind of sad, but I was one of the better workers at my jobs in high school.

50:33.280 --> 50:37.360
And even then, I was, like, not on time, half the time, like, it didn't matter. I didn't feel

50:37.360 --> 50:41.520
like it. And then the military was, if you don't show up to work on time, you get court-martialed

50:41.520 --> 50:48.880
and you go to military prison. That's the life. And once I learned, like, to operate by those

50:48.880 --> 50:54.400
standards and those regulations, those policies, that it dawned on me that actually, you know,

50:54.400 --> 50:59.520
Jaco has this phrase, discipline equals freedom, that once you sort of outsource all of your decisions

50:59.520 --> 51:05.200
to this sort of regimented system, then suddenly, like, life gets better. And you do have more freedom.

51:05.200 --> 51:10.480
You have the freedom to think about other things or to direct your attention to certain projects or

51:10.480 --> 51:14.880
goals or ideas. And you don't have to live your life in this constant state of chaos of, oh,

51:14.880 --> 51:20.240
I don't have any money now, you know, like that, you just, you know, set the set, set the system so

51:20.240 --> 51:23.440
that your money goes here. And this is what you're going to do. And you go to work at this time.

51:23.440 --> 51:27.200
And this is when you leave. And this is what's, and having that regimented system was really

51:27.760 --> 51:31.360
important for me. And now I just, you know, I do it, it's second nature to me, but it took

51:31.360 --> 51:36.720
eight years to get there. So yeah, I think those, those kinds of things, discipline was the big one.

51:36.720 --> 51:43.040
What do people who didn't grow up in poverty not know about what it's like to grow up in poverty?

51:45.600 --> 51:49.600
I mean, I think, I think poverty, poverty is

51:50.480 --> 51:53.680
it's an interesting

51:55.840 --> 52:00.000
question because I think a lot of people actually attempt to,

52:01.360 --> 52:05.280
they attempt to imagine it. I know a lot of people actually who didn't grow up poor, but who

52:05.280 --> 52:11.520
at least try to imagine what it would have been like to be poor. And I think like the,

52:11.520 --> 52:15.120
the imagination probably isn't too far off from the reality that there are certain things that

52:15.120 --> 52:20.640
you want, but maybe you can't get, or if you want a toy or a certain food or a certain thing that,

52:21.280 --> 52:25.360
you know, I think poverty now for at least in sort of developed first world countries,

52:25.360 --> 52:32.000
very few people are actually starving in the street, but it's more like, you know, I, I want to get,

52:33.920 --> 52:38.400
you know, maybe it's like a special occasion and I want to rent a video game at Blockbuster,

52:38.400 --> 52:43.120
but that's $6. And we're only going to let you rent a movie because it's $3. Like those kinds

52:43.120 --> 52:47.200
of like weird, small things. And you can only go on a special occasion for your birthday or

52:47.200 --> 52:54.000
something. It's not like a weekly occurrence. The other thing is like the, I think like the,

52:55.840 --> 53:02.000
the social environment is something people don't think about as well, that what family life

53:02.640 --> 53:08.960
and communities look like in poor and working class areas now are much different than,

53:09.200 --> 53:14.000
than they, than they used to look like. I mean, I cite this statistic in my book about how

53:15.520 --> 53:21.760
in the 1960s, 95% of children in the US, regardless of social class, were raised by

53:21.760 --> 53:28.080
both of their birth parents. And then by 2005, for the upper class, it had dropped to 85%. So

53:28.080 --> 53:34.640
there was a slight dip, but by and large, that's the norm still. Whereas for working class families

53:34.640 --> 53:40.800
in the US, working class children, it dropped from 95% to 30%. And that was 2005. My guess is

53:40.800 --> 53:47.200
it's dropped a little bit further than that now. And so just to give a sort of a glimpse into this,

53:47.200 --> 53:52.800
I mean, there was, I had five close friends growing up in high school. And so there was me

53:52.800 --> 53:58.080
sort of raised in foster homes and adopted, but there were divorces and other kinds of drama.

53:59.040 --> 54:04.960
I had two friends raised by single moms, one friend raised by a single dad, I had another

54:04.960 --> 54:09.360
friend who was raised by his grandma because his dad was in prison and his mom was addicted to drugs.

54:09.360 --> 54:14.400
And that's kind of like the normal situation when you go to like, if you go to a high school

54:14.400 --> 54:17.680
in one of these areas and just start asking people about their parents or their families,

54:17.680 --> 54:21.920
they'll start describing about dads in prison or moms in drugs or, you know, I'm staying with my

54:21.920 --> 54:26.640
aunt right now because my mom is in rehab or whatever. Very chaotic. Yeah, it's just total.

54:27.440 --> 54:34.560
Yeah, it's just totally chaotic and disorderly. And this is a point that I've made in my writing is

54:34.560 --> 54:41.280
that, you know, childhood poverty is not, and again, this is in the context of the US and,

54:41.280 --> 54:47.760
you know, first world countries, that childhood poverty is not really very strong predictor

54:47.760 --> 54:53.520
of harmful or detrimental outcomes later in life. The correlation is either very weak or

54:53.520 --> 55:00.320
not significant at all between growing up poor and growing up to commit crimes or

55:00.320 --> 55:06.400
self defeating behaviors, harm, violence, drug addiction, unemployment, all of these kinds of

55:06.400 --> 55:12.080
social pathologies, there's a very sort of tenuous connection there. But for childhood instability

55:12.080 --> 55:17.920
and those undesirable outcomes, there's a strong and consistent correlation there.

55:18.800 --> 55:24.480
And so childhood instability is measured by things like, you know, were you raised by both

55:24.480 --> 55:28.720
of your birth parents? Was there a divorce? How many different adults moved in and out of your

55:28.720 --> 55:34.400
home? How frequently did you relocate? Basically, how much day to day disorder was there in your

55:34.400 --> 55:39.120
life? How much uncertainty was there? And that actually does seem to have a very strong effect

55:39.120 --> 55:45.120
on childhood development, on their expectations, on their goals for themselves. And what's

55:45.200 --> 55:50.800
interesting is that when researchers control for childhood family income, the link remains

55:50.800 --> 55:55.520
strong, it remains significant between instability and outcomes. And so one way to think about this is,

55:56.880 --> 56:02.800
you know, if there's a rich family, but there's a lot of drama and chaos and divorce and addiction

56:02.800 --> 56:08.560
and domestic issues, a child raised in that environment is much more likely to have detrimental

56:08.560 --> 56:15.680
outcomes, more likely to commit crimes or become addicted to substances or just, yeah,

56:15.680 --> 56:21.280
have issues, you know, children out of wedlock or multiple with multiple partners versus a child

56:21.280 --> 56:27.680
who was raised by two very low income parents who are married, who are very focused on creating a

56:27.680 --> 56:31.840
stable and secure life for their kids. And you can kind of see this, I think, with like immigrant

56:31.840 --> 56:38.800
families and low income families that haven't really been quite afflicted by a lot of the

56:38.800 --> 56:44.960
pathologies that have occurred in the US. And so I think that's important to remember too,

56:44.960 --> 56:49.120
it's that yes, there's this poverty component, but there's also just this kind of, sometimes I

56:49.120 --> 56:53.440
wonder if poverty is even the right word for the way that I grew up. I think squalor is probably

56:53.440 --> 56:57.680
a more accurate term is like, you know, there was a bit of that material impoverishment, but it was

56:57.760 --> 57:06.400
more just people like living in a very kind of ugly and almost like masochistic way of just,

57:07.040 --> 57:13.840
you know, careless and impulsive and, you know, sort of drug addled.

57:13.840 --> 57:19.680
What's the mechanism that you think is causing that to happen? What is it about, it's so universal

57:19.680 --> 57:28.160
that this unstable, disorganized upbringing, regardless of class or material wealth,

57:28.960 --> 57:34.560
seems to have such negative impacts predictively down, what do you think's the mechanism there?

57:34.560 --> 57:41.200
I mean, you know, I probably some of it would be genetics, but I'm not sold that it's 100%.

57:41.200 --> 57:47.040
All right, people that are quick to anger, externalizing behavior as parents give the

57:47.040 --> 57:50.640
raw materials of externalizing behavior to kids, right? I think that's really good.

57:50.640 --> 57:53.440
I think that's like one piece of it, but I think that...

57:53.440 --> 57:54.800
Robert Ploman Rains Supreme.

57:54.800 --> 57:59.200
Yeah, exactly. And I think, yeah, that would be the Robert Ploman answer,

58:00.640 --> 58:07.120
you know, but I do think that that can't explain 100% of it because, you know, if you just,

58:07.120 --> 58:12.160
so for example, if you just look at white Americans over time, like all of the same things

58:12.160 --> 58:16.720
have occurred across social classes that actually, you know, 50, 60 years ago,

58:17.680 --> 58:22.240
I mean, I'll give you an example just for my adoptive family. So my adoptive family

58:22.240 --> 58:28.480
are basically white working class people on my mother's side. And so my grandparents,

58:30.240 --> 58:33.040
you know, they were, you know, they grew up basically during the Great Depression

58:33.680 --> 58:37.360
and they got, you know, but they got married, you know, my grandfather and my grand...

58:37.360 --> 58:40.880
They would tell me this story about how my grandfather asked my grandmother to marry him.

58:40.880 --> 58:47.280
And I think he was 18 or 19 and she was like 17. And she, you know, they were just like two,

58:47.280 --> 58:52.080
the only two young people in this town. And, you know, and she was like, I'll marry you,

58:52.080 --> 58:56.800
but you have to stop smoking, stop drinking, stop gambling. And he was like, done and done,

58:56.800 --> 58:58.640
they got married and they had a 60 plus...

58:58.640 --> 58:59.360
Let's have sex.

58:59.360 --> 59:03.760
Yeah, exactly. Well, yeah, they had, I think they had four or five kids.

59:03.760 --> 59:04.480
Lots of sex.

59:04.480 --> 59:10.800
Yeah. And they were married for 60 plus years, no issues. I'm sure they had

59:10.800 --> 59:14.960
issues, but like, you know what I mean? And then they had four kids, all four kids divorced.

59:16.640 --> 59:20.960
And, you know, I just, you know, they, they had married, they did get married,

59:20.960 --> 59:24.400
but then they ended up getting divorced. You know, some of them had, you know,

59:24.400 --> 59:29.520
kids, step kids, that kind of thing. Now, I'm a member of the next generation and I'm seeing

59:29.520 --> 59:34.320
my cousins and it's like, it's not even marriage. It's just like, oh, like they hooked up and had

59:34.320 --> 59:38.560
a kid, but he hasn't spoken to his kid in, you know, three years and, you know, so that's what

59:38.560 --> 59:42.160
it looks like now. And I don't think the genetics in this family lineage changed much.

59:42.160 --> 59:45.840
It was the social environment, it's the incentives, it's the denigration of marriage.

59:45.840 --> 59:49.920
It's, and I don't even, you know, people will point to economic factors, but my grandparents

59:49.920 --> 59:53.760
were very, they were probably poorer than, they're definitely poorer than my cousins now,

59:53.760 --> 59:58.400
you know, like they could not afford the things that my same age, you know, 30 year old cousins

59:58.400 --> 01:00:03.920
could afford. So it wasn't an economic issue. I think a lot of it was just cultural of what

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.760
are your expectations? I think a lot of it has to do with a lot of the stuff that you and I have

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:12.080
talked about and you speak about on your podcast around incentives, around sex and romance and

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:18.400
dating and just, yeah, in the 19, what is it, the 1940s, 1950s, my grandparents generation,

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:22.560
it was like, you know, if you wanted to have sex, you had to like live a certain kind of life,

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:29.280
exactly. And that was, that was just the reality then. And now it's, it's completely different.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:35.280
And I've presented this thought experiment before, I think I posted this on, on back when it was

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:41.280
still called Twitter, which was if you traveled back to 1945, just got in a time machine and walked

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:47.280
out in the post war era, and you said, and you know, very soon, I think it was 1960 when the

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:51.760
birth control pill was invented, you say very soon, it's going to be this magical technology,

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:57.920
the birth control pill. So contraceptives will be widely available. Abortion will be, you know,

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.960
it'll be more accessible, definitely certainly than it is now. So you'll have, you know, the,

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:09.520
all of these reproductive options before you. Do you think in the future, there will be more

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:15.040
children born out of wedlock or fewer? Do you think that there will be more abortions or fewer?

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:20.400
Do you think there will be more children raised in foster homes or orphanages living in chaos and

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:25.680
squalor, more or less? And I think, you know, almost everyone that you speak to in 1945,

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:31.200
you present this survey, I think almost every one of them would say less, they would say fewer.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:36.720
And then, you know, I, but that's not the case. It was very much the opposite of that, that I

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:42.160
think even these technologies and, you know, and the culture and everything sort of went in a,

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:45.200
in a very different direction than I think people had predicted.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:53.440
Mary Eberstadt came on the show. And Adam and Eve and the pill revisited a new version of her

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:59.760
old book. Fantastic. Just so great. And it's true, man. Like, you know, we look back, and it's kind

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:05.440
of cool in the red pill, manosphere, even in the EP world, you know, the social psychology world,

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:16.720
for people to almost laugh, snigger at how rudimentary the thinking was in the 1960s that

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:23.200
introducing birth control would result in better outcomes in terms of abortion, better outcomes

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:29.680
in terms of out of wedlock births. But who then would have been able to predict that that was

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:34.640
what was going to happen? You're talking like a fourth order effect, right? Like, okay, so you're

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.960
going to decrease shotgun weddings because the onus is going to go from the male that accidentally

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:44.800
impregnated to the woman who quote unquote chose, right? It went from a man's mistake to a woman's

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.240
option. And you go, okay, right. And then, and then what's going to happen to that? And what's

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:53.680
going to happen to that? But it's like, it's so far down the line. I was talking to Scott Galloway.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.880
And, you know, he was talking about the predictive power of stuff in the past. And he was saying,

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:04.320
you know, he'd looked through, combed through some research about the Great Depression and had

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:09.680
looked for anybody. Anyone predict this? It's like the year before the Great Depression in the 20s.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.680
No one, nothing, not a Cassandra in sight. And yet in retrospect, you go,

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.800
how could no one have seen this coming? You know, hindsight is a wonderful thing with regards to

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:28.080
that. One question that I've got that I think is kind of interesting is, so squalor, your word,

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:39.360
uh, up until the age of 16, 17, 17, until the age of 17, that should set a pretty low

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:44.880
hedonic threshold, right? That you're in a nice air conditioned room, and your jeans fit and don't

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.480
have holes in, and you're not worrying about whether or not you can pay for the Uber to get

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:56.080
from here to the airport. How have you found your ability to, uh, hedonically adapt over time?

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:03.200
Like, can you recall that as an anchor for your quality of life? Or does it almost seem

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:07.680
like it's someone else that lived that? That's, oh, that's an interesting question. Um,

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:13.840
I guess it's, it's a bit of both. I mean, it's, it's a day to day, I think. I don't really, yeah,

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:18.960
I don't really reflect in that way. You know, you just sort of live your life. But when I reflect

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.400
back and when I think about it and I realize, you know, there are those moments where like,

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:26.800
wow, like I can do this thing that I couldn't have done, you know, even, even after I was in the

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:32.480
middle, I mean, the, I think the pay structures probably changed a bit when I enlisted in 2007.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:38.160
I was, you know, I think the, the, I was making like $1,200 a month was the, the pay. And so I

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:43.440
couldn't afford a belt, you know, like, it was like small little things like that. Like, you know,

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.120
once I cover, you know, because I moved, yeah, once I moved off base, I got this house with my

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:50.640
friends, but you know, you have to pay like first, yeah, it's so funny now, like it doesn't matter

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:53.360
to me because I can, you know, I can, I have money, but back then it was like,

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.680
like, like panicking. I was like, you have to pay the first month and the last month's rent up front.

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:02.320
And then it's like a security deposit. And then it's this and then you have to, and then like gas

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.160
to commute back and, and all of these kinds of things and calculating all of this. And it's like,

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:10.480
oh, well, I guess I can't wear a belt for a couple of weeks and come on next paycheck. It's like that.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:16.880
It sucks. And, and so, you know, so there are times like that where I'm like, oh, I could just buy

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:22.000
this without thinking about it. And that that part is nice. So I think it is that kind of,

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.520
you know, like happiness researchers will do this. What is it like, they have terms for this,

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:33.520
it's like life, life satisfaction versus, I think they may just call it happiness,

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.840
where like happiness is like your, your actual affective state in the moment day to day and how

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:41.600
much positive versus negative emotion are you experiencing subjectively throughout the day

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.480
or the week or whatever. And then there's the life satisfaction component, which is

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:48.320
basically when you step back and view your life as a whole, how satisfied are you? And

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.280
those two things are correlated, but they're not quite the same in some ways.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:56.320
I think parents often report much lower levels of happiness, but higher levels of life satisfaction.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.760
Yes. And, and I think in that regard, it's like, you know, my happiness,

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:03.520
I don't know if it's actually changed much. Maybe there is a bit of that hedonic adaptation where,

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:06.800
you know, 15 years ago, it was like, oh, I can, you know, I can go to Wendy's,

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:11.520
cool, like I'm happy. Whereas now it's, you know, something else, but, but ultimately that

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.280
hasn't changed. But the life satisfaction, I'm sure is, is much higher that like, oh, I've had

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:20.640
a few accomplishments and I can afford things. I don't have to think about money as much anymore.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:25.840
And so yeah, I think there is that. And yeah, and also like reminiscing too, like when I talked

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.440
to my sister or some of my, my old friends from high school and just sort of thinking about those

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:33.520
days, it's like, you know, I do feel a bit better now about my life compared to what I was.

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:39.840
I was talking to a friend and they were asking me stuff about my childhood and my memory is really

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:49.280
patchy from my childhood. It's not fantastic, especially not sort of pre 10. And I said,

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:55.120
look, like what, what do you remember? I said, well, I remember a good bit because of my sister,

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:59.120
because we'll prompt each other about that. Oh, do you remember that? Oh my God. Yeah,

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:04.160
we did do that thing. And we were in that car or we got stuck in the, the mud or whatever, right?

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:11.600
And yeah, there's a degree where I wonder how much is just one good chat GPT prompt away

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:16.960
from me, you know, opening out into this really beautiful answer about some insight or whatever

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:24.400
some experience that I had as a kid. But yeah, George Mack, my friend, once a month lies in bed

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:28.240
before he wakes up for 10 minutes and imagines what it would be like to live with no arms or legs.

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:33.200
That's one of his favorite meditations among a bunch of other weird ones. So he's trying to

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:37.360
dial up contrast as much as possible. Think about all of the challenges that I would have

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.320
to face. Think about what this day is going to entail. Think about all of the things that

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:44.160
would be difficult for me. Think about how grateful I would be if only I could just,

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:50.080
you know, wash my own back if only I could brush my own teeth if only I could do these things.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:53.680
So what he's trying to do is give himself gratitude for the things that he takes for

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:59.280
granted that are very normal. Now, the interesting thing with your example is that you don't need

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:04.960
to imagine what it would be like to live in squalor because you did. But the way that our

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.960
sense of self works, you know, what is it? Every seven years, every cell in your body has turned

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:17.120
over. So there isn't even, you're like the two ship of these three, three, three ship of theseus

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:23.120
is away from the person that you were then. And even for me now, being in Austin for two years,

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:28.240
I went back home for Christmas. And it's like, it's kind of like a fever dream. I'm being back in

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:33.600
this place that I know so well, but I'm different, but I'm not. And then I find triggers, environmental

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:38.000
triggers causing me to fall back into other different ways of thinking and stuff like that.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:44.720
So I was interested in whether or not basically you have been able to lock in a degree of gratitude,

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:49.680
like relativistic gratitude, I suppose, based on where you came from to where you are now.

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:54.880
But it's a permanent, a permanent battle. Like in some regards, from a poverty perspective,

01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.320
you were a guy who was born with no arms or legs and then grew them.

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:08.800
That's right. If I think about what it was like back then, and I compare it to now,

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:14.560
of course, things are much better for me. And yeah, I mean, it would be, I think,

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:20.240
shameful to be anything other than completely grateful and just full of gratitude for-

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.080
And proud as well, I would like to think.

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.880
Yeah. I mean, that's a weird one. I think that's one of the things that, in the book,

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.240
I point this out, that when you don't really grow up with parents and you don't really,

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:36.960
I mean, because I grew up in foster homes before, I think there's the developmental

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.440
window where if you don't really receive positive feedback, I think I just like,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.720
I receive compliments in a very weird way where it's very hard for me to accept it.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:52.160
It's a skill. It's a real skill, man. Who is it that I gave someone a compliment?

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:58.800
Fuck, I can't remember who it was. I gave somebody a compliment and I've never seen

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.280
anyone. I wish I could remember who it was, but it would probably be a good idea that I

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:06.000
couldn't call them out in any case. Dude, it's like the worst way that I've ever seen anyone

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.920
take a compliment. Just, you know, you say this thing that you think is a nice gift that you're

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.600
giving somebody, and even giving compliments is a skill that I've had to learn because I'm

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.160
doing something that's nice for somebody else is a nice thing to do.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.480
Gwinda. It was fucking Gwinda. It was on an episode that I did recently, and I was like,

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:27.040
dude, I fucking adore your writing. I adore your sub-stack. You've got two bucks coming out.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:30.320
I can't wait to read them. I'm fired up every single time I speak to you on the podcast. I

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:34.080
love it. It's like a fugue state we drop into for two hours. It's brilliant.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:40.560
I just saw his face. People can go watch the episode. It's very charming. It's very charming

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:45.520
because obviously he holds himself to a high standard and stuff like that. But you see this

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:52.800
guy go like, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's hard. It's very charming. Well, the other day I had this,

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:58.880
this interaction with one of my friend's mothers, and you know, she was like very high energy,

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:03.600
and she was like, oh, you know, Rob, I love your writing. And now it's like, I love your sub-stack,

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:08.160
and I've watched you on modern wisdom. It's like, it's so great. And at first I was like,

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.240
you know, oh, that's nice. Thank you. You know, trying to like change the subject. I just like,

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:15.040
I feel like all these compliments, and I just feel uncomfortable. I'm like, that's really

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.320
nice of you. Thank you so much. And then she's like, no, really, she's like, did you really get a

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.600
PhD from Cambridge? Because that's amazing. And then like, I started to walk away feeling like,

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.480
damn, I feel pretty good about myself actually. Like, can I have you hung around all the time?

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.040
Eventually, I was like, you know, I was suddenly getting this like really positive mom energy.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.960
And I was like, this is great. Like, actually, but it took a second, right? At first I was like,

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.480
you know, just fell into that sort of default, like, oh, very kind of you to say, thank you so

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:40.560
much. And then she kept going with it. And I'm like, wow, this is a really nice slate.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.560
You're like, kind of the equivalent of a really, obviously overweight person

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:50.880
who can't just go in the gym and do a little bit. It's like, hey, we've got to shift 250 pounds.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.320
You need to stay on that treadmill for another hour, Mr. And then you finish and you're like,

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:59.280
oh, wow, like, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. There's like a crushing weight of compliments that you

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:06.480
need. But that's something I'd loved. I've got, who wrote No More Mr. Nice Guy? Robert Glover.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.400
Thank you. I've got Dr. Robert Glover coming on the show soon. I'm very excited to speak to him.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:18.560
And I'd love to talk about the skill of both accepting and giving compliments. I think that

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:25.360
that's a really underrated skill. The ability to give an earnest compliment and to graciously,

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:29.600
but honestly receive it. Right. Skill that no one really ever talks about.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.600
That is interesting. Yeah, I think from, at least my impression is it's actually

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.640
easier to deliver a compliment than to receive it. Way easier.

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:40.160
Because you can be sincere about it. Like, you can honestly show your appreciation if you enjoy

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:45.840
something to tell someone. But yeah, I've, yes, seen, this seems to be a common pattern that

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:54.560
people have difficulty with receiving them. More so with guys maybe, than girls, although even then.

01:12:54.560 --> 01:13:00.960
That's an interesting one. Because with women, for sure, they hide ambition. They downplay success

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.680
and stuff like that. Certainly, female to female communication, I think there is

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:11.600
more opaqueness and more fuckery that goes on with regards to that. If a guy thinks that you've

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.520
done something shit, they go, dude, that was lame. Whereas it might be couched in some other

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:20.320
sort of language from a woman. Yeah, that'd be interesting. I'd love someone to look at

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.120
since the versus insincerity compliments from comparing men and women. That'd be a fascinating

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:30.000
study. This morning, I was, I was prepping a newsletter. It'll go out tomorrow. You know,

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.280
I do like a three, you know, interesting findings. Everyone needs to go to Rob's

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.960
substack and subscribe. It's outstanding. Thank you, man.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:40.960
And I shamelessly repurpose at least one thing every like couple of weeks.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.840
You know, I think like, well, the findings deserved as wide an audience as possible,

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:48.800
but this was an interesting one. It'll go out where, so this was a study from 1988. I'd be

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.840
curious to see, like, I don't, I couldn't find anything more recent, but essentially,

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:58.960
they broke down by gender, the domain of, of, of where people deliver their compliments. And so

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.920
for women, it was, when women compliment women versus when men compliment men,

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:07.280
what are they complimenting? For women, it was mostly appearance. It was like something like

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:13.200
60% of the compliments were about appearance. And then it was like 15% about possessions and 10%

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:18.480
about accomplishments and that kind of thing. Whereas, so it was mostly appearance based for

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:23.040
women when they're complimenting one another. Whereas for men, it was mostly based on

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:29.840
accomplishments. Most of their compliments to one another were about accomplishments.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:36.720
And so one thing that I would wonder is like, maybe it's, I wonder if it's kind of easier or,

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:41.280
or more difficult depending on, so, so I would imagine like for women when they receive compliments

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:46.320
about their appearance, because it seems to be the most common domain that they would receive

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:49.680
those quite easily because they're used to it. Whereas for accomplishments, that makes them feel

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:53.280
uncomfortable in some way. And if you're a guy, if I go to you and I'm like,

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:58.000
dude, you're looking buff. Tell me about, tell me about how good my last newsletter was.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I wonder if like we would feel more uncomfortable when it's something

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:07.680
other than, than the target. That's so fascinating. And yet again, it shows just how

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:15.040
people's, people's behaviors zeroes in on the most salient parts of each sex's characteristics.

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:20.080
So women are complimenting the most important thing to the opposite sex.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.760
Men are complimenting the most important thing to the opposite sex. The same thing

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:29.280
happens with derogation as well. You know, if there's an argument between a guy and a woman

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:32.800
on the internet, the woman's going to say he's got small dick energy and the guy's going to call her

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.800
a slag, right? That's it. It's like, I'm going to derogate your chastity. I'm going to derogate

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.280
your sexual prowess. I'm going to say that you're not as competent or as rich or as good looking

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:45.200
or as like successful as you think you are. And I'm going to say that you're like fatter

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:50.000
older and uglier than you are. Why? Well, those are the most important things that you have with

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.800
regards to social currency. And these are the same people who will throw these sorts of insults

01:15:54.800 --> 01:16:00.480
around like, you know, Greta Thunberg accused Andrew Tate of having small dick energy. Like

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:05.520
it's, I think it's the third most liked tweet of all time or something like that. I think she's,

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:11.040
I think she's in the top 10 twice. And I think Tate features in the top 10

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.640
twice or three times and at least maybe one or two of those are his interactions

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.440
with Greta Thunberg. So kind of, I don't know, like,

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:25.440
he's like the Michael Jackson to her Janet Jackson or something like very, very successful when

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:31.840
they get together. Yeah, I think that, yeah, the same people who would probably endorse

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:38.960
like some form of gender blank slate egalitarianism or deny that there are any sort of biologically

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:43.280
based sex differences will still sort of target those areas of insecurity.

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:47.680
It's the same as the Harvard Extension School thing. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:52.240
Yeah. So yeah, that's, yeah. So if, um, yeah, if you're, you know, a very progressive person,

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.760
but then a man is annoying you online, you'll immediately start telling him that he's, you

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:59.440
know, a virgin or he's, you know, exactly fucking incel like, oh, okay.

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:04.080
Well, if you throw that debate around, speaking of that,

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:08.720
Alexander Datesyke just put a new study out. Did you see this one? He hasn't released the

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.760
details, but he's capturing the data at the moment on it through a Google form.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:22.080
It's so funny. He's put videos up asking participants to rank the attractiveness of

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:26.480
different red pill influences. Okay. So there's the guys from Fresh and Fit,

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:32.080
who else is in there? I don't know. There's like a bunch of other people that are in there.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:36.880
And, uh, it's got the replies are so funny. I gotta look at it. So it's on, it's on Twitter.

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:40.320
Like these, these, correct. Him mining for the data is on Twitter. The results aren't,

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.960
he's, he's currently, he only put it out yesterday, I think. I gotta look at this.

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:50.000
And, um, dude, I have to, is he on there? I'm not, I'm not, and he's not. He went like more

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:59.360
kind of like another big names within that world or whatever. But, um, he is, Alex has an ability,

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:08.320
I don't think I've ever, ever seen you get into a spat on Twitter. I don't think I,

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.920
I don't think you've ever had a back and forth, despite having like hundreds of thousands of

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:19.680
people that follow you. Uh, Gwinda likes to kind of, he's more like a hit man. So he'll sit

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:26.320
upon a ridge and look out and then he'll like fire something. And it's like AOC. It'll be

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:32.160
like a single reply to AOC with 500 likes from him. And then nothing, he won't tweet for another

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:39.760
week. Honestly, he pops out of the wilderness looks and he's like, adjust the site fires

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:47.280
and then leaves. Um, but I mean, Alexander goes in with incels, incel co, uh, that account that

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:53.200
I think is the admin of the incels.co thing. He's back and forth with like anyone, like egg and

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:57.920
non accounts. Like if he sees, and you've got this essay and it's really well written, but, um,

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:03.840
his capacity, he's kind of like the destiny of dating research. You know, he's just got this

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.760
predisposition that's very good for being able to put up for anyone that doesn't know who we're

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.280
talking about. He's been on the show, Alexander dates, I think it's like at Alex dates, I gone

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:16.720
on Twitter. Just look, whatever day this goes out on, look at who he's going tweets and replies

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:20.880
and have a look at how many people he's arguing with. And I promise you, they'll just be mountains,

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.960
like tons and tons and tons. And it's no one, it's nobody. And then sometimes it's a somebody, but

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.960
I think he's performing a much needed service because I don't have the patience for that.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:34.560
I think like, you know, professors and researchers and podcast, like just people who have like a

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:40.400
million things to do. And I think like, but he, he's, he's doing it very well and he's building

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:44.320
an audience this way. And I think, you know, it's, it's, it's, he's channeling his, his knowledge

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:49.200
and his research toward productive ends. And you know, I think it, someone should be engaging

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:55.280
with a lot of these like black pills, you know, it's a fucking high price. Do you see that we got

01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:04.880
lumped into, uh, uh, we, we got given a name. Oh, we did me, you, William Costello and Alexander

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:10.240
dates, like, and it's the academic manosphere. Okay. Good company. I like it. I think that's,

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:14.240
that's a pretty good, I was in there. Yeah. I think so. Okay. I think you were. It was a long

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.840
time ago on this day. It was like maybe months ago and I did, I forgot to send it to you. But

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:21.600
yeah, the academic, the academic manosphere types, it was used as a slur, but I was like,

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:26.240
yo, if you want this to be a slur, make it less cool of a name. Like it's a fucking dope. I want

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:31.520
to be a part of the academic manosphere. Yeah. Yeah. I got, I got lumped in a couple of years ago

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:36.560
with it was some like, you know, like someone was like trying to create like a league of the IDW.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:40.000
This was back when the IDW was still, I think it was still a thing or it was kind of on the

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:46.320
way down. It was like 2020, 2021. And yeah, I was like in the minor leagues. It was like, you know,

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:52.080
they're heavy hitters, Eric Weinstein. Yeah. And then it was back then, I don't know what,

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:55.120
I have like 10,000 followers or something. And it was like, that would have been probably after

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:59.120
your university of Austin thing, maybe around about that time. It was before then even, it was

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:04.560
like, you know, I think you and I had just met and it was like still kind of early days. And I

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.320
was looking at this, I'm like, I don't want to, you know, like, I like some of the people who

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:11.200
are, were whatever. I don't know if it's not really still a thing anymore, but I like some of

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:14.720
those people are like, I'm not really in this IDW thing. Like, I thought it was kind of, yeah.

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:22.000
So talking about you moving into the real, you know, upper stratosphere, troposphere of

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:30.000
class moving through your time in the Air Force. What about when you got to Yale

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:35.200
first and then Cambridge? What was some of the conventions that really sort of stood out to

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:40.880
you? Because I think this has informed a lot of your ability to sit back and look at these

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:45.920
dynamics and go, oh, isn't that interesting? Because you have an anchoring bias to be able to

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.400
compare it to. You're like, I saw this thing, and then I saw this, and then I saw that. So I'm

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:54.960
actually able to observe these dynamics for what they are, rather than kind of, I get to see code

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:58.080
rather than matrix as opposed to have only ever grown up inside of the matrix.

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:06.880
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, so yeah, I arrived on campus 2015 as a, you know, mature student, and

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:12.480
Asian, so looking like a normal age student. I think I had the beard back then. So I had like a

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:15.680
full beard, you know, so this is like a very common thing with vets, where like, because you have to

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:20.320
shave every day, and they like inspect you to make sure it's like, it better be like this morning

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:27.280
you shave, not last night kind of thing. And so as soon as I got on like, you know, I didn't work

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.520
out, dude, I think I gained like 20 pounds. Like it was the first semester was bad, where I was like,

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:35.840
I was like, I don't have to work out anymore. Yeah, it was really nice. And then like, I don't,

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:41.840
I like looked in the mirror, like six months in, I was like, I gotta take this. But the first six

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:48.160
months, it was glorious. And so, but yeah, I looked older, I was older, and you know, the

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.040
students, some of them would crack jokes about 21 Jump Street, you know, like that kind of thing.

01:22:53.040 --> 01:23:00.160
And yeah, it was like the first couple of months or so, nothing really unusual. But then

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:07.440
I saw this very strange, you know, I mentioned before, like witness the kind of birth of this new

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:15.840
politically correct movement where a professor had written an email, essentially defending

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:20.320
freedom of expression on campus later became known as the Yale Halloween Halloween costume

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:27.360
controversy on campus where this was October, the Yale administration released this email,

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:32.560
basically telling the students to, you know, not engage in any cultural appropriation, don't wear

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:38.000
costumes that would be offensive to these groups. And then one of the faculty members on campus

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.000
basically wrote an email just to her students in her residential college saying like, do we really

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.560
need the administration interfering in our lives? Like, you're all adults, I trust that if you wear

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:50.080
things that maybe you don't other people don't like, you guys can just work it out amongst

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:55.280
yourselves, essentially defending freedom of expression. And in response, hundreds of students

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:59.760
marched around campus, calling for her to be fired. And later for her husband, Nicholas Christakis,

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:04.640
to be fired, saying that she was racist, she was defending cultural appropriation, these students

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:10.720
claim they didn't feel safe on campus. And they were using this kind of language, which I think

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:14.080
like now all of this stuff is kind of spilled out of the universities and we're all kind of familiar

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:19.600
with all this sort of victimhood stuff. But back then I was just completely like flummoxed

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:25.040
that, you know, was like, we're in danger, we, you know, they caused us pain, suffering, we're

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:31.040
under immense harm. You know, this is like a emblematic of, you know, broader systemic forces

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:35.040
that are working against. And I'm looking at these students and like, I know for a fact,

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:40.000
a lot of them were the sons and daughters of millionaires. I remember asking one

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:46.080
young female student, basically, like, can you explain, like, why is this offensive?

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:52.800
I don't understand. And she basically told me I was too privileged to understand why, you know,

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:59.440
why Erica Christakis' email was offensive. Wow. And, you know, she was like some white girl who

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:04.640
like went to private boarding school and like grew up in a rich neighborhood, but she was an activist

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:09.840
and whatever. And so she was like kind of the, is it the Titiana McGrath, like that archetype,

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:16.160
except like, you know, went to Yale and everything. And so, and that was like an interesting thing,

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:22.240
too, was like, on campus, the whole identity politics idea was that if you are a member of

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:28.880
these certain sociological categories, then therefore you are conferred legitimacy to opine

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:34.400
on all of the social ills of the world and how to fix them and so on. But then the students also

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:40.320
placed a great deal of importance on lived experience, you know, and if you live through

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:44.800
something in your life, then therefore you're able to speak about certain things, you're

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:49.840
an authority on those matters. But those two things seem to be, to me, contradictory that,

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.280
you know, does it matter what you live through in your life or does it just matter like what

01:25:53.280 --> 01:26:00.160
you, what category you belong to? Isn't it interesting that you had 17-year

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:06.160
squalor legitimacy when it comes to lived experience, but the number one thing which is

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:11.600
ignored is class? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. And it was, I mean, yeah, they,

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.320
because there are so few people who had my kind of background on campus and because so few

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:22.160
students and graduates of these kinds of universities ever encounter it, it just

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.720
isn't on their radar that they don't even think about. I mean, what's really interesting was

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.800
that Yale is located in New Haven, which is a really low income kind of blue collar town.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:34.800
But, you know, they call it the Yale bubble where, you know, the students would only stick

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:41.200
around in this very sort of, you know, enclosed area. But I lived off campus in an apartment

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:46.720
downtown. And so I would walk through like a lot of poverty, a lot of squalor, a lot of addiction.

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:51.600
And, you know, having, you know, 20 minutes earlier heard some student talk about how they

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:58.320
were oppressed. And then I'd see, you know, real poverty and real suffering. And I was just very

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:02.320
difficult for me to sort of reconcile those things. And eventually, like, at first, I tried to be

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:07.600
sympathetic and tried to understand these, you know, these grievances and the students and the

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:13.200
graduates and the faculty and all these, you know, and then eventually I was like, these people have,

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:16.800
you know, they just completely don't understand, they have no connection with it whatsoever. And

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:24.000
some of it I think is legitimately malicious and duplicitous. I would see, for example,

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:30.960
people claim that investment banks were emblematic of capitalist oppression

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:36.320
and say that, you know, these are just, you know, these horrible entities. And then those

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:41.520
same people would be at a recruitment session for Goldman Sachs like two weeks later. And I think,

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:47.280
like, you know, that to be was like, that was a calculated move. Like, and what I mean by that

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:51.840
is like, I don't want to work for them. Yeah, like if they can basically eliminate their rivals

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:55.840
for these prestigious internships, then all the better for them. And so I think some of it was

01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.960
tactical and calculated. But I think for a lot of people, it's just, you know, their hearts are

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:05.280
in the right place, or they're not really thinking that much about it. And so yeah, this was,

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:11.440
yeah, it was very strange. And then the other thing is, so this is funny, I never knew my

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:18.720
father growing up, and I didn't know who he was or anything about him. And it was only recently,

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:25.920
I took a 23 and me and got the results and found that my father was Mexican. And I went through,

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.600
I called up our mutual friend, Rizib Khan, I was like, Hey, can you look at this with me and like

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:34.080
help explain? He's like, Yeah, your dad was like, you know, Mexican, he was like, Indigenous from

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:38.080
North America with some Spanish ancestries, like that's like a perfect, he's like, you grew up in

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:43.360
LA, man, like, what did you expect? And like, okay, so my dad was Mexican. But so when I was at Yale,

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:47.520
before I had this information, I was hanging out in a dorm room with some students. And it was a

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:52.000
friend of mine, who was a Mexican guy. And, you know, he, he was not like, you know, he wasn't

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.960
an activist, he wasn't like, woke or whatever. But I took a sombrero off the wall and put it on my

01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.880
head. And he was joking around, but he said something like, Hey, you know, that's cultural

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:04.400
appropriation, you can't wear that sombrero. I was like, Oh, my bad, you know, joking around. And

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:09.200
then once I got these results back, I was like, wait a minute, I'm allowed to wear that sombrero.

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.760
I could wear that sombrero. Get me a poncho, get me some fajitas. And then, and then the next

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:18.160
that I had, but the next that I had was like, this just shows how like how stupid the whole thing

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:23.200
is in the first place, right? Like, someone from my background who didn't know my father, who could

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:27.440
have been like, I could have believed like if I had believed in the cultural appropriation thing,

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:31.840
I could have bought into it. And now what am I supposed to think? Now that I have these DNA

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:36.480
test results. And then I, you know, just like the whole idea of like breaking people down into

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.200
like these ethnic categories, and they are or are not allowed to partake in this activity or that

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:47.840
or the other. Like, when when there are people out there who actually don't know who their fathers

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:52.640
are, or don't know, they don't even know what cultural appropriation means. I just think like,

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:56.960
our our attention and our resources and our time are spent on such such frivolous nonsense.

01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:59.760
But is it the tyranny of small differences? What's that thing?

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:06.720
Yeah, the narcissism of small differences. That's it. Yeah, that the smaller the differences between

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:11.520
people, the bigger that they're blown up to be. When you have this relatively homogenous group of

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:17.200
people at Yale, it's all to do with you can't speak to her like that. It's like, why? Like, she's

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:24.880
she's exactly the same as you, just that one grandmother's half African American or something.

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:29.840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and everyone is from like the top, probably the top decile of income.

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:34.160
I mean, at Yale, there are more students from the top 1% of the income scale than from the

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:40.480
entire bottom 60%. Like, almost everybody is either I mean, and like, yeah, this is an interesting

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:46.000
point, the narcissism of small differences where a lot of the anger I felt was it was like between

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.840
like someone at the 90th percentile income, who they were angry at that 99th percentile, right?

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:56.640
Like, you know, whatever, like someone from a family of whatever doctors and lawyers who are

01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:00.880
sort of upper middle class who are angry that the children of billionaires get to do something a

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:04.800
little more expensive or a little bit more, you know, they get to go on a more expensive vacation,

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:10.160
or, you know, like all of that was was very much confined with people who are extremely

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:14.000
affluent and well to do. And then there were, you know, a handful of people like me. I mean,

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.840
I, I'm the only one who had like the kind of life that I had, but I knew some people from more

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:21.680
kind of blue collar background. The underclass bona fides. Yeah, exactly. Who are really just

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:26.880
kind of like lower middle class blue collar, but not not like, I mean, it's the thing is like the

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:31.120
way that the system works is, I think we might have talked about this last time about just how

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:37.600
few people like only less than 3% of foster kids graduate from university, less than 3%.

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:44.400
And, you know, people who are from the bottom income quintile, it's 11%. And so, you know,

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:47.600
really, there are more, you know, you're four times more likely to graduate from college if

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.320
you're poor than if you live through the foster system. I mean, that's just how

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:55.360
the odds are so stacked against you. And so, yeah, I mean, even the people I knew who,

01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:00.080
so I think I was one of like eight veterans on campus, you know, people think of the military

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:04.000
as like, oh, kind of like people who maybe didn't go to college or people who had maybe sort of a

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:10.000
more hard scrabble life, which is maybe to some extent true compared to people who go to expensive

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.960
colleges. But I was, so I was one of eight military vets on campus. But even when I would interact

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:22.720
with the other vets and listed vets in my cohort, so there were eight in my cohort, and I would speak

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:25.920
with them, I was like, oh, like, basically all of them were raised by two parents and like, you

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:30.640
know, had a mom and a dad who did prioritize education and who, you know, kind of said good

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:36.800
examples and, you know, all of those things. And I think, yeah, we focus a lot on, I think the

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:41.600
left focuses a lot on economics. I think certain strands of the right will focus on behavioral

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:47.120
genetics. But there is this sort of cultural component here, too, that people don't really

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:54.240
seem to want to touch. At some point, I will write this post up about sort of the limitations of

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:58.400
sort of overextending the findings of behavioral genetics. I think like, it's an important thing

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:04.240
to know and to understand and to sort of be fluent in, but also to not discount the role of

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:10.400
good habits, customs, sort of good behaviors. I wrote this post, nobody's a prisoner of their IQ.

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:16.800
And I think that's an important piece, too, that it's true that the guys I grew up with,

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:24.560
regardless of their parenting or whatever their economic conditions were, they probably weren't

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:31.760
going to be in a position to go to a very expensive, you know, selective university.

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:38.880
But I think if they had been maybe taught different values and inculcated different habits,

01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:43.920
that, you know, two of them wouldn't have gone to prison. One of them was shot to death.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:49.280
Friends working sort of menial, low income jobs. I mean, that's the sort of typical outcome of

01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:53.440
people in that community. And I don't think like maybe we can't necessarily raise the ceiling for

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.440
some people. We can definitely raise the floor, I think.

01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:00.960
Yeah. And so one of the last episodes I did in this room was with destiny. And he prompted this

01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:06.240
idea that I named two step potential theory, which is a blending of individual agency with

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:11.360
real world limitations. Your efforts have tons of control over your outcome within the range that

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:16.000
your world's limitations will allow. Behavioral genetics teaches us that on average, around 50%

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.080
of everything that we are psychologically is inherited from our parents, boo, 50% of our

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:25.120
outcomes are limited by our genetics. Yes, but that also means that 50% of them are up to you,

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:29.280
which is great. This is another reason to not only compare yourself to who you were yesterday,

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:33.440
not to who someone else is today, but it's also a reason to try lots of things

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:36.240
until you find the intersection of something that you love and something that you're good at.

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:43.840
Yeah, it's like, you can imagine that you have a bracket within which your potential sits.

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:50.800
And that bracket is determined very heavily by outside forces. It's genetic predisposition,

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:56.240
it's life circumstances, it's nutrition, it's upbringing, it's the fucking unconscious trauma,

01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:01.280
it's all the epigenetics, it's all of that stuff. But your position within that window

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:06.160
is almost exclusively on you. Now, that window also determines your ability to deploy your

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:09.440
efforts. But that just moves the window, that doesn't move you within the window.

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:13.600
James Clear has this nice line in Atomic Habits about how

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.000
certain people become so preoccupied with their genetic limitations that they never

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.960
try to actually reach them. I love that quote. Yeah, it's incredible. And I think people understand

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:26.960
this at least in the context of physical fitness. It's like, well, I'm never going to look like

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:30.160
Arnold Schwarzenegger, so I'm just not going to go to the gym, which is like a completely

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:36.960
misguided way to think about things. But yeah, I like this line about sort of behavioral genetics,

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:42.720
but then also there is individual agency involved. And you do have some control over this. I mean,

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:50.080
I just wrote this post about Machiavelli and how in the Discourses on Livy, he writes about how

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:54.720
he basically says, God doesn't want to do everything. He's like, some of it is up to you.

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:59.920
So he was in a much more religious time than we are living in Italy in Catholic Florence.

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:06.320
And God doesn't want to do everything. But then he says, you know, basically, 50% of your outcomes

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:11.280
are due to fortune, 50% of your outcomes are due to your own individual efforts, and fortune will

01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:16.160
favor you if you take action, these kinds of things. There's a political philosopher, Harvey

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:20.960
Mansfield, who actually suggested that this transition indicates that Machiavelli may have

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:24.800
been an atheist, because at first he starts out saying, God doesn't want to do everything. And

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:29.520
then he starts saying, 50% is fortune and 50% is you. Well, where does that leave room for God?

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.840
And Machiavelli may have been sort of subtly indicating to the reader that, you know, you

01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:37.120
can talk about God, you can think about God, but ultimately it's going to be luck and it's going

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:43.120
to be you and that's all you have. Or God has got his percentages wrong. Yeah, exactly. So one of

01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:48.240
the things, I looked at your end of your review that you did, and that actually reminded me that

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:53.200
I hadn't done mine, is in the breakdown of what were the 10, I think you did the 10 most

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:56.240
read free articles and paid articles, which you'll still be up on your website and people

01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:00.560
can go and check that out. And that prompted me while I was back home in the UK that,

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:04.960
fuck, I haven't done mine for modern wisdom. So thank you for that. But the best read article

01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:10.080
that you had last year was one called How I Read. And there's this great screenshot from

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:16.320
Taleb in there. Taleb says, the opposite of reading is not not reading, but reading something

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:20.080
like the New Yorker. I love that line so much. What do you think he means by that?

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:25.360
You know, Taleb is so that you know, there's a screenshot from Twitter, I think there's,

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:30.240
you know, there is the sort of Twitter Taleb and then there's the the author. There's different,

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:34.400
you know, there's different versions of him. But I the way that I interpreted that, you know,

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:42.560
the contankerous tweet from Taleb was that, you know, if reading is defined as, you know, consuming

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:49.600
useful, important, timeless information, then, you know, reading, you know, the sort of hot takes in,

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:57.360
you know, legacy media institutions, you know, often, you know, colored by bias, colored by the

01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:01.920
ideologies of our time that, you know, that's actually the opposite of getting useful, you

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:07.120
know, important, timeless information, you're getting sort of unuseful, unimportant, timely,

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:11.280
you know, relevant, maybe in the moment, and then tomorrow people will forget all about it.

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:16.640
And so I think that's kind of what he meant here. And you know, to be fair, like I wrote in there

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:20.720
that I do enjoy reading The New Yorker sometimes, but but not as much as I enjoy that tweet.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:24.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What's your advice for people who want to become better readers?

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:28.400
I mean, it's, it's a habit, you know, I've been sort of sort of, you know, touching on this,

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:35.120
on this idea of discipline of habit of agency. And I think it's, it's similar to a gym routine,

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:41.040
right, where when you're starting out, it's, it's difficult, it's, you know, sort of building it

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:46.960
into your schedule. But then once you get going, it becomes much easier to just sort of set it

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:50.880
and forget it that, you know, from these hours, from this time of day, I'm, you know, I'm going

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:54.080
to the gym and here's the workout and here's the routine. And now you don't have to think about

01:38:54.080 --> 01:39:00.000
it anymore, that sort of discipline equals freedom idea. And so I did that with reading.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:07.200
I've really been kind of on and off reader since I was a kid. I taught myself how to read in the

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:13.360
foster homes. And then reading became this kind of, like the suiting experience for me that I could

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:18.960
sort of, you know, disconnect from the world and learn about information and, yeah, exactly.

01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:25.920
And so I would do that. And so it's always been a sort of a companion for me. But, you know,

01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:30.240
with, with, you know, everyone gets busy, everyone has a million things that they have to do,

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:34.080
they have work, they have obligations. But for reading, yeah, it really does, you really have

01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:37.680
to treat it like a gym routine or like a job or something like an important habit, set time

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:42.000
aside every day. And so this is what I was doing in, in grad school was, you know, first thing in

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.600
the morning, I'd have my cup of coffee and I try to read whatever, you know, five pages,

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:50.880
10 pages, 15 pages, whatever it is. If people don't really have the reading habit at all,

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:55.120
I do like James Clear's idea of like, start from like the lowest unit of effort possible,

01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:59.040
like sentence. Yeah, sentence. Yeah, I mean, it'd be really weird if you started from the word

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:03.200
level, but yeah, sentence level or a paragraph level, you know, ideally you could get a page in,

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:08.640
you know, something substantive, and then build your way from there, whether it's a chapter,

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.680
whether it's a book, and so on. And I think, yeah, breaking it down in that way is helpful,

01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:14.400
because, you know, I speak to some people who want to read and they're like, okay,

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.280
I'm going to try to finish this book this week, or I'm going to try to finish this

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:21.040
book this month. And I think like, thinking in those terms isn't really helpful, I think you

01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:25.920
have to break it down further of, instead of a book a month, I'm going to read three pages a day

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:32.160
or 10 pages a day. And then you'll finish the book when it gets finished. The other thing is,

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:36.080
if a book is uninteresting to you, or it's not holding your attention to just let it go,

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:40.400
you know, it's fine, you don't have to read it just because you bought it, or because you

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:43.600
rented it from the library or what have you. Because everybody else says that it's good,

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:47.760
or because you read on Twitter that it's really informative. You want to tell the people that

01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.760
you've read it, that they've read it as well. Right. And yeah, you don't, I mean, that's one of the,

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:55.520
I was one of the things that I learned too, was, you know, a lot of people, a lot of the sort of

01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:59.280
chattering class people, they will not read the books that they claim to have read, but they'll

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:04.160
read reviews. And so if you want to just like know about a book, to participate in a conversation,

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:09.600
just go read three or four reviews online. And that'll sort of give you the highlights of what

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:13.840
people are talking about, or what the takeaways are that people care about from the book. But if

01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:17.120
you really want to do a deep dive, if you really want to understand a book, then yeah, you have to

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:21.040
read the whole thing cover to cover, but you know, take it slow, do what you're comfortable with.

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:25.360
If you want to skip around, that's fine too, that if a particular chapter title sticks out,

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:29.440
it seems to be especially provocative or interesting, start with that chapter first,

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:34.080
and then you can go back. I would recommend for most books, especially most older books,

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:43.200
to actually read the preface, the, you know, author's note, the foreword, because for a lot of

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:48.160
sort of older texts, you know, I mentioned Machiavelli earlier, it does help that those,

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:53.360
you know, the prologues and all those kinds of things, they will sort of contextualize the book

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:57.280
and sort of explain to some degree, why is this book important? Why do people care about it?

01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:02.800
What's been the sort of commentary summary of this author's influence throughout the centuries?

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:05.520
And so I do recommend reading that and not just skipping to chapter one.

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:12.320
And yeah, I mean, there are other things too that you can read multiple books simultaneously,

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:17.040
there's no rule in place. I think we learned from school that one book at a time, you know,

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:22.880
read this and hear the formula for how you read. But actually, you can do whatever you want, skip

01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:27.760
around, read two pages of this book, put it down, you know, take a week off, read this other book

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:31.440
for a while, I'll do that when I'm on vacation, I'll just start a new book. Even if I'm working on

01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:35.600
three other books back home, I'll just pick up a new book off the shelf and go on vacation. And

01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:41.680
that'll be my vacation book. I do weird things like that. And for me, it's helpful. And, and the

01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:47.120
other thing is it's helpful to take notes to whether it's in the book itself, people get mad

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:50.720
at me sometimes on Twitter, they're like, Oh, you're defacing that book, like, Oh,

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:55.200
fucking bought it. Yeah, my book. Exactly. Yeah, it's not like I'm vandalized. You know,

01:42:55.200 --> 01:43:01.440
there's a there's a really good book called how to read a book called Mortimer Adler by Mortimer

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:08.160
Adler. And he's, he was a professor at the University of Chicago in the mid mid late 20th

01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:13.120
century. But he wrote this book basically, like, explaining the different forms of reading,

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:15.760
the different types of reading. And this is where I picked up a lot of this information

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:21.360
about it's okay to skip around what are your goals for reading, break down the habit. But

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:27.600
one of the points he's made is that no one missed, he makes this analogy says no one mistakes the

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:33.520
what are they called in in the composers of music, like the sheet, the sheet music or something,

01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:39.760
no one confuses that for the melody itself, right? It's like no one's, you know, it's not the paper

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:45.680
is not sacred, the ideas on them are sacred. And most authors would be flattered if someone was

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:50.480
so invested in the book and the topic that added their own fucking, yeah, and the marginalia.

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:56.000
And like, yeah, I mean, it's you see this with like, if you visit museums, you know, Cambridge,

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.480
they have like Darwin's notes or his scribblings of other people's texts. And you can see like he

01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:05.520
was reading and he was making notes. And, and he was doing this in a time where it was actually

01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:13.440
harder to get books than it is now. And so engage with the book. Try to understand what the points

01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.800
are in the book. Don't just I mean, this is something that I used to do, even though I was a

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:24.160
reader, I didn't really, I didn't really try to understand what the book was about before I started

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:28.080
it. It was like, Oh, here's an interesting title. And I'd read the back of it. And it would be,

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:32.880
Oh, it's about x, y, z. And I'll, okay, I'll just start reading it and sort of fumble my way through.

01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:38.240
Rather than think about, okay, where's this author coming from? What point is he trying to make?

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:43.040
Why is this book important? Try to take that sort of metal level perspective as well,

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:46.880
so that you can really understand where he's coming from and break down the points.

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:53.440
If you really want to, especially for more modern social science books, one thing you can do is

01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:58.160
essentially just read the first and last chapter or the preface in the last chapter. Because,

01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:02.000
you know, that's just the way that's just a style of reading or style of writing now where,

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.080
you know, publishers want you to just basically summarize the idea at the beginning and the

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:10.640
end for busy people for tired people. What's this book about, you know, like, what are you going

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:14.560
to talk about? And then at the end say, here's what I talked about. And that'll sort of give you,

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:19.360
you know, maybe 50%. What a funny hack. That's so funny. What about revisiting

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:24.800
things? Because your recall seems to be quite impressive, which is something that people want.

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:30.160
They want to, reading something and then not being able to recall what you read is kind of,

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:37.200
in some ways, like not having read it at all. Yeah, well, I think taking notes, highlighting,

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:41.440
and then what I'll do is like, you know, I'll have like a Google doc or some kind of

01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:45.680
note-taking app where I'll like cut and paste if it's like Kindle version or if it's the paper

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.000
version. I'll sometimes I'll just post it on Twitter. And then that'll be like the search

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.840
function where I can find it later. Or I can, yeah, I'll just let it get deleted from Twitter.

01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:59.600
I know that would be not the access to the audience. It's my own archive of my notes.

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:05.360
Exactly. That would be that would be rough. Yeah. Yeah. And so yeah, so I think sharing it in that

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:08.880
way. And that's actually how my Twitter started was me just sharing notes and things I was reading.

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:13.200
That's like how the initial sort of growth occurred was, you know, I was in, I think it was an

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:20.800
undergrad when I started it in 2017, posting my notes online and my highlights and underlines and

01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:28.160
and so yeah, I think like pinpointing the interesting points, doing like a very brief

01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:32.800
summary, even it's literally one sentence, preferably a paragraph. If you finish a book,

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:37.360
like what did you get from this book? What are two or three things that you remember right now

01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:41.040
having just finished read it? Because if you if you have just finished reading a book,

01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:45.600
the most important or interesting or provocative points will be at the top of your mind.

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:48.480
Just try to paraphrase it. Don't even go back to the book and say, well, what did he actually say?

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:54.480
Try to say, what did I remember? Type it out, try to use that, that forced recall. And that'll help to

01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:01.920
to to sort of get it into long term memory. And then every once in a while, like if I'm flying

01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:06.480
on a plane, or if I'm, you know, in waiting in line or something, usually I'll read a book,

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:09.760
but sometimes I'll actually just revisit my notes and say, you know, what did that book say? Or what

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:14.720
was that point? And do like a control f if I just want to read about whatever mating psychology

01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:18.160
or what have you, I'll just do the control f and okay, here are my notes on mating psychology

01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:22.880
from David Buss or this book or that book. And that'll help me to just sort of connect the dots

01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:29.440
and and and also help to provide material for my sub stack, which is most important, obviously.

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:32.560
Rob, I appreciate the hell out of you. It's very good to speak to you again. I'm so happy that

01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:37.840
this book's finally out. It's taken forever. Yeah, it's been five years plus. Yeah, in the making.

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:41.520
Yeah, that this has been going and then it's been ready to be published for a good while as well.

01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:46.160
And you've been sort of held at the starting line. So where should people go? They want to check out

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:50.080
the book that substack the everything else? Yeah, they can get my book troubled, a memoir,

01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:53.600
foster care, family and social class, that's, you know, wherever, wherever books are sold.

01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:58.720
