WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.160
If we were to look at ourselves through the lens of an experiment like we would an animal experiment

00:05.160 --> 00:11.380
We think that animal is sick if you saw an animal digging in the corner looking looking looking looking for a bone the dog

00:11.380 --> 00:17.160
Is looking looking looking looking looking and you'd think that's really sad. That's us, right? That's us

00:17.160 --> 00:19.160
I'm pointing it myself intentionally. That's us

00:21.800 --> 00:26.840
Dr. Andrew Huberman welcome to the show great to be here. It's been a long time coming very long time coming

00:26.880 --> 00:30.600
What do you mean when you say you cannot control the mind with the mind?

00:31.320 --> 00:37.960
Yeah, that statement really emerges from the fact that if we are in a pretty relaxed state or

00:38.360 --> 00:40.360
If we are happy

00:40.400 --> 00:45.740
We generally feel like we can do what we want to do. We can maneuver through our environment

00:46.080 --> 00:48.680
We can make choices that are reasonable

00:49.120 --> 00:56.440
But oftentimes we're not in relaxed and happy states. That's just part of the human experience obviously and there's a

00:56.920 --> 00:58.920
Fundamental feature to the nervous system

00:59.240 --> 01:02.320
Which is this thing they call the autonomic nervous system

01:02.320 --> 01:08.720
Which is just fancy nerd speak for the components of your nervous system that raise your levels of alertness or bring them

01:08.720 --> 01:14.960
Way down sometimes we hear fight or flight rest and digest, but this system governs all that but a lot more and

01:16.400 --> 01:19.480
basically what happens is when we are at the extremes of

01:20.160 --> 01:22.880
the autonomic what I call seesaw of

01:23.240 --> 01:31.320
Very very alert to the point of being really stressed or panicked or concerned or if we are very close to sleep and we're drowsy and we're exhausted

01:32.080 --> 01:33.920
at those

01:33.920 --> 01:35.920
points along the

01:36.640 --> 01:37.640
autonomic

01:37.640 --> 01:39.000
Nervous system

01:39.000 --> 01:43.520
Our thoughts become a bit like a runaway train, you know if you're very upset

01:43.960 --> 01:48.160
It's hard to talk yourself out of it if you're stressed. It's hard to think yourself out of it

01:48.280 --> 01:51.680
In fact, you can start doing all sorts of third-personing and

01:52.400 --> 01:58.840
Rationalization you can call someone you can text somebody. It's very hard to get yourself out of those states with thinking alone

01:59.560 --> 02:03.080
But the beauty of the autonomic nervous system is that it

02:03.760 --> 02:08.920
Traverses the brain and the body and it connects to essentially all the organs of the body

02:08.920 --> 02:13.760
And it's a two-way street such that certain behaviors

02:14.520 --> 02:16.520
Even certain patterns of breathing

02:17.400 --> 02:19.400
Etc allow us to

02:20.120 --> 02:24.160
Shift where we are on the autonomic continuum

02:24.760 --> 02:27.440
between very very alert and stressed and very calm and

02:28.280 --> 02:35.800
thereby give our mind a shift also in terms of the kinds of thoughts that we can entertain the sorts of

02:36.120 --> 02:41.520
Actions that we can engage in to make this concrete if you're very very stressed. We're very very upset

02:42.040 --> 02:44.720
Two things happen one. It's very hard to take your focus off

02:45.000 --> 02:50.480
Whatever it is that's upsetting you and if you don't know what's upsetting you knew pure anxiety, but you don't know why

02:50.480 --> 02:53.280
It's very hard to take your mind off of the feelings of anxiety

02:54.840 --> 02:56.840
In those states of mind

02:57.360 --> 03:02.440
There's another component which is that for whatever reason and no one really understands why this is

03:02.440 --> 03:05.600
It feels as if the state that you're in will go on forever

03:06.160 --> 03:09.640
Now when we're in happy relaxed states rarely do we think gosh?

03:09.640 --> 03:15.080
This is going to go on forever and yet when we are in these unfortunate states of mind

03:15.200 --> 03:21.060
We get the idea somehow it was sort of hijacks our perception of time and we feel like this is never going to stop

03:21.760 --> 03:24.920
If we turn to the body and certain behaviors

03:25.320 --> 03:27.320
Let me talk about what those are

03:27.320 --> 03:34.200
We are able to move ourselves along the autonomic continuum and at that point when we've done that successfully

03:34.360 --> 03:36.360
It's actually quite straightforward to do

03:36.600 --> 03:38.800
We are able to think about things differently

03:39.080 --> 03:42.120
We start to get a sense that the way we feel

03:42.560 --> 03:45.480
might not be the way we're going to feel forever and

03:46.240 --> 03:49.120
It's in those shifts that we start to realize ah

03:49.680 --> 03:54.720
My mind actually is not my best friend at these extremes, but there's a lot more to it

03:54.720 --> 04:00.560
You're only getting the tip of the iceberg in those states, so that's why I say if you can't control the mind with the mind

04:01.000 --> 04:03.160
Look to the body to control the mind

04:03.560 --> 04:04.880
How would that be adaptive?

04:04.880 --> 04:08.840
How would it be adaptive for us to focus all of our attention on to the anxiety?

04:08.840 --> 04:14.640
Is that something that you could see a useful? Absolutely, so let's take stress as an example

04:14.640 --> 04:16.640
And this could be stress panic anxiety

04:16.640 --> 04:21.360
You know each one of those has a definition in medical terms psychological terms, but to be fair

04:21.680 --> 04:27.840
No one really knows how to draw the line in the brain between fear and stress and anxiety

04:28.160 --> 04:32.920
But we can save with certainty that all of those states

04:33.600 --> 04:40.920
involve high levels of alertness high levels of awareness sometimes for things in our environment and sometimes just for what's going on internally

04:41.760 --> 04:43.760
When we are stressed anxious

04:44.240 --> 04:48.120
Afraid waking up in the middle of the night doesn't matter what triggered it

04:48.120 --> 04:53.520
There are a couple basic things that happen to all of us first of all our heart rate quickens. That's kind of an obvious one

04:54.520 --> 05:00.760
Fuel from our muscles and our liver is shuttled to particular organs of the body and away from others

05:01.280 --> 05:06.040
In particular fuel is shuttled towards the big muscles of the body to generate large movements

05:06.040 --> 05:12.000
This is why we quake a bit when we're stressed the hands will shake it's preparing us for where you're prepared for movement

05:12.000 --> 05:13.520
How does that prepare us for movement?

05:13.520 --> 05:18.320
The shaking actually is the consequence of trying to not move when we are stressed

05:18.400 --> 05:22.520
Basically, this is why taking a walk or a run you actually feel like you can kind of dispel the stress

05:22.520 --> 05:29.000
You're not actually dispelling the stress. What's happened is it's like the ARP the RPM are getting cranked up. It's like idling it

05:30.160 --> 05:33.640
Right, it's you know, you could sit there in a parked car and do that

05:33.720 --> 05:38.640
But basically you take the thing out of park and it just wants to go and so a lot of the times when we're stressed

05:38.640 --> 05:41.360
It's in conditions in which we're trying to remain still

05:41.800 --> 05:46.000
Public speaking and a tough argument, you know at the doctor's office about to get an injection

05:46.000 --> 05:51.120
You know, it depends on what stresses people obviously, but that readiness for action is a second component

05:51.120 --> 05:53.520
It's a heart rate readiness for action by way of shuttling

05:54.200 --> 06:01.120
glucose and other fuels to the muscles and then away from the reproductive organs from digestive organs, etc

06:01.120 --> 06:03.120
Because that is just not the right time for that

06:04.640 --> 06:13.760
Another very very powerful feature of this response is that our our pupils of our eyes the dark parts of our eyes get big

06:13.920 --> 06:16.640
Now you might think that that expands your visual field

06:16.640 --> 06:21.240
But actually the way the optics of the eye work that narrows the aperture of your visual field

06:21.240 --> 06:25.040
So when you are stressed, you literally are seeing things through a small aperture

06:25.320 --> 06:27.800
so distraught view of the world as they say and

06:28.720 --> 06:35.760
Under those conditions, you cannot see things in your periphery as well as you could prior to being stressed

06:35.960 --> 06:38.400
but you become exquisitely good at

06:39.120 --> 06:43.840
Measuring small detail changes in whatever it is that you happen to be looking at now

06:43.840 --> 06:50.280
There's an internal process too, which is that the aperture on your thinking also becomes very very narrow

06:50.440 --> 06:55.800
So that if for instance, well, I had this happen the other day. I I heard something very stressful

06:55.800 --> 06:57.800
I couldn't think about anything else

06:58.040 --> 07:02.280
Right and that might just seem logical like of course you can't think about anything else very stressful

07:02.280 --> 07:06.360
You're concerned about this, but my mind wasn't thinking about this particular incident

07:06.360 --> 07:12.600
It was thinking if this then this then if that then that and that then that and so you start, you know dropping into the future

07:13.040 --> 07:16.440
You start dropping into the past like why did we do that?

07:16.440 --> 07:19.440
Wow, you know and you start doing all that kind of cycling through things

07:19.800 --> 07:24.400
And of course there are so many things that can help relax us meditation

07:24.880 --> 07:28.040
Exercise a nice healthy meal social connection

07:28.120 --> 07:32.920
but the fifth column of the stress response is that

07:33.520 --> 07:37.120
Your aperture of vision your aperture of thinking gets very narrow

07:37.160 --> 07:41.640
And it becomes harder and harder to do the very things that would keep you out of stress

07:41.640 --> 07:45.880
And so this is kind of the the double-edged sword that is stress

07:45.880 --> 07:52.360
And so all the more reason why in those moments if the stress is not desired because there are moments when stress is desired

07:52.360 --> 07:54.240
You know you're navigating an emergency, etc

07:54.240 --> 07:58.440
But if you don't want to be in that narrow aperture of thinking and vision, etc

07:58.600 --> 08:04.360
Then you need to find some way to bring your level of autonomic arousal as it's called down

08:05.000 --> 08:10.800
Slightly so that you can start thinking about other possibilities or you know, there are instances

08:10.800 --> 08:15.560
I think everyone's been in this kind of situation where the thing that's stressing out is not going to get resolved today

08:15.560 --> 08:20.240
And you just sleep and of course you know you need to sleep and then you can't sleep

08:20.240 --> 08:22.640
And then of course that creates a compounding stress

08:22.640 --> 08:26.080
And now you're stressed about not being able to sleep and then over the course of the next few days

08:26.080 --> 08:31.680
You you know dissolve into a puddle of tears, but fortunately there are ways out of that kind of self-destruction

08:32.160 --> 08:35.160
You've done a lot of work on fear that was one of the things that you mentioned before

08:35.160 --> 08:38.520
Is there something that everybody is scared of because I've heard the

08:39.200 --> 08:44.240
Story the wives tale babies are born with is it fears of heights and loud noises or something

08:44.240 --> 08:47.640
Is there any truth in that there is there something everyone's scared of there is I think the one that

08:48.760 --> 08:56.360
Everybody who has a healthy nervous system will react quite robustly to is if you start increasing the amount of carbon dioxide

08:56.880 --> 09:01.240
That they're breathing and reduce the amount of oxygen that they're taking in that's terrifying

09:01.240 --> 09:03.240
Am I right in thinking there's a

09:03.240 --> 09:09.240
Experiment you can do where it's a single breath and that is pretty reliable at bringing on an anxiety attack

09:09.240 --> 09:14.040
Yeah, if you have people, please don't do this because you need the right proper medical staff around

09:14.040 --> 09:20.800
But they're they're great experiments of having people breathe carbon dioxide directly and it you basically panic

09:21.720 --> 09:27.520
It's terrifying one big gulp of carbon dioxide will make make you very afraid

09:27.520 --> 09:29.680
It turns out that there are a little group of neurons

09:29.680 --> 09:36.280
Of course neurons are just nerve cells that low group of neurons in the brain stem that respond to levels of carbon dioxide in the blood

09:36.280 --> 09:41.080
It turns out the reason we breathe is of course to bring in oxygen and then off low carbon dioxide

09:41.680 --> 09:46.720
But we don't have neurons that stimulate breathing for oxygen

09:46.720 --> 09:50.000
We have neurons that sense when carbon dioxide levels get too high

09:50.000 --> 09:55.840
So if you hold your breath, huh, eventually carbon dioxide levels go up and then at the moment that they reach a certain threshold

09:55.840 --> 09:58.640
These neurons fire and trigger the gas brief flex

09:58.640 --> 10:03.800
Oh, so in that moment you bring in oxygen and then of course you offload some carbon dioxide

10:04.280 --> 10:10.880
That's why it's so important to work on co2 tolerance right for breath work. Yeah, so free divers a sport

10:10.880 --> 10:12.400
I actually don't recommend

10:12.400 --> 10:16.640
Because there's only one way out of that sport as they say I have some friends who are free drivers

10:16.640 --> 10:20.280
And and obviously you can do it safely with the right guide and training etc

10:20.280 --> 10:27.120
But it is a very dangerous sport because for most people when carbon dioxide levels increase in the bloodstream and brain

10:27.360 --> 10:29.480
triggers this gas brief flex what

10:30.320 --> 10:33.360
Free divers train is carbon dioxide tolerance

10:33.520 --> 10:39.600
So they do that a couple of different ways and again, please don't do this because you actually people have died doing this

10:39.600 --> 10:42.800
Which is so one way is you can do what's called cyclic hyperventilation

10:42.960 --> 10:50.800
Right you do that 25 times or so and you think oh you're bringing a lot of oxygen you are but you're also

10:51.000 --> 10:58.560
Offloading a lot of carbon dioxide, especially if you use forceful exhales normally humans breathe through active inhales and passive exhales

10:58.640 --> 11:01.240
You just cut they just sort of dump their air passively

11:01.560 --> 11:06.000
But if you do the cyclic hyperventilation you're dumping a lot of carbon dioxide and then if you were to

11:07.480 --> 11:10.760
Hold your breath what you would find is you could hold your breath for a lot longer

11:10.760 --> 11:15.920
Why because your carbon dioxide levels are reduced so you don't have the same impulse to breathe now on land

11:16.240 --> 11:21.560
That's a more or less safe thing to do provided that you can get a good gulp of air once the gas reflex hits

11:22.880 --> 11:29.560
If you do that before going under water cyclic hyperventilation they call air packing and then you go under water

11:30.120 --> 11:35.880
You're going to be able to excuse me cyclic hyperventilation to air pack and then go under water

11:36.680 --> 11:38.680
but your

11:39.120 --> 11:42.680
Carbon dioxide is then lower you're going to be able to stay under longer

11:42.920 --> 11:47.960
But this is very dangerous because normally when that carbon dioxide threshold hits you would

11:48.280 --> 11:53.240
Pop up to the surface you sort of panic and want to go to the top free divers learn to tolerate

11:53.640 --> 11:59.160
High levels of carbon dioxide in their bloodstream and stay very very calm the way they die is very interesting

11:59.800 --> 12:04.960
Because it speaks to the physiology the way they they die is they'll just be swimming

12:05.520 --> 12:11.040
Feeling completely calm because they're very used to they've trained up the co2 tolerance carbon dioxide tolerance

12:11.280 --> 12:16.720
And when they die they don't suddenly feel like oh my goodness. I'm running out of air. It's just lights go black

12:16.960 --> 12:20.400
That's it. They're just black out and so they're alive and then they're gone

12:20.960 --> 12:24.640
And so this is why they use spotters. They you know, they have a line etc

12:25.120 --> 12:27.120
anytime you hear about somebody

12:27.200 --> 12:30.880
Dying doing free diving. It's rarely because they weren't

12:31.760 --> 12:36.720
Comfortable at a given depth or because it's not because they're gas reflexes kicked in

12:36.800 --> 12:40.640
It's because their gas reflex has been so desensitized that it's after the point of which they die

12:41.120 --> 12:43.600
precisely and this you know, it's sort of like when you hear that

12:44.800 --> 12:51.040
Skilled parachuters die why well because they're so comfortable with so many jumps. They actually forget to pull there's sometimes

12:51.520 --> 12:53.600
there are many instances in which they're they're

12:54.640 --> 12:55.920
videoing

12:55.920 --> 13:00.560
The first time jumpers right and they're getting the video for them and they themselves forget to pull because they're so

13:00.960 --> 13:04.240
Jumping out of planes and so as people get more and more advanced in something

13:04.320 --> 13:11.120
There's a there's a new risk that that surfaces because unless it's very reflexive and they built all all the protocols in

13:11.600 --> 13:15.120
Oftentimes they can overlook the very thing that allowed them to become expert in the first place

13:15.600 --> 13:20.880
Why do my palms get sweaty when I watch videos of people climbing up cranes and stuff like that?

13:20.960 --> 13:25.520
You know the ones that I mean the guy's got a gopro is a dude called james kinkston from the uk. That's a psychopath

13:25.920 --> 13:27.920
He goes up to the highest

13:28.000 --> 13:29.760
towers of dubai

13:29.760 --> 13:35.520
Legally in the middle of the night and then I watch it on a screen. It's only this big and

13:36.720 --> 13:40.960
I get this visceral response. Yeah, well two things first of all I I can relate

13:41.120 --> 13:45.760
You know, I saw the free solo movie with alex honnold and you know, he lives

13:46.400 --> 13:49.680
And it's still scary to watch right you actually know the outcome at the beginning

13:49.760 --> 13:52.880
they sort of make it clear that he manages to do this and

13:53.680 --> 13:58.240
You're it's still terrifying and I think it's for the same reason that the old youtube videos are terrifying

13:59.760 --> 14:03.440
Which is that we are so visual as animals

14:03.920 --> 14:05.920
We are so visual. I mean

14:06.080 --> 14:10.480
rodents even a lot of carnivore predators are extremely olfactory smell driven

14:11.280 --> 14:19.120
Humans are incredibly visual. I mean more than 40 percent of the human brain has something to do with vision visual navigation eye movements

14:19.600 --> 14:20.720
um

14:20.720 --> 14:23.360
Visual perception color perception face perception

14:23.360 --> 14:30.000
We have dedicated areas of the brain that are just for perceiving human faces and the micro expressions of human faces

14:30.160 --> 14:32.160
So it's so highly evolved for us

14:32.880 --> 14:35.200
When we see depth of field

14:35.760 --> 14:37.760
That's not um

14:37.840 --> 14:39.760
parallel to the ground

14:39.760 --> 14:41.760
It is terrifying with good reason because

14:42.560 --> 14:46.640
You know, what's the universal force that we all experience from the time we're born is gravity

14:46.880 --> 14:50.800
The first thing you learn is that things fall down not up, right?

14:51.200 --> 14:55.760
They you know, it's it's like the the fundamental rule that we come into the world with it's like

14:56.480 --> 14:57.520
Day one

14:57.520 --> 14:59.520
Even though the baby's got flopping around like a potato

14:59.520 --> 15:01.440
But can't even hold its head up the eyes are often

15:01.520 --> 15:03.760
You know the ocular muscles of the eyes are often not very good

15:03.760 --> 15:07.280
So babies it'll kind of their eyes are rolling back in their head that generally corrects itself

15:07.840 --> 15:09.840
over the next few weeks or so

15:10.080 --> 15:16.080
But the feeling of gravity of them, you know, if they feel like they're being dropped even the tiniest bit, right?

15:16.320 --> 15:20.320
They will go wide eyed. So there's a built-in vestibulo ocular reflex

15:20.800 --> 15:25.200
So when you see depth of field in the direction of the gravitational pull

15:25.840 --> 15:28.320
You actually get a little bit of activity

15:28.720 --> 15:32.400
In your cerebellum, which literally means mini brain a little area of the brain in the back

15:32.480 --> 15:37.360
That actually looks like a little mini brain if you were looking at the brain and that area of the brain is responsible

15:37.680 --> 15:41.520
For all the reflexes associated with the falling reflex. It does a lot of other things too

15:41.840 --> 15:44.400
So when you see that depth of field in the direction of gravity

15:45.440 --> 15:48.880
You have a little micro activity in your brain that you might fall

15:49.360 --> 15:53.680
And if you've ever been to a tall bridge or a dam and you go to the edge and you know people love to play with this

15:53.760 --> 15:57.680
There's that also that tower in toronto. They have the big um, see his tower

15:57.840 --> 16:03.760
Well, the big no the big um the big tower and I forget what it is. Maybe it's in calgary. Goodness Canadians are gonna hate me

16:03.840 --> 16:06.320
Okay, I love Canadians, but for some reason I can't remember this

16:06.400 --> 16:11.520
They have one of those glass floors there where you can walk and it's terrifying and you know, you're not going to fall through it

16:11.840 --> 16:14.880
Right or they tell you and you're not going to fall through it, but it's terrifying

16:15.520 --> 16:16.880
because your

16:16.960 --> 16:21.920
Body and brain are preparing for this immense fall. So when you see this in video, it's the same thing

16:22.000 --> 16:26.800
I always say a picture is worth a thousand words, but a video is worth 10 million pictures

16:26.880 --> 16:33.040
I mean, this is the reason why we're so drawn to things like instagram scrolling. It's like text text video

16:33.760 --> 16:36.560
You know or the the enormous popularity of tiktok

16:37.040 --> 16:43.840
It's video now the enormous popularity of twitter still escapes me because that's a different different sort of cultural gravitational pull

16:44.320 --> 16:49.360
But video and in particular action that gets us in a kind of a primitive mode

16:50.240 --> 16:52.240
That is an extremely

16:52.320 --> 16:58.560
Alluring visual image. What about emotional fears like a fear of failure or social disapproval or something

16:58.640 --> 17:03.600
Do they work in a in a similar way or is there a different part of the brain that's using that? Yeah, great question

17:03.680 --> 17:08.320
So um a few years ago a postdoc in my lab was now a staff scientist melise yeoman

17:08.640 --> 17:12.560
Excuse me melise doctor melise yeoman's ball bunch has a long name

17:13.360 --> 17:15.360
Excellent researcher studies fear

17:16.240 --> 17:21.200
Did a very broad scale survey of the general public thousands and thousands of entries

17:21.840 --> 17:23.280
Created this kind of

17:23.280 --> 17:27.520
Cloud of bubbles the bigger the bubble the more the greater number of people that had that fear

17:27.840 --> 17:31.920
You saw some we saw some interesting things. So heights certainly public speaking certainly

17:32.400 --> 17:34.400
doctor's office and stringes certainly

17:35.120 --> 17:37.280
public speaking fear is very common

17:38.320 --> 17:41.680
Social isolation fear is very common, but we also saw some things like dogs

17:42.800 --> 17:44.320
You know, there are a number of people who are afraid of dogs

17:44.320 --> 17:48.160
Which is inconceivable to me because I love dogs exactly the same. Yeah, but people

17:48.880 --> 17:54.160
You know people form these associations whether or not through experience or through indirect experience observing others

17:54.800 --> 17:57.600
I think public speaking is one of the greatest fear of dying

17:58.160 --> 18:00.160
Yeah, I swear. I don't it's not funny, but

18:01.040 --> 18:02.640
figure of speech I

18:02.640 --> 18:07.600
Never think about dying and being afraid of dying. I think about all the scary things that could happen while i'm living

18:07.920 --> 18:09.920
but there are many people who are just

18:10.240 --> 18:12.240
intrinsically afraid of dying

18:12.240 --> 18:14.240
And so that's that's a big one

18:15.120 --> 18:19.520
For people that uh, don't swim fear of drowning for people that swim less. So

18:20.960 --> 18:25.360
For people that have some sort of psychiatric disorder genuine psychiatric disorder

18:25.760 --> 18:31.600
Like obsessive compulsive disorder, which is not just per obsessive compulsive personality, but obsessive compulsive disorder

18:32.240 --> 18:36.800
Fear of the of being discovered in the shame that they have around their obsessions and compulsions. These are

18:37.920 --> 18:40.800
True ocd is very common. Do they all live in the same place?

18:41.680 --> 18:46.080
All of these different fears that all exist. Yeah, so I was rattling off and I didn't answer your question

18:46.880 --> 18:48.880
To the the more important point. So forgive me

18:49.920 --> 18:53.200
The short answer is they have a final common pathway

18:53.680 --> 18:58.880
Which is increased autonomic arousal and that is funneled through a couple what we call limbic structures

18:59.360 --> 19:03.280
Among others. So there's certainly involvement of the of the now famous amygdala

19:04.080 --> 19:07.360
This which means almond is this almond shape structure on the two sides of the brain

19:07.840 --> 19:14.800
There's also area the brain called the striatum analysis is also involved in fear and then the hypothalamus this small collection

19:15.200 --> 19:17.280
Of neurons just above the roof of your mouth

19:17.680 --> 19:21.760
Which is really to me one of the more fascinating areas of the brain harbors neurons

19:22.160 --> 19:26.160
That create a body wide and brain wide response

19:26.720 --> 19:31.840
To something that the higher order areas of the brain like the forebrain

19:32.240 --> 19:37.760
See and perceive as dangerous as threatening. So the short answer is yes

19:37.760 --> 19:44.480
It all funnels through hypothalamus amygdala striaterminalis and autonomic nervous system. That's a final common pathway

19:45.200 --> 19:50.320
But in terms of the variety of different things that can stimulate fear and the ways that they can do that

19:50.800 --> 19:52.320
That is highly contextual

19:52.320 --> 19:58.000
So the forebrain this real estate in the brain right behind behind the forehead is incredible because it's sort of

19:58.480 --> 20:04.000
Free real estate for you to customize for your life according to what happens to you early on

20:04.320 --> 20:06.800
So for instance, you might not be at all afraid of heights

20:07.760 --> 20:09.760
And you say well, why is that so?

20:09.760 --> 20:13.840
Well, maybe when you were a kid you were one of those maniacs that like, you know doing within the states

20:13.840 --> 20:18.240
We call them cherry drops the kids that could you know swing on their feet and then jump off the the bar and

20:18.480 --> 20:22.400
Then other kids are timidly crawling to the top of the thing don't even want to go up the ladder to the slide

20:22.800 --> 20:28.160
There's a ton of variation and that variation does not exist in the kind of deeper circuitry the final common path circuitry

20:28.240 --> 20:33.120
It exists in the learning that we experienced early in life one bad fall

20:33.840 --> 20:37.760
Can do it. I mean, I was bitten very badly by a german shepherd when I was a kid

20:38.400 --> 20:43.520
Head I almost got my eye, but you know for whatever reason I've always liked dogs anyway

20:43.920 --> 20:47.680
But there are other things that I've experienced that have left long term negative imprints

20:47.920 --> 20:53.840
So I it's highly contextual and a lot of it has to do with what happens immediately after the bad experience

20:54.080 --> 20:58.080
This is why nowadays there's a lot of legal use of the drug ketamine

20:58.640 --> 21:01.520
After traumas, you know, this is all very dark stuff, unfortunately

21:01.520 --> 21:05.360
But if you you know, you just imagine the family member that was just in a car crash and saw their

21:06.000 --> 21:09.280
The driver their loved one impaled onto the steering column

21:09.360 --> 21:13.280
I mean what could be more horrible than that nowadays if they come into the emergency room

21:13.280 --> 21:20.560
They will often give them an injection of ketamine, which is the dissociative anesthetic to get them to dissociate from this extreme emotional state

21:21.280 --> 21:23.280
So there are ways now to treat this

21:24.000 --> 21:27.520
And ketamine is used clinically at later periods, too

21:27.760 --> 21:30.720
didn't you you you did an experiment where you went

21:31.840 --> 21:36.720
Diving with sharks and I think that there was a complication and you went back the next day to redo it

21:36.720 --> 21:40.560
I'm going to guess that this is for the exact same reason to sort of conquer and

21:41.520 --> 21:44.880
Integrate the experience. Yeah to make a long story short

21:44.960 --> 21:49.280
We went two years in a row out to Guadalupe Island where there are a lot of great white sharks

21:49.760 --> 21:54.240
Some of the more expert shark divers were cage eggs sitting they were leaving the cage the first year

21:54.240 --> 21:56.240
I did not the second year

21:56.240 --> 21:58.800
I decided I would but the day before I did

21:59.280 --> 22:03.760
I went down into the cage just get comfortable again down there and I had an air failure

22:04.160 --> 22:09.520
And the safety tanks were out also and obviously I experienced extreme carbon dioxide

22:10.000 --> 22:15.440
Overload and panic. I didn't full-blown panic. I kept enough awareness that I was able to obviously I'm here

22:16.000 --> 22:20.480
Um, I survived doing a share air protocol, etc. But it was a very bad situation

22:20.720 --> 22:24.080
I don't like to say I nearly died because that's actually sort of letting the bug in my brain

22:24.080 --> 22:30.800
I like to joke that the reaper came in and um, you know and offered me a fist bump and I offered him a different gesture instead

22:31.360 --> 22:33.360
so I survived

22:33.600 --> 22:38.480
But the next day I woke up very very distraught because I had this bug in this loop in my brain

22:38.640 --> 22:44.480
I you know this notion I came so close to to the end and so I did go back down and I did cage exit

22:44.720 --> 22:46.720
and I don't say that to

22:47.120 --> 22:49.120
Suggest that it was the smartest decision

22:50.240 --> 22:52.240
Obviously you're safer on the boat or on land

22:52.880 --> 22:58.720
I don't say it to sound, you know, again tough or anything. I did it deliberately because I did not want to return

22:59.760 --> 23:01.760
home with this

23:01.840 --> 23:09.680
Loop of fear and so I went back into the traumatic circumstance and obviously made it out and if you look at all the successful treatments

23:10.240 --> 23:12.240
for trauma they all involve

23:13.040 --> 23:15.040
getting close to the

23:15.920 --> 23:17.920
trauma inducing mindset

23:18.480 --> 23:23.360
exposure therapy gradual and assisted by a clinician, but rarely if ever

23:24.400 --> 23:30.400
Are people with serious trauma encouraged to get as far away from the feeling of at least not in the clinical setting

23:30.560 --> 23:32.960
This has a lot of implications for things like trigger warnings

23:33.760 --> 23:37.920
Colleagues of mine in psychiatry. I've asked them directly. What do you think of trigger warnings? And they said, you know

23:38.160 --> 23:41.040
I mean, there's some logic to it on the on the surface, but if you really

23:41.600 --> 23:43.600
think about true trauma

23:43.600 --> 23:45.600
And we can define trauma

23:45.600 --> 23:50.000
Dr. Paul Conti was on my podcast his amazing trauma psychiatrists. He said trauma is an experience

23:50.800 --> 23:57.120
It's not just a bad experience trauma is an experience that changes your nervous system such that it behaves differently in the future

23:57.360 --> 24:03.440
That in a way that's maladaptive for you. So if you look at all the trauma treatments, they're all about learning to talk about the trauma

24:04.160 --> 24:09.680
Even experiencing some of the same feelings. So things like trigger warnings and all these things that buffer us against

24:10.080 --> 24:12.080
Feeling our true feelings

24:12.080 --> 24:15.840
Do nothing but prolong the trauma and prolong and exacerbate fear

24:16.560 --> 24:22.160
You had David Goggins in the lab to study him for fear. What did you learn from looking at that guy?

24:22.880 --> 24:29.360
David's David's great. I always chuckle with David because you know, the one thing about David is what you see on social media

24:29.520 --> 24:32.720
Is actually what you get when you interact with David

24:32.800 --> 24:37.440
We worked long hours one day and I was everyone was ready to tap out. This is a bunch of people in

24:38.000 --> 24:43.920
Silicon Valley for a day, you know doing some workshop type thing and he just he was changing into his running shorts

24:43.920 --> 24:48.240
Midway he was going to run to the airport and he ran to the airport as far as I know to get his flight

24:48.320 --> 24:50.320
I believe so, you know

24:50.640 --> 24:54.880
But there was this moment of should we continue? Should we take a break and he was like, no, let's keep going keep going

24:55.920 --> 25:00.720
Everything you see and read and hear about David is exactly how he shows up. It's really wonderful

25:01.440 --> 25:06.160
He came to the lab and he did, you know, we have a virtual version of the shark thing

25:06.640 --> 25:11.280
Um, which of course is not the same. It's the real experience, but for people who are afraid of sharks

25:11.520 --> 25:14.160
It's quite scary for them and allows us to study fear

25:14.480 --> 25:17.200
David was he's very afraid of sharks, which was sort of

25:17.680 --> 25:19.120
amusing to me given that

25:19.120 --> 25:21.280
As a seal he had to spend a lot of time in water

25:21.680 --> 25:28.080
But uh, he was first one in wanted to do the vr talked about how he didn't like it. But um, but that's why he did it

25:28.320 --> 25:30.080
You know constant

25:30.080 --> 25:33.280
Testing himself. In fact, I think even though David's quite successful

25:33.440 --> 25:36.080
I think and has many many options of how to spend his time

25:36.640 --> 25:39.600
I believe this is correct that I think right now. He's doing fire jumping

25:39.600 --> 25:44.640
He's fighting fires in the wilderness by ziplining in or fast lining in or jumping out of planes

25:44.880 --> 25:46.960
So he's constantly pushing that

25:47.680 --> 25:50.320
That friction lever to create

25:51.520 --> 25:56.320
Or build or further build this thing about leaning into friction

25:56.320 --> 25:58.320
And this is a term that isn't really scientific

25:58.800 --> 26:02.080
But that I decided to coin because this idea of limbic friction

26:02.560 --> 26:06.880
That when we're very tired and we need to be in action or when we're very stressed and we need to

26:07.840 --> 26:10.000
Perform in a more calm and controlled way

26:10.480 --> 26:14.000
There's friction on both sides getting out of bed when we're exhausted hard

26:14.720 --> 26:16.160
Very hard often

26:16.160 --> 26:19.840
Leaning into action in a calm and deliberate way when we're freaking out

26:20.080 --> 26:23.040
Like going to give a public lecture if one has fear of public speaking

26:23.440 --> 26:26.560
Also hard so this limbic friction and david just seems to seek

26:26.960 --> 26:29.440
What I call limbic friction in every domain of life

26:29.600 --> 26:32.160
Is that like exposure therapy for limbic friction then?

26:32.720 --> 26:33.520
Essentially, yeah

26:33.600 --> 26:38.320
I mean what you're training and improving when you're getting better at dealing with stress

26:38.800 --> 26:45.200
Is this ability to tolerate high amounts of adrenaline in your body and to think clearly and function well

26:45.440 --> 26:48.720
I mean adrenaline is epinephrine and just a little bit of physiology

26:48.800 --> 26:53.680
It's released from the adrenals obviously above the kidneys that gets your body organs

26:54.560 --> 26:56.560
Amped up and energized

26:56.880 --> 26:59.120
It can't cross the so-called blood brain barrier

26:59.200 --> 27:02.240
You have a high restriction fence that we call the blood brain barrier around the brain

27:02.960 --> 27:04.960
Keep bad molecules out

27:05.120 --> 27:11.120
Adrenaline therefore is released also within the brain from a little cluster of neurons called locus ceruleus. The name doesn't matter

27:11.520 --> 27:13.520
So when you are stressed

27:13.920 --> 27:17.440
Your brain and your body both wake up and that adrenaline

27:18.560 --> 27:24.800
Hijack certain systems narrows your visual focus, etc. Etc. If you look at almost all stress inoculation

27:25.760 --> 27:26.800
protocols

27:26.800 --> 27:28.800
Cold water ice bath cold shower

27:29.440 --> 27:31.440
cyclic hyperventilation

27:31.840 --> 27:33.840
Those all do the same thing

27:33.840 --> 27:37.600
They generate a lot of adrenaline release in the brain and a lot of adrenaline release in the body

27:38.240 --> 27:44.640
But it's different if those if the adrenaline in the brain and body is evoked by you that you did it

27:44.960 --> 27:50.400
Because under conditions under which you did the ice bath deliberately and now you're wide awake and really really alert

27:51.040 --> 27:52.560
There's this feeling that you have options

27:52.560 --> 27:57.280
It wasn't done to you, but you can train up an ability to for instance think

27:57.920 --> 27:59.920
Clearly and calmly

27:59.920 --> 28:05.520
Maybe even do some simple math problems in your head or maybe try and relax while there's all this adrenaline

28:05.840 --> 28:10.960
In your system and that carries over so that when you you know, we've all done it

28:11.040 --> 28:13.440
You're driving along the person in front of you stop short

28:14.000 --> 28:18.720
And you're almost in the accident, right? There's that moment where you could panic or that moment where you could

28:19.200 --> 28:22.480
You know road rage or that moment where you could freak out

28:22.880 --> 28:29.520
But if you are familiar with the feeling of adrenaline in your brain and body you navigate that in a in a calmer way

28:29.600 --> 28:35.760
How well because adrenaline is generic. There's no adrenaline for the car crash adrenaline for the heights adrenaline for the

28:36.320 --> 28:41.440
The uh the relationship situation. It's all the same so we can get better

28:41.440 --> 28:47.040
We can raise our stress threshold as I like to refer to it and that can be done through cold water

28:47.280 --> 28:49.280
Or cyclic hyperventilation

28:49.280 --> 28:51.680
Ideally not at the same time, but cold water

28:52.160 --> 28:59.040
You know is a universal stimulus for creating adrenaline release and there's a big range of cold not infinite but a big range of cold

29:00.000 --> 29:01.840
In which you can generate

29:01.840 --> 29:08.560
Adrenaline without harming your tissue whereas with heat you get into a very hot environment or very low oxygen environment

29:08.720 --> 29:12.000
You'll also get a lot of adrenaline, but you can also suffocate and burn yourself

29:12.000 --> 29:14.960
So this is why cold is used in navy seal screening and training

29:15.200 --> 29:18.800
And this is why I think so many people really like the ice bath and cold showers

29:18.880 --> 29:23.520
It has a bunch of other positive effects, but it is a great trigger for adrenaline

29:24.320 --> 29:27.040
speaking about relationships one of the most

29:27.920 --> 29:32.800
Uh common traumas probably that people are going to go through is heartbreak, right?

29:32.880 --> 29:39.600
You're going to be in a relationship that you imagine is going to continue forever. Maybe when you're 18 or sometimes when you're 48

29:40.240 --> 29:46.640
And then it's going to stop. Have you thought about the neuroscience of what's happening during heartbreak?

29:47.280 --> 29:50.240
Now we did so i've done episodes of our podcast on

29:50.800 --> 29:52.800
love attachment and relationships

29:53.360 --> 29:57.840
Which is a fascinating literature mostly from psychology, but also by biological literature

29:59.040 --> 30:05.600
And that's mostly about people's orientation toward attachment. So they're just very quickly

30:06.560 --> 30:12.880
There's the so-called secure attached style. This typically emerges in childhood when there's a very predictable care

30:14.000 --> 30:15.440
caregiver carry

30:15.440 --> 30:20.560
A relationship between child and most often mother, but it can be father to or other caregiver

30:20.800 --> 30:25.840
Just so happens that the classic experiments were done on mothers because this was in the 1970s and there weren't as many

30:26.560 --> 30:31.840
Reverse role really, you know homes, etc. There were some but not as many as there are now. So

30:32.800 --> 30:35.920
That's one style of attachment the parent leaves the child gets a little distraught

30:35.920 --> 30:42.400
But then can distract itself doing other things or just simply do other things because they have a high degree of intrinsic knowledge

30:42.640 --> 30:44.640
Not the thought but intrinsic

30:44.640 --> 30:49.280
Calm the autonomic nervous system doesn't feel any need to ramp up because the mom returns

30:49.600 --> 30:52.800
Then there's the so-called insecure attachment styles and there are a bunch of different ones

30:53.040 --> 30:57.840
But those are the ones where it's really stressful when the parent leaves. It's not clear. They're going to come back

30:57.920 --> 31:02.480
And when they come back, it's not clear that there's they're going to reestablish the bond the child will feel

31:03.200 --> 31:04.720
Supported, etc

31:04.720 --> 31:07.280
Here's what's fascinating those same neural circuits

31:08.000 --> 31:13.040
Are repurposed for romantic attachment in adult life the same circuits, which shouldn't surprise us

31:13.040 --> 31:15.280
I mean, why would the brain throw away valuable circuitry?

31:15.440 --> 31:20.960
But this whole Freudian notion that you know childhood attachment styles map onto adult attachment styles

31:21.520 --> 31:23.520
That's real. That's physiological

31:23.840 --> 31:25.680
Now one important point

31:25.680 --> 31:30.400
It's not one for one in the sense that let's say you had a secure attachment to your father

31:30.880 --> 31:34.640
Let's say it's a young a young girl and as a baby and a young child

31:34.640 --> 31:37.840
She had a secure attachment to her father and an insecure attachment to her mother

31:38.640 --> 31:44.080
In adulthood and let's say she's heterosexual. So in adulthood she prefers men as romantic partners

31:44.320 --> 31:47.920
This girl grows up and you might say well, she had a good relationship to her dad

31:47.920 --> 31:52.640
So she's going to have a good secure attachment style in her adult heterosexual relationships

31:53.600 --> 31:54.960
Often it's not the case

31:54.960 --> 32:01.120
They will transplant or superimpose the insecure attachment style to the to the mother on to male

32:01.680 --> 32:02.000
relationships

32:02.000 --> 32:04.720
But have great relationships to female friends, for instance

32:05.040 --> 32:08.320
So we have to be a little careful to not map one for one. That's important

32:08.640 --> 32:10.400
So all of that is in us

32:10.400 --> 32:12.800
And then you were talking about breakups and we did an episode on grief

32:12.800 --> 32:16.080
And the way that grief works in the brain and nervous system is that there are three

32:16.720 --> 32:20.720
Sort of factors that are mapped in our consciousness and our subconscious

32:21.120 --> 32:23.120
And these are space

32:23.280 --> 32:27.360
Time and this notion of closeness, which is attachment space and time is very simple

32:27.600 --> 32:31.360
It's where is the person that I love and when will I see them next?

32:31.840 --> 32:32.160
Right?

32:32.160 --> 32:34.800
I mean if you have a relative that lives overseas and you know, they're alive

32:34.880 --> 32:36.800
You're not going to grieve them. You might really miss them

32:36.800 --> 32:39.760
But you're not going to grieve them the same way you would if suddenly you get the note

32:40.560 --> 32:42.560
Unfortunately that they passed away

32:43.040 --> 32:48.320
And then attachment is how close you are to them like how critically you rely on them for

32:49.040 --> 32:53.280
Internal control and support and that doesn't mean they have to be an immediate caregiver

32:53.280 --> 32:57.200
It could just be like a really good friend. You call them mates over in the UK

32:57.200 --> 33:00.000
Right? Like a really good friend that just your knowledge of him

33:00.560 --> 33:02.880
Just makes you feel good. You feel better in the world

33:02.880 --> 33:06.720
You know as a guy who mostly grew up with kind of a big pack of male friends

33:07.120 --> 33:13.760
I mean I feel strongest and happiest and most secure in life when I see something about one of my friends doing well in life

33:13.760 --> 33:18.800
It just makes me feel good if one of them dies and unfortunately I'm getting to the age where a number of them have died

33:19.600 --> 33:21.600
then

33:21.600 --> 33:25.680
You feel like all of a sudden like goodness like there's a loss internally, right?

33:26.080 --> 33:28.000
Okay, that's all sort of obvious

33:28.080 --> 33:31.200
But what's interesting is that the grief process itself

33:31.840 --> 33:37.680
Is about restructuring this map this map think of it like a tripod. It's got three pieces space time and closeness

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
When someone dies

33:40.000 --> 33:46.560
It's very confusing for the brain because where are they in space? Well, the body is put someplace. Maybe it's cremated. Maybe it's not

33:47.120 --> 33:51.120
We have notions of a spirit and that depends on one's orientation a soul or a spirit

33:51.280 --> 33:56.560
Okay, or if you don't then you don't then where do they go, right? And then time when will you see them again?

33:57.360 --> 33:59.440
There's the never you'll never see them again

33:59.840 --> 34:05.600
And the closeness component remains and so there's an untethering of this map and so there's been brain imaging studies

34:06.240 --> 34:08.240
um beautiful work by

34:08.320 --> 34:10.320
Mary Frances O'Connor University of Arizona

34:10.720 --> 34:16.800
showing that if you look in the brain and people that are in grief from loss of a really strong attachment the state

34:17.200 --> 34:21.120
Of brain and body that gets flipped on is a motivational state

34:21.920 --> 34:23.040
it's

34:23.040 --> 34:27.840
Exactly the same circuitry in the brain that one sees active if someone very hungry

34:28.160 --> 34:34.000
Is put just outside the wall of some delicious food or if an animal that really wants to mate

34:34.880 --> 34:37.360
I guess mate with animals you call it copulate

34:37.360 --> 34:43.360
They really want to copulate with another animal is put just beyond the wall of that animal, but they can smell them

34:43.600 --> 34:45.600
I mean these are highly motivated

34:45.600 --> 34:52.560
Desiring states so grief is a motivated state to to bridge the distance in time and space and yet it's impossible

34:53.040 --> 34:56.720
And so the process of grief is a gradual waning of that motivation

34:57.440 --> 35:00.880
And a gradual shift of the memory of the person into some

35:01.360 --> 35:05.360
Concept whether or not it's a soul whether or not it's just the past whether or not it's their energy

35:05.360 --> 35:09.200
You know again, it depends on what the forebrain of that particular person believes

35:09.840 --> 35:15.920
Shifts that concept of that person into a place where the brain is comfortable. There's no more autonomic arousal

35:15.920 --> 35:17.280
There's no motivation

35:17.280 --> 35:19.280
And we've all experienced this if you've had a loss

35:19.760 --> 35:23.760
And I've had a loss for instance where my graduate advisor died and I adored her

35:24.080 --> 35:26.080
And every once in a while her daughter will call me

35:26.640 --> 35:32.160
From her cell phone and she kept the same number on that phone and the name and every once in a while a ring

35:32.720 --> 35:36.560
Barber Chapman and I'll reach for the phone and then there's this moment when I'm like, oh goodness

35:36.800 --> 35:39.440
So anyway, I'm going on and on just to color this with example, but

35:40.240 --> 35:41.920
When there's a breakup

35:41.920 --> 35:47.280
It's exceedingly hard, especially if the person is young, you know, if you look at suicides after breakups

35:47.280 --> 35:50.320
Those are far more common in younger people than they are in older people

35:50.400 --> 35:53.600
Why because the relationship represents the whole future

35:53.680 --> 35:58.720
They have no concept that they're they know there are other people, but it sort of feels like the whole world is shutting down

35:59.360 --> 36:00.800
so

36:00.800 --> 36:02.160
in

36:02.160 --> 36:06.320
Breakups what's happened is the person is no longer available in time and space

36:06.640 --> 36:09.920
This is why when someone breaks up you literally have to let them go, right?

36:10.000 --> 36:15.120
You know constant pursuing of them is the out of context is not healthy. They have a name for that. It's called a stalker

36:15.840 --> 36:17.680
Don't do it

36:17.680 --> 36:19.680
But it's almost as if you have to

36:20.080 --> 36:24.000
The brain has to think that the person is gone in time and space

36:24.240 --> 36:26.880
And this has become much harder with social media, right?

36:26.880 --> 36:30.560
Because people can check up on people they can hear from people in the old days like when I was growing up

36:30.640 --> 36:34.720
You just like took the phone off the hook or you you diverted your attention

36:35.280 --> 36:37.840
Now we are constantly renewing that the person is still there

36:37.920 --> 36:41.840
And so love and the loss of love and the death grief are

36:42.480 --> 36:47.040
Virtually identical. It's that motivational stain. This is why it's so hard to not reach out to somebody that you really

36:47.440 --> 36:48.800
miss and want back

36:48.800 --> 36:50.800
I saw a study last week that

36:51.280 --> 36:55.360
Had researchers asking participants to rate emotional and physical pain of a breakup

36:55.680 --> 36:59.120
They found that women tend to be more negatively affected by breakups

36:59.440 --> 37:02.480
Reporting high levels of both physical and emotional pain

37:02.800 --> 37:06.240
But while breakups hit women the hardest they tended to recover more fully

37:06.800 --> 37:11.680
Men on the other hand rarely fully recovered. I thought that was very interesting. I wasn't too sure what that meant

37:11.920 --> 37:16.320
Yeah, it's interesting. Um, it also rings true with my my experience and my observations

37:16.400 --> 37:20.880
It I think I mean this could relate to a number of things and here I'm painting with a broad brush, right?

37:21.280 --> 37:23.680
But um, you know, how comfortable one is

37:24.240 --> 37:30.320
Feeling their feelings is male or female is going to strongly dictate how quickly one moves through grief

37:30.400 --> 37:32.400
This is the same thing as trauma

37:32.400 --> 37:38.800
The more willing someone is to feel the full depth and intensity of the feelings that they associate with that trauma

37:39.120 --> 37:41.120
The more quickly they're going to move through

37:41.360 --> 37:44.800
The trauma, uh, again, I'm lifting from paul conti's words. So these aren't mine

37:44.800 --> 37:48.080
But you know people use a number of strategies. They use distraction

37:48.640 --> 37:51.840
They use states like they sublimate to things like anger

37:52.400 --> 37:53.040
um

37:53.040 --> 37:59.200
And avoidance of various kinds in order to not feel the traumatic feelings or not feel the breakup people, you know

37:59.760 --> 38:05.600
Try and self-soothe the alcohol or try and self-soothe with multiple new partners or whatever it happens to be doesn't work

38:06.160 --> 38:11.280
Just extends it because this map of space time and closeness needs to be fractured

38:11.280 --> 38:15.440
And the only way to do that is for the brain to have to confront the reality

38:15.760 --> 38:17.120
Which is that

38:17.120 --> 38:22.800
Whether by death or by by breakup, they are no longer available. It's like the food on the other side of that wall

38:23.520 --> 38:25.520
Is gone. It's just not there anymore

38:26.480 --> 38:30.960
Or that the food that was accessible now there's a wall in between and you will not get through it

38:31.200 --> 38:34.000
And you know, you can see this actually in animal studies that are kind of

38:34.560 --> 38:37.200
Hard, they're actually very hard to watch you'll see the animal perseverate

38:37.280 --> 38:40.480
Literally damage its own body trying to get through a barrier to something

38:40.480 --> 38:45.440
It's highly motivated to see people do that post breakup. They usually do that by talking to everybody about the breakup

38:45.840 --> 38:50.400
Um, which is its own form of perseverating on the motivation. What did I do?

38:50.560 --> 38:54.960
What did I do wrong this and that and some of that analysis is healthy some of it's not now why

38:55.600 --> 38:57.360
would one group

38:57.360 --> 38:58.720
be

38:58.720 --> 39:01.920
More of let's just say effective at dealing with breakups

39:02.080 --> 39:08.640
It's probably the ability to really feel the full intensity of how sad it is and be able to confront that and here

39:08.800 --> 39:14.560
I'm you know, I'm a male. I've only ever lived in a male body. So all I can tell you is that I think from a very early age

39:15.040 --> 39:19.680
Um, there's a an ability that at least I'm sure it transcends to women too

39:20.240 --> 39:23.680
Or extends to women too, but learning to pack down feelings, right?

39:23.920 --> 39:27.520
And so when are we really talking about when we're talking about pack down feelings? I'm not a psychologist

39:27.520 --> 39:31.440
But what we learn is top down control for brain to autonomic control

39:31.440 --> 39:36.240
It's the same thing like I don't want to jump off the high dive or I don't want to do this public speaking

39:36.240 --> 39:40.800
But I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of like I'm just gonna force myself. I'm gonna David Goggins it, right

39:41.520 --> 39:43.920
grief is a is an autonomic state

39:44.480 --> 39:46.960
Uh, we say it has valence has negative valence

39:47.440 --> 39:49.440
But it's high levels of autonomic arousal

39:49.840 --> 39:55.120
With a negative connotation because you can be high levels of autonomic arousal with happiness, right?

39:55.120 --> 39:58.320
You can be very alert and aroused and happy very alert and arous and sad

39:58.640 --> 40:00.640
It's very alert and arous and sad

40:01.120 --> 40:02.480
and yet

40:02.480 --> 40:06.320
We learn how to tamp that down. What is tamping down? It's

40:07.120 --> 40:09.120
reducing our heart rate. It's

40:09.520 --> 40:12.640
Going to work each day being a functional human being, you know, there's a lot of that

40:13.440 --> 40:14.560
rather than

40:14.560 --> 40:17.600
Allowing ourselves to you know sob uncontrollably into a pillow

40:18.400 --> 40:23.200
Some people are better at this. I mean the late steve jobs was a big proponent of scream therapies

40:23.280 --> 40:29.040
He used to go up into the hills behind stanford. He actually owns up still owns a property back there. He was really into

40:30.400 --> 40:36.880
You know catharsis cathartic release of internal state that he felt would allow him to like return as a happier nicer person

40:36.880 --> 40:42.000
He was also kind of well known for screaming at people in the office. So he obviously had a lot pent up inside

40:42.560 --> 40:44.560
um, so I think

40:44.640 --> 40:46.640
The better that we can lean into

40:48.000 --> 40:51.360
The emotional states that we fear the most but in a controlled

40:52.000 --> 40:54.960
Way where we're not harming ourselves or other people the better

40:55.360 --> 41:00.480
The more that we try and avoid that and we try and sublimate or just you know, and I've done this

41:00.480 --> 41:01.520
So I'm speaking from experience

41:01.520 --> 41:01.920
You know

41:01.920 --> 41:08.320
I would use the anger or the sadness from an experience to just work 10 10 times longer 10 times harder

41:08.640 --> 41:10.000
To just get that much more focused

41:10.000 --> 41:15.600
You're taking that autonomic arousal that narrow aperture and that energy and you're putting it onto something that moves your life forward

41:16.000 --> 41:18.720
So in some cases that's good because you still need to function

41:19.120 --> 41:20.960
And give but it can give you the

41:20.960 --> 41:27.520
Here I'll just say it gave me the illusion that I was working through something because you get all the accoutrements and rewards of hard

41:27.520 --> 41:28.240
Work

41:28.240 --> 41:31.120
But what you don't do is remap that spacetime

41:31.840 --> 41:34.320
closeness map and then you find I guarantee

41:34.880 --> 41:36.880
You find yourself five or ten years later

41:37.200 --> 41:41.520
Wondering why you're so exhausted or why certain things in life aren't going well

41:41.520 --> 41:44.480
And it's because when they say you haven't dealt with the loss

41:44.880 --> 41:47.520
You never actually allowed yourself to feel the feelings

41:47.680 --> 41:49.680
But once you do

41:49.680 --> 41:55.360
It's like a valve. It releases you hear musicians say that the most recent album was shit

41:55.520 --> 42:00.240
Because I didn't have any heartbreak to work through right and it is strange how people

42:01.840 --> 42:06.720
It's a difficult thing to pass because a little bit of it is kind of like alchemy right a little bit of it

42:06.800 --> 42:11.520
Is kind of like turning something that's terrible into something that's useful and beautiful. It's fuel

42:12.480 --> 42:13.440
but

42:13.440 --> 42:15.520
You're right. It is a it's a

42:16.160 --> 42:20.320
Hiding away from what it is that you actually need to do from the work that you need to do

42:20.880 --> 42:22.880
And in a world which is a meritocracy

42:23.200 --> 42:27.760
Where people want success and status and accolade and fame and you go well

42:28.960 --> 42:30.960
enemies and

42:31.440 --> 42:33.440
revenge and bitterness

42:33.520 --> 42:34.960
resentment

42:34.960 --> 42:37.360
Pretty good motivators. Maybe I could use some of that

42:37.520 --> 42:42.720
Maybe I should go out of my way to try and put myself into positions where this motivates me and working out

42:43.280 --> 42:46.000
Where that falls on the ledger is is a difficult one

42:46.240 --> 42:50.160
It is and I think it depends on life stage and it depends on how one is going to work it out

42:50.240 --> 42:52.560
I mean the the narrative around the shark dive

42:52.640 --> 42:54.320
I mean even as I say it now

42:54.320 --> 42:57.280
So that was 2017 was the second dive when I think about all that

42:57.520 --> 42:58.640
I think like that was crazy

42:58.640 --> 43:02.160
I was out there studying fear and I almost was the professor who died studying fear

43:02.240 --> 43:06.320
It would have been a terrible end to the story. Um, what was I doing? Don't do this don't do this

43:06.400 --> 43:11.120
But you know, there are times in our life where we feel compelled to take on certain challenges for whatever reason

43:11.760 --> 43:15.520
There's a phrase it doesn't exist in the scientific literature, but it captures two

43:16.160 --> 43:21.280
Um components of physiology that are absolutely factual earlier. We talked about limbic friction

43:21.920 --> 43:26.880
As it relates to creative process and sublimation of anger and sadness and creating things from bad

43:27.440 --> 43:29.440
Events books music, etc

43:30.080 --> 43:35.200
Um the the words that come to mind are limbic resonance the human beings

43:36.160 --> 43:41.440
Resonate with these extreme states, you know, there aren't many great albums written about

43:42.320 --> 43:45.840
A good day walking on a sunday in the park like it's kind of boring

43:45.840 --> 43:49.120
I mean, there's the the beautiful painting sunday in the park with george, but I'll be honest

43:49.120 --> 43:52.400
It's beautiful, but it's also kind of boring you can look at the details of it for a while

43:52.800 --> 43:59.360
People like intensity the scream is it, you know, people look at that for a long time and speaks to the psychosis of the artist, etc

44:00.240 --> 44:04.800
You know, people don't generally bond through passive relaxed states

44:05.200 --> 44:10.080
Unless they've also been through a lot together, right? I mean you even think about uh, the

44:10.480 --> 44:11.920
We could talk about this separately if you want

44:11.920 --> 44:16.720
But all of us are here because of the autonomic seesawing that is the reproductive act

44:16.960 --> 44:22.640
It goes from highly around how you refer to it in your lab. You know scientists autonomic seesawing

44:22.640 --> 44:27.120
It is it's very interesting that the arousal process is one of increase in autonomic arousal

44:27.840 --> 44:31.840
In order to get true arousal, but then not so much that it inhibits arousal

44:32.240 --> 44:38.800
Then mating behavior and then the the orgasm response in males and females is highly what we call sympathetic not emotionally some

44:38.800 --> 44:42.560
It can be I suppose emotionally sympathetic, but from a pure physiology standpoint

44:43.040 --> 44:46.240
It's a activation hyper activation of the stress system

44:46.960 --> 44:48.960
Even though it has positive valence

44:48.960 --> 44:53.360
And then there's a very quick rebound to the so-called parasympathetic

44:53.840 --> 44:59.680
Arm of the autonomic nervous system this deep relaxation, which we don't really know why I wasn't consulted the design phase

44:59.680 --> 45:03.840
but we think that that postcoital bliss and is and the

45:04.240 --> 45:09.600
Kind of relaxing the desire to not run around a bunch more for most people was to exchange

45:10.080 --> 45:12.400
odorant molecules to increase pair bonding

45:12.880 --> 45:17.040
And even if people aren't trying to pair bond because people don't always just mate to reproduce

45:17.840 --> 45:19.920
but that uh

45:19.920 --> 45:24.000
Some of the molecules that are released in each of the two individuals oxytocin being the main one

45:24.560 --> 45:28.880
Give people a sense of kind of postcoital bliss and and it's a very calm one

45:29.200 --> 45:32.960
That creates opportunity for bonding and discussion that is all like pillow talk

45:32.960 --> 45:35.040
There are other forms of pillow talk postnut clarity

45:35.440 --> 45:36.240
Andrew

45:36.240 --> 45:39.600
But for women it might be something different right of course a different different name

45:39.760 --> 45:43.600
I only speak in the language of physiology, but for both men and women this happens

45:43.680 --> 45:46.000
It creates this little orb of closeness that is both

45:46.560 --> 45:48.880
physiological and but neurochemical too

45:49.200 --> 45:52.960
So what we can say for sure is that whether or not it was in vivo or in a dish

45:53.040 --> 45:55.280
We are all here because two parents

45:56.080 --> 46:01.440
Right a male and a female unless you're a condor where two females can produce a baby

46:01.440 --> 46:04.560
This has now been shown right but as far as we know

46:05.040 --> 46:09.760
Where a male and a female reproduce because they each went through this arc of arousal

46:10.560 --> 46:16.400
Not too high arousal extreme stress relaxation that happened separately or together because in vitro it could be

46:17.040 --> 46:23.360
Fertilization to be separate so the test of whether or not we get to reproduce is actually the ability to to

46:24.560 --> 46:28.800
Assuming that people are doing this together and not through in vitro fertilization

46:29.280 --> 46:34.800
Is a test of whether or not people can coordinate their autonomic nervous systems now there are ways around that and to override it

46:34.800 --> 46:36.160
But by and large

46:36.160 --> 46:40.240
That's the way humans evolved and the way all other animals evolved

46:40.880 --> 46:42.880
Now limbic resonance

46:42.880 --> 46:45.920
Is a good way I think to describe that process

46:46.000 --> 46:52.000
But that carries over to other things too an album about an extreme loss a song or a poem about extreme loss

46:52.560 --> 46:58.000
Brings the reader the listener into a limbic state that's very similar or approximates what

46:58.960 --> 47:00.400
The creator

47:00.400 --> 47:02.880
Experienced right the person created that art or that

47:03.520 --> 47:07.360
Poetry and in the same way if something is about a lot of anger, you know

47:07.360 --> 47:13.040
If you like loud fast music or something like that it's an extreme state. It has a gravitational pull to it

47:13.520 --> 47:16.560
There's again. I'm using this language limbic resonance

47:17.120 --> 47:23.840
Rarely if ever do human beings bond through nothing they bond through shared experience and you think of what makes people feel close

47:24.400 --> 47:27.840
Well, there are a couple things and this has everything to do with time perception

47:27.920 --> 47:30.960
typically when there's a high degree of limbic resonance it means that

47:31.520 --> 47:36.880
The molecule's dopamine was increased substantially over baseline at some point

47:37.360 --> 47:41.840
Dopamine is almost always discussed in terms of pleasure, but it's the molecule of motivation drive

47:42.560 --> 47:47.840
And to some extent reward it tends to narrow our visual focus and believe it or not dopamine is the molecule from which

47:48.160 --> 47:50.160
Adrenaline is manufactured

47:50.720 --> 47:53.600
Biochemically you get adrenaline from dopamine

47:54.240 --> 47:59.280
So these two act as close cousins to put us into these states of motivation and have energy to pursue things

48:01.040 --> 48:03.040
When dopamine

48:03.040 --> 48:05.040
Is very present in our system

48:05.280 --> 48:08.960
Or if you're in the company of someone else and there's a lot of dopamine two things happen

48:09.200 --> 48:12.240
First of all, you're very motivated narrowing a focus. That's one

48:12.480 --> 48:16.400
The other is that the way that you perceive time is quite a bit different

48:17.040 --> 48:20.320
For instance, if you ever had an amazingly exciting day

48:20.800 --> 48:23.600
Just tons of things. Maybe you meet someone new. You're having the best time

48:23.600 --> 48:29.280
I mean just think falling in love and the most incredible date that you can imagine how it begins and how it ends

48:29.280 --> 48:32.880
It just feels incredible. It all feels like it went by very very fast

48:33.440 --> 48:37.600
And yet when you look back on that day, it seems like so much happened

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Now think about a opposite situation

48:40.480 --> 48:43.200
You go to the doctor's office and you're sitting in the doctor's

48:43.680 --> 48:49.600
Lobby and you're waiting and you're waiting and there's no phone reception. So you can't scroll instagram. You're waiting and you're waiting

48:49.840 --> 48:52.320
It's incredibly boring. It's a very low dopamine state

48:52.720 --> 48:54.960
It feels like it goes on forever

48:55.440 --> 48:57.920
And yet when you look back nothing really happened

48:58.320 --> 49:03.120
So dopamine changes our perception of time and in terms of developing human bonds

49:03.760 --> 49:08.800
This has been well established that if two people for instance go three different places in a given day

49:09.280 --> 49:14.480
They tend to feel like they know each other far better than if they stayed in one place even for a longer period of time

49:14.560 --> 49:20.080
Did you know that pickup artists were weaponizing this about 15 years ago? No, it doesn't surprise me

49:20.080 --> 49:21.280
But i'm sorry to hear it

49:21.280 --> 49:26.640
It was common held wisdom in the pickup artist community that you were supposed to have a three location date

49:26.880 --> 49:32.640
To manipulate precisely this to make the girl feel like you had progressed further down the

49:33.280 --> 49:37.520
Maturation process of of spending time together. Surely there have to be female pickup artists, too

49:37.840 --> 49:40.800
Uh, yeah, I feel like their job's probably easier

49:41.920 --> 49:43.920
I can't comment

49:43.920 --> 49:47.040
I don't know. I've never been one going back to dopamine

49:47.600 --> 49:52.240
How just how triggering are our phones when it comes to dopamine? Okay, great question

49:52.960 --> 49:54.960
We often hear that

49:55.120 --> 49:58.400
You know the social media getting dopamine hit after dopamine hit

49:59.280 --> 50:01.360
When we first get on social media after

50:02.160 --> 50:07.520
For the first time or after a long period of time the amount of dopamine that's released we think is quite substantial

50:07.760 --> 50:13.920
It's novel. Remember dopamine is about novelty surprise and the sense that we are on some exciting track

50:14.240 --> 50:19.520
That's what dopamine is really about it puts us into states of readiness anticipation looking seeking, etc

50:20.000 --> 50:22.560
Almost always for things outside the confines of our skin

50:23.200 --> 50:26.320
Just to contrast it maybe for a bit more of a future discussion

50:27.280 --> 50:30.720
Serotonin does the opposite when there's a lot of serotonin in our brain and body

50:30.960 --> 50:35.520
Typically it makes us feel satisfied sated and more quiescent comfortable with what we have in our own

50:36.080 --> 50:41.520
Immediate sphere and within us right the comfort of a good meal the food you have dopamine is about go go go

50:41.680 --> 50:44.560
If you look at somebody who's high on cocaine or methamphetamine

50:44.720 --> 50:48.000
It's all about pursuit because that's a very dopaminergic drug

50:48.000 --> 50:51.600
You look at somebody who's taking a drug and i'm not suggesting people do this

50:51.600 --> 50:57.120
But it really ramps up serotonin. Let's say a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor prosaxol off, etc

50:57.760 --> 51:02.800
The side effects of those drugs if the dosages are too high lack of appetite lack of libido

51:03.360 --> 51:09.200
Kind of meh about life, you know, then so they'll adjust the dose down. That's because those are serotonergic drugs

51:09.760 --> 51:10.960
so

51:10.960 --> 51:12.960
in in general

51:12.960 --> 51:17.040
When we are in pursuit of things dopamine is is quite high

51:17.600 --> 51:18.720
so

51:18.720 --> 51:21.600
Now you have to remind me your question because i've set up the dopamine serotonin

51:22.160 --> 51:24.160
cell phones. Ah cell phones. Yes

51:24.720 --> 51:26.720
forgive me, so

51:26.800 --> 51:28.960
The thing about cell phones is when you first get on there

51:29.520 --> 51:33.600
And you have let's say your no wi-fi on the flight or something and you land

51:33.920 --> 51:38.080
It can actually be quite stimulating you get a lot of dopamine. Oh, there's this. Oh, there's that

51:38.320 --> 51:42.000
But very quickly when you're scrolling on social media

51:42.720 --> 51:45.600
You're no longer getting the novelty, but you're continuing to do it

51:45.600 --> 51:47.760
You almost don't know why you're doing it at that point

51:47.840 --> 51:52.000
It shifts over to something that's a bit more like an obsessive compulsive behavior

51:52.480 --> 51:57.520
Where that we can define an obsessive compulsive behavior where the obsession leads to a compulsion

51:57.520 --> 51:59.760
So the obsession is a thought the compulsion is a behavior

52:00.160 --> 52:04.720
But the acting out of the compulsion merely serves to increase the obsession

52:05.360 --> 52:10.320
Right, this is very different than being obsessed with food or obsessed with cleanliness. There's no payoff, right?

52:10.320 --> 52:15.440
Exactly. There's no anxiety relief by carrying out the compulsion with OCD behaviors

52:16.320 --> 52:22.320
Like scrolling social media the dopamine quickly wanes and then you find that you're just sort and we've all been there

52:22.400 --> 52:27.600
You're scrolling like why am I doing this? This isn't that interesting that is this isn't that interesting now

52:28.320 --> 52:31.440
The algorithms for social media are very clever and I don't want to demonize it

52:31.440 --> 52:35.760
I you know provide a lot of a lot my life has spent on you know in social media now, but

52:35.920 --> 52:42.080
In the algorithms that they've incorporated function on the the most powerful

52:43.120 --> 52:47.920
way to keep people doing a behavior or an animal for that matter is intermittent

52:48.560 --> 52:52.640
Random reward a random intermittent reward that you don't know when you're going to hit the jackpot

52:52.640 --> 52:57.760
So you're scrolling you're scrolling and then you see something typically it's very high what you know in nerd speak

52:57.760 --> 52:59.200
We'd say signal to noise

52:59.200 --> 53:04.640
So if you're reading some interesting things this came out in the news this came out and then it's all of a sudden a riot

53:05.200 --> 53:09.600
or a person that is jump is based jumping off a building or

53:10.400 --> 53:14.240
You know for people that are are scrolling looking at bodies or something like that

53:14.640 --> 53:17.200
Live bodies that hopefully people aren't looking at dead bodies

53:17.200 --> 53:20.960
But look if something's very tragic then that has this gravitational pull

53:21.520 --> 53:23.840
And then you what happens is you start getting

53:24.560 --> 53:28.560
The system working for that next dopamine hit that you don't know when it's going to come

53:28.560 --> 53:29.840
It's just like gambling

53:29.840 --> 53:36.240
So I look at social media as initially being very dopaminergic driving rewards surprise and excitement

53:36.560 --> 53:39.040
But very quickly transitioning to something more like ocd

53:39.680 --> 53:43.920
And the kinds of behaviors where it looks if you if we were to look at ourselves

53:44.160 --> 53:47.120
Through the lens of an experiment like we would an animal experiment

53:47.440 --> 53:53.840
We think that animal is sick if you saw an animal digging in the corner looking looking looking looking for a bone the dog

53:53.920 --> 53:59.440
Is looking looking looking looking looking looking looking looking you'd think that's really sad. That's us

54:00.080 --> 54:05.600
Right, that's us. I'm pointing at myself intentionally. That's us. So we have to learn to self-regulate the amount of time

54:06.160 --> 54:07.200
but

54:07.200 --> 54:11.760
That doesn't have to be a process of you know scruffing ourselves and saying don't do it

54:11.760 --> 54:17.440
Don't do it think about it in terms of the positive the more time away from something the more positively reinforcing

54:17.440 --> 54:22.000
It will be when you return and that just to sort of superimpose this onto the relationship conversation

54:23.120 --> 54:24.240
you know

54:24.240 --> 54:27.520
Many of us are fortunate to have partners that we love spending a lot of time with

54:27.920 --> 54:30.800
It's also good to miss that person every once in a while now

54:30.800 --> 54:34.160
That might be an hour for some people apart of no communication

54:34.160 --> 54:36.800
It might be a week everyone varies on this on the spectrum

54:37.200 --> 54:41.760
But the idea of missing someone is that positive anticipation that kind of pain, right?

54:41.760 --> 54:45.680
It's a motivational state and then when you see them, it's all the richer so you can

54:46.320 --> 54:52.560
Imagine that the dopamine circuits can be used to more successfully navigate a number of different things

54:52.960 --> 54:58.640
And you know a lot of couples completely quash the excitement and the pleasure of being together not just physical pleasure

54:58.640 --> 55:01.440
But just pleasure of being together because they just

55:02.000 --> 55:06.080
Spend too much damn time too much familiarity or they're texting all the time, right?

55:06.320 --> 55:10.880
or the you know and and this whole thing around texting has become a really interesting test of

55:11.520 --> 55:12.720
Dopamine expectation

55:12.720 --> 55:20.000
There's a thing called dopamine reward prediction error if you think the reward is coming and it doesn't you drop below baseline levels of dopamine

55:20.080 --> 55:22.800
That's why you should never tell someone that this restaurant is going to be the best restaurant

55:22.800 --> 55:26.160
You've ever been to in your life. Exactly. I made the mistake of telling my girlfriend on the way here

55:26.160 --> 55:30.000
I wanted her to read this book. I'm like this is an amazing book. You should read it and I caught myself and I thought

55:30.240 --> 55:32.400
Damn it. I'm actually detracting from how

55:33.520 --> 55:35.520
Good she's going to experience the book

55:36.080 --> 55:40.720
Tell her it was terrible. Oh, yeah, it's really good though. This is the problem. It's hard to do

55:41.280 --> 55:42.400
so

55:42.400 --> 55:44.400
I think the key is to

55:44.880 --> 55:47.920
To leverage dopamine reward prediction error in the best way

55:48.000 --> 55:54.400
It's the surprise that you know, if you take kids driving home from school and suddenly you pull into the ice cream shop

55:55.040 --> 55:56.480
They're going to be so ecstatic

55:56.480 --> 55:58.800
But if you tell them you're going to go to the ice cream shop and it's closed

55:59.520 --> 56:00.880
Huge drop below baseline

56:00.880 --> 56:04.080
Does that mean if you tell them that you're going to the ice cream shop and it's open?

56:04.240 --> 56:08.000
That's less than not telling them you're going to the ice cream shop and it's surprised. Correct

56:08.080 --> 56:10.080
It's it's they literally tear out into

56:10.480 --> 56:15.600
Maximum surprise is the maximum dopamine release then successful completion of the mission

56:16.320 --> 56:18.320
As it were is the next and then

56:18.640 --> 56:22.160
Unsuccessful is there not an argument to be made that you would be able to

56:22.800 --> 56:26.720
Drag out the amount of time that dopamine is released for because of the anticipation

56:27.440 --> 56:33.600
Yeah, so well and people do this in relationship quite a lot right anticipation is the kind of ultimate fuel

56:34.160 --> 56:38.880
Of the courting dance, right? I mean this is also but one has to be very careful

56:39.200 --> 56:43.200
Because whether or not it's from the male side or the female side or whatever variation thereof

56:43.680 --> 56:49.520
That there's a you only get so many reward prediction errors before people start to

56:50.320 --> 56:52.320
predict or associate

56:52.560 --> 56:57.440
Low dopamine with somebody or some experience in other words if you you know, I'll use an example

56:57.920 --> 56:58.720
Not for my own life

56:58.720 --> 57:02.080
But if you say, you know, we're going to Costa Rica on vacation

57:02.560 --> 57:06.320
And then you say listen, I have to work and they might understand but that's a letdown

57:06.400 --> 57:10.080
It's a dopamine reward prediction error in the direction of lower dopamine

57:10.400 --> 57:13.360
They might recover from it. They might not but most people recover from it

57:13.680 --> 57:16.560
If you do that two or three times what ends up happening

57:16.640 --> 57:21.680
You can model this beautifully and they've seen this experimentally in animals and humans then you say, okay

57:21.760 --> 57:25.200
We're really going to Costa Rica this time and you think well

57:25.200 --> 57:28.240
The surprise is going to be that you actually go the amount of dopamine

57:28.240 --> 57:34.240
That's released for positive for successful completion of the initial goal is far lower than it ever would have been

57:34.480 --> 57:38.560
So you can only cry. Well, I suppose that's not the right way to put it. You can only

57:39.360 --> 57:44.160
um, create positive anticipation so many times and then create a letdown before

57:45.040 --> 57:48.960
Completion that the prom delivery of the promise has very little impact

57:49.280 --> 57:52.480
And so you have to be very careful with one's words better to say nothing

57:53.840 --> 57:55.840
Then to let somebody down

57:55.840 --> 58:01.040
For sure in the context of human relationship and you know, this plays out in some um less perhaps

58:01.520 --> 58:07.600
amusing ways where you know, you look at people who are successful in life and you always hear success build success

58:07.680 --> 58:11.280
And it's absolutely true like when students come to my lab and they do a phd thesis

58:11.280 --> 58:16.480
It's very important for me to get them on to a research track quickly that they're going to experience some success

58:16.960 --> 58:18.480
Because if they spend

58:18.480 --> 58:20.320
Four years and then it fails

58:20.320 --> 58:27.040
That's the devastating and then they have to start over again. Same thing with kids. I mean getting some success early on

58:27.680 --> 58:32.560
Even if it's low bar success really does build up one's positive anticipation

58:33.200 --> 58:36.320
An ability to perform well in the future because dopamine gives energy

58:36.400 --> 58:40.640
Remember, it's the precursor to adrenaline and the sense that the world is predictable

58:41.280 --> 58:43.440
Now this can go a wrong way too

58:43.760 --> 58:48.640
And I see this a lot with the idea that everyone gets a blue ribbon. This is terrible too because

58:49.440 --> 58:54.240
If everyone is rewarded every child is rewarded regardless of how well they performed

58:54.560 --> 58:58.720
If they're all rewarded to the same level you actually flatten the dopamine curve

58:59.120 --> 59:02.000
And so in that sense, yes, everyone might feel

59:03.520 --> 59:09.280
You know celebrated but you actually are lowering motivation for the given activity

59:09.680 --> 59:11.200
This has a whole

59:11.200 --> 59:15.680
landscape of research in back of it relate to intrinsic versus extrinsic reward

59:15.840 --> 59:18.640
The strongest motivation is always going to be intrinsic motivation

59:18.800 --> 59:24.320
If you reward kids or adults for something too many times even if they like that activity they

59:25.280 --> 59:27.520
The propensity to do that activity will be reduced

59:27.680 --> 59:31.360
But if you reward without effort or without success

59:31.920 --> 59:37.600
That is devastating for a nervous system. In fact, I've gone on record and I'll say it again and again and again, which is that

59:38.560 --> 59:40.560
dopamine that

59:40.880 --> 59:42.880
Arrives without prior effort

59:43.280 --> 59:44.800
destroys people

59:44.800 --> 59:46.480
this is

59:46.480 --> 59:53.040
This is drugs. This is uh, you know, this is things like a cocaine and amphetamine. It's high levels of dopamine with no effort

59:53.040 --> 59:56.720
Okay, they had to buy it. They had to find it. They did whatever it but that's no

59:56.720 --> 01:00:00.000
There's no physical effort or mental effort involved in getting the dopamine peak

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.960
This is why hard work followed by reward great working hard on a relationship and then it gets better

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.040
There's a breakthrough whatever it is

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.280
That is powerfully positive

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:13.600
Dopamine that just arrives because you say, oh, you're here. So you get reward

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:18.800
Terrible and this is why rewarding every little positive thing that a child does with

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.680
You know their favorite thing eventually diminishes the value of that thing and diminishes their

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.160
ability to get motivated on their own

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.560
So a very very powerful system one has to be very very careful how one leverages it

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:35.920
What are your thoughts on dopamine detoxing? Is that legit? Does it work? Well up until about six months ago

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:41.120
I would have said no, um, but my colleague Anna Lemke was on the show. Oh, fantastic

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:46.480
Um, I have such admiration and respect. She's great. Yeah. Yeah. I just a brief anecdote

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.840
I was I directed neuroanatomy course for the medical students at stanford

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.120
I should have known who Anna was and then one day she came in to give a lecture on dopamine and addiction and my first thought was

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.320
Oh my goodness, you know have to get her on the podcast and have to I want her

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:05.040
Talking to the world because it's such powerful knowledge. So if people haven't heard that episode already go listen to chris talking to Dr.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.160
Anna Lemke, I'm gonna listen to it

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:10.000
I've listened to all her podcasts that I was aware of but again, we were talking about it's hard

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.800
Sometimes hard to find podcasts. So I'm gonna listen to that

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.200
Um, cannot listen to her enough times

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.840
you know the

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.440
the dopamine

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.280
You asked earlier about the arc of dopamine and how long it lasts that the

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:29.120
One of the key takeaways from that book dopamine nation that I've incorporated in my own life

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.080
Is that there are certain activities like cold water that create long lasting arcs of dopamine

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:38.080
Those can be very useful for putting us into long lasting motivational states

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:43.280
So, um, these are not big peaks and troughs. These are the pain of the cold water

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.400
Followed by this long long arc of dopamine

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.800
Wonderful. It's kind of an antidepressant positive motivator natural stimulus

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.920
I always say if you don't have access to a nice bath cold showers

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.240
Yes, we'll work if you have a shower that doesn't get cold enough. Keep in mind that the original study showing this dopamine increase

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:07.760
Had people get into 60 degree water, which is not that cold 60 degree fahrenheit for 45 minutes to an hour

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.200
So your water bill might go up

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.720
But you could just draw a kind of cool bath and get in that up to the neck

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.360
So because I realized there are sometimes some cost barriers to people. They not everyone has a nice bath

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.200
no

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.880
Dopamine detoxing. Yeah, so dopamine detoxing is something that

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:29.360
Apparently today my uh short term working memory is off. I I swear I can't get that in you. I can't think of any

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.760
I'm caffeinated. I can't think of any, um

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.040
pharmacologic reason for it, but uh, no excuses

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.560
um

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.920
So dopamine detox I would have thought was not something real

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.560
It seemed kind of silly to me actually

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.440
And I'll tell you why it seems silly and why it still seems silly, but why it may have some utility but then ana

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:53.600
Dr. Anna Lemke told me that it actually can be quite useful to take some time and space away from

01:02:54.240 --> 01:03:00.400
Social media certainly from any addictive drugs. That's the treatment for addiction and restore those dopamine levels to baseline

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:06.000
Now the way that dopamine detoxing was initially described in the bay area where seemed a lot of tech

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.320
Types we're talking about it

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:12.560
Was in terms of I heard something like oh people aren't even looking at other people's faces

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.280
You know, they're really kind of living this like monkish lifestyle and like no food of that

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.160
They really enjoy no anything that to me seems kind of crazy and kind of extreme

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:27.760
I mean, I can understand not ingesting a lot of highly palatable foods, you know eating somewhat blander foods

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.960
I can understand not um, certainly not doing any prescription drugs or taking some time off from caffeine caffeine increases dopamine receptors

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.120
Which makes the

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.360
The dopamine that's available more powerful at evoking the dopamine response

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.320
I can understand avoiding certain substances and behaviors

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.520
But the idea that you weren't going to look people in the eye because there's gonna be too much dopamine

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.600
I mean, I guess it depends on who you're looking in the eye and how much their look

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.760
positively arouses you but the fact of the matter is that that's not

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.440
That's not a very rational way to think about dopamine detox

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.840
But staying out of you know, high intensity

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.560
Highly rewarding activities

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:11.760
I think could be useful in terms of reestablishing that dopamine balance and everything we know from ana's work is that

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:20.480
Dopamine, you know, if you drive those dopaminergic states too long addictive drugs, etc. People can do this with sex food drugs gambling

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.680
social media all sorts of things

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.440
Um pornography

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:30.480
You know what ends up happening is the amount of dopamine that's released over time goes down and down and down and down

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:35.440
And pretty much is traversing into the territory of pain and then people again are back to this thing where you know

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.440
They're scrolling internet porn

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:43.680
8 9 10 times or hours a day and then they're wondering like why this isn't effective for them anymore whereas it was before

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:50.880
And there's an additional issue with pornography, which is not often discussed, which is that remember guys in particular

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.960
The brain is a learning prediction machine and if

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.080
I'm not trying to say that all pornography is bad

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.040
But there are good data to support the idea that

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:05.120
If your brain learns to be aroused by watching other people

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.040
Have sex

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:12.640
It is not necessarily going to carry over to the ability to get aroused when you're one on one with somebody else

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:18.000
Right the especially young kids who are consuming a lot of pornography. The brain is learning

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.720
sexual arousal to

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.920
Other people having so you're going to program yourself into being a voyeur

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:31.120
Yeah, or just create challenges in in sexual interactions with you know with with peer with a

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.800
With a real partner

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:39.520
Mary Harrington has the three laws of porno dynamics and the second law of porno dynamics is the law of fap entropy

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.080
And it says that whatever you start out wanking to will get progressively more intense over time

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:49.360
And I think that this is sort of speaking to that ever ever sort of escalating amount of

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.440
The wildness that you need to watch in order to get an ever decreasing

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:59.680
Stimulus that comes back. Yeah, and you know here. I'm I'm approaching this only through the lens of biology, right?

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.800
I'm not a you know, I'm not a psychologist, and I'm certainly not

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:07.200
Um political in it in any way at least not I have ideas about politics

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:12.640
But I just don't discuss them publicly, but the but the idea here is that you know, I'm not saying

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.360
Pornography as a stimulus is bad or good. What I'm saying is it

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.320
In its availability and its

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:28.960
Extreme forms. It's a very potent stimulus and very potent stimuli of any kind extremely palatable food

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.360
extreme pornography

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:36.640
Extreme experiences like bungee core jumping those set a threshold for dopamine release and

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:42.880
Anna will tell you that and I'm sure she did that the higher the dopamine peak the bigger the drop afterwards

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.920
And it's not that you drop to baseline you drop below baseline

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:52.160
So again, it's not these things aren't good or bad. They just have to be controlled in a way because

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.480
When people are pursuing dopamine peaks over and over and over

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.840
And they aren't getting them typically it's because they've been pursuing that activity

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.480
Far too often and you're saying perhaps take a break from that and there may be

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.240
An ability for yourself your system to reset, right? Yeah

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:13.200
Yeah, I mean in theory all the things that we're talking about with pornography

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.840
Could be superimposed onto food or could be superimposed onto real sex, right?

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.120
That one also has to be cautious there, right?

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.480
but

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:28.800
The cycling back and forth between dopamine and low dopamine states dopamine fasting as it were but maybe just

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.920
Low dopamine states. These are natural rhythms

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:36.720
That existed in the nervous system. We had to remember what the dopaminergic system is there for

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.880
I'll say it again. I wasn't consulted the design phase, but we know as a as a

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:47.360
Generic form of motivation and pursuit you can imagine the human or the animal that's hungry or thirsty

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:51.360
It needs energy to go pursue the thing. So the idea that you have to eat in order to get energy

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:56.480
That's true, but you need energy in order to get the thing to eat. So our nervous system has energy also

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.560
That's dopamine and epinephrine

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.000
Yes, we use glucose and glycogen etc when we're pursuing things

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:07.360
But the idea here is you're pursuing something and then either by smell or by sight

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.280
You think you're on the right track. So you go down that track and then ah, there it is

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:15.520
You know, you get some berries or you get, you know, let's get prehistoric about this or you get to kill

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:20.480
The prey and eat it and then it gives you energy to continue this pursuit or to reproduce

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:24.080
I mean, there's a reason why humans and other animals seek out reproduction is that every

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.600
Every species but certainly humans have two innate

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:34.960
Desires built into them whether or not they decide to actualize this or not is the desire to protect young and make more of its own species

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:41.120
Every successful species does that even if people don't have children in general people care about

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.920
Children that because they of what they represent very few people dislike children

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.240
I mean, there are a few mutants out there that dislike children

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.320
But you always worry about those kinds of people

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.400
Yeah, you were talking earlier on about the fact that dopamine can be released

01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:00.240
When you set yourself a little goal and then achieve it and one of the ways that you encourage your grad students is to

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:03.680
Give them a little bit of reward earlier on so that it keeps them motivated

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.840
Is this the same mentality that works during an endurance event?

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.360
When you want to say i'm just going to get myself to the next lamppost

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.080
I've just got to get myself to that hill over there. Is that the same dynamic?

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.400
Yeah, um, we can call it milestoneing

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:21.200
You just set some milestone and the key thing here is that and this is the beauty of the dopamine system

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.440
Just like the stress system is generic the fear system is generic

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.520
It's designed for a bunch of different scenarios

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.120
The motivation system is also generic it can be

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.560
to

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:38.880
Achieve the next lamppost as a milestone or it can be five miles is the next milestone you get to control that

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.440
And it so it's completely arbitrary, right?

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:46.560
I mean in that one of the most brilliant things that was ever said to me by an extremely skilled psychoanalyst

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:53.600
Is so simple and yet I do think it's the most fundamental thing to understanding oneself is that it's all internal

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:58.960
Right if you finish a marathon in first place, no one comes along and drips dopamine in your ear

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.400
You self generate that it's all internal. It's all about your internal representation

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.440
Now that doesn't mean that there aren't good and bad events in life, but

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.520
The fact of the matter is that if you set the next milestone as

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.480
Just outside the distance of what you're comfortable with and you make it there

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.000
If you allow yourself a moment to register that win

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:27.280
You get energy to do to then set the next milestone and achieve it that energy is dopamine

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:34.480
converted into epinephrine into adrenaline and this is why you hear these incredible heroic stories like I mean

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.320
I think the movie sorry

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:42.000
I hate to say but the movie was less good than the book but like loan survivor the marcus latrell story and the

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:48.240
Actually, I think today or yesterday might be the anniversary of operation red wings. So all those guys sadly died except

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.160
marcus

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:54.880
And you know he in the movie he's it's like fast forward to where he I don't want to give it away

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.200
But where he basically is the loan survivor, but

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:04.000
In the book it's crazy. I mean the guy dragged himself on elbows and knees for miles and miles and miles, right?

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:10.560
You know that that kind of ability where you hear about people walking on stubs to you know, these incredible feats of human

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.720
Endurance and willingness to persist

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.600
those

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:23.600
People were able to do that not because of glycogen or they drank their goo or whatever the triathletes are always using

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.120
it's because of

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.640
nervous system

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:34.320
Energy the ability to continue to manufacture adrenaline and keep going and the and the extent to which that can continue is

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:39.920
No one will ever know I do believe that humans have a tremendous capacity to endure and persist

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:46.480
But that few human beings actually know how to tap into that system except under conditions of extreme survival

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.320
and you also hear from

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.920
really good physicians

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:54.320
Ones that aren't into woo biology or woo psychology at all that to some extent

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.000
Yes, there are people that unfortunately die in their battle against cancer

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:04.240
No matter what but that the the desire to continue living is a powerful force in of itself

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.400
There may be spiritual components. There may be that's not the business. I'm in

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.120
You know so and how I don't know the experiment I would do to test it

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.880
but almost certainly setting of milestones and the ability to generate dopamine and

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.840
Adrenaline is what allows people to persist and live longer. There's no question about that

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:25.680
One of the best books that I've read this year is the expectation effect by david robson

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:31.280
So he is a science writer from the uk and he looked at

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.520
A whole bunch of studies the placebo effect which everybody's familiar with right?

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:42.320
There is a particular expectation that an outcome is going to come from some sort of medication and lo and behold that outcome manifests

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.520
He found this across pretty much every area of anything that you care to care about

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.280
So my two favorite studies from this it was so so interesting

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:58.080
He realized that gluten intolerance self-report gluten intolerance has increased from 3 to 30 percent in 10 years

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:03.840
This is the why there's so many gluten-free options on the menu principally. They've got 30 of the population to serve

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:06.800
Yeah, so people need it and he was wondering. Well, what is it?

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:12.400
Human biology hasn't changed that much. Is it maybe that the foods have changed and people are responding to that?

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.280
Or is it maybe some sort of expectation because

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:21.200
The type of news stories that are hearing about gluten and about how bad it is for us and inflammation and all this sort of stuff

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.800
Maybe it's that and people are expecting it. So they brought people into a lab

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.920
They sit them down these people do and do not have

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.880
self-reported gluten intolerances

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.200
And they give everybody the same meal

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.440
They tell everybody in the room that it's got gluten in it. It's got no gluten in it

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.360
after a while

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.640
people who

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:44.320
Don't have a gluten intolerance biologically who haven't eaten gluten

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:51.040
Have diarrhea. They have hives. They're breaking out in inflammation. They're having to run at the bathroom. Okay. Well, that's kind of interesting

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.240
They did another another story that he spoke about

01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:00.880
VO2 max tests that they were looking at apparently there's a particular genetic mutation that allows people to blow off

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.600
CO2 and upregulate oxygen in a better way

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.960
They brought people in even numbers of people that didn't did not have this genetic trait

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.560
Split them into two random groups. So there was a mix of both do and do not have the trait in each

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:19.440
First group was told you've got the right genetic trait. You should be really really good at this second group was told

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.240
Sorry, you don't have it. You shouldn't be too good

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:28.080
No surprise perhaps at the group that was told that they did they ended up performing better

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:32.320
But when they actually looked at what was happening in the physiology of these people

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:37.040
They found that the people who didn't have the genetic mutation but were told that they did

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:42.480
Had a lower overall lactate threshold. They had a lower overall heart rate

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:45.760
They were blowing off CO2 more effectively and upregulating oxygen

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:49.440
Better than the people who did have the genetic mutation

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:55.120
But were told that they didn't so he coined this term that said your expectations are even more powerful than your genes

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.280
I love that. I'm going to read the book

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.360
I that's a remarkable example

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:05.280
And I think that you know a lot these days is being made of epigenetic effects and things but this is almost in the different direction

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:06.480
This is a

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.480
psychophysiological

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:09.680
response

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:15.680
I find this kind of thing to be honest among the more fascinating and interesting aspects of neuroscience

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.240
If not the most interesting lately

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.280
Those examples are tremendous

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:25.040
So I can't counter those at all with anything more spectacular

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:31.200
But that the work of dr. Aliyah crumb at stanford. She runs the stanford mind body lab and she's done

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.920
simple experiments, but they're really elegant

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.640
Instructing people one group all about the terrible effects of stress

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.640
Destroys your immune system, etc. etc other people telling them also true things

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:48.320
But all the positive effects of stress it sharpens your ability of function

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:52.480
You can remember things better, etc. etc. You see exactly what

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:56.240
You are told basically now you can't lie to people

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.800
You can't tell them things that aren't true

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:04.320
It's just about the subset of information that you get dictates the response you get and perhaps the most traumatic

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:06.800
Was they gave two different groups of people

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:10.800
And then they actually each got the opposite condition to a milkshake

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.920
One group is told this milkshake is very high calorie

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.400
It contains a lot of fat and sugar, etc

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.400
Another group is told

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:22.320
The milkshake they're getting is very low calorie. It's very nutrient sparse, etc

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:26.960
Then they measure hunger so how long it takes for them to get hungry again after ingesting it

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:28.800
They also look at insulin

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.480
And they also look at ghrelin this hormone that is secreted

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:37.280
Um as you get essentially makes you hungry. It's associated with hunger. There are other things too, but

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:42.640
You see exactly what you would expect which is that people that get the nutrient dense milkshake

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:47.200
Are satisfied for longer their ghrelin is suppressed and their insulin is higher

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:52.080
You see the opposite in the group that had the the so-called low calorie shake turns out. It's the exact same milkshake

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.920
This is remarkable right because this is not simply the placebo effect

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:04.080
I think it's the placebo effect plus the expectation effect plus a real physiological effect because that's what you describe as well

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:09.200
And the way that ali dr. Ali chrome she she goes by

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:12.480
The way she describes it is that any

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.200
event

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.200
Causes a real physiological response

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:24.080
But that real physiological response is braided in with our expectation and our understanding of what the response ought to be

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:29.280
To create the actual response. So it's sort of real plus perceived equals

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Actual reality. Yes, exactly. And so, um, I love this kind of thing as you can tell

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:38.080
I'm eating up the example that uh that you gave I think it's spectacular because

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.680
What it means is that no, we can't lie to ourselves

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:46.560
We can't tell ourselves that you know, drinking water is going to sustain us just as food would for

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.880
For five days. We're not going to be hungry

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:53.440
But to some extent if one understands that well, you can survive a long time on just water

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:58.240
And you don't need to eat then you might experience less hunger. That's the way the nervous system works

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.040
Well, you can definitely survive longer on just water if you believe that you can survive longer on just water

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:08.000
There is no reason not to believe this. So I was really really averse to the whole

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:13.760
Ronda burn the secret who sending out messages to the universe and david

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:22.000
Uh positions himself very anti that as well in the book. Um, but you can't deny the fact that the positive thinking has a real

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:28.320
physiological impact on what you do. He was talking about um, they did a study with

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.800
older people

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:36.240
That were past retirement and they asked them to use what what sort of words do you associate with getting older?

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:40.160
And they split these people into two different groups and the sort of words that people used

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:48.000
Perfectly mapped on to how long they were going to live. So the people that use the sort of words alone frail fragile injury death

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:51.520
They were the ones that lived the shortest the people that said

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.200
um

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.200
happiness freedom liberty

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.040
connection

01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:04.800
Maturity those sorts of words were the ones that lived the longest so your expectations can literally impact your longevity

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:11.280
There's I I'm yet to read the book in detail, but I've talked to a guy named ethan cross. He wrote a book called chatter on the show

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:18.080
Oh fantastic. Okay. I think that internal chatter world is a very interesting one that neuroscience will eventually have something to to say

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:22.320
Uh about I think the most powerful mindset

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.480
Uh, at least to me is one that again, I learned from ali crumb

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:29.360
This is a mindset that in her

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.640
Pure reviewed studies of different populations. It's clear exists

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:35.120
Um universally and people in the SEAL teams

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.680
but um less so

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.880
Or is perhaps even absent from the general population sadly

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.720
The idea that stress grows you

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:49.440
That challenge grows you, but isn't the only way that you can grow

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:55.600
I think is a very powerful mindset. So what do you mean by that? So they she what they did is she surveyed a bunch of different

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.600
People with different professions and asked, you know, what's your view of stress? Do you think it grows you?

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.200
It diminishes your ability, etc

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.560
So this isn't giving people information

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:08.720
This is asking them for information and the only group that said stress grows you the more challenge the better you get

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:12.720
Etc the more stress you experience the more likely you are to to succeed

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:18.000
Was the this group from the SEAL teams? I don't know if they were new recruits or if they had been in a long time

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.080
But that was the the group

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:25.680
I would add to that that yes, if you adopt the mindset that stress grows you you're going to be much better off

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:31.680
But also that stress is not the only way to grow in life, right? There's this idea, you know, we have this

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:36.720
And again, there's sort of a gravitational pull of this. I like stress grows. Yes, you know

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:41.440
Forward center of mass or you know, always be in friction limbic friction limbic friction

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.720
How about a more

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.200
expansive or nuanced version of that might be

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:52.480
Stress grows you so if you're under stress you're back on your heels from something you think, okay

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:57.520
How can I get flat-footed or even forward center of mass you tell yourself stress grows me stress grows me stress grows me

01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:03.440
But that doesn't mean stress is the only thing that will grow you right learning to cycle between periods of hard work and deep

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.920
What I call non-destructive

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.760
Uh deliberate reset, right? Um, that's what really works over time. I can attest to that

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:16.720
You know people who just really go out and tie one on in order to to recover

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.840
You can only get away with that for a few years before your body and mind start to give out, right?

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:25.360
so fine non-destructive ways to reset and

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.840
Also adopt the mindset that stress grows you and adopt the mindset that

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:35.920
You know, there are other ways to grow that don't involve stress and I think you're set up to have a pretty fantastic life

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:39.680
That's my you know, simple view of of the way these things work

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.880
Speaking of endurance and suffering

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.480
What have you learned from lex Friedman since you've been friends with him?

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:51.040
The guy works a lot. You can text him or call him at pretty much any hour except

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.360
Um, the early morning hours that he happens to be in because he's likely to be asleep

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:58.560
You know lex is a really interesting one. Um

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:00.880
because

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.880
You know like a lot of scientists and engineers

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:06.320
Yet he has that ability to really drop into the trench which is

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.840
Certainly not unique to scientists and engineers, but is really helpful

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:16.640
I think you lex comes at things from a from at once a very engineering physics perspective

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:21.280
Which you know, obviously computer science robots and all AI and all that he loves that stuff

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:25.120
But you know, there's a phrase that he's used over and over again in our conversations

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.640
And he's talked about this publicly and I've started to pay a bit more attention to

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:33.760
Because he says it so many times which is you know approach life with love in your heart

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:37.520
You know, which is weird, right? You think about an engineer who's thinking like this goes there

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.600
And this is what it's going to predict the best outcome and then you think like approach things with love in your heart

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:45.680
And I think he's right because and I think that is very powerful because

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:48.480
There are so many pitfalls

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:51.360
And by pitfalls what I mean are energy sinks

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:55.120
That you know across the day from the time you wake up until you go to sleep at night

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:59.520
There's so many places for you to put your energy can go into online battles. It can go into

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:04.560
Uh, you know texting five different people. It can be investing in one person

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:09.680
It can be there's so many things and so much of success in any domain is about

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:13.280
Yes, maintaining focus. We hear about that a lot focus focus focus

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:19.280
But what is focus focus is really about not allowing energy to dissipate into these kind of meaningless trails

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:27.280
So I think about lex and I as I do for all people. I think, you know, what animal does he best represent or what animal best represents him

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.920
I think of all people like this. I have this kind of weird

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.600
Process where after I spend some time with somebody it just pops to mind

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:37.680
Like I can't tell you what animal comes to mind yet. You might see that after the ice bath later on

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:42.160
We'll see how long it's you might be you might be a polar bear. Um, super comfortable in the water

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:45.440
Um the cold water, but I think that you know at some point

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:51.520
I realized that that lexes gets very fixated on things very very fixated

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.840
But he also knows how to disengage

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:59.600
And he really avoids energy sinks through this and losses through this kind of love

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.080
Thing that he's really into

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:08.480
Because anger is very energetically demanding. It's great fuel, but it's not efficient fuel overall

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.240
Right, it's it's like having a gas tank full of fuel, but there are a lot of leaks in it

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:16.480
Whereas I do think that doing things out of genuine desire. There's a calm

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:21.440
Sort of energized balance that comes with that and you feel like you can go forever

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:24.400
So this is starting to sound a little bit. Woo. It sounds like, oh, you know

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:28.080
The heart is more powerful than the adrenals and like they're both powerful

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:31.520
The adrenals can keep you alive and enduring for a long long time

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:36.640
But if you do things out of anger and friction for too long your immune system will crash. We know this

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.440
but it is

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:44.320
Essentially infinite how much energy you can derive out of genuine desire

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:47.680
To engage with something or somebody what animal is he then?

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:52.160
You know lex. Well, his hair makes me think he's some spiky thing

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:57.440
He's sort of like he's some he sort of has the like the persistence of the porcupine

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:02.400
But he has he's definitely has I think he as much as I don't want to admit it because I wish it were me

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:08.880
Not him, but I think the animal that best captures lex because he's also a bit of a loner is the wolverine

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:13.360
I've spent a lot of time thinking about actual wolverines. Not the Hugh Jackman version of wolverines

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:19.680
But the actual wolverines they're very solo animals unless they pair up to mate. They're incredibly strong

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.760
He is freakishly strong

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:25.680
I've done jujitsu with him. I'm not good at jujitsu. He is he's a black belt jujitsu

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.280
But he is freakishly strong. So if I had to pick an animal I'd say probably

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:33.360
Um the wolverine. What's interesting about him. I went to

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:38.160
Thanksgiving with him last year, which was my first time of enjoying that holiday here, which is a fantastic holiday

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:42.080
I actually think we don't have something in the uk where people sit back and do that

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:47.440
Gratitude reflection period except for Christmas, you know people do that end of your review

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.400
But I really think and especially the time of your it's in it's perfect. So

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.520
we were talking and

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.840
He was talking about the fact that

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:56.800
He was working hard

01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:02.960
But he feels this gap between where he is and where he could be which I sounds like less sense is a common

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:05.520
pattern. Yeah, and

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:10.560
He was saying that a lot of the friends that he speaks to will say, you know, you're doing well. You're working hard

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.400
and

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:16.880
He looked me in the eyes and he's like, I don't want them to say that I want them to tell me to suck it up

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:21.840
I want them to tell me that I need to stop being such a pussy and keep going as I it takes an

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:26.000
Unbelievably singular person to work as hard as he does. I don't think that the internet

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:29.520
Whatever people know about how hard he works

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:34.560
Is only a small sliver of just how obsessive and committed he is

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.640
And for him to say that he wants to be around more people that push him in that way

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:40.880
It made me realize that

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:42.640
perhaps

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.080
I could be offering more to my friends as well that

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:48.560
offering them just sort of

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.320
support

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.840
in the form of

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:57.600
acceptance and and presence and I'm hearing you and dude, you're doing great or whatever reassurance in that way

01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:02.320
Maybe isn't always the best way to go about things. So yeah, that was it's just something that stuck in my mind

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.880
It's something it's a little model that I've kept with me where I'm thinking look

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:07.200
Does my friend need me to tell him that he's doing good?

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:11.360
Or does he need me to tell him to suck it up and get his nose down because I know that you can do it

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.440
Sounds very much like lex I'm learning about your your internal workings a bit too

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:19.680
There are three kinds of reward two of them are often discussed one is rarely discussed

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:24.160
And but is pretty powerful and I think it's useful to think about toggling between these different rewards

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.880
Whether or not for ourselves or whether or not in trying to

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.520
stimulate and motivate other people

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:32.800
One of course is reward. You did great

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.240
Congratulations. That was awesome. Love that podcast

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:42.160
Great that you got an a plus on your report card or b plus because last year you got a c whatever it is reward

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.640
Then there's punishment, right?

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:47.360
This is obvious you screwed up like

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:53.760
You take something away or you take the anticipation of reward away, whatever it is you screwed up

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:58.160
You're punished you're grounded, etc. You're not watching tv for a month or whatever it is no screens for a month

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:03.040
Then there's the third kind of reward, which is the reward that you hang out in front of somebody

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.480
At a distance like a carrot on a stick out in front of them

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:13.440
Which is not reward for what they've accomplished, but reward that they can anticipate if they accomplish something

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:15.440
I think this could be

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:20.560
Very effective in the context that we're talking about it, which is how would I do this with lax?

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.080
I'd say, you know, I really loved this particular interview

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:31.040
If only the next time you have that person on you also asked them this, right? That's not a punishment

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:35.920
You're not saying it sucked because it didn't include this. You're not saying it wasn't great. You're saying

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.720
If next time you were to do that

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.880
I think it would be even better

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:46.480
So you're hanging a potential reward out in front and I think that can be a very powerful motivator

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:50.160
So you can you know, we could build up a number of different examples around this

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:56.000
But this is not often talked about in sort of reward punishment schedules and motivation

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.560
We always think reward and punishment, but we think immediate reward immediate punishment

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.120
Now in terms of building habits

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:08.240
And goal setting and goal seeking we know that visualizing failure is

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:16.480
For better or for worse is a far better motivator than visualizing success if you want to get people motivated to start

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:21.040
All right to start now getting people to continue

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.360
Involves regular rewards for reaching milestones. However, and I should have said this earlier

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:32.080
I want to make sure that we do emphasize that the best schedule really is random intermittent reinforcement

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:37.520
So if you're setting milestones on this run or in your intellectual pursuits or business pursuits or relationship pursuits

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:43.280
If you set a milestone and you get there you do want to have a little bit of an internal celebration

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:47.600
Remember it's all internal so internal celebration not extrinsic celebration

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:50.000
And reward

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.200
But every once in a while it's good to just not reward yourself

01:29:53.600 --> 01:30:00.240
Now at what ratio should you do that? Well, the the computer modeling data say that the optimal ratio of success

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.640
successful trials and

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:07.760
Unsuccessful trials for learning and motivation is going to be about 85 of the time to reward yourself

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.600
And about 15 of the time to not reward yourself

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:15.280
So random intermittent lack of reward is another way to think about it

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:18.240
And I talked about this with jocco a little bit and he thought oh, yeah

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:23.040
Probably what we should do is have workouts where it's a big fishbowl full of ping pong balls

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:25.680
And about 15 of them are marked with reward

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:28.720
But the other ones is you do something and you get to go take a ping pong ball out

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.280
And if you take that out then you get some reward

01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:37.120
If it's marked and if it's not then you don't and rather than every time you accomplish something

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:40.960
You go reward yourself. So here we're talking we're getting kind of into the weeds of reward schedules

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.960
But I think if you really want to support a friend

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.960
Punishment you should use very judiciously

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:48.320
Although if they really screw up a good friend as they say we'll put

01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:52.240
The friendship ahead of the friend or the friend ahead of the friendship. Excuse me

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:55.200
The friend ahead like you're going to tell them what they really need to hear

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.320
Even if it compromises the friendship if you really believe they need to hear that

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:02.720
Other times reward like that was awesome. Congratulations. And then

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:05.680
Occasionally if it's warranted

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.400
That was great ish

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:12.880
But it would be so much better if the next time you did this or that was great

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:16.560
But you know, honestly, I think it was a mixture of good and not so good

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:21.920
So I think those are three powerful ways to reward and they can be mixed up and toggled back and forth

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.440
According to whatever schedule allows that person to continue. What is your morning routine look like at the moment?

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.240
morning routine is

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.520
wake up

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.360
if I

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:34.560
Run about what time?

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:40.640
I'm waking up these days around 6 a.m. 6 30 a.m. I'm trying to go to sleep by about 10 30 p.m

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:42.960
Sometimes it's 11. Sometimes it's 10

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:46.320
I wake up

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:51.200
And I have to be careful here because that whenever I've described my routine in a little bit of detail people always say

01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:53.200
I can't believe you don't go to the bathroom. That's like well

01:31:54.240 --> 01:32:00.480
So I want to my pants exactly right foot left foot. So I want to be clear. I take care of my basic functions

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:04.160
But when I wake up I make a beeline for sunlight

01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:08.160
So I'm going to get sunlight in my eyes for the you know

01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:11.600
I'll probably go into the grave saying this so forgive me if people have heard me say this before but

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.640
The single best thing you can do for your sleep your energy your mood your wakefulness your metabolism

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:23.760
Is to get natural light in your eyes early in the day. Don't wear sunglasses to do it takes about 10 minutes or so

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:27.920
Um, if you live in a cloudy area if you're in the uk in the winter

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:32.480
Yes, or the summer or the summer. Maybe you resort to some artificial light as a replacement, but

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:35.200
As much as one can get bright

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:38.320
natural and if not natural artificial light in your eyes early in the day

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.880
without sunglasses

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:42.640
contacts and

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:46.560
Eyeglasses are fine. Don't try and do it through a window or windshield. It's going to take far too long

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:49.120
This sets in motion a huge number of different

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:55.120
Neuro biological and and hormonal cascades that are good for you reduces stress late at night

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:59.760
Offsets cortisol a million different things really that are good for you. So I get that

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:03.520
And yes, some that walk do not walk ideally that would be a walk

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:06.560
but sometimes we'll just go into the yard and have some coffee and and

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:13.040
You know, soak into whatever sunlight through through the clouds if it's a cloudy overcast day, it might be 20 30 minutes if it's a

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.320
Um, it's a very bright day. It might just be a few minutes

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:21.680
But really the the quality studies on humans that have looked at this say try and get as much

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:26.080
Natural light as you can in the morning hours whenever it is that that is for you

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:30.000
Especially the first three hours after waking if you can work outside great

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.480
If you can get in your window because as opposed to just in a dark conference room, that's better

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:38.080
But if you can get outside, that would be fantastic. So I get sunlight

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:43.600
I hydrate I drink water and then yerba mate is my favorite form of coffee. Excuse me caffeine

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:48.000
Are you waiting? How long are you waiting from 90 to 120 minutes? Are you doing any salts during that time?

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:53.920
Are you taking any electrolytes in I am a fan of water with element before I had element packets

01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:57.520
I would just take a little bit of sea salt or pink salt your favorite element flavor

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:02.240
I like them all. There's one I don't like. I'm not a fan of the chocolate one, but I like either

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:08.000
Yeah, some people love it. My podcast producer his wife loves that. So I give it to her the chocolate mint one

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.320
but um, I like the raspberry the

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:17.200
Um, the citrus one. I love that stuff mango chili is if you open the mango chili and breathed in shortly afterwards

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:21.440
It's like being pepper sprayed. It's absolutely insane. It's like it's like being blasted in the face

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:26.160
But yeah, I mean that's that's just the best way that cold glass of water and that first thing in the morning

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:28.400
and I mean it was you who

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:34.560
Reassured me of the what I thought was bro science about your adenosine system not being active for the first 90 minutes

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:38.400
And if you're going to pump caffeine onto that, you're not really actually acting on that

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:42.480
Your adrenal system is the one that you need to be looking at optimal you hydration all that sort of stuff

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:45.600
It's just such a good way to start the day. So okay, we've got

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:50.240
90 minutes deep what have you been doing in that you've had your light in the eyes

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.640
What have you been doing between that and the yerba matter in 90 minutes?

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:55.280
I do everything I can to

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.200
Not do email

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:01.600
Not do social media and to take care of a few critical tasks these days

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:05.040
I'm I have this obsession with trying to do one

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:07.760
Cognitively hard thing a day

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:08.960
one

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:14.960
And one physically hard thing a day now does it not extreme physical not david goggin's level workouts or anything but

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:20.320
In that 90 minutes, I'll typically try and read a research article start to finish

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:26.480
Or I'll work on a document that I might be doing a grant or research paper or planning a podcast or researching a podcast

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:31.040
I try and get my brain into kind of a linear mode. I try and narrow that aperture

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:33.680
As if I don't the distraction

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:38.400
That's created by social media and interactions with others can kind of wick out into the rest of the day

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:42.720
So I'm not necessarily trying to finish something in that time, but I try and do something

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:45.200
Challenging I experience great

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:48.160
pleasure from

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.400
Battling through something mentally challenging

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:56.160
But that's something that I built up since my university years when I was about you know 19 or so got serious about school and

01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.080
Really started to

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:02.720
Experience the the deep pleasure of like I figured that out or like that was really tough

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:06.720
I don't always succeed, but that's what I'm doing in that hour to 90 minutes

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.440
But I confess sometimes

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:13.360
We'll take a walk during that time and maybe talk through some things that are that are challenging

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:18.640
You know or sometimes I get lazy and I miss a day of that cognitive challenge

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:21.680
Then I do caffeine about 90 to 120 minutes

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:24.720
after waking and

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.280
Even though I prefer to work out earlier

01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:32.480
I generally will then do some sort of physical workout. I have a very consistent routine

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:36.640
I've done over 30 years where I weight train for 45 or

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:40.880
Minutes to an hour every other day and occasionally I take an extra day off

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:46.480
And occasionally due to travel or other commitments. I'll occasionally double up two days and then take two days off

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:52.640
So it's really boring, you know talk about workout schedules, but it's really simple. It's like, you know, I'll do a

01:36:54.320 --> 01:37:00.080
Kind of pushing day rest pulling day upper body push up rest upper body pull

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:06.960
Rest and then legs take two days off something like that. Are you doing on the off days? Are you doing some sort of zone three?

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:13.120
Always jogging or skipping rope. Those are my favorite forms of cardio sometimes swimming

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:16.240
But typically I'll go running for 30 to 45 minutes

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:21.840
Or if I'm feeling a little bit lazier because I always find the high intensity stuff to be easier than the long drawn out stuff

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:27.600
I'll sometimes throw on a weight vest a 30 or 50 pound weight vest and I'll go out for a shorter run

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.600
Or I'm a big fan of knees over toes. Ben Patrick. I know you had him on

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:35.840
We were down in Costa Rica with him and his wife who had the best time and learned so much

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:38.800
I'll occasionally

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:40.800
Do a backwards, you know, he'll walk

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:46.800
Or throw on the weight vest for that. We sometimes we'll get bands and we'll so there's a great way to combine this

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:53.040
We will sometimes get two people in one of these thick bands do hill walks in the morning while getting our sunlight

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.320
But that I don't really consider a workout. I consider that just kind of rehabilitate us at movement

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:02.320
So on the off days I'm doing cardio and sometimes that's the morning. Sometimes that's in the evening

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:06.800
I do not like to wait trained on the second half of the day because I like to be really caffeinated when I wait train

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:08.800
I like to listen to loud fast music

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:11.360
Most of the time not always I keep my phone

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:15.120
Out or off of for most workouts

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:21.840
Podcasts maybe if I'm running but I really try hard when I'm working out to just focus on the workout

01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:25.520
And those workouts the weight training workouts are always 10 minutes or so of warm-up

01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:30.160
And then no more than 40 to 50 minutes of really hard work

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.240
If I do train hard any longer

01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.640
I don't recover enough to be able to come in a few days later

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.920
And when I train that way I generally make pretty consistent progress

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:42.480
And you're taking yourself up until what's that probably maybe 10 30 11 a.m. Something like that

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.360
Yeah, and then I'll eat my first real meal now occasionally

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:47.920
I'll wake up really hungry if I didn't eat that well the night before

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:51.440
But typically the after I train I yeah, I'll eat

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:58.880
I like oatmeal after I train oatmeal fruit some fish oil protein drink and then maybe 90 to 120 minutes after that

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:03.040
I'll have a real lunch. My lunch is pretty much the biggest meal of the day if I have my way

01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:05.200
It'll be a steak a salad

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:08.320
Maybe a little more starch although I sort of got it earlier

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:15.280
Um, brazil nuts and that meal sometimes can extend longer and longer. I love being a feeding. I love to eat

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.400
Yeah, so I'll eat and then I confess I usually will work a little bit more for about 30 minutes or an hour

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.480
typically email and then I'll take a

01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:23.600
um

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.200
10 to 30 minute

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:28.960
Yoganidra nap or a nap and then come back refreshed

01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:34.240
Um, I really struggled with the naps man. I come back after that and my emotions are all over the place

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.320
I'm disoriented. Maybe it's because I

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:42.400
Struggled to fall asleep super quickly and therefore I'm extending that period out for a little bit longer than I need

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:47.920
I probably need to try the Yoganidra thing. But for me, it's it I'm absolutely all over if I do that

01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:52.880
I wake up and I don't know what day it is and my emotions always feel a little bit out of whack as well

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:57.920
I wake up grumpy from naps. Sometimes I'm told okay. There are a few times when I've woken up just really angry

01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:01.440
I have no idea what that's about. I don't know any of the neurochemistry associated with that

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.520
Sometimes I wake up from naps. It's really pleasant

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:06.640
I'll occasionally if the nap is early enough in the day afterwards

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:09.600
I'll have a you know, a nice double espresso and get back into work

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:13.680
That's the hardest part of the day actually if I was well structured in the early part of the day

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:20.240
It's that two or three p.m. The key is then to try and get something really useful done cognitively again

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:24.560
So some people might look at this and say wait, you're working for an hour in the morning and 30 minutes here in an hour

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.560
in the afternoon when you actually working but

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.760
It's really about the depth of the trench when you're working

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:33.440
And so if I'm going to drop into something again for a few hours in the afternoon

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.920
I'm really going to drop into it and that's typically phone off and out of the room

01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:42.560
And my goal is to get to the evening time so that I can do the things that I want in the evening

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:46.640
I can enjoy like I'm always setting a goal of the next time block

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:50.000
So this is something I've been doing for a long time, but even more so lately

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:56.160
I don't think my goal in the next hour is to do blank. I think this is dopamine reward predictions

01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:00.320
Inaction, I think okay if I get this workout done

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:04.800
Then I'll be able to eat at more or less the same time which I enjoy and then

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.000
Something else will happen. So I'm very focused on what I'm doing

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.920
But I'm doing it for the purposes of like opening up the next door to the next thing

01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:16.960
So if I can get that afternoon work block done, I'm thinking if I can just really get this podcast recorded

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:21.200
Which I enjoy is that your usual time to record middle of the afternoon used to be in the morning

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:26.320
But I'm getting I'm putting more and more preparation into them all the time my poor podcast producer

01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:28.960
He's like, you know, I always joke that the one thing these podcasts

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:34.720
Probably will succeed in doing meaning my podcast is they're going to cure insomnia because some of them are so damn long

01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:41.600
But I experience so much pleasure from spending a week or two researching something and then putting some structure on it

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:45.840
As you know, I mean podcasting is its own its own sort of natural drug

01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:49.280
It just feels good if you enjoy doing this sort of thing

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:53.200
Um, so typically what we're starting late in the day now and going till pretty late

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.840
For me the problem that I have so I'm fasted right now. We're what one minute to 4 p.m

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.520
You haven't eaten anything today. No, no, nothing gracious. So but that's the only way if I eat I've my thoughts become slower

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:07.840
I'm not as verbally articulate. I'm nowhere near as agile now. I could push this super super late

01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:09.840
I'm sure and it would be probably a pretty bad idea

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:16.320
Maybe I could avoid maybe I could go protein and fat or just mostly protein earlier on and that would have a void

01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:21.120
But I just find that my thoughts and my verbal articulation just goes through the toilet

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:24.400
It's adrenaline if you I mean, I think that sorry to interrupt you

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:29.760
But if you ingest a bunch of glucose or you know, I think you're getting that I mean you've got to have a nice

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:32.480
I'm guessing that we were to tap your vein right now

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:38.160
If we could do micro dialysis on your brain that you have a nice low but steady level of adrenaline

01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:42.400
And listen, this adrenaline thing this dopamine thing is no joke

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:47.840
This is the stuff of human evolution, right? This is the these are the same neurochemicals

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:52.800
This is this is the energy drink of human evolution. This is not the rock star red bull, etc

01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:57.680
That stuff just hijacks this very system. I'm not saying it's bad. It's just feeding this very same system

01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:03.520
So if you find an eating schedule or a fasting schedule that allows you to tap into that as a resource

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.400
I don't care what anyone says about whether or not fasting will make you live longer or not. Who knows, right?

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:11.280
If you're in the control group, you know, what's going to happen

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:12.560
So

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:15.280
But everyone presumably everyone dies eventually

01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:18.560
So pick your pick your mode of eating be my guest

01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:21.760
But if you figured out a way to tap into this

01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:29.440
In a way that works for you by all means leverage that because until somebody comes along and says that intermittent fasting is unhealthy

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.280
Well, then to me it seems at least for me eating between 11 p.m

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.360
Excuse me 11 a.m

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:37.360
Ish and 8 p.m ish

01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:38.880
Is great

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.720
And what I can also tell you is that having a consistent meal schedule

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.120
Meaning a feeding window. We absolutely know. I don't know why this isn't discussed more

01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:51.920
We absolutely know that that helps anchor your sleep schedule and having a

01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:57.920
Anchored sleep schedule helps anchor your light viewing schedule and a light viewing so it all starts to piece together

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:04.400
I think that what's lost in the discussion about nutrition except for the fact that most online discussions about nutrition are carried out by

01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.920
Religious well, they're religious

01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:09.200
But they also seem to be carried out by people that have it's like I don't know like like

01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:14.320
Real feelings of powerlessness in themselves like it comes through like because they're quibbling over like

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:18.240
Whether or not you should eat a cracker or not or whether or not, you know

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:23.280
Inhaling oxygen, you know westward is going to break your fast or not

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.680
I'm obviously I once I said David Sinclair came on my show twice and he's a fantastic human

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.840
I know your friends with him and um

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:36.720
He talked about the fact that his resveratrol goes into a small amount of fatty yogurt

01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:39.440
I think because it's like breakfast, right?

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:42.800
So you need to mix it in and it's homemade yogurt and something else and something else

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:48.240
And it's like that it's it's a shot of yogurt, right? It's enough for him to put his little capsule of resveratrol in

01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:53.440
And the comments were a light with people. Oh, yeah, saying that's not a real fast

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:56.160
Because you've got it's so sad

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:59.680
You know, it's so sad that we can't have a nuanced conversation about nutrition online

01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:06.400
That well, let's let's be fair calories in calories out applies, right? I don't think the laws of thermodynamics have disappeared

01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:07.680
Um

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:12.800
And yet you have people who would argue that it doesn't and okay like we'll let them have their their arguments

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:18.720
I think that the key thing is when you find an eating schedule that works for the other things that you need to do in life

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:20.800
it's really beautiful because

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:26.880
Then you really start to exert some control over these energy systems. What we're talking about is focus and de-focus

01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:32.640
We're talking about focus and deliberate decompression. We're not it's yoga nidra or a nap or simply a walk

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:34.240
um

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:39.760
And food as you point out is a wonderful source of caloric energy. We need it at some point

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:44.880
But it also can create this parasympathetic response where we feel very tired

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:49.040
Especially if you don't eat for long periods of time and then you eat substantial amount of starches

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:51.760
You will feel like calmer and more relaxed

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:53.440
this so

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:55.440
And maybe sleepy and maybe brain foggy

01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:00.160
So I I've been you know, of course assaulted by this for this online

01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:07.520
I do tend to eat some more starches in the evenings and fewer proteins and sure you can show me 20 double blind placebo controlled

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:12.400
Or randomized controlled trials saying that if you're gonna eat starches, you should eat them in the early part of the day

01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:14.240
Well, I do that too after I train

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:17.040
But ultimately what I'm interested in doing is maintaining

01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:22.560
The kind of bodily health and aesthetic that I'm looking for my blood lip is that I'm looking for

01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:24.560
But I want to accomplish things in life

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:28.560
So I think if one gets too distracted by what's possible with nutrition

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:32.080
It can be it can really take somebody off target. No one ever

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:34.880
succeeded in creating anything useful

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:40.480
In terms of worker relationships by overly focusing on changing their dietary intake

01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:44.960
But so once it works. So what once something works for you

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:49.040
I say just lean into it. Just lean into it and that can change over time

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:53.760
So that can really change over time. Do you know alex hall mosey? You familiar with him sounds familiar

01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Really hot shit on the internet at the moment this sort of gym bro who has founded this company and

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:04.960
Is now moving on to bigger and better things. He's eating. I'm pretty sure he's eating the same lunch

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:06.640
for

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:10.800
10 years or something. He always has the same lunch and he's got the exact same

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:15.600
Thought process around this that you do if you were going back to the morning routine thing

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.240
if you were to design

01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:23.600
Or if you were to instruct someone to do the worst possible things in the morning

01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:26.080
To set their day up for failure. What would they be?

01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:31.280
Uh wake up and stay in bed. Uh, well, wait, there are good reasons to stay in bed in the morning

01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:33.440
But once those are completed then

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.680
staying in bed

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:41.520
Is curtains drawn? Yeah curtains drawn just using your passively scrolling on social media

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.120
um

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:44.560
like there are

01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:47.920
There are neurobiological data showing that when you are upright

01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:51.360
You actually are stimulating this area of the brain called locus ceruleus

01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:55.760
Whereas when you recline you actually are less alert. Literally the position of your body

01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:00.800
Dictates some of your levels of alertness. That's why you suggest people to not sit like this

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:03.920
At their work desk, right? Yes, and if you're look and

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.120
If you're looking down

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:11.760
While working you're actually less alert than you could be if your eyes are averted slightly over

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:16.480
Most people that are on their phone including me and the postural stuff is really bad, too

01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:22.320
I mean i'm getting i'm trying to really combat that internal rotation, you know that the c-shaped human kind of thing, you know

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:27.200
It's really not good. I'm really trying in fact one. This is so common now

01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:29.760
the c-shaped human thing that

01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:36.080
It almost feels strange to be upright, you know, like people think exactly the open the the uh

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:41.520
Sort of external rotation is good for us. We know this but in bed. I would say in bed

01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:46.720
So people are on their phone. They're in bed. They're they're not getting enough light or they just artificial light

01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:49.040
Where they're trying to get the sunlight through the window terrible

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:55.840
They are then going and sitting and getting into like hip, you know hip flexor contraction

01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:59.120
They're drinking coffee too early in the day

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:02.640
They aren't getting into any kind of movement

01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:06.480
But it's mostly about the sort of randomization of activities

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:09.040
Sort of making a cup of coffee while texting

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:13.120
Not getting sunlight, you know, then they're scattering that in with like a little bit of work

01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:16.320
But then something hits that's stressful and they're diverting their attention

01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:19.840
They're sort of building in this eight attention deficit like disorder

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:26.960
Through they're doing they're not single task. They're not monotasking and they're not being deliberate or intentional with the things that they're doing

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:31.200
They're just allowing the morning to kind of come and take them wherever the wind blows

01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:32.000
That's right

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.840
And I have to say even though I describe my routine accurate my morning routine accurately if I were to really optimize it

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:40.960
And I've done this from time to time. I would get up

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:44.480
I would hydrate and I would immediately exercise

01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:47.120
I would use that early

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:52.320
You know peaking of the cortisol response that comes with waking to get the body into action

01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:57.200
Sort of jockel willing style right 4 30. I always see his posts, but I see them at 7 a.m

01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.600
Yeah

01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:02.960
So you know jockel was up before me again today

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:07.600
Yeah, he seems to always beat me by a few minutes unless I wake up in the middle of the night for a moment

01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:09.200
but

01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:11.840
To really get into action because that's going to generate its own

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:17.600
Dopamine and adrenaline response anytime I've worked out really early like if I have a flight and then

01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:20.400
You know and then moved into the other components of my day

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.840
I find that I feel better all day long

01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:28.720
I I also will say if I work out really early maybe between 7 and 8 a.m

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:34.160
Well, then my first meal might land at 9 a.m. So you know, you need to be flexible with some of these things

01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:38.880
But the general principles apply I notice that you haven't put cold exposure into your morning routine

01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:40.480
I'm going to guess you must have a cold tub of some kind

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:41.760
You have a cold tub in a sauna

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:46.400
I've been less good about that lately the best time to do that for me is on my cardio days

01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:51.040
I do it after because you don't want to do it post hypertrophy because you're going to blunt some of the responses

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:53.840
That are actually you're trying to get by the the workout itself

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:59.440
That's right. And I have one I should say I have one rest day per week where I don't do any cardio or weight training

01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:02.720
I really like doing having a complete rest day, but on that complete rest day

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:04.880
If I can

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:06.000
I'll do

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.240
20 minutes of sauna and then cold for three minutes 20 minutes of sauna and then cold

01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:11.760
I'll make the rest day

01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:18.080
Reparative yeah, and generally we make that social where we're talking about things and and we're very social in our working out like we

01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:20.640
Talk my partner and I talk while we work out

01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:22.720
You know when it's set when it's time to do a set

01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:24.480
I become a little bit of like the drill sergeant

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:28.080
So like let's do your set do your set, but then occasionally I'm the guy doing a set and I'm like all right

01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:30.560
So this afternoon we're you know

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:36.160
But I try and I try and really focus and I enjoy training by myself too, but generally we train together and then

01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:40.480
And then typically if we're doing ice bath or sauna we try and coordinate those things

01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:44.880
So I've seen a bunch of research about sauna. I've seen a bunch of research about cold exposure

01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:52.320
Contrast therapy, which is huge here in Austin going from sauna to cold and it seems like 20 and 3

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:54.800
Three rounds is very typical

01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:58.240
Is there something that we're gaining or something that we're losing?

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:04.400
By doing that cycle rather than doing a block of heat and a block of cold separately

01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:09.520
Not that i'm aware of but you know that we finally have some good science to put to this and unfortunately

01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:14.080
It wasn't from my lab. This is the beautiful work of susanna soberg who's over in scandinavia

01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:18.240
Published a paper in cell reports medicine showing that the threshold you're trying to hit each week

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:24.960
Is at least you can do more but at least 11 minutes of uncomfortable but safe cold exposure

01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:32.720
Per week total so that could be three minutes monday three minutes wednesday so on to 11 minutes and 57 minutes per week

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:35.760
Minimum so size. That's what they found

01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.960
What did they find increases brown fat thermogenesis?

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:43.760
thereby metabolism thereby comfort being you know in cold etc

01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:47.440
Clearly there's a resilience effect

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:51.920
Clearly there's a dopamine increasing effect and clearly you can do more you could do all that in one day

01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:56.080
Or you could spread it out throughout the week or you could do more it kind of depends on what you're shooting for

01:52:56.240 --> 01:53:00.400
How cold people always say how cold how hot well for heat is generally

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:05.200
Between 187 degrees fahrenheit and 212 degrees fahrenheit

01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:08.320
Somewhere in that range and for cold it's

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:11.200
Cold enough that you really want to get the hell out

01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:14.400
But that you can stay in safely because i don't want anyone to kill themselves with doing this stuff

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:16.960
Did i see you say that um

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:19.760
evening time

01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:21.200
heat exposure

01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:27.120
Increases growth hormone release by 16 times or something insane, but subsequent

01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:35.280
Sessions of the same only increase it by a very small margin. Yeah, am i talking about my asset? No, you're absolutely right so we can

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.400
We can delineate some protocols

01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:43.440
If you want to get better more resilient cold exposure is going to be great anytime

01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:46.880
Post cold exposure your body is going to heat up

01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:53.600
Think of your body heating up as waking up. So if you are concerned about not being able to sleep

01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:57.440
Then i would suggest you do your cold exposure earlier in the day, right?

01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:01.680
Heat does the opposite so i'm laying out some parameters here heat does the opposite

01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:03.760
You're going to heat up while you're in the deliberate heat exposure

01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:06.960
But afterwards there's a post heating dip in temperature

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:12.160
We can talk this was all covered in an episode with dr. Craig heller on thermogenesis gets a little bit down in the weeds

01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:16.720
But take my word for it or if you want to get the science you can go there to find the science behind this

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.600
So sauna at night is great

01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:23.760
As well now let's think about how to combine these things. So let's say you

01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:27.440
You know you're on it. It's a tuesday. You've done your weight training on monday

01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:32.720
And you want to do your heat and cold you don't have time to optimize everything perfectly you could say okay

01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:34.160
i'm going to do my

01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:40.800
Heat and cold at 10 a.m. Or 8 a.m. You get in the sauna for 20 minutes or so and then you get into the cold for three minutes

01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:43.920
And then you might get into the sauna again for 10 minutes

01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:48.400
And you get in the cold for another minute or so you end on cold

01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:52.400
Why because it'll wake you up and presumably you're not you want to be woken up for the day

01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:57.200
That also means don't then if you're doing it in a facility don't then go and have a warm shower

01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:01.840
Right once you've finished right coolest shower is fine because you want to clean off often

01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:04.160
I mean the ice bath is cleanish, but it's you know

01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:06.800
Depends where you're going in laboratories

01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:11.360
You're absolutely right in laboratories if we want to preserve something in particular a virus we put in the freezer

01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:13.680
If you want to kill a virus you heat it up

01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:17.520
This is never as dirty of a sauna as you want, but the cold tub

01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:22.640
Well, yeah the sauna sort of its own autoclave if it gets hot enough right and the cold

01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:26.960
Cold stuff needs to be cleaned out now and again you get mold growing in a in a freezer

01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:30.640
Which is kind of freaky to think about but you really can't it's never going to grow in a sauna

01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:35.040
Never going to grow if it gets hot enough now. There is what I call the sober principle

01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:41.600
Uh, which is if you are using deliberate cold exposure to increase metabolism end on cold

01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:44.320
So finish on the cold not just because it wakes you up more

01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:49.360
But because then you have to heat your body up naturally, which is a thermogenic metabolic response

01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:56.080
So end with cold and if you really want to push it you can do things like don't use a towel use evaporation

01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:00.160
Uh spread out your limbs and don't huddle so that you have to shiver more etc

01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:04.720
I mean a lot of little games you can play, but let's say you want to reduce post exercise inflammation

01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:08.800
You're not concerned with hypertrophy gains of muscle size gains or strength gains

01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:15.280
Well, then get in the cold after your your workout do that for one to some people can do 10 minutes reduce inflammation

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.040
Let's say you really want to hit growth hormone, which is what you asked

01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:26.320
The biggest effects of sauna on growth hormone and they are big effects are when the sauna is only done once per week

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:31.040
But it's done in four cycles or sets we could say of 30 minutes each

01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:34.240
So that means 30 minutes in the sauna at the temperatures I described before

01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:39.760
Then a five minute break just air cooling off or 10 minute break then back into the sauna for 30 minutes

01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:43.680
This is brutal. Then again in the afternoon 30 minutes in the sauna

01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:45.520
then

01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:50.080
10 minutes just air cooling off and then back into the sauna for 30 minutes. So that's two hours

01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:56.960
At 187 to 212 degrees in one day in one day with a maximum of what less than sort of 20 minutes

01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:01.600
Of rest in between those little sessions than the big rest in between. So you have to be very careful, right?

01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:07.040
Heat can kill you. You got to hydrate. You need to make sure you get enough salt like it. I mean, this is this is work, right?

01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:12.240
But you get you see in these human studies up to 16 fold increases in growth hormone

01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:15.040
So you could imagine this could exert some very strong

01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:20.640
Repairative effect if you're training for a big event or endurance event or maybe you're just really wiped out from the week

01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:25.680
This is a stressor, but it's a stressor that delivers a potent growth hormone response

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:28.480
Now if you do sauna more often than that

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:32.720
You're not going to want to do two hours a day in the sauna because presumably you're doing other things

01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:34.560
You have a life you have a life

01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:39.760
And in addition to that the growth hormone effect starts to diminish if you become too heat adapted

01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:42.480
And that raises a more interesting question, perhaps

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:48.480
Which is why is it that this two hour protocol really works if you do it once a week to increase growth hormone?

01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:51.920
It's because it's a stressor and certain stressors increase growth hormone

01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:54.480
Does it have to be heat? No

01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:58.080
You could probably also do four really long rounds of ice bath

01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:00.640
And i'm guessing you'd probably see a similar effect

01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:05.760
No one's ever really looked probably see a similar effect because it's all about the stress stimulus

01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:11.680
Now those that work on exercise science and weight training would probably say yeah, you could also do a

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:15.120
This has been shown, you know at 90 minutes 10 sets of 10

01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:21.520
Multiple exercises for 10 sets of 10 high volume german volume training workout and get the same growth hormone effects

01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:23.840
There's so many studies like this

01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:27.440
I personally like to do the sauna two or three days a week

01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:33.120
And if i'm traveling off and don't get the opportunity if i'm in austin, it's great because they're all these sauna places

01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:37.920
But if i'm traveling abroad, i don't have the time then i might do i might take a day

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.200
I'm thinking wow i did three podcasts i'm exhausted when i'm in new york

01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:44.960
I like to go to a place i have no relation to them, but i think it's called spa 88

01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:48.320
It's a russian banya and i'll just go for the whole day

01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:51.600
If i've been working really really hard they serve food there

01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:56.800
They serve borscht and all this other kind of like pickled vegetables and um, they must think that you're russian

01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:59.520
You they must you must walk through the doors and they go. Hello, brother

01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:04.240
Sometimes i usually just don't the best way to appear russian lacks. I hope you're listening is to just not say anything

01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:08.160
Just just to not that's the most russian thing that you can say is nothing exactly

01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:12.320
That place is great and they have different saunas steam sauna

01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:17.200
They have cold dunk and sometimes i'll just spend three four hours there. There's one in san francisco called archimedes banya

01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:22.080
So sometimes that's an occasional thing now most people are trying to incorporate this into their daily life

01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:26.560
And just like as we said for ice bath if you don't have access to ice or ice bath or cold tub

01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:28.480
You do cold shower

01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:34.320
Or longer cool baths with heat. I realize not everyone has access to a sauna hot baths do work

01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:40.160
Now one thing about hot baths and hot sauna is they will nuke your sperm that is not nuke a nuke is a you know

01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:43.600
Slang they will reduce viable sperm counts

01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:46.960
So for males that are trying to reproduce, you know trying to create children

01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:50.640
You want to be careful about hot baths and hot sauna too often

01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:54.160
Some people will bring a cold pack in and put in their groin. You can't do that in a bath

01:59:54.960 --> 02:00:00.880
But it's i mean sperm are maintained outside the body the testicles are maintained outside the body for a reason

02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:04.800
Right the scrotum has varying elasticity in order to maintain temperature of the sperm

02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:09.600
That's why that that's the the various effects that have been described are there on purpose

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.840
um, so

02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:15.120
Why human evolution design this way? I don't know someone will say but

02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:17.840
in any case

02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:22.240
Unless you're trying to you know, and again the ice pack approach is interesting

02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:27.520
Um, some people do that actually there's a kind of interesting relationship between cold and testosterone

02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:35.920
And spermatogenesis. There's a little cottage industry out there. I think on amazon people will buy these gel pack underwear of

02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:38.560
I think they're called snowballs

02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:43.360
This is cooling the scrotum in order to try and increase spermatogenesis

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:51.120
Now i'm not aware of any data on this but people report anarcho data and have shown their blood work and stuff

02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.680
that it

02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:59.200
It actually works to increase testosterone levels. I am not aware of any period studies. I am not

02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:02.560
I'm not I would not be sitting as comfortably as I am right now

02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:07.440
But but I find this sort of amusing on the one hand and then on the other hand

02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:11.920
I think what we're arriving at is some general principles of physiology, which are that light

02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:14.640
exercise

02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:15.680
temperature

02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:21.440
Both heat and cold are all very powerful stimuli for creating hormonal and

02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:29.200
Neuromodulator dopamine epinephrine effects and when you start to dig beneath the surface of all these protocols wim Hof breathing ice baths

02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:30.800
sauna

02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:37.280
Snowballs what you are finding is that these are all different stimuli to tap into these different neuromodulator systems, right?

02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:42.400
You know sunlight on our skin and on and into our eyes organizes all these hormone cycles

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:47.280
There's a beautiful study out of israel just this last year pure reviewed studies showing that if men

02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:54.080
And women are told to go outside and get a lot of sunlight exposure on their skin for 20 minutes a day three times a week

02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:59.520
Testosterone and estrogen levels go up substantially feelings of desire and sexual passion go up

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.960
You know, there's a real effect of the summer months

02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:07.200
For people and it's hormonal and that's because the skin is an endocrine organ

02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:08.560
um

02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:13.360
These effects shouldn't surprise us and some people hear these and they go

02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:19.120
Oh, so basically you're just telling us to like get sunlight and exercise and eat well and you know and avoid bright lights at night

02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:22.000
So that you can see but yeah, that's basically what we're saying

02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:25.840
We're saying that because there's now substantial physiology to support that

02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:32.000
There's nothing new in terms of the mechanisms the mechanisms haven't evolved in we believe hundreds of thousands of years

02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:33.440
If not more

02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:38.560
The ways to tap into these systems are many high intensity interval training. You're going to get increase in adrenaline

02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:45.200
Yoga nidra meditation a nap. You're going to get increases in serotonin. So it's not trivial though

02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:47.840
I want to be really clear these sorts of things

02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:53.120
Are not trivial. They are exceedingly powerful because they tap into systems that we all harbor

02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:56.560
So the beautiful thing is they work the first time and they work every time

02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:01.120
And there are very few things you can say that about they work the first time and they work every time

02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:05.360
And the reasons they work are now becoming clear to us through these more high quality studies

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:09.520
There's a lot of conversations at the moment around concerns for the

02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:12.400
Average amount of testosterone that men have got

02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:16.000
Eastergens in the water and stuff like that

02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:18.720
Should we be worried? How worried should be?

02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:22.320
So, um, I just recently came back from Copenhagen

02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:26.720
I was there to give a talk for the lundbeck foundation and there was another talk that the lundbeck foundation put on

02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:28.960
They do a great popular science series

02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:30.000
um

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:33.760
Called coffee and cocktails. I'm not a drinker, but people it's so european

02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:36.560
It's it's so different than over here. Was everybody smoking outside

02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:41.440
No one was smoking but people would bring were allowed to bring in real glasses with ice in them

02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:45.280
And yet the auditorium was silent. This was a big con is in the conser hall in Copenhagen

02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:48.160
It's a very beautiful venue and you couldn't hear an ice cube

02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:52.320
Chink the entire night and no clink clink clink no no chinking of the ice cubes

02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:56.720
People were in there with their cocktails and enjoying enjoying science and earlier that week

02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:00.560
There was a talk by dr. Sheena swan. She wrote a book called countdown

02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:04.560
She went on Joe Rogan's podcast. I believe earlier last year

02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:10.960
She talked about the decline of sperm counts from the 1930s until now and

02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:16.320
Ties it in a very she's a serious researcher with national institutes of health grants, etc

02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:24.320
Ties this to um the increasing presence of phthalates the most difficult word to pronounce in the english language besides ophthalmology

02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:27.040
phthalates

02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:32.720
That are present main present mainly in pesticides if you look at sperm counts and testosterone levels in

02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:35.760
males in different areas of the united states they are

02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:40.560
Significantly lower in areas where there's a lot of pesticide use in rural

02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:43.440
Areas where there's a lot of farming and pesticides

02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:47.600
very serious issue and in the offspring of mothers that

02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:49.360
ingest

02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:50.880
phthalates

02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:57.440
There's this the anal genital distance is what they study in the lab the lot the anal genital distance literally the distance between

02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:03.200
The base of the scrotum and the um and the anus in males is much greater than it is in

02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:07.200
There's a word for that females don't have a scrotum obviously

02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:12.480
So they measure from the base of the genitals to the base of the vagina to the to the anus in males

02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:15.760
They go from the base of the scrotum depends on the study. Sometimes it's the top of the scrotum

02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:21.280
You know, I always say, you know, uh, you always have to be careful when people are measuring anything related to genitalia

02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:23.280
Because somebody's going to cheat in the measurement

02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:25.440
so

02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:28.000
So in any event, I don't know how they controlled for that

02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:34.080
But she shows these remarkable pictures in mice and in humans of people that are exposed or mice that are exposed to phthalates

02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:37.520
And basically males are showing the more female like pattern

02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:39.120
of

02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:44.800
Of anal genital distance when they're exposed to these phthalates in utero. Okay, this is not post birth

02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:48.640
This is in utero. The mother's being exposed. It crosses the blood placental barrier

02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:53.680
What's happening? Well, this is reducing sperm counts now. What can people do about this?

02:05:53.680 --> 02:06:00.240
Well, first of all, there's this question of whether or not phthalates are having a similar effect after a child is brought into the world

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:08.880
One doesn't know but we do know and this is goes back to my early graduate work was on the effects of androgens like testosterone and dhT

02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:10.800
on

02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:12.960
different traits of brain and body

02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:14.480
we know that

02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:22.960
For instance, it just very briefly that during pregnancy the brain is organized male by way of believe it or not testosterone converted to estrogen

02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:29.760
Through a process called aromatization, but the growth of the penis the fact that there even will be a penis etc

02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:37.520
Is set by a testosterone called dhT dihydrotestosterone testosterone converted to dhT through five alpha reductase and on and on

02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:42.720
That's an organizing effect on the system as they call it

02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:48.160
But then there's an activating effect where during puberty the testes just start producing testosterone

02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:53.200
Some is converted to dhT and the dhT is what creates the growth of the penis

02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:55.440
Okay

02:06:55.440 --> 02:07:00.240
In people that inject phthalates during puberty and in the post puberty years

02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:05.440
It's conceivable that those phthalates could inhibit the activating effects of androgens

02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:10.880
Not just what we call the organizing effects of androgens early in life. Oh, yeah. Why is this interesting and important?

02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:14.640
Well sperm counts are definitely going down. Are they going down so much so that

02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:17.200
People are incapable of reproducing

02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:22.080
Probably not because you know as they told us in school it just takes one and indeed it just takes one sperm

02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:24.800
But it is a probability. It's a numbers game, right?

02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:28.160
The reason, you know, I people that take anabolic steroids unless they

02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:32.640
Do things to offset the effect on their own testosterone and sperm production

02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:35.440
sperm counts are down so the probability of

02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:41.280
Of successful insemination is of the egg is reduced also. It's a numbers game

02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:46.320
So it just takes one but having many improves the probability that the one will be able to fertilize

02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:49.840
So the short answer is yes. I think it is

02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:55.920
Very concerning now, which things should we be concerned about my understanding of the literature in here?

02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:57.200
I'm not an

02:07:57.200 --> 02:08:03.040
I'm now venturing to territory for which I am certainly not an expert is that things like plastics that have bpa's

02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:08.560
May be a concern drinking water may be a concern, but the most serious

02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:10.240
or

02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:13.440
Enriched source of bpa's aren't things like printed receipts

02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:16.880
I was out for dinner the other night

02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:19.040
It was probably about a month and a half ago

02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:24.400
And the server came over and I reached for the receipt and as I was going for it like this one of the girls

02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:26.400
So I'd never met before she's a creator online

02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:29.520
Hit my hand away. I was like, are you really going to touch that?

02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:35.520
And this is the first time I've ever heard about this. This is legit. Yeah printed receipts are are a

02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:41.280
A rich source of bpa's and topically that could come through the skin could go transdermally

02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:44.160
I mean now you'd probably have to handle a lot of receipts

02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:47.600
I mean, I don't think you're a check out cashier. Perhaps this would be the sort of thing

02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:54.640
Definitely check out cashiers and listen it's going to vary. Some people are operating with a testosterone level and sperm count

02:08:54.720 --> 02:09:00.320
That's already back on its heels so to speak some people have abundant testosterone and sperm

02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:03.360
So it's really going to depend on the individual

02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:07.440
I don't think people should get paranoid or delusional about any of this

02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:11.040
But just don't start sleeping in a bed of receipts don't start sleeping in a bed of receipts

02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:14.160
That's an interesting there are all sorts of jokes that could be made about that one

02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:17.120
That I won't make but

02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:23.840
There are also some other things like you know do a little bit of online research about phthalates and don't go to fringe sites

02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:29.840
Go to dr. Shana swans website, right? I believe she's out bound Sinai or one of the other larger medical schools in new york

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:34.880
Go to her website. She's a legitimate researcher and see what's there. See what the sources of phthalates are pesticides

02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:37.200
Does that mean you should only eat organic fruits and vegetables?

02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:41.920
Maybe I don't know which pesticides people are using on which fruits and vegetables, right?

02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:43.920
So there's some research that needs to be done

02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:45.520
but

02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:49.680
The moment we start talking this way and people start saying oh, wow, this is really like hippie science

02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:54.720
This isn't hippie science. This is serious NIH funded researcher saying phthalates

02:09:55.200 --> 02:10:01.680
Before birth can dramatically alter the trajectory of of the male's ability to make sperm and testosterone

02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:07.120
Phthalates in puberty may be able to do that, but we know that that

02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:15.600
Androgens in particular DHT and testosterone converted to estrogen have a powerful role in masculinizing the brain and body during those years

02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:20.640
Why wouldn't people be you know do a half an hour of research online?

02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:25.200
Or for instance the abundant data that melatonin suppresses pregnant

02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:30.080
Excuse me suppresses puberty and yet people take melatonin like it was you know

02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:36.000
Insane super physiological levels. Yeah, am I saying melatonin is going to suppress your puberty if you took it as a kid

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.280
You're messed up. No

02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:41.440
And yet it's very easy to replace it with some of the healthier alternatives that are out there

02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:47.200
So I think that one can have a thoughtfulness about this stuff and it's some and it's action oriented

02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:49.680
Without having to really freak out about it

02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:57.280
How do you think that creators like Derek from more plates more dates or greg do set us someone who's changed the way that the internet understands

02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:03.600
Hormonal profiles and supplementation because since watching a lot of Derek stuff since he's become big on youtube

02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:07.440
I have been much more considering the balance that's inside of my body

02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:11.040
But I don't I don't think that that was super common before guys like him were around

02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:16.880
Yeah, I look Derek's not a scientist by training, but he's done an immense service to the world

02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:21.200
Because no one was talking about this stuff. It was talked about in bodybuilding circles

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
where they talked very openly

02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:26.000
it was

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.440
Starting to emerge in

02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:32.000
testosterone replacement therapy clinics and then mostly guys were doing this stuff and lying about it

02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:37.760
They're doing it, but then they don't want to talk about actually kudos to joe rogan who years ago came out and said

02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:41.760
Yeah, he decided to start doing trt and low dose of a testosterone

02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:46.320
He's already successfully reproduced in this. Oh, you know, he brought it up and and you know

02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:49.600
It's clear that this is becoming more common

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:51.920
Here's some of the general principles that I think

02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:56.800
Forgive me Derek if I get this wrong in terms of what you believe because I never want to speak for anybody else

02:11:56.800 --> 02:11:58.960
but my read of the science and the actual protocols

02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:01.920
speak to the idea that

02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:04.720
Many people do not need testosterone replacement

02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:08.160
Young guys should really avoid doing anabolic steroids

02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:13.040
They can really mess up their system not just physically not just for the ability to have kids later

02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:20.880
But um lead to all sorts of sexual issues and sexual performance issues like there needs to be some medical incentive

02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:23.280
right hypogonadism for instance

02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:25.360
but

02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:31.520
At the point where someone either has bank sperm or decides they don't want any more kids or is willing to do something like take hcg to maintain

02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:35.760
testicular and uh function in spermatogenesis. It's very clear that

02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:39.680
Going with the lowest in a doctor described, right?

02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:43.760
I'm not talking about illicit use that the lowest possible dosage of testosterone

02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:50.640
Therapy is going to be better than for instance taking 200 milligrams in a 1 mil injection

02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:51.920
every two weeks

02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:56.720
Right because you get these huge increases and then these troughs. So people are something that you've learned from Derek

02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:00.480
Yes, and in talking with other people and I I'm no longer doing this

02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:05.920
But I I did a run of it from 45 to 46 years old and nothing before that

02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:11.200
Um, and I did it because I'm working on a on a book really that has a whole section on hormone therapies

02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:15.280
I wanted to see what it was like. I'll tell you basically testosterone gives you more energy to work more

02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:19.520
Um, if it's done appropriately, right? Maybe that's the the secret for legs

02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:24.400
Maybe maybe home always just brimming maze brimming and I'll say when I went into it

02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:28.400
My my levels were mid-range. They were fine. Hi to mid-range. They were kind of like sevens eights

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:31.840
But I was doing some supplementation to support that I've since gone back to that

02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:35.680
It was funny when you say something on the internet people think that means it's forever, right?

02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:42.000
It is possible to start and come off, right? So so what I've done and and so here's what's what's relevant here people are now

02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:47.680
Spacing out, you know 30 milligrams on monday 30 milligrams on wednesday 30 milligrams on fridays

02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:51.360
They kind of a low reasonable dose again. Talk to your doctor. These aren't recommended dosages

02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:56.960
That's more typical. Another thing that's really important is that people have traditionally blocked estrogen by

02:13:57.520 --> 02:13:58.640
increases

02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:03.360
While doing this by taking an aromatase inhibitor nulvidex aromidex these kinds of things

02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:06.080
That

02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:09.040
almost often is a bad idea almost often because

02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:11.920
Having enough estrogen around allows you to maintain

02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:14.560
cognitive function

02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:20.240
And libido a lot of guys think it's just you know, and it is true if estrogen is very high and testosterone is very low

02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:23.920
It could libido can suffer but if testosterone is very high and estrogen is very low

02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:26.400
libido can really suffer

02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:32.880
So a lot of people who are crushing their estrogen realize that by coming off some of those drugs they feel far better

02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:40.800
Far better far better. So most people I know that are doing this are taking low doses of testosterone semi frequently throughout the week

02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:43.920
20 to 30 milligrams every other day or so

02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:46.160
There's a lot of variation around this and then

02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:48.720
Not doing anything to reduce

02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:54.640
Aromatase or if they are taking very low doses not one milligram of aromidex

02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:59.760
But maybe something like 0.1 milligrams of aromidex every third day or so again, not a recommendation

02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:04.000
Talk to your doctor the the smarter clinics are starting to think about this and actually

02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:09.680
I don't have any financial relationship to Derek or to Merrick health, which is his clinic

02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:13.520
But from what I understand they do a very good job. I did help them design

02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:14.800
a

02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:16.240
herbal

02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:22.000
Mostly herbal supplement for testosterone support for people who are not on TRT as things like tonga ali fidoge

02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:25.440
But unbeknownst to most people I I've not made one penny

02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:31.040
On that that was just based on a conversation of the research with him and dr. Kyle Gillette and a few other people. So

02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:39.920
Estrogen can help maintain libido also can increase libido now. Here's something I learned that's really interesting from peter atia recently

02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:44.720
Women as we know make both testosterone and estrogen and of course a bunch of other

02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:46.880
hormones too

02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:50.160
if they get their blood work back and you were to adjust the

02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:55.200
Units that those hormones are measured in nanograms per deciliter in some cases

02:15:55.520 --> 02:15:59.360
Pika grams per deciliter in other cases if you normalize them all to the same

02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:07.120
Nanograms per deciliter you would find that a healthy woman has more testosterone than she does estrogen

02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:09.520
That's right

02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:14.400
I asked him this three times. I'm like, you're telling me that women have more testosterone

02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:22.160
Circulating in them than estrogen. He said absolutely now this maybe there's a there's a caveat to that during some phase of the menstrual cycle, but

02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:27.280
That does not mean that their toaster testosterone levels are higher than that of men

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:34.880
But this is remarkable, right? This means that these androgens testosterone and are doing interesting things in men

02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:40.000
End in women and estrogen as we just described are doing really interesting things certainly in women

02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:46.560
End in men. So this idea of more testosterone less estrogen good is always the case. That's simply false

02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:49.680
You have to think about whether or not it's a man whether or not it's a woman whether or not

02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:52.400
The goal is more less

02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:55.520
Typically people aren't going for less libido, but I suppose it's possible

02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:59.440
Some people out there with them. Some people might be highly distracted by an excessive libido

02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:03.040
That's a different story, but and then of course DHT

02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:06.000
So I think one of the things that Derek has really contributed to the world

02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:09.200
And I think is important for people know that a lot of the drugs

02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:11.760
That are used to treat hair loss

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.880
Finasteride propitia things like that block DHT receptors to hydrotestosterone

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:23.200
DHT is responsible for beard growth in the face and for balding male pattern baldness people because they want their hair

02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:27.040
We'll take these drugs if they take it them in pill form

02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:32.880
They're blocking DHT everywhere and they can experience severe defects in libido and sexual performance

02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:38.160
Now before that choice between your hair and your erection for a lot of people it is right

02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:42.640
I mean for now there are now topical things and Derek talks about all this kind of thing

02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:48.240
They're top really really deep. He goes really deep into all this and what's interesting is, you know, we also can take a step back

02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:51.840
And say like what's the landscape of health information that created this

02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:56.240
Opportunity for a kid in his 20s. By the way, no one knows his last name

02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:58.800
Very clever. No one knows his last name

02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:02.960
Um, I'll play Derek. It's kind of an avatar of a human, right? Although he's real

02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:09.440
What created this landscape for this guy to be able to get this information out there even though he's not a physician

02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:10.320
He's not a scientist

02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:16.160
And I think what it is is that he saw that there was all this information nested in these very niche communities

02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:18.880
That most people don't want to look like a bodybuilder, right?

02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:23.120
And yet what he did was he sort of normalized the discussion about hormones

02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:27.040
He normalized the discussion about other things like dopamine and cortisol

02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:30.560
Etc. And what's interesting is that science now

02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:37.680
Is kind of following suit, you know 10 years ago a discussion about hormone therapies would never come up in the hallways of

02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:39.920
discussions with my colleagues

02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:43.920
Since doing an episode of the podcast on optimizing testosterone and estrogen

02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:48.400
No fewer than 10 of I'm not going to name names, but these are serious scientists

02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:53.360
And it's a mixture of men and women have approached me about like, hey, like what can one do in order to adjust

02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:55.600
testosterone or estrogen levels is

02:18:56.080 --> 02:19:00.400
Um estrogen therapy for menopause a useful thing when should one start now?

02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:03.360
I'm not an endocrinologist so all I can do is point them in the way of information

02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:06.000
But this is an important area and here's why

02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:13.280
Hormones control neuromodulators like dopamine estrogen and so on and those neuromodulators powerfully influence our states of mind

02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:16.560
So if your hormones are out of whack your neuromodulators are going to be out of whack

02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:18.880
Typically the treatment for depression would be to go in and just

02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:24.000
Give a serotonin reuptake inhibitor or well butron type dopamine thing and that has its use

02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:26.160
But I love this

02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:30.960
trend now not towards hormone therapy necessarily but just toward a thinking a mindset of

02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:37.680
How deep in the layers of my biology can I go to create these sort of waves of health that rise up to the level of

02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:40.160
ability to focus

02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:44.480
And etc for so many years it's all been attacked at the surface kind of the waves

02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:49.440
On the surface of the ocean and yet there's this like we're now talking about the deep tectonic plates

02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:52.720
Movements that are affecting all that in any case

02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:57.360
Around about 30 years ago. You took a real hard turn in life

02:19:57.440 --> 02:20:02.880
It seemed like you drastically altered the trajectory that you were moving on for quite a while and I'm very interested

02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:04.800
in how

02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:10.400
Anybody manages to make severe life changes like that. I think that many people can

02:20:11.040 --> 02:20:15.280
They believe that they have control over maybe their daily habits and little things here and there

02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:21.200
But they don't have huge global control over their life direction. Certainly not in the way

02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:23.920
that they want

02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:26.160
Reflecting on that now

02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:32.480
Does it almost surprise you the sort of the ability that you have to be able to change that direction? It seems so unbelievably rare

02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:36.080
Uh, right. So it um, I don't know

02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:39.520
Um, I like to think everybody harbors it inside themselves

02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:44.640
I I can say without going into the whole backstory because I've done it before I mean at at 19

02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:49.680
I basically just looked at myself and decided that I was a loser, right?

02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:55.280
I mean, I was able bodied which was helpful. I had a mind that could remember things which was helpful

02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:58.080
I was interested in a few things

02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:01.680
But none of those things were setting me up for career or ongoing progress

02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:07.040
And I had a lot of maladaptive behaviors, right at the time I was getting involved in fighting

02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:12.160
I just I just didn't I wasn't completing my schoolwork. I was just really in a bad place

02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:15.760
And it was really fear and desperation

02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:18.240
mostly fear

02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:20.240
That inspired the the switch

02:21:22.480 --> 02:21:25.040
Along the way and I haven't talked about this publicly

02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:29.200
You know to any great extent but along the way I hit numerous roadblocks again and again

02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:34.400
Sometimes they were situational like people close to me dying and the grief that came with that sometimes it was my own

02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:40.080
Kind of um feeling like I was getting pulled back toward a state of mind that wasn't healthy for me

02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:43.200
Uh and so on but I think what I've

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:45.440
been good at

02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:48.080
at least good at not great at but at least good at is

02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:50.560
finding

02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:54.000
Really good mentors that would allow me to get to the next

02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:56.640
node of the next milestone

02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:00.080
And I should say that some of those mentors were real people

02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:03.120
That I I didn't say can you be my mentor?

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
not that that would be a bad thing but

02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:09.040
Really tried to model my behavior after people that I respected

02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:15.520
And sometimes those mentors were people that I didn't know at all. I mean, I'll just say this right now

02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:20.960
I I mean, I'm an embarrassment by saying that but you know, I was a junior professor meaning before I got tenure

02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:23.040
running a lab

02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:25.040
I had a bulldog puppy

02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:29.600
A laboratory and a home for the first time in my life and feeling very very

02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:32.240
Overwhelmed and distraught and I made

02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:34.960
Many of the things that I heard

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Tim Ferriss say

02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:42.160
Sort of central to my way of doing things. I didn't go four hours of work a week

02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:45.920
But I did start to get extreme about organizing my schedule

02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:49.840
So he was a big influence on you Tim huge huge and and I know Tim a little bit

02:22:49.840 --> 02:22:53.040
We have some common friends and I feel very fortunate that now we're in touch because

02:22:53.440 --> 02:22:56.640
Gone on his podcast and gotten to know one another but just huge

02:22:56.720 --> 02:23:02.880
I mean like there were no organizational forces in my life for me at that time that could help me navigate through this landscape of

02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:06.400
You know, I'd never been a professor before I had

02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:10.800
Taught it now those many years ago now, but um, I knew how to do science

02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:16.080
I felt confident in my ability to take an empty room and a budget and create by the right equipment and do the experiments higher

02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:18.080
The people I had no problem with that

02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:19.840
but how to

02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:22.880
regulate my time and my energy and how to

02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:26.160
Communicate with people

02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:30.240
I mean he had these like little things that I don't like the word hacks. I hate it because hacks are

02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:34.560
Implies that you're using something for a purpose that it wasn't intended for that's a hack

02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:37.200
But he had things like instead of asking people

02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:43.280
You know like what's up when they come in your office asking them, you know, what specifically, you know, what can I do for you?

02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:44.480
Like what do you need?

02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:50.240
Right really cutting to the chase because time became a valuable resource little things like that tiny things on the fit on the surface

02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:53.760
That translate into huge conversion in terms of time and energy

02:23:54.160 --> 02:23:55.200
um

02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:58.880
And even just setting aside some savings and things I it's not that I'm not

02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:00.480
Dumb about money

02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:04.320
But I wasn't I've never really taken the time to think about how I was going to invest money or do anything

02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:09.520
So tim did a tremendous service for for me without realizing it and I've thanked him now a million times

02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:12.400
I'm gonna thank him a million times. I'm thanking thank you tim. I'm thanking you again

02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:15.760
Things like that. So it's selecting mentors then eventually

02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:20.560
When it came time to start podcasting. I mean lex whether or not he knows or not, you know, just thinking

02:24:20.640 --> 02:24:23.520
Oh, here's another guy who's a he's a scientist. He's mit

02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:29.120
The fact he always wore that suit and I'm gonna copy him and just always wear the same thing because I don't have to take

02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:32.160
Guesswork I can take the guesswork out of it. There were little things that

02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:36.560
were super deliberate that just saved me time and energy and I think that

02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:41.680
That's helped me along the way and then the other thing is I have really tried to adopt this idea that

02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:45.040
When it's inevitable

02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:48.560
And it will inevitably arrive that stress grows us

02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:53.360
That it really sharpens decision making it really sharpens decision making and you know

02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:55.680
If you have a very stressful event and then you recover from it

02:24:55.760 --> 02:25:01.120
The worst thing to do is just go and keep going you need to take some time and reflect about what led into that

02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:08.640
So I think I'm very good at leveraging fear into positive change if I really think about most of the major shifts in my life it was

02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:15.520
I'm scared as hell to remain in this situation and I'm very good at broadcasting fear into my future

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.520
Uh, you know, if I've ever been in a bad relationship, it was

02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:22.400
Clearly if I stayed in it couldn't have been so bad

02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:24.960
That I felt like I had to leave so I would

02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:28.800
Broadcast and project, you know, how horrible it would be for my future children

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:35.120
And I might even build that up a little bit my system now one could say well, maybe you could have navigated it successfully

02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:41.520
I'm better at projecting fear into my future and that has led me to make I think better and better decisions over time

02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:44.800
That's it. How much of the old andrew

02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:46.640
still

02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:50.800
Rises to the surface today. I know that the music that you tend to listen to when you're training is

02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:55.920
Still pretty punky and when I work. Yeah, I mean I have two very polarized versions of music

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:59.440
I do love, you know, I love bob dillon. I love joe strummer acoustic

02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:01.760
I like I you know, I like melodic music too

02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:07.440
But yeah, I'm listening to rants. It's diff little fingers. I mean, I'm I mean, I was the first ever gig I went to

02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:13.760
Siff little fingers. I'm just I've never actually seen them play live. I'm a huge stiff little fingers fan. Huge stiff little fingers fan

02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:15.280
um

02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:19.200
Huge against me fan huge rancid fan. I mean, you know for people that

02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:23.920
Um of my generation, they probably remember it people were younger probably think oh, that's all 90s stuff

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:25.520
But a lot to me

02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:29.040
I mean, I have huge collections of like 80s and 90s music 70s music

02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:34.400
Second wave punk third wave punk. I collect a ton of that stuff. I love it. I mean how much of me still exists

02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:36.480
I believe that

02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:41.840
We are all born fundamentally with some gift and it's our job to reveal that gift to ourselves

02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:48.160
And you know, here I'm I want to thoroughly acknowledge someone else who's been a great mentor without ever meeting him as a robert green

02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:51.760
I think is a is a one fantastic guy fantastic. I've never met you robert

02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:55.280
But I'd love to meet I mean, it's one of these things where I used to put you in touch

02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:56.640
He's been on the show twice amazing

02:26:56.640 --> 02:27:00.960
I used to suggest the book mastery to to graduate students and to undergraduates like, you know

02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:03.280
Learn the this process of finding a mentor

02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:04.880
um

02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:10.400
And in science we have natural mentors graduate advisors and postdoc advisors and I I made sure I will say this

02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:15.920
I should have said this earlier when a mentor has sort of arrived in my life either virtually or in reality

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:19.600
I make the most of that relationship. I really nurture those relationships

02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:23.200
I mean, I still go to visit the children of my dead graduates

02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:24.960
advisor

02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:28.560
Kids, you know, because I care so I mean these are like these people are like family to me

02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:32.080
How much of it still exists? Well, the energy has always been the same

02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:35.280
The energy is I have an absolute obsession from day one

02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:40.640
This maybe was what I was kind of born with to I like to learn things and share them with the world

02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:47.760
I was six years old giving lectures on monday after reading about medieval weapons or, you know, goldfish biology

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:51.520
In class and when my parents thought I was crazy and they took me a psychiatrist

02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:56.240
And I'm like, no, he just really likes learning and really likes telling people about that about what he learns

02:27:57.280 --> 02:27:58.560
so

02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:01.680
And I had a little bit of an underlying Tourette's when I was younger I had a grunting tick

02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:07.040
I had a look and when I'm tired it sometimes emerges a little bit and for me learning and kind of seeking

02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:09.520
kind of calms that somehow

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
as does training

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:16.240
As is skateboarding I did boxing of course head damage isn't good. So I stopped boxing but

02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:22.400
That's always been in me. That's how I'm that's how my nervous system kind of tilts left in that way

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:25.840
The energy

02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:28.960
I would say I'm able to turn the dial

02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:33.440
I'm able to tap into kind of some old hurts and angers as fuel

02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:39.200
But I really try and orient towards things in a very Lex Friedman ish way from a place of like show them love

02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:43.360
Show them show them do things from a place of love because it's a more continual resource

02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:48.320
Really believe it's this dopamine epinephrine cycle positive feedback cycle. I really do

02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:51.120
And so that's all there

02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:57.840
You know, I have pretty much eaten the same way I have since college. I really I haven't really changed the way

02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:00.720
I eat that much. I mean, I probably ate more junk every once in a while

02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:05.040
I scream and pizza and stuff and now I have less of an appetite for but I still am the same

02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:07.040
I still train every other day. I um

02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:11.920
I love music. I love movies. I love nature. I love the flora and fauna of life

02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:16.080
I mean, I have this kind of obsession with fish tanks freshwater fish tanks. I love

02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:25.040
And listen, I my ex-girlfriend is a she's a florist. I I developed a love of flowers, you know in those years

02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:27.760
I love, you know, I

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:31.120
I'm probably the one guy who was like wandering around in college

02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:36.480
I would go to these like orchid festivals and some of them look like aliens and I just I just love learning

02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:40.240
and I love digesting novel information and

02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:41.360
um

02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:42.640
And now

02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:46.800
You know, I have to say I'm in a place where the people that I'm closest to I mean

02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:50.400
Thankfully really kind of support that and I can indulge it through podcasting

02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:55.440
It's so lovely now that the environment of curiosity. I think that podcasts and and youtube and

02:29:56.080 --> 02:29:57.680
creators have

02:29:57.680 --> 02:30:00.800
Engended it's so cool. You know the the fact that you get to

02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:05.120
Find out about something that you really care that you would have done right you would have done it

02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:09.040
For free without anybody else knowing about it right and then somehow

02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:16.960
Telling other people the thing that you found out in this version of the simulation is called a job or a pursuit or something

02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:19.440
It's it's wild another thing

02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:23.360
That has carried over from your youth or your tattoos

02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:26.080
Which I've heard you talk about

02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:28.080
But never seen

02:30:28.320 --> 02:30:31.520
What's your relationship with your tattoos and why is no one ever seen them? Yeah

02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:35.200
Um, yeah, actually it was tim ferris that outed me on this one

02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:38.000
He was like I found a picture on the internet with you in full sleeves

02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:39.360
um

02:30:39.360 --> 02:30:44.640
Yeah, you know, I believe that you know tattoos are I mean this has come as no surprise or a

02:30:45.440 --> 02:30:50.800
literal expression of what we feel on the inside and you know, I and I'm not recommending this kids don't do this

02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:56.160
I started getting tattooed really young. How are you about 14? I got my first tattoo. No way. We did them ourselves

02:30:56.720 --> 02:30:58.720
With india your first one is yourself. Please don't no

02:30:59.280 --> 02:31:04.000
Please no one do this india ink and a needle and um, we used to do these is really bad

02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:10.160
They're called nicknack tattoos or we kind of would do this at home. Don't do it. It's really bad to get bad infections. They're ugly. They they

02:31:11.440 --> 02:31:13.440
Blur they bleed that's not good

02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:18.720
Um, yeah, I started getting tattooed. I when I was a kid and growing up skateboarding in the punk rock scene

02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:22.480
There were these guys that um in the town where I lived they called themselves the yatsi guys

02:31:22.480 --> 02:31:25.760
I don't know why I don't know what that was about, but they all had full sleeves

02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:29.360
And they were super nice guys and they were all into skateboarding and

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:34.560
You know and vehicles and I just looked up to these guys. I thought like someday. I want full sleeves

02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:36.240
I

02:31:36.240 --> 02:31:41.600
Yeah, I've got full sleeves. I'm basically like neck to neck to wrists. So chest piece as well. Yeah, but yeah

02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:45.920
Back's covered. Yeah, nothing on my legs. Nothing on my stomach ribs. Yeah

02:31:46.480 --> 02:31:50.880
tops of my tops of my shoulders and um, I got a big picture of costello my dog back there

02:31:50.880 --> 02:31:54.400
I've got a picture of his paw back there. I've got a picture of another dog used to have um

02:31:54.880 --> 02:31:58.080
There's still some space for a few things. There's some things very personal to me

02:31:58.480 --> 02:32:03.280
Um, is that the reason that you prefer not to show them? Yeah, you know, I think that there are a couple reasons

02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:05.440
I'll just be clear as to why first of all

02:32:06.160 --> 02:32:11.680
When I show up to podcast it's the same way I show up to lecture in the classroom auditorium

02:32:12.320 --> 02:32:13.760
and I

02:32:13.760 --> 02:32:19.040
Swear on my life. This is my mindset and this is my mantra when I do it. I'm there to teach. It's not about me

02:32:19.120 --> 02:32:21.840
It's about a student. It's about the people learning

02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:25.200
I don't want it ever to be about me. I don't want the focus to be on me

02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:27.200
I mean, obviously I'm the voice and the person talking

02:32:27.680 --> 02:32:32.800
But I really want people to internalize the information and I do think that the tattoos because they have nothing to do with

02:32:32.800 --> 02:32:35.840
The information are a distraction. They're just a distraction

02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:41.600
I don't know it would sort of like be wearing like a bright yellow shirt or something. It's not my style

02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:45.120
I prefer to kind of make myself disappear as much as I can

02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:47.600
Um and let the information come forward

02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:52.480
That's you know, even when I gave scientific lectures, which I still do of course for my my professor job

02:32:53.200 --> 02:32:56.960
I generally liked the room to be pretty dark and I wanted the light to be on the data on the slides

02:32:57.120 --> 02:33:00.080
I was happy to be the voice, but I want people thinking about the data

02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:05.360
So podcasting is a little different to come through as a voice or on youtube a voice in an image, but

02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:08.160
I really prefer that it not be about me now

02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:13.680
There's a human element too and I think things have changed a lot when I was growing up tattoos were not accepted

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:17.200
There are many work environments where if you have for instance

02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:18.880
Where

02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:24.640
People prefer that they're surgeon or their doctor not have tattoos some people might prefer their surgeon or doctor have tattoos

02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:26.720
When I was growing up if you had a

02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:28.000
I never had one

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:32.320
But if someone had a nose ring they had to cover it up with a band-aid or take it out if they worked at the coffee shop

02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:38.160
Remember that you probably don't you're probably young enough or the or eyebrow ring think trends have changed right things have changed

02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:41.920
And I'm kind of old school because I'm kind of old now 46

02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:49.280
And the etiquette for me has always been to you know, and this is lex does this too is I I personally

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:55.520
Behind that if I can just show up as formal and consistent as possible that people will at least know that I'm taking them seriously

02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:58.640
So I don't really do it for me. I pretty much do it for the audience

02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:06.240
And also none of the tattoos are like that interesting. It's my dog. I really like raptors. I've got a bunch of birds

02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:10.960
I've got I mean I have all sorts of different things like raptors like the dinosaur. No raptors like

02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:16.400
Red-tailed hawks and blue, you know, I like birds and I had either dinosaurs or trucks

02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:20.080
You know, you really need to love four raptors. No, no no four raptor

02:34:20.080 --> 02:34:23.680
I drive I drive a Toyota four-runner and I love it. I've got one truck and I love that thing

02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:25.600
Although gas for right now

02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:29.280
I mean it's you kind of got a wonder about having a gas-driven vehicle like a four-runner

02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:33.360
In any case, yeah, the tattoo thing I would say for for younger people coming up

02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:36.320
Just be aware that you can't control other people's perceptions either

02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:40.160
And so, you know, I always made it a point that I didn't want things on my knuckles

02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:42.960
I didn't want them on my hands. I didn't want them on my neck. I didn't want them on my face

02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:49.760
Do I judge people when they have them? No, but do I want them for me? No, I also think that this is very neuroscience-y

02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:53.200
As a neuroscientist that we have dedicated brain areas called fusiform

02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:57.680
Gyrus it's a face area that's dedicated to the processing of faces

02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:03.520
Even if I just put two dots and a line in between them on a piece of paper you see that as a face

02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:11.200
When one puts a tattoo on their throat or on their face, it actually changes the way that the face is perceived, right?

02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:16.720
I mean it almost looks like another mouth there, right? It's a very different look. It's it can be a little bit jarring

02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:22.320
I'm not saying one shouldn't have it, but it can be a little bit jarring. It's it changes the look of the person forever

02:35:22.640 --> 02:35:24.880
It's not just that it's above the neckline

02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:29.680
It's that it kind of competes with the processing of their face in its normal way

02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:34.000
And so for me whenever I see somebody with a throat tattoo or a face tattoo

02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:39.120
Sort of like it's hard to kind of orient around that and I think there's some biology to

02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:42.800
To that relates to that but like when it comes down to it

02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:46.640
I mean people need to be individuals and live their life the way they want to live their life

02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:50.720
I've also never been that much of an iconoclast. I've not

02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:57.120
You know, I grew up in the punk rock thing. Um, you know, I hate in-group out-group stuff

02:35:57.120 --> 02:36:01.200
I always had friends from a lot of different, you know friends are jocks and hippies and punk rockers and

02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:05.920
You know straight and gay and like I don't care as long as people are living their best life

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:11.680
And they're not harming anybody like I'm like great. Go for it. I I'm very laid back in that way

02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:14.160
Of course if people are harming other people

02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:18.000
Then I believe that like a little bit less liberty and independent freedom

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:22.320
I mean liberty is you know, one of the highest things though, you know for me so

02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:23.760
I

02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:29.920
But I don't tend to I don't consider myself a very judgmental person but you can't always control the perceptions of others

02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:34.800
So I would just think people should be thoughtful about what they want to accomplish in life in terms of a life mission

02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:38.240
And just ask whether or not some of the permanent cosmetic changes

02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:43.040
They might make might might align with compete with or be neutral for those life missions

02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:48.480
My life mission is very simple. I want to teach people the beauty and the utility of biology. I'm going to do that today

02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:53.600
I'm going to do that until I take my last breath in one form or another because that's what excites me

02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:57.280
And that's like what keeps the dopamine cranking dude. Let's bring this one home

02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:03.120
Look, I really really appreciate you the work that you've done the fact that I feel like I have a lot more agency over my life because

02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:08.480
I understand that my internal processes are something that I can influence

02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:13.520
You know the first time that I heard you say that you cannot control the mind with the mind a lot of different things clicked for me

02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:17.440
So I'm very glad that Lex bullied you or convinced you to start doing your show

02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:22.480
And uh, yeah, I'm looking forward to hearing a lot more of what you've got to do in the future

02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:25.600
Well, thanks so much and thanks for bringing me on today. Obviously

02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:28.240
We've been in touch and I

02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:33.520
Align with you and I feel resonance along the life as a podcaster, right?

02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:35.520
But also we've had a chance to interact a few times

02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:40.400
I'm looking forward to more because I think what you're doing bringing knowledge to the world is is so important

02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:43.200
And I so appreciate your your questions and learning from you

02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:46.240
I'm also going to get these resources about the expectation effect and the rest

02:37:46.240 --> 02:37:49.280
I've been taking notes here because I I'm obsessed with learning

02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:53.840
So why should people go people want to make sure that they they listen to more watch more follow more of your stuff

02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:57.360
Where should they go? Thanks for asking. Yeah, it's very straightforward. It's huberman lab

02:37:57.920 --> 02:38:01.360
Is the podcast and it's all the standard places youtube apple spotify, etc

02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:03.280
Huberman lab on twitter

02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:06.560
Huberman lab on instagram and the twitter and instagram mainly are short content

02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:12.240
I used to do a lot more hand drawings and I think you're doing instagram pretty much as well as any science communicator that i've seen

02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:16.400
I don't think there's anyone else that's optimized it better than that. Thanks right now. Thanks

02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:21.200
Yeah, I try and answer comments and respond to things and any of those three places and we have a website

02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:22.960
Which is huberman lab dot com

02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:26.480
There where all the podcast episodes are linked salt things in all formats

02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:31.440
We have a newsletter and you know people can peruse that if they want it's all I should say zero cost to access

02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:36.000
So that's been a major goal that we've stuck to which is to just we don't put anything behind a paywall

02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:41.280
The information that's there is the information that anyone can access dude. I appreciate you. Let's go and get hot and cold

02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:43.440
Let's do it. What's happening people?

02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:46.400
Thank you very much for tuning in if you enjoyed that episode
