00:00.000 --> 00:05.880
What's wrong with being a nice guy? What's wrong with being a nice guy? That's that's a good question

00:05.880 --> 00:08.940
You know when I put out a book called no more. Mr. Nice guy

00:08.940 --> 00:10.920
I'm sure a lot of people picked it up that wait a minute

00:10.920 --> 00:16.040
There's already enough not nice guys out there why somebody write a book teaching men how to be not nice

00:16.400 --> 00:17.320
but

00:17.320 --> 00:22.480
The problem with being a nice guy just a quick elevator pitch is that a nice guy is a guy who?

00:22.840 --> 00:27.960
Inaccurately internalized the belief system every young age. I'm not okay just as I am

00:28.200 --> 00:33.440
So he's trying to do two things very unconsciously usually one has become what he thinks

00:33.960 --> 00:39.080
Everybody else wants him to be so he'll be liked and loved and get his needs met and get laid hopefully

00:39.480 --> 00:44.720
regularly and hide anything about himself that might get a negative reaction from people

00:45.280 --> 00:50.840
Hiding his needs his wants and sexuality so while he's trying to get laid. He's hiding his sexuality

00:51.520 --> 00:55.800
so a core problem with nice guy syndrome is nice guys tend to be un

00:56.320 --> 00:58.320
Unauthentic

00:58.560 --> 01:04.040
There there there's not a real them there. They're trying to become something hide something and

01:04.640 --> 01:08.000
That tends to make them fairly dishonest untrustworthy

01:09.280 --> 01:11.280
Frustrated resentful passive aggressive

01:12.360 --> 01:17.840
A whole list of traits that can go along and and mainly it prevents and I'm a recovering nice guy

01:17.840 --> 01:20.240
So I'm not speaking down to anybody, you know

01:20.240 --> 01:23.560
It keeps us from just being ourselves living up for our full potential

01:24.360 --> 01:29.560
Having what we want in life having a good time and so just a lot of baggage comes along with it

01:29.880 --> 01:37.400
What are the component parts of being a nice guy? What are the traits that they embody or project?

01:38.440 --> 01:42.840
Worry what you'll recognize most often and what listeners may recognize in themselves

01:43.560 --> 01:45.560
Core tendencies often people pleasing

01:46.160 --> 01:52.800
Seeking external validation and and for men usually that seeking validation from women even even gay guys

01:52.800 --> 01:57.360
I find tend to do it even if they don't plan on having sex with the women they

01:58.320 --> 02:00.320
We can talk more about this, but we're

02:00.920 --> 02:08.080
We've learned from birth to please women. So there's that people pleasing that external validation

02:09.080 --> 02:10.280
I'm

02:10.280 --> 02:16.880
Failing to live up to one's full potential a basic court is honesty, you know thinking, you know, I'm a good guy

02:16.880 --> 02:22.680
I'm pretty honest. I always laugh when men tell me they're pretty honest. I say that's actually a contradiction of terms

02:23.560 --> 02:25.560
You're honest or you're not

02:26.800 --> 02:28.800
And

02:29.640 --> 02:34.760
And just you know for most nice guys, there's just a certain dull

02:35.400 --> 02:41.120
Depression that they live with just thinking, you know, I should be happy. I should be getting what I want

02:41.120 --> 02:47.240
I should be getting love. I should I should but I'm not and I don't know why not and

02:47.840 --> 02:55.120
So there's there's a lot of characteristics, but the core piece you'll see the most often is that people pleasing seeking of external validation

02:56.400 --> 02:58.400
Who is the

02:58.920 --> 03:03.160
Prototypical nice guy avatar like just describe him for me

03:05.200 --> 03:07.200
He's you know

03:07.840 --> 03:12.480
He's just just that guy that's you know walking through life trying to make everybody happy

03:12.600 --> 03:17.600
Try not to do anything wrong. Don't want to fuck anything up doesn't want to piss anybody off

03:18.120 --> 03:22.320
Goes along to get along, you know, we've heard that, you know, happy wife happy life

03:22.320 --> 03:24.320
If I just make everybody happy

03:24.480 --> 03:30.360
Everything's good. I have a course that I've taught for a number of years called nice guys don't finish last

03:30.360 --> 03:32.760
They rot in middle management. So he's good

03:34.040 --> 03:40.680
But you know, he doesn't excel he doesn't stand out because standing out is actually really scary for nice guys

03:41.120 --> 03:43.480
It's too much attention. It's too much expectation

03:45.600 --> 03:49.560
So, you know, when I started working with nice guys 30 years ago

03:50.720 --> 03:55.600
Most of the men I worked with, you know, probably were around my age. I was in my early 30s at that time and

03:56.320 --> 03:58.320
So there's a lot of baby

03:58.320 --> 04:05.600
Baby boom generation guys, you know, they they were trying to be different than their fathers the World War two, you know, man

04:06.240 --> 04:13.080
They were in that protest generation against Vietnam growing their hair out getting in touch with their feminine side

04:13.080 --> 04:17.000
And so a lot of the men I worked with, you know, kind of grew up in that era

04:17.160 --> 04:21.600
But I've been doing this for a while. And so, you know, my son's 38 for example

04:21.600 --> 04:27.120
So, you know, I worked with Millennials Millennials men younger than that and what's funny is

04:27.640 --> 04:30.480
Whereas my generation a lot of the men

04:31.400 --> 04:36.880
Kind of attribute part of their nice guy stuff to well, my dad wasn't there or you know, my parents divorced

04:36.880 --> 04:39.920
Oh, you know, he worked all the time or he's an alcoholic

04:40.760 --> 04:47.240
Nowadays I hear a lot of men say, oh, my dad was a nice guy and and about all he taught me about life was don't piss off your mother

04:47.240 --> 04:51.480
And and because he was walking around eggshells trying not to piss off my mother

04:51.760 --> 04:57.440
So, you know, I've seen that whole range all the way from the guys that were reacting to, you know, the

04:58.760 --> 05:00.760
asshole

05:02.280 --> 05:08.960
Patriarchal father to now the guys that were raised by nice guys and they don't know any other way of being

05:09.400 --> 05:15.120
It's like one generation had the tyrant and the other generation had the compliant

05:15.640 --> 05:19.480
That's a good way to put it. That's nice. Yeah, the tyrant the compliant

05:19.480 --> 05:22.560
Yeah, it was but here's the interesting thing, right?

05:22.560 --> 05:26.360
And it's so fascinating that you had one generation that was

05:27.040 --> 05:29.040
Rebelling in their niceness

05:29.040 --> 05:32.320
Even if that niceness isn't that nice. Yeah, and then another generation

05:32.960 --> 05:37.120
That was following in their niceness. So there seems to be a particular

05:38.160 --> 05:40.160
stickiness to niceness if

05:41.480 --> 05:47.680
Tyrants that are emotionally unavailable and not nice are able to create nice guys and

05:48.480 --> 05:50.320
nice

05:50.320 --> 05:52.320
Fathers are also big trouble

05:53.800 --> 06:01.680
What's why is it so prevalent? What is what is this pull? Are we as men are we inculcating or absorbing something from the world?

06:01.680 --> 06:04.560
Is this the way that we were raised by mom and dad is the

06:05.520 --> 06:09.000
What's the gen what's the origin? What's the genesis the seed of this?

06:10.200 --> 06:15.040
That's a good question, of course and this course what every nice guy wants. Well, how do I get to be this way?

06:15.040 --> 06:17.280
You know who cursed me with this. Yeah

06:17.680 --> 06:24.480
I I quickly learned when I started working with nice guys again 30 years ago that there is no one

06:24.800 --> 06:31.080
You know one size fit all how you how you got to be a nice guy. I thought there was it first. I thought they're all like me, you know

06:32.280 --> 06:38.440
Disconnected from their father in some significant way, you know significantly raised by their mother trying to please their mom and

06:39.640 --> 06:42.960
And I thought well that that explains it all but it didn't and

06:43.840 --> 06:49.560
There's so many pieces that go into a lot of men I work with that identifies being nice guys

06:49.560 --> 06:54.600
I think part of it's their temperament part of it's just they're easy going, you know

06:54.600 --> 07:03.080
My my mother would often say in adulthood to women. I was dating. Oh Bobby never did like conflict and I'm thinking

07:03.320 --> 07:06.560
Thanks mom, you know what are you telling these women be nice to my son?

07:06.560 --> 07:11.000
Don't be mean to him, but I'm also thinking who does like conflict, you know

07:11.000 --> 07:15.640
I do tend to marry women who like to fight but I for me

07:15.640 --> 07:21.200
It's kind of like, you know, I can't can't can't you know instead of us you doing something that starts a fight

07:21.200 --> 07:26.360
I say to them can't I just yell at you a little bit you cry and then I hold you in that really what you know

07:26.360 --> 07:31.240
This is all about anyway, and my wife always say no, it doesn't countless. You're really mad at me

07:32.360 --> 07:36.440
So I don't like conflict in particular. So that's my temperament

07:37.440 --> 07:42.240
Disposition that many of the nice guys will have the raw materials of someone that's a little bit

07:43.240 --> 07:44.520
Yeah, part of my nature

07:44.520 --> 07:49.800
But but that's just kind of one category of nice guy the other one that that I bumped into I call often those

07:49.800 --> 07:54.200
I'm so good nice guy. He's the guy that just always did everything right no matter what, you know

07:54.440 --> 07:59.240
But the other side I talk about you know one mr. Nice guy is what I called. I'm so bad nice guy

07:59.480 --> 08:02.880
This is the one that you know, maybe start rebelling at an early age

08:03.120 --> 08:07.440
Maybe at 80 HD undiagnosed, you know, he's always impulsive getting in trouble

08:07.840 --> 08:13.200
You know not following through getting yelled at getting punished starts doing drugs and alcohol at 14

08:13.360 --> 08:18.000
You know drops out of school and then maybe at some point as a come to jesus moment

08:18.320 --> 08:21.200
Religion military gets married as a kid

08:21.840 --> 08:27.520
Death in the family. He goes I got I got to quit, you know self-destructing. I got a I got to be nicer

08:28.000 --> 08:32.240
So there's that kind of nice guy as well. So it's a different temperament than the than the other

08:33.600 --> 08:38.880
One of the pieces, you know, there's so many pieces that go into this but to answer your question, how do we

08:39.440 --> 08:41.440
What's the stickiness part?

08:43.120 --> 08:49.920
Again, I think a real core piece that I see with so many nice guys is this attempt to please women and

08:51.200 --> 08:55.920
I I was talking to somebody the other day it makes perfect sense because if you think about it

08:56.320 --> 09:02.560
We're all born to a woman our earliest caregiver. It is not mom. It's probably some other woman

09:02.960 --> 09:08.160
So from the time we're born our very survival our sustenance our okayness

09:08.720 --> 09:14.400
Depends on a woman and probably us getting along with that woman. That's probably a good thing, right?

09:15.040 --> 09:21.920
And so that's really normal that the our first experiences are how to how to negotiate a relationship with a woman to make that

09:22.240 --> 09:25.200
Big powerful holds our our life in her hands

09:25.840 --> 09:27.840
Person how to make sure that's okay

09:28.560 --> 09:34.400
And I don't know about in the uk but when I was growing up in Seattle. I had one male teacher

09:35.120 --> 09:43.200
Before I got to junior high there's four times more female fighter pilots in the us air force by percentage

09:43.520 --> 09:45.520
Then there are male kindergarten teachers

09:46.320 --> 09:50.240
There you go. You've done your research so so I had one teacher

09:50.240 --> 09:55.760
So that means just to learn how to get from second to third grade not only had to learn my reading writing and arithmetic

09:56.080 --> 10:00.640
How to please a woman. Okay, all of that's fine. There's there's nothing inherently wrong with that

10:00.640 --> 10:03.520
I think that's actually probably the way it's always been

10:04.160 --> 10:07.600
But historically I mean if we go back even two or three generations

10:07.600 --> 10:09.600
But if you go through most of human history

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Out of about age 12

10:12.160 --> 10:14.960
The men came into the boys life took him

10:15.360 --> 10:21.280
You know from the women took him out had a masculine initiation taught him how to get comfortable being uncomfortable

10:21.360 --> 10:24.800
How to face his fear how to live in the scary world of the masculine

10:25.280 --> 10:30.880
And therefore and spent most of his time from them on out with men in the masculine

10:31.520 --> 10:36.240
And and so he got he moved through that what do I have to do to please a woman?

10:36.720 --> 10:40.400
So I think that's a really normal thing that to try to please women

10:41.360 --> 10:43.360
The survival for for every young boy

10:43.840 --> 10:47.760
But what was missing is there's no initiation to teach them

10:48.000 --> 10:54.240
How to how to go face their fears in the scary world with the masculine and quit seeking the approval and validation of women

10:54.560 --> 11:01.040
Because there's this really interesting paradox that I took me years to find out and you know a lot of men I work with takes

11:01.200 --> 11:03.200
You know, it's a big surprise

11:03.600 --> 11:05.600
is all

11:05.600 --> 11:10.720
Pursuing women and trying to please them doesn't make them interested in you. It doesn't make them like you

11:10.720 --> 11:13.680
It doesn't make them want to have sex with you. No, it actually doesn't

11:14.400 --> 11:20.240
Actually not trying to please women tends to make a guy more interesting to women in general

11:20.240 --> 11:23.920
That's a big paradox for a lot of the men I work with and it was for me

11:24.080 --> 11:25.280
You mean I mean all this

11:25.680 --> 11:31.600
Me listening and talk about their problems me trying to be different than the jerks they complain about me repressing my sexuality

11:31.680 --> 11:34.000
So it's not like I just want that one thing from them

11:34.320 --> 11:38.640
Oh, you know all that doesn't make them interested in me. No, it doesn't actually

11:39.200 --> 11:43.440
But they do seem to be drawn and attracted to the guy who's comfortable in his own skin

11:44.320 --> 11:47.600
Living a life, you know on his terms connected with men

11:48.480 --> 11:51.840
Putting a big dent in the universe that is really attractive

11:52.160 --> 11:56.160
But there's no note. How do I get this woman's approval involved in that whole mix?

11:57.200 --> 12:00.560
What are the covert contracts? Oh, I'm glad yes that

12:01.280 --> 12:04.800
That's um, that's my favorite part. I'm no more mr. Nice guy and I know

12:05.600 --> 12:08.480
Many men read it say robert. That is the biggest takeaway

12:09.360 --> 12:15.680
The covert contracts are unspoken often unconscious agreements that the nice guy has

12:16.480 --> 12:21.360
With everything that's not him with the world with god with women, you know, which is how things work

12:22.240 --> 12:23.280
and

12:23.280 --> 12:29.920
In the book I I I'm a little bit general, but I've broken it down to three specific covert contracts that nice guys have

12:30.240 --> 12:36.880
They're all if then uh, if I do this then this will happen. They they all are basically manipulative

12:37.040 --> 12:42.720
They all have strings attached and often the nice guy isn't aware of them and nobody else is either

12:43.040 --> 12:45.040
So covert contract number one

12:45.040 --> 12:49.280
If I'm a good guy, I will be liked and loved and get my and and

12:49.920 --> 12:53.680
Going back to and the women I'm trying to impress will want to be with me and have sex with me

12:53.760 --> 12:55.760
So if I'm good, I'll be liked and loved

12:56.480 --> 13:01.120
Number two if I meet everybody else's needs without them having to ask

13:01.680 --> 13:05.120
Then they will meet my needs without me having to ask

13:05.680 --> 13:06.800
now

13:06.880 --> 13:09.200
Unfortunately, nobody else knows this contract exists

13:09.200 --> 13:14.080
So they don't know they're supposed to be reading our minds and figure out what we want like we're trying to do for them

13:14.800 --> 13:21.520
Another core problem with this is that nice guys are actually really terrible receivers. We're not good at letting people do force

13:21.520 --> 13:26.560
We're not good at giving to ourselves. So that's covert contract number two covert contract number three

13:27.120 --> 13:32.160
Is if I do everything right, then I will have a smooth problem free world

13:32.640 --> 13:37.840
So it's kind of a peter panish kind of thing, you know, I I do everything right? I'm a good guy

13:38.160 --> 13:39.920
but unfortunately

13:39.920 --> 13:45.440
We're the player the referee the scorekeeper and we got the big scoreboard. I've done everything right

13:45.440 --> 13:48.560
How come this stuff still isn't going the way it's supposed to go in my life

13:49.200 --> 13:53.760
So nice guys are walking around these covert contracts and you ask, you know, what are

13:55.040 --> 13:57.520
What what what's the core characteristic of a nice guy?

13:57.760 --> 14:00.560
One of them is is that they're often really resentful

14:01.120 --> 14:04.080
You know, they might say well, I'm kind of bugger. I'm kind of frustrating

14:04.080 --> 14:10.720
But the really resentful not an arrangement because I've been doing this. I've been doing it right. I've been following the rules

14:10.800 --> 14:15.520
I've been, you know, being the good guy. I've been meeting your needs. I've been, you know, following all the rules

14:15.920 --> 14:17.920
You know, how come I'm wins at my turn

14:17.920 --> 14:22.640
How come I'm not getting all the all the stuff that I thought I would and that leads to a lot of resentments

14:22.640 --> 14:26.080
And that's one way I can tell I tell nice guys

14:26.480 --> 14:30.240
They well, how do I know if I'm if I'm using covert contracts and I'll go

14:30.560 --> 14:36.240
You'll know because you're walking around resentful and pissed off either because you didn't get back

14:36.640 --> 14:40.880
In turn or you didn't get appreciated for for all that that you did

14:41.360 --> 14:47.760
I heard somebody share a quote the other day that I really liked to me is another really nice way of putting covert contracts

14:47.760 --> 14:50.720
And this I guess was from Neil Strauss and he says

14:51.120 --> 15:01.760
Un unspoken expectations expectations are premeditated resentment. Isn't that that that is what happens with covert contracts phenomenal by him? Yeah

15:02.960 --> 15:04.960
that

15:06.880 --> 15:09.360
So the frustration and the resentfulness

15:10.800 --> 15:12.480
that's coming from

15:12.480 --> 15:14.960
offering to the world something that you think should be

15:15.920 --> 15:19.600
Universally liked you have that there is there's no way that anybody could be

15:20.320 --> 15:27.280
Offended by what I'm doing. I'm following the rules. I'm offering the world lots whilst asking for nothing in return

15:28.000 --> 15:28.800
and

15:28.800 --> 15:33.040
The fact that not asking for something in return results and you getting nothing in return

15:33.680 --> 15:35.680
Finding how that works. I don't know

15:36.640 --> 15:41.920
But it's I suppose this as well plays into the dishonesty bit and it's so I understand

15:41.920 --> 15:44.960
I would say that I'm I'm very much in nice guy category

15:46.560 --> 15:48.560
Very much a people pleaser

15:49.280 --> 15:53.040
My temperament is to be averse to conflict as well

15:54.080 --> 15:58.160
I've made a dent in many ways, but it's been done

15:59.280 --> 16:02.800
It's been done by weaving my way through avoiding

16:03.440 --> 16:05.440
much of the the conflict

16:06.160 --> 16:08.160
That that I would maybe need to

16:08.240 --> 16:11.600
So I suppose I can be at least in some regards a

16:12.880 --> 16:19.760
A paragon or like a a a role model for the successful nice guy in in many ways and me too

16:19.920 --> 16:24.400
You know, again, I don't like conflict, but you know, I you know, I'm doing okay

16:24.960 --> 16:31.280
There's something I always felt I always felt the fact that I wasn't like my go-to isn't typically

16:32.720 --> 16:35.600
Aggression that's not what I lean into

16:36.160 --> 16:37.200
Um

16:37.200 --> 16:42.080
Despite the fact I've got a background of fighting and and doing other things and physical training and stuff like that

16:42.320 --> 16:44.320
I always felt like it emasculated me

16:44.640 --> 16:46.960
The fact that there was something more heroic

16:47.520 --> 16:53.520
About being someone that was quick to anger, you know, there was something kind of typically masculine about that and I think I was

16:55.760 --> 17:01.760
Not strong enough to say ashamed, but it felt it it didn't feel as

17:03.200 --> 17:04.400
grand

17:04.400 --> 17:06.400
to be someone who

17:06.560 --> 17:11.920
Would be I know that there's an ability in you know being under control having your emotions under control

17:12.400 --> 17:14.560
um, but there's also a degree of

17:15.280 --> 17:19.040
Fragility, I think that you can sometimes feel with that also

17:19.600 --> 17:24.400
Well, let me give a one way to maybe look at the model and see if it fits what you're saying

17:25.280 --> 17:28.000
Is that when I was writing no more mr. Nice guy

17:28.000 --> 17:33.600
I really focused a lot on shame being a core foundation of a nice guy syndrome that internalized belief

17:33.760 --> 17:35.360
I'm not okay and

17:35.360 --> 17:41.440
Inaccurately internalized belief from our earliest life experience a few weeks old few few months old

17:42.480 --> 17:45.200
by the time I finished writing the book and it was you know

17:46.000 --> 17:50.880
Getting ready to be published. I by that time. I'd really come to also see that anxiety plays

17:51.360 --> 17:58.160
Maybe an equally significant role in nice guy syndrome. So where everything that nice guys are doing is trying to manage that sense of shame

17:58.160 --> 18:03.120
I'm not okay. I'm unlovable. I'm defective and their anxiety states, you know, I might piss somebody off

18:03.120 --> 18:06.720
I might get rejected. I might get hurt. I might lose. I might look foolish

18:07.120 --> 18:13.040
so, you know, both of those states really play into it and one of the things I've come to see is is that

18:14.240 --> 18:16.640
Whether we've got just just kind of break it down

18:16.640 --> 18:20.640
whether we got kind of the asshole jerk over here that fighter that quick to fight guy

18:21.120 --> 18:27.040
Or the wussy doormat, you know, the nice guy over here. That's the avoidant and kind of doesn't like the conflict

18:28.000 --> 18:31.040
I think they're they're both on the the same continuum

18:31.120 --> 18:36.880
I think they are both in a fight flight freeze mode of managing their interstates of anxiety

18:37.120 --> 18:41.920
The nice guy is in the flight freeze bond sometimes added to that list

18:42.480 --> 18:45.440
And what we call the jerk is in the fight mode now

18:45.520 --> 18:47.520
They're both still just trying to manipulate

18:48.160 --> 18:55.120
People and situations outside of them because they're anxious the nice guy does it by being nice and avoidant and not upsetting anybody

18:55.200 --> 18:58.800
And you know waiting for it to blow over you all that kind of whereas, you know

18:58.800 --> 19:06.400
The guy the other end of the spectrum is it's just he just quick to react with aggression to manage the people and situations around him

19:06.640 --> 19:09.040
So so he doesn't feel afraid and anxious

19:09.760 --> 19:14.000
And so men will often, you know, they'll read my book or you know, they'll hear some of my information

19:14.000 --> 19:17.680
They'll say robert I get that being a nice guy isn't working and I don't want to be that

19:18.000 --> 19:22.240
But I don't want to be the asshole either and you know, where where's that middle ground and I go

19:22.480 --> 19:25.280
I actually don't know where the tipping point is between two

19:26.160 --> 19:28.160
Dysfunctional extremes. It doesn't exist, right?

19:28.480 --> 19:32.000
What what we're actually talking about is is going to a different plane a different level

19:32.320 --> 19:34.080
Where we actually learn to soothe ourselves

19:34.080 --> 19:36.880
We're actually learned to be assertive where we actually learn to have boundaries

19:37.120 --> 19:39.600
Or we actually learn to be differentiated and ask ourselves

19:39.600 --> 19:45.200
What do I want and follow through on it where there's you know, there's a whole different plane of behavior versus just

19:45.600 --> 19:47.680
What do I do to not feel anxious here?

19:47.760 --> 19:54.720
But again, the nice guy and the jerk probably neither one is aware that they're trying to manage their anxiety states

19:55.120 --> 19:57.120
And and it isn't until you actually

19:57.680 --> 20:00.480
Get told that maybe that's what you're doing you go. Oh, wow

20:00.720 --> 20:04.800
I never thought about that before and then then you actually can feel your anxiety

20:05.120 --> 20:08.000
Rather than trying to just manage it to where it doesn't, you know

20:08.640 --> 20:13.520
Make you feel so anxious. Is it a desire to feel safe then to feel reassured?

20:14.320 --> 20:15.920
Yeah, I think, you know

20:15.920 --> 20:17.920
safety's at the core because

20:17.920 --> 20:21.120
Well, I took child development 101 back in grad school

20:21.200 --> 20:24.800
I think the very first thing they told us one of the few things maybe I remembered

20:25.200 --> 20:28.640
Was that for every child abandonment equals death?

20:29.360 --> 20:32.480
So children come into the world inherently vulnerable

20:32.880 --> 20:34.480
All right, there's no one to take care of us

20:34.560 --> 20:40.800
It takes humans longer to mature into self-sufficiency than any other animal on the planet

20:41.120 --> 20:44.960
You know our grandfathers, maybe that was about 12 or 14, you know

20:45.600 --> 20:51.040
My age was more, you know, considered 18 21 22 that was like 35 for a young man to you know

20:51.200 --> 20:55.680
Mature to be able to take care of himself. That's a joke. Um, but but it's true

20:56.320 --> 21:02.480
So we're dependent completely dependent and if somebody doesn't take care of us we die

21:02.720 --> 21:05.840
So if we get abandoned neglected, uh, we die

21:06.240 --> 21:09.840
So I know for me like when my wife, you know, I'm

21:10.560 --> 21:12.960
My wife Lupita and I've been married for seven years now

21:13.520 --> 21:18.800
Mexican woman I met here in Mexico and um, she gets a look on her face and like

21:19.680 --> 21:24.480
I'll go into, you know, this motive. I gotta I gotta fix it. She's upset. She's angry. I gotta make it better

21:24.800 --> 21:26.800
And you know, I've been working on this stuff for 30 years

21:26.800 --> 21:28.080
So you know

21:28.080 --> 21:29.600
Not like I don't know

21:29.600 --> 21:33.360
You know what's happening and I'll just watch myself have this anxiety state

21:33.760 --> 21:37.840
That I gotta I gotta talk her down through over get her back to good, you know, make her happy again

21:38.320 --> 21:43.280
And I'm thinking why am I worried about with this short little Mexican woman? Why what look she has on her face?

21:43.360 --> 21:44.720
I love her of course

21:44.720 --> 21:50.560
But why why is that triggering such depth of anxiety and really is a you really sat with and worked with it

21:51.040 --> 21:55.760
It triggers a really old emotional state that does feel like I'm gonna die

21:56.160 --> 21:58.160
If this doesn't get better right now

21:58.640 --> 22:02.000
I'm gonna die and I don't actually have that thought in my head

22:02.400 --> 22:05.840
But my reaction to it feels that intense. That's the embodied

22:06.400 --> 22:11.920
Sensation if you ask the embodied the nervous system my emotional operating system. Yeah, yeah

22:13.520 --> 22:14.720
I wonder

22:14.720 --> 22:16.880
Stepping outside of relationships for a second

22:17.680 --> 22:19.680
Relationships with anybody including friendships

22:20.960 --> 22:22.960
One of the patterns that I've noticed

22:23.200 --> 22:26.640
Especially amongst some of my friends that are nice guys or recovering nice guys

22:27.680 --> 22:29.280
Is a desire to

22:29.280 --> 22:30.640
Do things right?

22:30.640 --> 22:34.480
Oh, of course to like a task in and of itself

22:35.200 --> 22:37.840
Uh, I would guess that nice guys are probably more orderly

22:38.480 --> 22:42.240
than the normal person sources will be stacked in the in the right way

22:42.800 --> 22:44.800
You know, mustn't have a very room

22:45.680 --> 22:49.280
Because again, you'd think that you'd think that okay. I got to do it right

22:49.360 --> 22:54.160
I got to do orderly, but you know, I've got my camera angled or you can't see what's over on the sides

22:54.240 --> 22:58.480
All right, it's it's it's a mess. It is it's not terrible, but

22:59.360 --> 23:03.680
It it is messier on the sides than it is behind me. Okay. And so

23:04.560 --> 23:06.880
Again, a lot of the nice guys I work with

23:08.240 --> 23:11.680
They may have perfectionistic expectations of themselves

23:12.320 --> 23:18.080
Um, and some worked really hard to to to meet them and then they're they're in a state of anxiety all the time

23:18.560 --> 23:23.440
But others I know they go, you know, I haven't made my bed in years. You know, I don't pick up after myself

23:23.440 --> 23:26.480
I can't remember the last time I I checked my bank account balance

23:26.960 --> 23:30.480
So you'd think there would be that but but ironically

23:31.280 --> 23:34.400
Um, there's not and here's a piece that

23:35.600 --> 23:38.560
That it may sound an odd on on the surface of it

23:38.720 --> 23:42.000
But when I talk with nice guys about their fears and their anxieties

23:42.480 --> 23:47.440
I think one of the biggest anxiety or fear state that the typical nice guy might have

23:47.840 --> 23:53.760
Isn't so much a fear of failure fear of foolishness fear of looking foolish fear of loss fear of making a mistake

23:54.160 --> 23:56.000
Is fear of success?

23:56.000 --> 24:03.520
Because what happens if I do get it right? What happens if I rise up to a level of success and then, you know

24:04.560 --> 24:08.560
There's things that can happen all of a sudden the bar gets raised the expectations are higher

24:08.560 --> 24:12.240
I'm in a brighter spotlight. I might get attacked. I'm more visible

24:12.640 --> 24:13.760
um

24:13.760 --> 24:17.360
There's so many I'll lose control over my time all of these

24:17.920 --> 24:20.880
Built in anxieties of what happens if I'm too successful

24:21.280 --> 24:23.680
So again, a lot of times the nice guys will

24:24.480 --> 24:25.280
unconsciously

24:25.280 --> 24:27.280
I don't really like the word self sabotage

24:27.440 --> 24:31.120
But they'll get in their own way of living up to to their full potential

24:31.520 --> 24:37.360
And keeping things messy around you is actually a pretty good way to you know, you know, not live up your full potential

24:37.600 --> 24:41.120
Not checking your bank account every now and then, you know, I'll bite you on the ass sooner or later

24:41.680 --> 24:43.760
isn't it isn't interesting that the

24:45.680 --> 24:47.680
almost universality of

24:48.400 --> 24:49.920
high ability

24:49.920 --> 24:50.800
of

24:50.800 --> 24:51.840
this honest

24:51.840 --> 24:54.000
Do you want to uh, do you need to sort the dog?

24:57.360 --> 24:59.360
This is a regular occurrence I can see

25:00.320 --> 25:05.440
She's usually in the room with me and and she's a deer. I this is my bringing her in she can chill

25:05.920 --> 25:10.320
Yeah, the problem is she's upset because somebody's out front and I'm the only one home

25:10.560 --> 25:12.560
And I don't want to go deal with whoever might be up

25:13.600 --> 25:18.960
Okay, it could just be my wife getting home with my daughter from school. Okay. Okay. So um

25:20.240 --> 25:25.680
Yeah, she's just being a good girl. Let me know exactly. Yeah, poppy. There's somebody out there. There's somebody out there

25:25.680 --> 25:31.280
Let's go. Let's go and it may have been she just saw a cat. So, you know, I I don't know so be it um

25:31.680 --> 25:33.680
She walked away. So

25:34.160 --> 25:40.560
She's bored of you now. Yeah, it's interesting that there is uh, there's almost universality of

25:41.280 --> 25:47.200
Uh, not having healthy boundaries. Yeah of being dishonest of being manipulative although you don't think that you are you're

25:48.000 --> 25:53.360
Overly pliable in a way that means that you change yourself to get the outcome that you want from people

25:53.760 --> 25:59.680
But it seems at least based on what you've said here that there there appears to be a boundary at least typically

26:00.160 --> 26:02.400
among the nice guys where this doesn't

26:03.440 --> 26:05.760
outside of relationships friendships

26:06.400 --> 26:07.680
family

26:07.680 --> 26:11.040
Dating etc. This doesn't spread out into a

26:11.760 --> 26:13.360
Uh

26:13.360 --> 26:20.480
Overbearing desire for for orderliness and and sort of perfectionism in all areas of life

26:20.960 --> 26:24.640
You know with regards to an obsession about getting it right about being

26:25.440 --> 26:29.920
It can't I just what I'm trying to say is it's not universal

26:31.200 --> 26:35.920
Whereas the other stuff is yeah, but it's what it shows or at least what it says to me is that there's something

26:36.800 --> 26:40.080
It it's obvious that ground zero for this stuff is relationships

26:41.520 --> 26:48.240
You know that that would have been my first thought as well because it is for me and it is for many nice guys

26:48.560 --> 26:52.960
But you know what I've I've seen guys who are total nice guys

26:53.520 --> 26:57.520
In relationship and they get on the job and they kick ass

26:58.000 --> 27:02.960
You know that they're highly successful at work. I've known other people that it showed up

27:03.200 --> 27:09.840
You know at work where they're a told nice guy and going along to getting along and never really stepping up or never launching

27:09.920 --> 27:15.360
You know that that business and but at home, you know, their their wife would say he's not a nice guy

27:15.360 --> 27:17.520
He's nice to everybody else, but he's not nice to me

27:17.920 --> 27:23.280
So it can be interesting and and that would again when I started working with nice guys

27:23.440 --> 27:26.160
I just assume there's a one piece fits all

27:26.720 --> 27:30.160
And and there's really not now there are those certain commonalities

27:30.880 --> 27:33.760
But I think partly because we're also dealing with temperament

27:34.240 --> 27:38.400
That for example, maybe you and I had very different life experiences

27:38.640 --> 27:43.360
Maybe we have some similarities of temperament some differences different life experiences

27:44.080 --> 27:50.320
We're not going to turn out just the same. We may still have those tendencies of you know seeking approval avoiding conflict

27:50.720 --> 27:56.720
You know kind of a uh, oh, you know, I'm so good. Why doesn't everybody like me and everybody try to be just like me?

27:57.200 --> 27:58.160
um

27:58.160 --> 28:00.080
There might be some similarities

28:00.080 --> 28:04.640
But we might be very different and still relate to this. Yes. I'm a nice guy

28:05.040 --> 28:09.200
Understood. What about hidden behavior? They keep things hidden from themselves. They keep

28:10.640 --> 28:12.320
Why is that so common?

28:12.320 --> 28:17.120
Why is it common because you know those two things when you know when we first started you asked me, you know

28:17.200 --> 28:22.960
What what is the nice guy and basically and and I said he's the guy trying to get everybody's approval and validation

28:23.120 --> 28:25.840
You know holding your finger ups. It's which way is a wind blowing

28:26.320 --> 28:33.680
But the other piece is that hiding things about ourselves, you know hiding anything for example that might get that look on my wife's face

28:33.840 --> 28:37.920
You know, oh, she got that look. I must have done something. I better not do that again

28:38.240 --> 28:43.600
You know again that began at a very very early age when getting that look from somebody important to us

28:44.000 --> 28:49.920
might result in getting slapped getting smacked getting neglected getting yelled at getting shaken whatever

28:50.640 --> 28:52.160
so

28:52.160 --> 28:58.720
Nice guys. This is part of that. I got to hide whatever there is about me that tends to create these negative reactions around me

28:59.520 --> 29:05.600
But often there's another piece not again not universal but often for nice guys in their family system

29:06.320 --> 29:10.640
Somebody has been defined as the needy person the most important person

29:10.960 --> 29:15.920
Could be dad could be mom could be a sibling and their needs were more important

29:16.320 --> 29:22.240
All the attention and focus went on, you know making sure dad never got pissed off making sure mom didn't go on a tirade

29:22.320 --> 29:27.920
Making sure, you know, brother doesn't you know, whatever, you know, he's sick or he's he's out of control

29:28.640 --> 29:32.080
So often for nice guys, we try to become this needless

29:32.640 --> 29:36.800
Wantless never rock the boat never be a moment's problem kind of person

29:37.280 --> 29:38.400
so

29:38.400 --> 29:41.120
What we interpret is us having needs

29:41.680 --> 29:46.960
Draws too much attention and and you know my their needs are more important than mine and so

29:48.720 --> 29:50.720
Nice guys, we're

29:50.800 --> 29:54.000
Again trying to avoid that negative reaction the two things we often most hide

29:54.320 --> 29:59.680
Are our needs and wants and our sexuality the sexuality that's kind of easy to put a finger on

29:59.680 --> 30:04.320
You know, we live in a culture that we're bombarded with sexual stimuli everywhere you go

30:04.720 --> 30:11.360
But still there's still that you know that religious message that sex is bad evil save it for the one you love shame

30:11.840 --> 30:16.400
Yeah, just a whole shame wrapped around sexuality you'd think that would have gone away by now

30:16.640 --> 30:22.240
But but it's not it's as strong as ever. So for the the the the very young nice guy

30:23.200 --> 30:27.920
When kind of kind of back up a little bit back to the to the child development 101 stuff again

30:29.360 --> 30:34.560
Every child when they experience discomfort of any kind, you know, the hungry and they don't get fed

30:34.640 --> 30:39.040
They're they're they wet their diaper. They mess in their diaper. They don't get changed or cold. They don't get help

30:39.360 --> 30:42.000
Then you know, they have stomach ache. They don't get burped whatever

30:42.640 --> 30:47.760
Whenever a child experiences discomfort their children are narcissistic by nature

30:48.640 --> 30:51.840
Emotionally, they assume this is me. I I'm the cause of this

30:51.920 --> 30:53.440
I did something wrong. I'm bad

30:53.440 --> 31:00.560
They don't think it because the thinking brain isn't online at this early age the emotional brain fight flight free survival brain is

31:01.440 --> 31:08.320
And so a child will try to do two things in a very primitive way a non-thinking non-rational purely emotional way

31:08.720 --> 31:11.440
They will try to medicate the feeling states they're having

31:12.000 --> 31:14.880
Suck their thumb eat cry sleep

31:15.760 --> 31:18.880
Whatever to try to not feel bad right now

31:19.600 --> 31:23.120
And again in a very pre very primitive pre verbal

31:23.680 --> 31:25.040
kind of way

31:25.040 --> 31:30.880
Try to do try to not do whatever that was it caused the uncomfortable states or do something different

31:31.440 --> 31:35.760
And so that begins at a really early age and so the child is

31:36.320 --> 31:42.880
These these the shame is is inaccurately internalized at an emotional level. I must have done something wrong

31:43.120 --> 31:45.120
That's why this is happening. So

31:45.760 --> 31:48.400
I got to figure you how to do that different or not do that hide

31:49.040 --> 31:51.040
And so all of this comes

31:51.200 --> 31:57.920
So early as part of an emotional language an emotional operating system. It's not in words. It's not in picture memory

31:58.720 --> 32:00.720
And it's it's primitive

32:00.720 --> 32:06.880
So here we are trying to figure out how not to have these uncomfortable experiences and prevent them from happening again

32:07.360 --> 32:11.280
And one of the best things our primitive brain came up with is hide

32:12.000 --> 32:15.200
Hide, you know, whatever that I have needs all I have needs

32:15.520 --> 32:20.480
I I get I'm I'm hungry when I have needs I get slapped. Oh, their needs are more important than mine

32:20.960 --> 32:22.000
so

32:22.000 --> 32:25.680
Just hiding is part of that because we think it must be about me

32:26.080 --> 32:30.080
That's causing these painful negative experiences to be happening to us

32:30.800 --> 32:35.200
Does this mean the nice guys often have coping strategies? Maybe they'll overeat

32:35.760 --> 32:40.720
maybe they'll be compulsive with social media use or porn or video games or

32:42.240 --> 32:44.240
Substances or whatever

32:44.720 --> 32:48.000
The thing about that model. I just gave you that child development model

32:48.720 --> 32:50.720
Every human does that every human

32:51.680 --> 32:57.840
We all just pick usually again based on temperament and maybe just life experiences and birth order

32:58.400 --> 33:02.480
We all pick what are we going to do? How are we going to try to manage this?

33:02.800 --> 33:06.240
And I sucked my thumb times in kindergarten. I think maybe I was trying to

33:06.960 --> 33:11.680
Deal with some uncomfortable self-soothing self-soothing exactly trying to manage some anxiety there

33:12.560 --> 33:14.720
So that's what I did now

33:15.280 --> 33:21.280
We we go through childhood then we hit adolescence and now we really want people's approval and want to fit in and be noticed

33:21.360 --> 33:22.880
and have attention

33:22.880 --> 33:24.880
All of this really, you know, it gets

33:25.760 --> 33:29.520
Fueled with with with our hormones and need for attention

33:30.000 --> 33:35.040
Where you know, they really get solidified and we pretty much carry these routines into adulthood

33:35.360 --> 33:37.760
So yeah, trying to be perfect might be one

33:38.400 --> 33:43.600
You know trying not to be perfect because my brother was perfect and I couldn't you know compete with him

33:43.840 --> 33:46.320
So I'll be the opposite. I'll I'll make the mess

33:47.360 --> 33:52.400
Yeah, when I eat I sure do feel better when I spend all my day and night playing video games

33:52.480 --> 33:59.360
I I don't feel stressed when I'm oh, isn't porn amazing. I didn't know that this existed. Look how I feel

34:00.000 --> 34:05.280
Um, oh, you know, if I get straight A's look, I I finally get some validation

34:05.280 --> 34:09.680
But I don't know if it's ever enough. I better keep, you know succeeding performing

34:10.000 --> 34:13.520
You know, I better get into great amazing shapes so I can be valuable

34:13.760 --> 34:19.760
Oh, I'll never get in good shape. So who cares? I'll just keep eating it can take so many different forms

34:20.320 --> 34:25.040
And the only real logic to it is the the infant logic

34:25.760 --> 34:29.920
That you and I and everybody else had at a few weeks and a few months old

34:31.120 --> 34:34.080
Why uh nice guys bad receivers

34:37.200 --> 34:42.080
Because we think it makes us bad, you know, the the thing is is that

34:42.960 --> 34:49.680
As I said, most of us is is most nice guys internalize this belief. Well, I because I have needs

34:49.760 --> 34:52.880
That's why I I have these bad things that happen to me

34:53.040 --> 34:58.880
If I don't have needs bad things won't happen and often again, they I could I could look around in my family

34:59.200 --> 35:05.760
Oh, dad's needs are more important. Well, let's all make sure dad's okay. Oh now mom's unhappy. Let's all make sure mom's okay

35:06.240 --> 35:10.880
My little brother was a general fuck up at pretty much everything. Oh, okay

35:11.200 --> 35:15.440
You know, we got to make sure little brother's okay because he's gonna fuck up and I kind of like oh

35:16.000 --> 35:20.400
If I don't have needs if I just kind of do everything right, I'll be the golden child

35:20.400 --> 35:26.640
I'll get some validation. You know, I I won't get noticed too much and getting trouble and and so again

35:26.640 --> 35:28.640
That was my story. It's not every nice guy story

35:29.680 --> 35:30.640
but

35:30.640 --> 35:37.520
There's some fundamental piece in there that if if is visible if people know I have needs like that makes me vulnerable

35:37.680 --> 35:42.240
It puts me at risk. It gets people control over me. I'll owe people something

35:42.720 --> 35:50.000
So in my own personal work, one of the earliest things I had to start doing was was making me a priority where I

35:50.400 --> 35:53.760
Put where I did for me. I I'd do for everybody else

35:54.000 --> 35:59.920
But I wouldn't make me a priority and you know, I'd make sure you know, my wife and kids they all went to the dentist

36:00.080 --> 36:03.920
I wouldn't go to the dentist. Oh, they you know, if I saw something on sale, I'd buy it for them

36:04.000 --> 36:06.960
I wouldn't buy it for me. So I had to start taking good care of me

36:07.600 --> 36:11.600
The next step that that kind of came with that but came a little bit later for me

36:11.920 --> 36:19.200
Was actually beginning to surround myself with people who wanted to help me meet my needs and then actually letting them

36:19.680 --> 36:26.480
That was really anxiety producing to let people do things for me and I had to consciously just go

36:27.360 --> 36:31.440
Okay, I'm it's as simple as like I'll take the garbage out

36:31.920 --> 36:34.480
And you know, we got to take the garbage from the kitchen to the front gate

36:34.560 --> 36:37.440
It's 20 feet got to unlock the gate put it out on the street

36:37.680 --> 36:40.720
My if I'm taking the garbage at my wife will go you need help

36:41.440 --> 36:46.160
Well, no, I don't I don't need any help to take a bag of garbage from the kitchen to the front

36:46.320 --> 36:50.800
And and so I my gut response always say no, but then I realize well

36:51.440 --> 36:55.280
I don't need any help, but she wants to be with me. She wants to accompany me

36:55.600 --> 36:59.440
She doesn't want to think I'm doing all the work. Well, she's not she's very hard worker

36:59.920 --> 37:03.760
I go. Yeah. Yeah, come help me. Do I really need the help? No

37:04.560 --> 37:08.480
But it was actually it took me a while. I'm still learning that way

37:08.720 --> 37:11.760
You know, she's not really thinking I need help taking the garbage out

37:11.920 --> 37:15.760
She just wants to come take the garbage out with me just to walk to the street with me and back

37:16.160 --> 37:21.120
You know, that's that's okay. Well, who might have say no to that? That's the thing about being a bad receiver

37:21.680 --> 37:23.680
It robs people of the

37:23.920 --> 37:25.360
enjoyment

37:25.360 --> 37:28.720
Of helping you you've you've stole my words when I'm

37:29.520 --> 37:34.720
When I got I got divorced in my late 40s after 25 years of marriage to two different women

37:35.440 --> 37:38.640
And again when I started dating and started meeting nice girls, you know

37:38.640 --> 37:42.000
Who wanted to do anything for me wouldn't ever say what they wanted wouldn't make it to say

37:42.160 --> 37:47.360
I thought oh, I'd I'd empathy for my two ex-wives what I put them through with being an ice guy

37:47.360 --> 37:51.920
But I remember I was dating one woman and I met her because she sold me shoes at Nordstrom

37:52.240 --> 37:56.800
And she so she worked in retail fashion sales and her one time she came over to my apartment

37:56.880 --> 37:58.880
And I'd done some laundry left it on my couch

37:58.960 --> 38:02.480
She started folding my laundry and I said you you don't have to do that

38:02.640 --> 38:06.160
She goes no, I like doing it and and she goes and I'm good at it

38:06.480 --> 38:09.360
And you know, so she folds on my laundry puts a little stack on the end of my bed

38:09.360 --> 38:12.800
And she goes but I won't put it away for you. I said I'm not putting it away either

38:12.880 --> 38:18.320
I'm leaving it out there to remind me somebody loves me, you know that that somebody wanted to do something nice for me

38:19.040 --> 38:22.880
After that I started leaving my clean laundry on the couch

38:23.600 --> 38:25.600
So she could have the joy

38:26.160 --> 38:28.480
Of coming over and because it gave her pleasure

38:28.640 --> 38:30.880
Now who am I to rob her of that pleasure?

38:31.200 --> 38:36.720
And I need to work on it because how am I going to receive great things in this world?

38:37.200 --> 38:41.040
If I'm not good at receiving if I can't if I can't let somebody fold my laundry

38:41.520 --> 38:46.080
How am I going to receive the blessings of wealth of fame opportunity of adventure?

38:46.480 --> 38:52.560
So it's it's a very conscious practice. It was for me. So how do I let people give and let them have the pleasure of doing it?

38:53.920 --> 39:00.240
So the solution is not being a bad guy because a lot of people and you could try

39:01.600 --> 39:03.600
so, you know

39:03.840 --> 39:08.960
Nice guys finish last the bad guy gets the girl, you know, women will

39:10.400 --> 39:15.360
Sleep with the alpha but marry the beta, you know, pick your meme or cliche of choice

39:15.600 --> 39:18.320
But they're all out there sure to come up with

39:19.360 --> 39:23.280
And it seems let me I'm going to try and interpret what I think the

39:24.400 --> 39:26.400
Your philosophy is and let me know if I get it right

39:27.600 --> 39:29.600
I think

39:30.640 --> 39:32.640
The downsides of being a nice guy

39:33.360 --> 39:38.480
Although subtle and often completely opaque to the nice guys themselves. Yes

39:39.360 --> 39:41.360
are

39:41.760 --> 39:43.280
kind of

39:43.280 --> 39:45.280
evident given

39:45.760 --> 39:50.800
Can become evident given enough crowd sourcing of sense making so people and community

39:51.280 --> 39:54.960
Come up with memes and characters in tv shows and stuff like that

39:55.120 --> 39:56.880
right

39:56.880 --> 40:03.920
The solution that the low resolution solution that then gets proposed is if x x being

40:04.400 --> 40:05.520
nice guy

40:05.520 --> 40:07.520
Is bad and doesn't get what you want

40:08.000 --> 40:12.880
Then opposite of x y which is bad guy must be good

40:13.280 --> 40:15.280
so the prevalence of

40:15.520 --> 40:18.480
In you know, uh treat her like you don't like her

40:19.200 --> 40:23.200
Like why women love chads like that kind of more

40:23.280 --> 40:24.800
Um

40:24.800 --> 40:31.840
Lethario approach to attracting women and and and getting what you want in life and sort of you know being ruthless and stuff

40:32.560 --> 40:34.320
Is that a

40:34.320 --> 40:37.600
an erroneous solution to the problem of nice kindness

40:38.720 --> 40:40.320
it's

40:40.320 --> 40:45.200
A core problem with what you just proposed is it is equally inauthentic

40:45.920 --> 40:50.480
As as the other and it's equally attached to some external outcome

40:50.960 --> 40:52.960
By trying to figure out how to do it right

40:53.600 --> 40:57.520
Right. How about I just do this right again, then I'll get the women to approve of me

40:57.760 --> 41:02.400
We're still in the same boat. We're just looking for a different right way of doing it now

41:03.360 --> 41:10.960
As simple as this sounds, you know, like when I do like interviews with like a female coach that that maybe works with men

41:11.760 --> 41:12.800
and um

41:12.800 --> 41:18.800
And I say something that you know generalization like the feminine meaning all things feminine, you know women but

41:19.040 --> 41:22.080
Dogs cats babies opportunity money weather whatever

41:22.720 --> 41:27.280
I'll say is highly attracted to a man who's comfortable in his own skin

41:28.320 --> 41:30.000
knows where he's going

41:30.000 --> 41:32.080
And looks like he's having a good time going there

41:32.800 --> 41:36.800
And the women, you know coaches interviewers podcasters on the call always go

41:37.600 --> 41:39.600
Oh, yes

41:40.000 --> 41:46.320
Okay, they're they're reacting kind of their nervous system is reacting to that thing. I didn't say the guy's an asshole

41:46.400 --> 41:49.760
I didn't say he treats women bad. I didn't say doesn't give a fuck about

41:50.400 --> 41:53.440
He he's he's centered in his own body

41:53.920 --> 41:58.320
He's he's differentiated. He's asking himself. What do I want? What's important to me?

41:58.800 --> 42:04.880
Following through on that, you know, not leaving the message behind not trying to be perfect not seeking anybody's approval

42:05.280 --> 42:07.280
He's on mission. He's on purpose

42:07.520 --> 42:11.920
And in my experience the feminine is highly attracted to that you don't have to work

42:12.560 --> 42:14.560
At at getting the feminine to be attracted now

42:14.560 --> 42:17.520
Are you always going to have feminine approval? I told someone the other day

42:17.520 --> 42:23.040
This has never come out of my mouth before but I said actually there is no standard of feminine approval

42:23.680 --> 42:28.800
But the feminine is not about standards. It's just about whatever is moving masculine at standards

42:29.120 --> 42:30.640
You you go into the masculine world

42:30.640 --> 42:35.280
You know when you've lived up to the standard when you've hit the ball out of the park when you've scored a touchdown

42:35.520 --> 42:41.120
When you made ace when you you know made x amount of money the masculine doing standards are clear

42:41.360 --> 42:44.480
We can go into that world and go I've achieved. I've made it

42:44.640 --> 42:46.880
We have it. We have the stats rigorous. It's orderly

42:47.600 --> 42:49.600
Requires something of you. There's discipline

42:50.080 --> 42:52.560
The fat there is no such thing as feminine approval

42:52.720 --> 42:57.840
I mean ask any guy even a woman who approved of them dearly in one moment

42:58.080 --> 43:01.840
I'll ask them. Have you ever had experiences where the very next moment she was

43:02.160 --> 43:05.440
unapproving of you and nothing about you had changed you had even

43:05.920 --> 43:11.280
And guys all go yeah, isn't that the way it always works? Yeah, you know one minute when I was dating

43:11.440 --> 43:16.080
I had women tell me robert. You're the most amazing man. I'm so glad I met you. I'm so grateful

43:16.320 --> 43:18.800
I'm so happy and then never hear from them again

43:19.360 --> 43:25.200
Or say robert, you know after two weeks, you know, I'm taking a break from dating or I'm giving my ex another try

43:25.440 --> 43:28.800
And I'm going what just happened. That's the world of the feminine

43:28.960 --> 43:33.840
It doesn't it isn't nailed down and orderly. So we we have to quit seeking

43:34.560 --> 43:36.560
feminine approval

43:36.640 --> 43:41.520
One of my certified coaches wrote a book that that I really like but there's a line in there

43:41.760 --> 43:44.160
It said that a man does not mature

43:44.800 --> 43:47.440
Until he quit seeking the love of a woman

43:48.720 --> 43:55.600
As long as we're seeking love that's a feminine trait long as we're seeking to get that approval that love that validation from a woman

43:56.560 --> 43:58.560
We're in a loop that there's no escape from

43:59.440 --> 44:05.280
But when we when we can self validate when we're on purpose when we're living life on our terms

44:05.680 --> 44:10.720
All of a sudden that makes us very attractive to the feminine. It will come to us. That's that's my experience

44:11.120 --> 44:12.320
It will come

44:12.320 --> 44:16.160
Now as soon as you turn and go, oh is here. How do I keep it? How do I make no no no?

44:16.400 --> 44:21.120
We just blew it. All of a sudden now they're going to get that look on their face again. Like I go what I do wrong

44:22.000 --> 44:23.280
so

44:23.280 --> 44:26.800
If we take the how do I get the women's approval out of the equation

44:26.960 --> 44:30.800
You're more likely to get it does that mean you just don't give a fuck don't care whatever

44:31.200 --> 44:33.760
That's not what I'm again. It's not black and white

44:34.160 --> 44:38.000
We we men want to make it black and white. It must be this or it must be that no

44:38.240 --> 44:40.240
It's this this is

44:40.640 --> 44:46.400
Another level that we rise to that lets us put a dent in the universe that lets us

44:47.120 --> 44:53.840
Live with purpose and passion that lets us connect deeply with others that lets us be vulnerable and courageous

44:54.480 --> 44:56.480
That actually invites the love

44:57.200 --> 45:00.560
Into our life that that we desire rather than seeking it

45:01.600 --> 45:03.760
Well, ultimately I was watching this um

45:04.560 --> 45:10.480
Video from a lander botan from the school of life. Do you know that guy? British philosopher phenomenal insight

45:11.120 --> 45:15.120
You were the second person who mentioned him in the last two or three days

45:15.200 --> 45:18.240
I always pay attention when so whenever I hear someone's name like, you know

45:18.400 --> 45:22.880
Whenever I heard you need to get on chris williamson's show when I heard that three times in the same week

45:22.960 --> 45:25.600
You know, I thought wait a minute that name sounds familiar. Oh

45:25.600 --> 45:27.600
Oh

45:28.480 --> 45:33.120
I'm on he's on my calendar. What do you what do you know? It's um, so I use a

45:33.920 --> 45:37.760
I'll just say what you're referring to he wrote an op-ed article in the new york times

45:37.840 --> 45:39.200
Maybe 10 years ago

45:39.200 --> 45:45.840
He's now the title was why you will marry the wrong wrong person. Yeah, I love I love that article. I copied it

45:45.920 --> 45:52.080
It's it's just class. He's outstanding. Uh, I've he is on my mount rushmore of of of guests

45:52.080 --> 45:54.880
He was very formative for me. Um, one of the reasons that

45:55.600 --> 45:58.800
I'm gonna go on a tangent about why I love a lander botan

45:59.360 --> 46:01.760
one of the reasons that I really love him is he's so

46:02.480 --> 46:04.880
Softly spoken and he's so

46:06.080 --> 46:08.080
embodied in the nuance of

46:08.960 --> 46:14.960
Being fallible of how our emotions run the show. He's not posture. He's unbelievably smart

46:15.040 --> 46:21.680
you know, he's very very well versed in renaissance art and history and poetry and and sculpture and and and

46:22.080 --> 46:24.720
All all this stuff, but there's no posturing

46:25.520 --> 46:30.640
From his left brain. Yeah, there's none of this sort of over rationality. He he

46:31.840 --> 46:38.880
Accepts with complete face value the fact that we can be self contradictory and embarrassing and and all the rest of it

46:38.960 --> 46:41.840
But anyway, he has he has this line in a video that I was watching recently

46:42.880 --> 46:44.880
Where he talks about

46:45.040 --> 46:51.360
A person whose greatest achievement would be after their death people would say they never made a fuss

46:52.400 --> 46:55.920
Oh, they didn't make a fuss. They didn't you know, they didn't cause any ripples

46:55.920 --> 46:58.800
They didn't make any waves and he's talking about largely

47:00.080 --> 47:06.480
An equivalent of the nice guy this person who's you know overly pliable who's concerned about upsetting others who's doing all of this stuff

47:07.120 --> 47:11.920
Anna, I just it really it really sort of struck home like oh my god, like that's the

47:13.600 --> 47:18.560
That's the inheritance and the legacy which is waiting for you and ultimately

47:19.040 --> 47:21.120
You can make it to the end of your life having

47:21.360 --> 47:27.760
Either made all of the messes in the world or made zero messes at all depending on whether you go bad guy mode or nice guy mode

47:29.120 --> 47:31.120
But

47:31.120 --> 47:34.240
Like your legacy as you look back on your life is going to be one of

47:34.960 --> 47:36.960
You playing a persona

47:36.960 --> 47:41.120
You're never going to really be able to connect to any of the things that you do

47:41.760 --> 47:43.760
people

47:43.760 --> 47:45.760
accomplishments

47:45.760 --> 47:47.760
praise compliments adoration

47:48.400 --> 47:49.360
money

47:49.360 --> 47:51.360
Because it wasn't you

47:52.160 --> 47:54.160
that earned that

47:54.160 --> 47:56.160
You didn't earn your money

47:56.800 --> 47:59.200
The role that you're playing earned the money

47:59.680 --> 48:05.280
The role that you're playing got the marriage the role that you're playing got the relationship or the job raise or

48:05.600 --> 48:09.440
Or created the family or the the billion dollar company. It wasn't you

48:10.080 --> 48:12.080
wasn't you

48:12.720 --> 48:14.720
That's kind of messes with your head doesn't it

48:15.680 --> 48:17.440
It's scary

48:17.440 --> 48:23.600
You know when you were describing and I can't pronounce his name pronounce his name a land of botan. Oh, yeah, that's beautiful

48:23.840 --> 48:27.200
When you are describing him i'm sitting there thinking i'm a straight guy

48:27.600 --> 48:30.720
And that guy sounds sexy as hell the way you were destroyed. He's

48:31.760 --> 48:36.320
I mean, he's got the classic philosophers build, but so be it. So be it

48:37.120 --> 48:39.600
Here's something else. So here's something else that i've had in in my mind

48:40.000 --> 48:40.720
um

48:40.720 --> 48:44.640
Since looking at your work and kind of i've spent a lot of time over the last three years

48:44.960 --> 48:48.240
Looking at evolutionary psychology mating dynamics so on and so forth

48:50.480 --> 48:52.880
We don't see especially from women at the moment

48:53.520 --> 48:55.520
Many conversations online

48:55.680 --> 49:00.560
About nice guys about guys being too nice about guys being too pliable

49:01.040 --> 49:06.080
A lot of the conversations skews toward guys being too toxic guys being too immature

49:06.480 --> 49:10.160
But it's immature it it tends to be in a in a toxic manner

49:10.240 --> 49:12.880
It's sort of the use and discard the use and abuse

49:13.600 --> 49:16.000
The the very sort of transient transactional nature

49:17.920 --> 49:19.920
What is the reason do you think?

49:20.320 --> 49:24.960
That there isn't as much popularity if if and i don't disagree

49:24.960 --> 49:29.760
I think that a huge problem will be the pliability and and dishonesty and niceness of men

49:31.360 --> 49:32.960
Is it just less

49:32.960 --> 49:36.640
Tweetable to to have that as the reason that you can't find met

49:36.640 --> 49:40.160
I've got all of these men that keep bending over backward and keep doing things to me

49:40.320 --> 49:45.040
Is it that it's kind of publicly unpopular for women to call that out because it seems like they're being ungrateful

49:45.280 --> 49:47.280
What do you what do you think it is? Well?

49:48.640 --> 49:53.280
Because i'm not in a woman's head. I I can't and because i'm not on social media

49:53.520 --> 49:56.000
I also but I I do know what you're talking about

49:56.640 --> 49:59.920
Of course, there are memes that that that run

50:00.720 --> 50:02.400
and I

50:02.400 --> 50:06.160
I do you know because I get a google uh notice every time

50:06.640 --> 50:12.400
Nice guy, you know pops up somewhere. I I do see what when it does pop up it usually pops up and

50:12.880 --> 50:14.880
write wing republican writing

50:15.120 --> 50:17.120
um most often but

50:17.760 --> 50:19.440
When women do

50:19.440 --> 50:21.760
Write their blog articles about nice guys

50:22.320 --> 50:28.640
It is most often how nice guys aren't nice of how they use basically the covert contracts of oh

50:29.040 --> 50:33.040
I'm going to listen you talk about your problems. I'm going to pay your car payment this month. I'm going to

50:33.680 --> 50:39.200
Pretend like I care about you and then when they you know ask the woman out or wanted to have sex

50:39.440 --> 50:42.480
They goes no I never thought of you that way you're a friend, you know

50:42.800 --> 50:48.400
And then the and then the guy of course that all that resentfulness that passive aggressive that rage comes out

50:48.800 --> 50:54.080
And so, you know that meme does show up, but but it still ends up being toxic masculinity

50:55.360 --> 51:00.960
Here is my thought and it sounds like you've looked a lot at this and you might even have a better perspective than me

51:01.920 --> 51:03.920
My thought is that

51:05.200 --> 51:10.240
You know, I grew up during whatever the wave of the angry feminism was in the 60s and 70s

51:10.240 --> 51:12.000
I don't know if that's first wave second wave

51:12.000 --> 51:17.520
But you know every man's a rapist and erections a sign of aggression and you know that already bought in my mother

51:17.840 --> 51:21.120
You know my mother's generation with the first I think true feminists

51:21.440 --> 51:26.480
She raised my my sister to not need a man raised her boys to be different from their father

51:26.720 --> 51:29.520
You know that was kind of the beginning of that movement

51:30.400 --> 51:32.400
and um

51:33.760 --> 51:34.480
So

51:34.480 --> 51:38.000
From that I grew up with I don't be like those bad men the women are complaining about so

51:38.320 --> 51:42.240
So kind of the toxic masculinity meme has been around for a while

51:42.560 --> 51:47.040
It just didn't have social media and now mainstream media mainstream me

51:47.040 --> 51:52.640
I I can't even listen to like npr anymore because it's kind of like it's just gone so much to like

51:52.800 --> 51:57.600
Let's just run fluff articles, you know fluff stories and stuff like that. I agreed. Um

51:58.240 --> 52:00.240
I think

52:00.800 --> 52:02.800
There had to be a pendulum swing

52:03.680 --> 52:11.600
You know most of that's directed at patriarchy, you know now you just say patriarchy and like we all understand exactly what that means

52:11.680 --> 52:18.080
It's evil, right? But but patriarchy was also providing protect, you know, there was also

52:19.040 --> 52:22.960
Positives a part of it and was there an ownership mentality? Yeah

52:23.280 --> 52:27.680
Did that lead to colonialism and you know abuses towards women and children? Yeah

52:28.240 --> 52:31.360
Uh racism. Yeah, so yeah all of that

52:32.320 --> 52:36.960
Well, you know when we make a social change we tend to throw the baby out with the bathwater

52:37.360 --> 52:44.000
So, yeah, this was rail against this big idea of patriarchy toxic masculinity, you know

52:44.720 --> 52:49.200
You know mansplaining man spreading everything that men do is bad kind of stuff

52:49.520 --> 52:51.040
I

52:51.040 --> 52:57.920
Think maybe it had to go to an extreme and and I think most sociologists that look at big shifts in society

52:58.320 --> 53:00.720
Say when you have an oppressed people

53:01.200 --> 53:06.240
Um the down drawing it almost has to become like a revolution. It has to be at the extremes

53:06.320 --> 53:12.720
It doesn't have to be a correction. Yeah, it's not like a Gandhi that just you know, let's subtly create the shift

53:13.200 --> 53:16.400
Um, so I think there has to be that over correction

53:16.800 --> 53:23.280
And and you know, so we went through the hashtag me too where you know, men were you know, you know, accused tried

53:23.440 --> 53:29.840
You know prosecuted and you know in the media lost jobs lost status purely because some woman said oh

53:29.840 --> 53:34.480
I want to join the me too crowd, you know, and yeah, there was a lot of abuses that were being addressed

53:34.960 --> 53:37.520
Should they've been addressed through social media?

53:38.400 --> 53:40.640
I don't know if that was you know, the most

53:41.600 --> 53:45.200
Democratic way to do it, but it's how it got done and then you know, yeah

53:45.440 --> 53:49.280
If you you know publish something that gets a lot of likes and a lot of

53:49.600 --> 53:55.680
Follows and yeah other people are going to publish it. So yeah, it went to the incentives aligned to make it happen

53:55.920 --> 54:02.560
Of course they do and social media is all about algorithms and you know the more something shows up the more you see of it

54:03.040 --> 54:06.320
Uh, that's why I told one of the reasons I don't like social media

54:06.880 --> 54:08.080
um

54:08.080 --> 54:10.080
But I actually think

54:10.080 --> 54:12.080
That we're actually making an adjustment

54:12.640 --> 54:14.640
You know, I I I saw articles

54:15.360 --> 54:19.840
Yeah, a couple years ago likening anything that had to do with men's work

54:20.640 --> 54:23.120
To like the oh there goes the balloons

54:24.160 --> 54:26.160
Jesus christ

54:26.800 --> 54:30.000
I didn't think it was gonna work. How have you managed to make balloons come up on this?

54:30.320 --> 54:32.560
I promise I promise. I'm magic. Stop doing it

54:33.520 --> 54:39.120
I I wish I yeah, I can't quit moving my hands now. The thumb will probably go up. Maybe maybe confetti

54:39.440 --> 54:42.160
All right. All right. Okay. So even just a couple years ago

54:42.160 --> 54:48.800
I saw articles about linking the january 6th, you know riots, you know in washington dc

54:49.520 --> 54:55.200
To anything having to do with men's work like conflating that that all came out of the men's movement

54:55.840 --> 54:57.280
and I'm going

54:57.280 --> 55:02.560
And this was in main is washington post random article like that, right? So it's mainstream media

55:04.160 --> 55:06.160
I think actually

55:06.160 --> 55:10.240
That I think maybe we've reached that far enough far extreme

55:10.320 --> 55:12.320
And I think maybe it's starting

55:12.320 --> 55:17.360
So we're all of a sudden that's losing this interest is it seems to you know, oh, okay

55:17.440 --> 55:22.240
There's another meme about toxic masculinity. Oh, there's another meme about andrew tape

55:22.320 --> 55:27.040
There's another, you know, blah blah blah and people do get bored and now maybe in this because I'm

55:27.280 --> 55:30.880
In the middle of men's work. It's what I've done for years

55:31.440 --> 55:36.480
And I'm I'm in you know a men's program myself. I built a men's program. I believe in it

55:37.440 --> 55:45.040
I I really do think we're moving to a better space that as men become more conscious

55:45.760 --> 55:49.360
Um of the things that I think, you know, they teach they're valuable

55:50.000 --> 55:53.280
You know being honest being transparent making their needs of priority

55:53.280 --> 55:58.560
Surrounding themselves with people on how to get their needs met living with purpose living with passion, you know

55:58.640 --> 56:04.080
Being generous making the world a better place being open-hearted being loving, you know quality good qualities

56:05.440 --> 56:07.200
That I think

56:07.200 --> 56:10.320
Is changing the world is shifting the dynamic

56:11.280 --> 56:17.920
Women I think will begin to go that that's actually really attractive. That's that's sexy. That's better. I like that

56:18.480 --> 56:19.600
and um

56:19.600 --> 56:24.160
And I think there'll still be a few ones hanging on to but I let's all still stay mad at men

56:24.240 --> 56:29.920
Let's you know, let's still and after a while, you know, one of the things that really was a big shock to me

56:30.480 --> 56:32.480
I was probably in my 40s

56:32.560 --> 56:38.080
When I was I was talking to you know a feminist and I mentioned somebody who identified as a feminist a woman

56:38.240 --> 56:42.480
Maybe on an airplane and and I said, well, here's the feminism I grew up with

56:43.040 --> 56:46.400
And she said, oh, you mean that every man's a rapist you you like

56:46.960 --> 56:48.640
Believed all that I go

56:48.640 --> 56:53.680
Well, it sure was because that was just a few angry pissed off women that got a lot of attention

56:53.920 --> 56:59.040
I go that's all it was not all women felt that way. She goes no and they still don't I go

56:59.280 --> 57:05.360
That's actually good to know that maybe all that noise that you know gets a lot of likes and follows

57:05.840 --> 57:07.840
Maybe that doesn't represent

57:07.840 --> 57:14.000
But even the majority of women there was a really wonderful term that I heard last year called the tyranny of the minority

57:14.960 --> 57:18.400
And it happens. Yeah, I think that that explains it

57:19.040 --> 57:24.080
Another way of putting it is the slowest dumb shit on the freeway is going to control how fast everybody can go

57:24.320 --> 57:27.920
Very good. Yes. Yes. We're controlled by the extremes and the idiots

57:28.560 --> 57:30.240
um

57:30.240 --> 57:35.680
It's interesting to think about why that might be the case. I think that you've probably you're probably not far wrong that

57:37.840 --> 57:39.840
It's still so popular to

57:41.200 --> 57:43.200
fit men into the

57:43.200 --> 57:45.040
impressive

57:45.040 --> 57:46.640
tyrannical

57:46.640 --> 57:49.680
patriarchal overbearing dominating controlling role

57:50.480 --> 57:51.280
that

57:51.280 --> 57:57.280
If women were to if a woman was to post online something which is more more honest, perhaps which would be

57:57.760 --> 58:02.000
Um, I keep going out for men who are overly pliable and because they're so pliable

58:02.480 --> 58:05.440
I'm concerned that they're not being honest with me

58:06.160 --> 58:10.000
What does that sound like? Well, it sounds like a call for men to be less pliable

58:10.400 --> 58:14.800
Which is not far away from men to be more aggressive more controlling

58:15.200 --> 58:20.240
Writing a book that's called no more. Mr. Nice guy. Why would someone write a book teaching men to be not nice?

58:20.640 --> 58:22.160
We do we do

58:22.160 --> 58:25.760
Live in a black and white world and again media social media

58:26.240 --> 58:30.400
Loves the black and white. It doesn't like nuance subtlety

58:30.960 --> 58:37.120
That's the dangerous the real n word of 2024 is nuance. That's the real one that you shouldn't be saying

58:37.280 --> 58:40.240
All right, so getting into getting into relationships, which are obviously

58:41.040 --> 58:43.200
I think ground zero for a lot of this stuff

58:43.600 --> 58:47.520
You know, you can kind of hide things away from yourself when it's on your own

58:47.600 --> 58:49.920
And you're in and out of work and all the rest of it

58:50.000 --> 58:53.920
If you know, everybody is emotionally connected with the work and everybody's emotionally connected with how

58:54.400 --> 58:56.400
organized their source cupboard is

58:57.040 --> 59:04.240
Relationships real ground zero. What do nice guys not understand about how female attraction works?

59:04.240 --> 59:12.240
Well, most of us are believing what our mothers told us, you know, uh, if they told us anything

59:12.320 --> 59:14.880
Which is to be nice to girls with my mother said be a gentleman

59:15.680 --> 59:19.120
Okay, make sense. You know be a gentleman and I am

59:19.680 --> 59:24.880
Uh, I'm a gentleman, but a woman taught me this one. Uh, I always open the door for women

59:24.960 --> 59:30.160
I tell them wait for me. I'll open your door. Now if you really break it down, that's me being dominant

59:30.800 --> 59:33.600
You know, I tell them what to do wait for me. I'm gonna open your door

59:34.320 --> 59:39.120
And of the of the several hundred women who I've told to do wait for me. I'll open your door

59:39.680 --> 59:43.520
Only one has pushed back against it and she pushed back for a while

59:43.680 --> 59:47.520
Then all of a sudden she quit and kind of decided she actually really liked

59:48.160 --> 59:51.920
Actually what she did is she jumped my bones in a public place and a very I said

59:52.880 --> 59:57.380
We need to take this somewhere else after the while she's been pushing back against my dominance

59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.080
so

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:04.080
For there to be attraction there has to be a polarity

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:10.080
And polarity involves dominance and submission. I know those are evil terrible words, you know

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:16.080
Because we think about dominant men, you know making women be submissive. You're in you're in a safe space here

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.880
I'm not I'm not sweating it

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.600
But yeah, it is okay. It is going out on the internet, which is fine

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:28.080
You know and what's happened is a polarity has just switched where the females have become dominant the dominant players

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.400
And the guys have become the submissive players and then the the women go

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.160
How come I can't find a guy that turns me on and the guys you're going?

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:40.720
How come I can't seem to turn women on? Well, it's it's is reversed a polarity

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:46.160
You you can't have polarity. That's attraction without dominance and submission

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.840
And the more subtle it is the more subtle the attraction is the more

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.360
Latent it is tends to be the more intensity attraction is we've probably all experienced that in one way or another

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.040
And I tell people you can't have sex without dominance and submission

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.800
Otherwise, there's two bodies lying next to each other waiting for something to happen

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.480
You know you gotta have a yeah, you know fight you have a top and bottom

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.880
You have a picture and catcher right there's got to be

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:15.280
A polarity now the beauty is that polarity can you can flip it around?

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.440
You know back and forth and I think in very conscious relationships

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.120
That that happens beautifully my wife's very strong

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.200
She grew up eight out of ten kids in poverty in guadalajara, mexico

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:32.000
alcoholic father got beat on by family members beat on by neighbors

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.400
You know abused by family members abused by priests, you know, she's she's been through

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:43.360
You know, she goes to the gym two hours a day. She can out squat me easily. She's done my thigh. I don't I don't piss her off

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.320
Um, you know, she can get shit done

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.960
I grew up in a middle class white bread neighborhood of seattle washington

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:57.040
Surrounded by bowing engineer families, you know, it's just you know, I never had to fight for anything

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.520
Okay, so she's tough

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.320
But she doesn't she's always told me I love it when you tell me no

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.960
She goes, I don't I don't want to be in charge. I don't want you to always ask me what what you know

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.160
What do you want to do? She she likes it when I make we're walking to a restaurant

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.400
And you know, though here in mexico and they'll say no they'll say should I the last curtain?

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.760
Should I get the waiter say should I give him a menu in english? She goes no

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.200
He lives in mexico give him one in spanish and I'll say yeah

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.760
Give my wife and kids the menu in english

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.640
And then they hand her a menu and she goes no, he's my boss

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.760
He'll order for me and they always laugh about that and I say yeah

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.920
I get to be the boss when she says I can't you know, so we got those the whole stick down

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:39.680
But the truth is she is strong. She's powerful. She can get shit done. She can kick ass

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.720
But she doesn't want to be in that mode all the time

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.200
She wants to to be led. She wants to submit. She wants to open

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:52.160
She wants to be done too in blissful kinds of ways. Well, that's my job

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:58.960
Right. So and even though I'm kind of more that I'm I'm go along to get along. I you know, I'm yeah

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.080
This or that either one's okay with me. I'm kind of more that way

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.720
She doesn't like it when I'm that way

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:11.520
So for her she's happiest when I will play the default lead the default decision maker

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:15.120
But she likes it best when I said here's what I was thinking. What do you think?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.280
You know, I don't just say what do you think, you know, what do you want?

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.680
I'll say, you know, I was thinking a white with a little bit of tint of gray in it

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.800
What do you think?

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:29.200
You know, she wants me to to to lead that and then she'll feel the polarity and then she'll tell me

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.000
What she thinks or wants and then you just say you decide

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.120
Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go pick out the paint

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:41.200
Um, am I being abusive to her by being dominant? No, I've heard so many women tell me

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:48.160
When the guy leaves it all up to them to comply it the women feel burdened by that most are in their masculine

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.480
dominant role all day long in their work in their career

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:59.760
Raising children even mothering is a masculine dominant state to be in you're taking care of kids needs

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:04.160
That's not feminine. I don't them want to have to take care of your partner after that

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:08.080
Yeah, then then when the guy says oh, I don't get you want to have sex tonight

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:13.200
Would you or what do you want for and it's just one more thing that they got to check off there to do is

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.280
They don't want that

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:21.120
Now am I making a generalization? Yeah. Is it fluid? Yeah. Is it nuanced? Yeah

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:26.720
Is it okay? The guy's always got to be the dominant the woman's but no that's not what I'm saying

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:32.640
But for for men when I start talking about them consciously setting the tone and leading in relationship

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.200
When I say that to a nice guy

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:41.760
The response he usually he'll pondering okay, dr. Glover what I hear you say when you say take control

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:47.120
I go no no you did not hear me say the word take control. I did not say it

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:53.600
I don't believe in it. I'm talking about you lead you set the tone you state what you want where you want to go

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:57.680
What you want to eat and and and give her a chance to follow like on the dance floor

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.920
She can't follow where you don't lead

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Give her that and then

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.640
Be open to a discussion be open to her taking the you know setting the tone and leading

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:11.200
But it's not about but guys nice guys will say when you know when you said take control

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.120
Is more nuanced than that but again

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.400
So that that that's my job is helping guys

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:22.240
Apply the the nuance that that word of 2024

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.360
What is the role of emotional tension?

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.480
Oh, you've done some research

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:33.280
Yeah, that's a cute little wink of the high that just it was just flirting with you. I'm just

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.480
It's reflexive. I'm just trying to flirt with you. Yeah

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:44.080
I know the girls like it. Probably the boys do too. I I live in a very gay community. So, you know

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.560
I know how it is

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:51.920
Okay, so the role of emotional tension. There we go. We just had emotional tension going on right there. Yep

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.800
I'm gonna I'm gonna make a generalization that doesn't apply to everybody

01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:02.160
But it does seem to apply to a lot and that's the generalized statement is

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:06.720
Is that in general for women to experience attraction?

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.120
Say towards a man

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:16.400
Arousal and to stay attached to that man over time. She has to experience some kind of emotional tension

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:23.200
She's got to feel something the butterflies and this the that the drama that does he love me doesn't love me

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:28.400
And we men can kind of understand that a little bit. We kind of like the tension we feel of go

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:33.120
Feel it's nice, you know like her boobs whatever, you know, that creates attention for us

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:38.000
But in general men don't like emotional tension, especially in relationship

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:44.560
If you even think about, you know, our sporting events where we do get our tension and clocks on them

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:49.360
You know, we know it's going to end at this time. That's why baseball is falling out of favor

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:53.840
That's why they put a clock on baseball. They put the they put the pitch clock last year

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:59.440
Yeah, you know, how many times you can throw it at first, you know, because oh, we got to have it on a clock

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.040
You know, so um, so men's tension is on the clock

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:09.200
Oh, yeah, I I know this, you know, this this adventure flick i'm watching in the hero

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:14.240
This is happening. I know he's gonna get out of it and it's gonna be done in 35 minutes, you know, it's done

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.680
We're done. Shoot go home kick back into nothingness, right?

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.760
The feminine never gets tired of tension the feminine if it

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.600
If it isn't feeling tension is bored. It will create tension

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:29.120
And so that's what's hard for men to understand, you know

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.880
We think to be nice to women will make them be attracted to us

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:37.840
But nice creates absolutely no attention no tension really for anybody

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:43.200
Men or women, but we think well, that's what mom told me to do. Go be go go be nice to them

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:48.800
It's what that's what I in junior high all the women were complaining about those jerks who create attention for them

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:55.200
And so I listened to her complain about the jerk since she kept going back to the jerk even after you know, I'm such a nice guy

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:01.680
So in general women need that emotional tension watch it. They create it within themselves

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.000
Um and and we guys if we have any kind of tension between us

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:11.120
We'll just have it out. Maybe we'll punch each other and then we'll be done. We'll go have a beer. It's all good, you know

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.760
We don't need to keep going back into that tension state to have a bond have a connection

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.560
Well, we'll go do something together. We may go compete

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:22.880
We may go bring our a game and leave it all on the field, but then we walk off arm and arm

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:27.520
So it's just the the the difference between that masculine and feminine

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:32.640
So the hardest part for men to understand is that the women need that tension. So even when

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.760
I say wait for me. I'll open your door

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.160
And now I create a little bit of dominance and she waits for me. That's tension

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.480
All right, it's just a little bit. It's a little subtle, you know, even like, you know

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:47.920
Say hey, put the menu down. I'll order for us tonight

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:52.720
There's tension and I'm not being nice. It's actually creating something. What's he gonna order for?

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:56.560
Is he gonna pick something? I like do I trust him? Is it gonna be an adventure?

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:01.440
You know, I tell guys and you know and you know guys will think it's game playing

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:06.720
And it kind of can look like that and but the the real thing is it's actually just is how do we get more conscious?

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.960
So I'll tell a guy for example, you know

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:15.440
If a woman sends you a message text message or calls you and if you reply right away or you pick up the phone and answer

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:18.480
How much tension will the woman experience through that?

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:23.360
Well, well, none we've relieved it as soon as we answered the phone or tension went away

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.760
But what if you didn't answer it?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.720
What if you called her back in 30 seconds 45 seconds

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:32.560
An hour and she goes, where were you? Why didn't you answer?

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.360
And what if you didn't give her an answer to that?

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.280
And she's going why didn't he answer? What was he doing now? Here's the thing because those guys

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.400
Ten if we do have emotional tension, we like what I call positive emotional tension

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.680
You know, it it feels good to us where you're at

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:57.440
For the for women they don't care. Is it positive emotional tension? Is it is it pet or is it net negative emotional tension?

01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:59.920
They don't care emotional tension is emotional tension

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:05.280
And so, you know, it means, you know, them starting a fight, you know them doing something knows

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.560
They know it's going to piss us off. It's kind of like they don't care

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.400
They got our attention

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.440
And and that's all that mattered. They got our attention and there's tension

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:19.120
And and even the thing of guys like listening to women talk about the problems. I tell guys there's a an

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.040
inverse

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:26.160
negative relationship between the amount of time a man spends listening to a woman talk about her problems

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.880
And the likelihood he's going to get laid what you mean

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.400
It means that if you say and listen to talk about her problems, you've actually relieved all of her tension

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.960
Tensions flowed completely out of because you know, she talked she talked she talked all the tension

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:42.640
Came away and what I tell guys is then you end up looking like

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.760
Her girlfriend with a penis and odds are she doesn't want to have sex with her girlfriend

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.760
So anything we do to relieve their tension

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.160
Actually works against us and robs them kind of like we talked about earlier

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.640
Are we going to rob them of the joy of doing for us?

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:05.600
Well, are we going to rob them of the emotional tension that they have to have to feel to feel something

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.160
To to want to engage

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.280
You had this fantastic example

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.480
of how emotional tension

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.400
is enjoyed differently by men and women by the

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.800
story arcs of romantic comedies and how men and women

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.960
Uh, experience experience that can you explain that?

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:32.080
Well, you mean like, you know, you you take your woman to watch titanic and she titanic

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:36.400
You know, she's already seen it eight times and she walks away with her panties wet thinking outcome

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:42.000
I can't have that and the guy the guy's checking his watch checking his phone his fort center on yet

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:48.000
How do I get out of here? I I thought what was particularly interesting was you you explaining and it really sort of hit home to me that

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:51.680
Uh, if you're a man who's watching a romantic comedy you see

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.120
um

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.400
regulation at the beginning everything is is fine

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.000
Then you see dysregulation something happens and everything goes up in the air

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.080
Then you see regulation again or more like

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:09.200
Middle movie regulation whether the couple first starts to get together and you're like, oh, well, I mean that's it like let's go home

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:13.680
The movie's done. Yes done. Whereas what the woman then wants is this protracted

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.640
Oh, but the ex-girlfriend's back in the picture

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.920
But oh my god, he hasn't got his right visa and he's going to be deported

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:25.040
How are they going to keep the relationship going and it's just protracted and protracted and protracted and protracted and then

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.680
I don't I don't know what it's like to be a woman at the end of a rom-com

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:28.640
But it may be

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:33.600
Unsatisfying for there to be a conclusion. It's like what could we just let's roll it for another three hours

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:37.360
Let's just continue to extend this and that's maybe we're bollywood figured it out

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:40.960
Let's just do the wedding scene everybody's dancing to a real upbeat song

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.080
We know it's over but now they'll do a part two of it

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.400
um

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.400
and you know

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:53.360
Women I've been in relationship with learned don't take me to a romantic comedy

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:58.640
I'm sitting there going that is so fucking unrealistic. That doesn't happen in the real world

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:05.280
How come every guy has a job he doesn't actually have to go to how come every woman's a fashion editor in every one of these

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:11.600
Yeah, I know he loves dogs, but he lives in this new york loft and makes canoes. That's how he supports himself

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.840
Come on. That's not real. Yes

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:19.920
Yeah, you don't want to go to a romantic comedy with me because I live in the world of could that really be real

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.720
Could that really happen? Do people really do that?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.880
No, you know, that's not how the real world works

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:31.120
But it creates emotional tension and so that's really what it is all about

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:37.840
It's not about reality the masculine wants to go resolve all the emotional tension to get us back into reality

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:41.760
So yeah, I it's it's really hard for me to watch a romantic comedy

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:47.360
Just twiddle my thumbs and just not not say anything. Oh, it's excruciating. So

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.320
thinking about this

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.320
Dynamic that we have this emotional tension

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.800
this amount of of dominance and and uh direction

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:00.800
Uh and and suggestion that comes from the man. Um

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.520
There will be women listening and out there who

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:10.880
Enjoy they're writing a blog article about us right now. It's fine. It's added to the list

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.600
But there will be women listening who?

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:19.120
Maybe a little conflicted or there will be men who imagine that the woman might be conflicted because you say well

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:25.600
She wants she comes home. She's had a difficult day at the work because kelly that bitch in the cubicle next door

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.720
Has done that thing again that pisses her off and the woman

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.920
Wants to be able to vent. She also wants her man to listen to her

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.320
and it's this odd duality of

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.680
Not knowing what's best for us

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:44.640
And of the things that we want not always being in our best interests and you

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:51.120
Quoted the best onion article which is woman turns man into a partner. She doesn't want to be with

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.800
I I got the article the headline alone is is enough right, you know

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.080
And and again, this is this is the dance of relationship

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:06.880
Wouldn't it be great if you know, we could just say guys just do it this way every woman's going to like it

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.760
No, it doesn't work that way

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:15.600
And but what what you said what was really true is that yeah, so for example

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.240
You know the woman in your life's been in her masculine all day doing at work

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.920
Putting up with asshole managers asshole customers asshole clients asshole core workers

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.640
And now, you know, she comes home. There's one more asshole now is putting demands on her

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.280
So for example

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:39.120
Um, the woman that folded my clothes that I mentioned again, I met her at the mall as she sold me shoes

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:44.960
And when after we started dating, um, one of the things where we really clicked is she liked baseball

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.360
I like baseball

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:50.160
Rangers fine. I could have been part of a threesome. It would have been great

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.880
There we go. You're flirting again

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:57.040
But but you lost to me as soon as you said Texas Rangers, you know

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:03.360
Hey, those of us with the world series championship in the last year. Yeah, you're you're the we you're the homer

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:08.720
Yeah, we we won the world series. Let me see the ring man. Show show me the ring. Okay, so, um

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:14.880
She liked baseball so, you know, she'd get off work four or five o'clock in the afternoon

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:19.280
I'd already have a bar stool staked out at the roost chris that was right next to you know, where she worked

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.760
Couple baseball games are already on the screen at the bar

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.200
They have this great half rice hamburger during happy hour

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:32.800
She'd come in and she would just start, you know, I'd already have the wine ordered sitting there

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.880
You know, the you know the appetizers that come and she's like this about her day

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.720
Like that. She's been in her mask in all day. I would take out my phone

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:47.680
Set it at five minutes and say you have my undivided attention for five minutes. Put the phone on the bar

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:51.520
I would give her eye contact. I would face her

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.000
I would listen

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
undivided attention

01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:02.480
She would run out of steam before five minutes was up because she's going I sit here complaining

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:06.960
But there's a baseball game on and there's a glass of wine sitting here. What do I prefer?

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:10.480
Before now if I didn't put her on the clock at five minutes

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:15.200
It was a game it was me being dominant but in a loving playful if I didn't put her on the clock

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.480
She might

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:22.800
Be crabby all night long and she would not enjoy herself because one of the things I found is that for

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.920
Somebody who identifies as feminine to be in their masculine all day

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.360
Are often not good at getting themselves out of that masculine

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.480
I got to go home and wash dishes and get the laundry done

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.120
There's things we got to do before I got to get up and go to work tomorrow

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.440
I'll sit down. I have a glass of wine. Tell me about your day. Let me rub your feet

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.640
I'm a big fan of of in a sense

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:51.440
Leading her back into her feminine out of that masculine rigid get shit done kind of state of mind

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:55.840
And now all of a sudden she begins opening and she'll tell me your attention

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.680
I might even say a woman taught me this. I'll say, you know what? I want to hear about your day

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:01.680
But give me the guy version

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.960
You know, and I've never had a woman ask me. What does that mean? I'll say you you want me to be your guy, right?

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:10.880
Yeah, yeah, all right, then I need the guy version when you tell me about the day

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:14.640
Please translate about how Kelly and the cubicle next to her, you know

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:19.680
And I know why she does it because you just insecure and she's always wanting attention and she always takes it out of me

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.840
Dear

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:25.280
I love you. Give me the guy version. Kelly pissed me off today. Great

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Now I understand why you had a bad day

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.040
So, you know

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.440
Get playful with it get playful with it

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:39.920
There's definitely one of the common threads that I'm noticing through a lot of the dynamics is a degree of playfulness and

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:43.600
It's my nature. So it is what I bring and

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:48.240
You know, it's it's helping it's helping to it's helping to relieve the tension

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:50.960
relieve the tension it's helping to relieve the

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:52.880
seriousness

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:56.080
Of everything that that it it gives more play

01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:01.280
It gives like in the engineering term it gives more room within the system for things to breathe

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:05.360
You make a suggestion, but it's not it's not done in too

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:10.240
Rigid of a fashion. There's there's there's movement in there and it's done

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:14.720
It's evident the reason that you're doing it and it's not in a mocking way. It's not in a passive aggressive way

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:19.520
It's not in a condescending or patronizing way, but the reason that this I think

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:25.120
Works is it shows. Hey, look like we're here to enjoy our time together

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.600
we're here you're here to enjoy we're here to enjoy this and

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:33.760
Whether it's someone's had something good happened. Someone's had something bad happened. Someone's sad. Someone's mad. Someone's whatever

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:38.160
The appropriate amount of playfulness I can struggle to think of

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.440
Really many situations in which it doesn't make it better

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:44.640
Yeah, I

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:50.880
And that doesn't mean getting silly and everything's a joke because again guys will kind of like oh, you mean make a joke about it

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:52.960
and again

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.960
teaching men

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.960
to to be lighthearted

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.160
But that that that can be a pretty daunting task

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:04.240
Yeah, um now what's funny though if you get men with men

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:09.760
And and let them just kind of begin to let their hair down guys get silly with each other

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.600
And you know and but we're I think we're afraid of showing that to women

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.200
Oh, yeah, I won't I won't appear manly. I won't be you know

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.960
It's a degree of there's a degree of competence. I think

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:26.640
Uh, I certainly noticed this. Do you know who charlie hoop it is from charisma on command?

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:32.880
He's got a very big charisma channel on youtube. It really really great guy very embodied ton of self work ton of men's work

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.200
and

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.400
he

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:39.600
Helps mostly men but also women become more charismatic

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:46.240
So he's he's learned the principles of confidence and charisma and um one of the best tools that he

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:50.240
teaches is when people ask a question

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.200
The best answer isn't always the right one

01:20:54.160 --> 01:21:00.240
And you know he uses this example of um, how to overcome your discomfort around trying to be funny

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.920
And he says if you walk out of the house and you're with people you walk out of a bar

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:09.600
Or whatever and the weather is one extreme of either hot or cold make a joke about it being the opposite

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:14.960
Yeah, and he was like it's the shittest joke. It is the worst. It's a pure dad joke

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:20.560
But he said it'll get a chuckle out of people if you walk outside and it's freezing hot and you go dude

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.560
Wish I'd brought some shorts today. This is great

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:26.880
um like people have a little bit of a chuckle about but it really really

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:30.640
Showed me and I have a friend george who's been on the show a lot

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.800
He a lot of the time if you're playing kind of like a game of tennis

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:40.560
So you're playing a game of tennis which involves a linear conversation. Here is a question. There is an answer

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.600
Here is a question. There is an answer. Here's another answer. Here's another question

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:48.240
And you played this back and forth. He regularly hits the ball sideways

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:54.880
So he'll call back to a thing that happened a couple of weeks ago or he'll say, oh, you know

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:59.200
I bet that such and such a famous person from the media would have done that or whatever like he'll

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:05.280
Rip the conversation out like orthogonally from where it is and there's play in that

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:10.880
He's not answering the question because he he has the comfort in himself to not need

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:16.400
To get validation by being I am the person that always knows the answer

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:22.160
I am the person that is always able to give the the correct conclusion that draws the line that puts the full stop

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.760
And dots the eyes and crosses the t's

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:26.880
I don't need to be that person and it's such a breath of fresh air

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:31.680
Because you're having this conversation and and you're like, I'm excited. I don't know what's gonna and it

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.560
Engenders that in you as well, but there's definitely like good boy energy

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.520
a nice guy energy in

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.520
I will answer the question properly. I will ensure that this

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:50.400
Somebody's asked something of me and to deliver it. I shall and that removes the playfulness. Yeah, you know and

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:55.680
When I work with guys around this again when I said when I learned to date in my 40s and 50s

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:59.840
I you know, I was never good with women and if I got one I kept them way too long

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:05.920
And I started getting successful, you know with dating and getting laid and guys said Robert teach us

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.480
I'm not a dating guru

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:13.840
But what you're talking about is it again for most of the men I worked with they get so afraid

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:19.280
I'm gonna do something wrong. I'm gonna make a mistake. I'm gonna piss her off. I'll blow it and then then it's irreparable

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.760
and I'd say, you know just

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:26.720
Toucher don't you know if you have the impulse to touch or touch her if you have the impulse to tease your teaser

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.720
If you have the impulse to tell her come on. Let's go do this

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:30.960
Don't hold back

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.960
It's crazy as it sounds. I tell guys

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.520
Blurt and act on impulse

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.760
You think that's a recipe for disaster

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:44.720
But the truth is it lets them be themselves because their authentic self comes out and you know, I've had so many experiences

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:48.160
You know around one if I just blurted acted on impulse

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:51.680
You know, I remember one woman I dated on the second date

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:54.560
We were going to go for a walk and she said, well, let me go use the restroom

01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:59.680
Restaurant and she went to the restroom came back and I so I'm gonna go use the restroom

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:02.000
I said by the way enjoyed watching you walk away from me

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:05.440
And as soon as I said it, I thought oh fuck. I probably blew it, you know

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.720
After we broke up we stayed friends and said

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:12.880
Months later said you remember when you said that to me said, yeah, I thought I blew it

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:18.080
He goes, oh no, I loved it. Well, I it I just blurted it right. I didn't hold it back

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:24.800
I remember another another woman early early first date where we're walking and she said something about her

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.960
Her sister or sister-in-law they're they're having a shoe party, you know, where women get together and

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.840
Look at shoes

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:40.800
The lamest thing a tupperware. I can think of the a shoe party lamest party in history

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:45.680
But okay, and so I blurted without thinking oh shoe shopping is women's porn

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.480
She turned and looked at me and she goes

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.520
You get it you understand

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:58.000
You know and and and so guys will say well, I'm not funny, you know, I'm not I'm not, you know, I can't

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.480
I'm not talking about telling jokes

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:03.680
I'm talking about whatever that thing that came to the tip of your brain

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.680
But you held it back

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:10.320
Yeah, because you're afraid it might be the wrong thing to say the wrong thing to do as soon as you held it back

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:16.880
You killed the tension the putting it out there and sometimes you crash and burn, you know, there's the sweat flops

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:22.960
You go, oh man, that didn't get one laugh, you know, but you got to take that risk every comedian

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.440
You know has had plenty of bombs

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:28.400
to but man that one landed and

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.880
And it's not about trying to get it right. It's about taking the sensors off

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:38.080
And letting that you that maybe just speaks to the obvious

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:43.680
Out there and people people they'll relate to it or they won't it seems a lot like

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.720
one of the key

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.240
tactics for

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:51.200
Rehabilitating a nice guy is learning to kind of get out of your own way

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:58.160
That's a good way to put it because what we've been doing is again go all the way back to where we began this

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.600
They've been trying to manage their shame. I'm bad. I'm not good enough. I'm gonna be found out. I'm gonna die

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Their anxiety. Oh, no, somebody will react negatively. There'll be pain involved

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:12.400
And so that is what's driving the bus is their shame and their anxiety

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:16.960
And so who is really in there? You know, who is the person?

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:18.960
Um

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:23.040
One of the things the comments I get from people that work with me or you know

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:27.760
Come to my workshops or seminars or do calls with me. They'll say robert

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.920
I appreciate how how authentic you are

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.680
And I'll go

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:33.920
Nobody would have accused me of that 30 years ago

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:39.040
Nobody would have said robert. I love how real you are how authentic you are how you just share yourself

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:42.320
How you share your mistakes you fuck ups. I didn't

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:47.200
And and I couldn't attract a woman to save my life, you know back back in those days

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:52.960
I I kind of could but I I didn't know that what I was what I did that might attract a woman

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:57.200
But I wasn't real. I wasn't authentic. I was holding my finger up checking the wind

01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:01.520
I was a chameleon, you know, what's what's gonna give me the most laughs or what's gonna give me, you know

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:07.440
What will kind of go over well, but not too well that you know now I'm not on the spot that I got to follow through

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:08.800
and

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.800
man to just take the sensors off

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.720
and just

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:15.120
Blurt act on impulse be you

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:20.480
I think is such a powerful rehabilitation and since most nice guys

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:25.440
Their sensors are the most prominent with women. That's a great place to go practice

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:31.680
One of my the same friend I was talking about before mr. Orthogonal tennis game george

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:36.960
He he has this idea called only the irrational behavior survives. What he's talking about

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.760
What he's talking about is he imagines

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:43.360
being at the funeral of somebody that he knows and he

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:48.720
Thinks about the conversations that the people are having around the room and they're not having the conversation

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.760
The washing was always folded and he turned up on time and all the rest of it

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:57.360
He uses this example of his mum and he says that his mum hates fighting

01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:01.840
Just really just does not like physical fighting big big problem with it

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:08.160
And once his brother was in the car his younger brother was in the car with her and they were driving somewhere and she

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.880
I don't know 50s year old woman

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.200
Normal british woman saw two

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:18.720
18 year old boys sort of squaring up to each other and pushing and trying to fight or whatever on the side of the

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.920
On the pavement. She stops the car in the middle of traffic

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.880
Gets out and runs over and the brother's like mum. What the fuck are you doing?

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.880
Like what the two guys

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:32.640
Twice your size and quadruply a testosterone. What the fuck are you doing?

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:36.640
She runs over and she gets in between them physically gets in between them like no fighting no fighting

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.040
Gets back in the car and the brother's like mum. That was

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:44.000
Insane, you could have been hurt. You could be what she's I don't care. I don't care. I just don't like fighting no one's fighting

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.880
and he said at her funeral

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:52.240
People will say she was the sort of person that would stop the car in the middle of traffic to stop two boys fighting

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:58.720
And it's like that only the irrational behavior survives is is similar to what you're talking about that there are rough edges

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:00.480
to

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.480
our personality and our behavior

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:09.600
But ultimately that is our personality and behavior like if your goal your goal should not be as a person on this planet

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.760
to smooth out any of the things that make you anything into this sort of

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.560
vanilla amorphous

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:21.360
blob that kind of like just glides

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:27.920
Through it's like no you have things that you want to say and actions that you want to take and changes that you want to make

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:31.520
And just the faith to be able to do that unencumbered

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:33.040
is

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:38.480
That's what life is. Yeah, and and it takes support. It takes practice

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.160
um

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:43.760
Yeah, you know talking no more mr. Nice guy about nice guys being teflon men

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:47.440
No stick, you know, nothing. I don't want anything to stick to me

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:54.720
But we do connect as you said around our rough edges, you know, what we remember about people might not even been always a thing

01:29:55.520 --> 01:30:00.160
It might even bugged us or got on our nerves when they did it and we're around them

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:03.120
But it's also the thing we miss. I mean, you know

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:09.120
Nala the pit bulls back at my my door again. I've got french glass doors so I can see her outside my office

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:13.680
Yeah, you know when she barks during, you know, I'm on an interview a podcast

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:18.160
It really bugs me but you know if I didn't have her and I'd notice

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:20.160
Oh, I miss her bark

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:25.840
You know, I love when she'd go crazy and let me know that somebody was out front our handyman

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:30.880
The the water guys deliver a while they call my dog's name because they know she'll bark differently

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:36.160
When she's had her name called and well and I would miss that if it if it ever went I go

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:39.920
What's wrong with Nala? How come she doesn't bark at people outside anymore?

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:47.200
Yeah, it's it's it's rough edges bore, you know, all that smooth get it right. No, you know, that's boring

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:51.040
Why is your first sexual experience so important?

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:54.240
You talking about mine

01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:00.400
Come on, even that's too far for me. Um, yeah

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:05.600
First sexual experience. Why is it very formative? Okay, you know

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.320
That

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.240
That's a good question

01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:14.160
But it's also difficult one to answer because our first sexual experience is probably

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:18.480
Conception, you know, I'd say birth. We're born sexual

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:25.920
We're the the essence of who we are is sexuality every living thing is built to reproduce

01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:30.000
After its own so our sexuality is the essence of who we are

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:36.880
We we kind of live culturally thinking well, you know, children don't become sexual until you know that

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.360
particular age whatever that might be

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.920
but the truth is, you know

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:46.640
Little boys little girls discover their body parts that are very young age

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:52.160
Oh, there's pleasure before you, you know, they understand the words of parents don't stop doing that, you know

01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:56.000
They're they're they're they're finding the pleasure in their own body parts

01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:02.560
And the essence of our psyche is is is our our sexuality, you know, if

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:07.600
So many great teachers, you know all the way from from Freud

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:16.720
To david data to osho to david snarch people at least i value talk about the the most profound way into who we are

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:24.000
Young is to our sexuality because it is the essence of who we are. So to bring that back to answering your question

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:28.960
I will often ask people like in a workshop, you know, again, I primarily work with men these days. Well

01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:31.760
I 100% work with men these days

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.440
I'll ask them

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:40.240
What was your earliest sexual memory and it doesn't matter what it was first time you notice you had an erection first kiss first wet dream

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.320
First i'll show you mine. You show me yours first, whatever

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:48.800
Uh, and it can vary for you every what but i'll just say what is your first memory?

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.720
And then i'll say get it get clear in your mind. What was it?

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:54.960
And then i'll ask them

01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.760
Did it occur in the open?

01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.920
Could you go tell your folks about it?

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.760
Could it be celebrated?

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:07.280
Did your parents say that's amazing. Let's go get pizza. That's a you know, it's a developmental milestone

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:14.640
Um, or was it hidden? Was it secretive? Was it guilt-ridden? Was it shame-based?

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:20.320
Uh, even worse. Did it feel good? But you felt bad about it feeling good

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.560
All right, so

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:28.640
For about 99.9 of the people on the planet our earliest sexual experience

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.200
Was wrapped in shame

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:35.840
And in hidden darkness guilt i'm bad. I can't let anybody find out

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:40.880
So our sexuality gets cross-wired with those features

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.680
It's bad it's evil hide it

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.880
Repress it don't let it out and then that takes

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:53.280
You know as many different forms as there are people in terms of how that manifests from from there

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:58.400
So then we get to be adolescents and adults and can't figure out why

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.920
Sex is so messy so difficult so challenging. So

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:05.600
You know, how come isn't work how come how come it's not easy?

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.440
Yeah, people who think that they have a a low sex drive

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:12.080
Might actually just be

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:14.240
psychologically scarred from

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:16.080
The way that they perceived it

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:19.440
That's very possible. I and I've I've often said, you know, I

01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:25.120
Will get personal I didn't discover I didn't know I could actually masturbate myself to

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:31.600
Ejaculation until I was a freshman in college. That's pretty late compared to most and and you know

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.480
I was kind of a late bloomer in a lot of ways around sexuality

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:36.480
And I was just well, that's just me

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:42.000
But yeah, it's very likely me growing up in a fundamental christian church where I heard messages really early

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:45.840
That if you lust after a woman's breast you go to all you go to hell for all eternity

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:49.440
You know where you know, my mom taught me to be not be like my dad

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:54.080
Where you know, I listen to the women that he's a jerk. He only wants one thing, you know

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:59.440
Yeah, there might have been some scarring that went into the you know, I'm trying to work out

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:04.560
You know, it's better to not have a sex drive. Oh my penis betrayed me again by getting a wreck

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:11.600
You know what stop doing that. You know, you know, I'm trying to work out from a first sexual experience

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:17.280
My first the first time I had sex the girl who I worked with at the

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:19.760
local

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:21.760
Hotel where I was the room service boy

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:24.160
Do you know what?

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:25.280
uh

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:26.480
fucking

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:28.480
What was it?

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:36.160
A vw loopo is a loopo loopo. It's like the site. It's smaller than a fee at 500 and it was three door

01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:38.720
and it was in a

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:43.760
Uh, like an industrial estate halfway between did you have sex in the loopo?

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.600
I had I

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:49.360
If you think that having sex for the first time is difficult having sex for the first time in a car

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:54.560
That's like half the size of a jumper just turns the turns the difficulty level up to 11

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:59.760
um, but yeah, I maybe maybe that's I don't know what that means. We were next to a

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:06.720
Like a Mercedes bends mechanics. Maybe that's why I love f1 so much. I'm not sure I keep getting an erection whenever I see Lewis Hamilton

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:07.760
I'm not sure

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:13.280
Uh, we could really spend my my first attempt was in a chevy vega

01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:20.400
You know, it probably slightly bigger slightly bigger the next time I tried it. It was on a park school bus. I got smart, right?

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.800
Yeah, very nice

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:26.000
Very good. Well, I mean the school bus. Yeah, but um, yeah, it's

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:30.880
It's it's very interesting to think about how we sort of internalize these stories

01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:37.440
And I had a do you know dr. Paul conty is so that was stanford. I've heard that name

01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:40.000
I couldn't tell you who he is but I have heard the name

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:47.200
So he did a four-part series with andrew huberman last year. I've heard that name too. Yes. Yeah, so every everybody says that name all the time

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:51.120
He's fantastic. They're both fantastic and um, paul does uh

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:53.440
evidence-based

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:55.440
unconscious work trauma

01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:57.520
and such

01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:00.320
from a very medical standpoint and um

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:05.280
He was talking to me. He gave me this really lovely frame very interesting about how

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:08.640
Formative experiences in our past

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:16.160
Can reshape the way that we see the entirety of that world but importantly they reshape our

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:19.360
Memory of what it was like before that as well

01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:24.480
so for us to say something like uh, I get in a car accident when I'm 25 and

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:31.360
Then you get travel anxiety which causes you to not enjoy driving or to feel anxious when you're driving and then at 35 you tell yourself

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:32.960
I've never

01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:37.440
liked driving you were like no until the age of 25 you loved it. Do you not remember you did that thing?

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:38.160
It's like no no no

01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:40.160
I was anxious the whole time and this

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:47.520
this ability that like the fallibility and the malleability of our memory and our sense of self and our understanding of ourselves

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.680
um the fact that for sufficiently formative experiences

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:53.680
can

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:58.160
Like manipulate those and mold them in a different way. I just thought was so

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:01.360
It's fascinating but kind of brutal as well

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:05.760
Well, and maybe this is a the same another way of explaining the same thing

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:11.040
Every time we recall a memory we fundamentally change the memory

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:17.040
Because every time we recall it we're now in a different emotional state a different position different surroundings

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:18.720
We

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.720
Accurate memory does not exist

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:25.280
Right, you know what even even as we think we're remembering our earliest sexual experience

01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:28.080
You know if there was actually a camera they're filming it

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:30.560
We might find out it's completely totally different

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:34.400
Surrounding wise than we thought so every time we recall a memory

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:40.080
We're altering it. So our memories keep changing over a lifetime. So um

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:42.400
but what but

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:46.560
What happens at that trauma we're talking about and that what I call the cross wiring

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:54.320
That's happening at an emotional level and so it doesn't matter even if our memory is accurate in terms of you know, digitally

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:57.760
Accurate what what matters is emotionally

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:02.000
How we move forward with it and so now if you know

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:08.160
We've been a sexual creature since birth and all of a sudden something happens that sex is hidden

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:13.600
Well, I better keep it hidden from from here on out and we don't make that as a conscious decision

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.440
It's just an emotional roadmap that we start following

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.760
Hmm

01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:27.760
It's very very interesting. Okay. So we identified this and people are sitting listening to you and I talking very openly about sexual experiences

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.920
And they're going you're not supposed to do that

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:36.960
You're not supposed to talk openly about those things because they're going on their emotional wiring of how you're supposed to you know

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.280
Be about sex. Yeah. Well like the vw lupo opens all sorts of doors

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:46.240
Um three of them exactly egg precisely correct unless you can clamber out the back honestly, dude

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:50.640
I I and I remember how not far the passenger seat went back as well

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:54.400
I just thought this is what and you got to do in the passenger seat because of the steering wheel

01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:56.800
But you guys have the steering wheel on the wrong side of the car

01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:03.840
Well, speak for yourself. Look, we've gone through this litany of problems, right? This big big big big list and

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.800
We don't have enough time to

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:10.240
prescribe the panacea for all of the nice guys listening

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.720
given the fact that you've done

01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:14.560
so many

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:17.360
seminars coaching sessions working with people

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.680
What have you found if you were to give the biggest movers?

01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:23.920
of

01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:25.920
Rehabilitation for nice guys

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.040
I don't think i've ever used that exact word for it

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:31.840
What what what are the uh the practices?

01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:37.600
What are the places that they should focus on in order to start to embody themselves more honestly?

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:40.320
Okay, yeah be their authentic selves exactly

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.880
I'll just walk you through what I did number one. I tell people find safe people

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:49.280
Don't try to do this on your own. You didn't become a nice guy in social isolation

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:53.040
Don't try to get over it in social isolation

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:59.520
We have to have safe people to start releasing our shame to tell people I've got this story about myself and people go

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:04.400
That's not bad. That's not terrible at all. You're know, that's normal what you're describing

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:09.520
So we need safe people to support us release our shame perhaps mentor us

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.960
Encourage us help us face our fears. So I tell nice guys go find a coach therapist men's group. I love men's groups

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.640
do

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.640
A big chunk of my own personal

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:27.600
Rehabilitation in in men's groups. Uh, I was leading five men's groups a week when I was in private practice up in seattle

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:32.560
Um, I just I'm a believer so find men's group. Don't try to do this alone

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:36.640
How do you suggest to interject there? How do you know if it's a good men's group or a bad men's group?

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:44.400
That that's a good question and it is somewhat subjective because something a group you love might not work for me

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:53.680
When I started looking for something about all that existed at that time was the uh,

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:58.720
The robert blei methyl poetic go out in the woods beat a drum have the talking stick and say, oh

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:05.280
I did that I ended up in a 12-step program is where I started it not wasn't by choice. It just where I landed

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:10.800
Um, I got I got lucky. I landed and I was in a men's group led by a woman

01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:15.520
Around sexual shame who liked men and so that was good for me

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.960
I tried some other men's groups that I just never connected or resonated with

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:27.200
A core piece I would recommend whether you're looking for a coach a therapist a men's group

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:31.680
Is find somebody who leads it who's actually done their own work

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:37.440
You mentioned embodiment quite a bit somebody who's actually gone out worked on their own stuff

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:44.240
You know, I I became a therapist. I got my phd in marriage and family therapy at 29 years old

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:49.680
Started you know a few years later started doing, you know trying to do real therapy

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.320
I'd never been to therapy

01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:59.200
And you know, it wasn't till I got into therapy and men's groups and started working on my own

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:04.480
Toxic shame and my own anxieties and my own patterns that I could actually really help people

01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:09.760
So, you know, um, it doesn't hurt to check out, you know, ask the person

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:11.760
What's your journey?

01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:15.680
You know, we're we're if you worked on yourself and then just see do you connect with them?

01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:17.920
Let's usually go place do you connect?

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:25.760
So go go find a coach therapist men's group 12 step group something where you get to go start revealing you releasing toxic shame

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:30.880
Start being honest nice guys think they're honest or anything but honest

01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:33.600
I remember pretty early in my process

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:38.880
I realized almost everything I told my then wife was whatever won't rock the boat

01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:42.960
So I I told her I'm gonna work and be an honest whenever I catch myself

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:46.560
Making up a story to tell you I'm gonna come tell you

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:50.880
I was gonna lie to you. Here's the lie. I was gonna tell you. Here's the whole truth

01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:56.960
So I started doing that and actually I used to tell her her middle name ought to be overreact because that's

01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:02.560
What she did and every the funny thing was what actually just started telling her the truth about shit. She'd go, okay

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:07.280
Thanks for telling me that I'm glad you didn't lie to me and you know, whoa, that's different

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:12.000
You know when I was trying to get her not to overreact she did when I just told her the truth

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:18.640
Yeah, okay, don't lie to me. That was it. So work on being honest and again, we need safe people usually to do that

01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:22.000
Work on making your needs a priority

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:28.000
Sorry to ask yourself. What do I want? What's important to me? You know, am I do I do I need to go to the gym?

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:31.600
Do I need to go to the dentist? Do I need to take some time to relax?

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.640
Do I need to rest my eyes? Do I need to go read a good book?

01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:38.080
Do I you know, how do I get my needs met and how do I let people

01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:43.520
Help me get my needs met and how do I surround myself with people who want to help me get my needs met?

01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:46.960
Uh start working on boundaries

01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:53.200
That's that's a big one for nice guys is well, nobody grows into adulthood knowing how to set boundaries because

01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:56.400
Nobody teaches children how to set boundaries

01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:57.360
um

01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:03.360
Because in in the real world the big people get to do whatever they want to the little people and because we were all little people

01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:07.520
We never learned you could say no stop that i'm going to remove myself now

01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:11.200
So learn about boundaries. I was in my thirties

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.580
In my second marriage with a phd

01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:18.880
Before I had ever even heard of boundaries a therapist. I went to taught me about them

01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:25.360
So start working on boundaries and then I just I think the one other piece i'll throw out there that I think is just so fundamental

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:27.680
Especially for guys for nice guys

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:28.880
go

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:30.160
connect with men

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:31.040
Go

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:37.600
Build a tribe of men. I've had to do that a few times in my life about seven years ago when I got married down here in

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.360
Mexico

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:43.200
Not yet fluent Spanish my wife only speaks Spanish

01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:45.920
And i'm living in here working at home

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:48.720
I I had no guys in my life

01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:53.200
And I went seeking and found a men's program and joined it and now

01:45:54.720 --> 01:46:01.520
If you looked at my text messaging my calendars my email i'm on zoom i'm messaging with buddies

01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:04.480
all the friggin time and it just

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:10.160
It makes everything about my world better. I'm I'm more on point with with my work

01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:14.880
My relationship improved. I'm in better health. I'm happier

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:20.400
So build a connection with men. So there's about five things that are a pretty good start

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:24.240
Dr. Robert Glover ladies and gentlemen, Robert I

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:30.560
Adore your work. I think it's very much needed. It's so fascinating that it's been around for quite a while

01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:35.440
You know and and yet this single thread of guys being overly pliable

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:39.760
Of resenting despite the fact that they're playing the game correctly. They think that they're doing all the rest of it

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.400
is uh

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:48.240
It's so fascinating and I I've today's been phenomenal. Where should people go? They want to keep up to date with your work

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:49.440
You've got

01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:50.800
Trota the internet
