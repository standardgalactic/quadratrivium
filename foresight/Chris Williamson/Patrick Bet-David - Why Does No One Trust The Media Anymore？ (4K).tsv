0	6800	You say that you're useless to the world if you're not competing and you need enemies to drive you. Why?
8520	13160	I think most people who say they don't have enemies
13840	17480	They probably don't want to tell others they have the enemy or they don't want to disclose it
17480	20960	They're great poker players. I don't know a single person that doesn't have an enemy
22080	23680	Everybody does
23680	26880	We're we're very good at concealing our
27080	33680	Our insecurities our emotions our fears our wildest desires our
35480	39480	Enemies or comments that rub us the wrong way that wire us
40600	42600	We are very good actors
42600	47240	Incredible actors right now if you have a long time of talking to somebody and you kind of watch them closely
47240	51960	And the more they talk and then eventually you're gonna find some leaks. You're like, oh, I just found one right there
52040	57880	Boom, I found one contradiction right there. Boom. I found one and they're okay interesting. We all have a little bit of that
58720	65280	But I do think that when you study the people that do something very big. I'm not talking about small
65280	69000	I'm talking really really big. We're talking about some interesting people today
69160	73000	You and I have somebody we both respect a lot Robert Green his books
73520	78640	I'm sure you love his books. I love his books 33 strategies of war. I couldn't put it down for two years straight. I
79520	81520	listen to that book every day
81960	83680	in my car
83680	87880	Straight every day. It was on repeat for two years straight. Why though?
88680	91240	because I innocently got into sales and
91960	95200	I had a good time in sales and business after I got out of the military and
95680	98480	I wanted to be a bodybuilder and then I realized I'm six four
98480	102480	It's not gonna work for bodybuilding to win Mistro Olympia because everybody's five eight five nine five ten
102480	107560	Maybe five a lemon Ronnie Coleman, but the six four days are behind us even Luc Ferigno didn't win at that height
107880	110680	Arnold did and then when I got into sales and
111560	115080	Everybody was a fan then I started competing still a little bit of fan
115080	119080	But when I started the insurance company and then I started growing market share really
119680	122120	Then a lot of those people that were fans then started
122800	128920	Undermining and I said got it. This is how it works. You can't be this naive. You can't be this innocent
129760	132880	Competitions out there if you want to kind of go out there and take market share from others
132880	134080	You want to get bigger?
134080	138320	You can't expect for people to sit there and like everything you're doing. That's what I realized
138520	143680	You got to choose your enemies wisely people want you to do well. They just don't want you to do better than that. Yes
144440	145640	Yes
145640	148240	Yeah, it's interesting. There's this story of Churchill and
148840	153720	He's showing a young MP around the House of Lords in the UK
153720	159640	This is before World War two you can imagine that they're wandering through these dusty hallways over there's the
159920	162760	Toilets and over there's where we have a cigar and blah blah blah
162880	165640	Anyway, they go into the chamber they go into the House of Lords, right?
165720	172800	The difference actually the distance between the two front benches is the same distance as a longsword held out at arm's length
172800	178200	From both sides. She's a kind of a funny vestige of evidently what they were worried about in the Middle Ages
178200	181840	And they've just continued to update but they've never changed the distance of the front benches
182000	187200	Anyway, but this young guy who's probably full of testosterone and you know, he's finally he's here with Winston Churchill
187840	190560	He go in and this young MP starts just
190640	194360	Sticulating at the other side he keeps referring to them as the enemy
195320	200000	Churchill turns to me says that's the opposition dear boy. The enemy's behind you
201200	205920	And I love that story and the reason that I love that story is that it often reminds us that
207000	209000	symbolically we believe
209760	216760	That the biggest obstacle we have to overcome is out there and many times the call is coming from inside of our own house
216800	220720	I think that the worst enemy that many people have is the voice that's inside of their own head
220720	224680	Now this voice has probably maybe come from the outside world, but we've now internalized it
224680	230800	You know, we have become our own worst enemy in some regards. Yeah, and by the way, that's one of the enemies
230800	233920	That's one of the enemies and there isn't one is the famous
235160	239880	Matthew McConaughey speech that he's given. Hey one guy asked me who's the greatest actor in the world and he says hey
239880	243640	You know, I'll tell you and then you're like I want to meet the 35 year old version of me
243640	246000	And hey when I get to 35, you know, I want to make it 45
246000	250440	It's always looking forward to what that next better version of you is going to be but
250880	257000	At the end of the day, even Alexander one of his famous quotes is quotes is I have met the enemy it is I right and
257880	263560	Although that is one element of an enemy. That's great. We need that
265000	268800	Michael had it Brady had it Kobe had it, but
269800	272680	There's a there's a crazy
273800	278800	Psychologically you can call it, you know psycho competitor that
279600	284200	They're constantly in the search of recruiting their next enemy
285240	291840	It's it's like, you know, life is boring if I don't have my next target, you know
291840	297720	I'm almost you know bad for myself if I don't have the next target the next enemy
297760	302600	And if I choose it the right way, then I'm able to bring out a side of me. I've never seen before
302920	308840	What's the function of an enemy? What is the function of an enemy? What is the function of?
310320	313800	Fallen in love. Why do you need to fall in love? Why do you need to have a wife?
313800	317420	It's pleasurable. It's fulfilling. But what does it do to you though when you're in love?
318040	323280	You know, you know how they say when when a person is in love and they go and test their brains
323280	326960	And it's like somebody that's on drugs. You've seen this before you probably read this before, right? Okay
327560	329320	so
329320	331320	But what's the risk of love?
332320	333920	Heartbreak
333920	339360	Losing years of maybe you love the wrong person. Maybe they don't love you in return as much as you love them
339360	342840	Maybe you're gonna give more than they're gonna give you maybe a betrayal
343480	346680	Maybe it's an act. Maybe it's just good for the season
346680	349280	Maybe they're gonna change your minds if they really find out what you're out
349280	356320	There's a lot of risk to love, but why do we love? You know, it's a very unique relationship that risk is exhilarating
356360	358360	It's exciting, you know
359160	365960	Maintaining it. It's a lot of work. It's not easy. It's why nowadays most people don't want to get married nowadays
365960	371520	There's a movement of I don't want to get involved to getting married. I don't want to have kids. It's too risky
371520	374040	I want to live for myself. I don't want to have the
374880	381400	Responsibilities I don't want to be heartbroken. Okay, great. I think you know one time a friend of mine and I
381640	386000	Arash we're in Italy and I rented this place in
386640	390960	Tuscan, Italy, this is like 10 years ago and we're staying there and Arash and I when we're together
390960	395720	We like to debate and we debate about anything. It doesn't matter what the topic is anything, okay?
395920	401160	He's like the Middle Eastern Bradley Cooper too good looking of a guy one of those guys kind of like you're a good-looking guy
401160	402800	He's a good-looking guy
402800	405920	So we have a three-hour drive to Cinque Terre, okay?
405920	411000	It's a beautiful place you go to and it's a long drive to go to it. You know what we're debating about love
411000	413000	Here's what the question was
413600	419560	Can you love somebody you know define love for me says love is a feeling it's emotion
419560	422640	It's this it's a great. I said say you're in jail
423200	425200	Your wife is somewhere else
425600	430960	How does she know you love her? How do you show her love is love a verb is love a feeling is love a noun?
430960	432960	What happened this conversation right and
434400	435560	Then
435560	442360	You realize the risk of loving is worth it. I can't imagine live in life without having that love
443640	448360	It introduces you to a person you've not met before man a great enemy does that as well a
449440	456920	Formidable enemy is gonna introduce you to a person you've not seen before by the way could be ugly could be scary could be oh
457240	461160	My god, who is this person? Why are you acting like this? Why are you thinking like this?
461480	465520	So most of us when we come almost like that the movie venom
465520	468040	It's one of my son's favorite movie, right? The venom comes inside
468120	471080	There's a there's an ugly side to it if you lose control of it, right?
471080	476240	And you become reckless then you hurt people around you then you're actually not good for yourself. You're destroying your own life
476240	478080	That's why the key word is what?
478080	479920	Choose your enemies
479920	484920	Wisely, it's not it's not have an enemy. It's choose your enemies wisely
485080	490200	If I choose the right enemy and then I have this relationship with this enemy
490880	496680	Sometime it's a one-month enemy. It could be a one-week enemy could be a one-day enemy could be a lifelong enemy because it's yourself
496680	498680	because that's a permanent enemy and
499240	501240	Just like a love affair
501400	505640	There is an affair with this enemy. It's actually a beautiful thing. I
506400	510440	Love the idea of it bringing out a side of you that you didn't know
510680	515120	Bringing out a person inside of you that you want to wear existed. So I think there's a
516800	521560	There's definitely a function to get that into you come on crack it in there's definitely a function to
523040	525040	To people looking to be well balanced. Oh
527400	529400	Yeah
530280	535320	Delicious good wow fantastic. That's what I want to hear six months of taste testing
535320	538200	So I'm glad that it takes time to fly to Liverpool to do that
539200	541200	There is definitely a
541440	543440	culture on the internet of
543520	545520	people wanting to
545600	547600	ameliorate all of their difficult and
548040	552480	Uncomfortable emotions to transmute them into something closer to equanimity, right?
552840	558360	balance peace sanity and I've said this a lot and I think that I'm quite averse to
559200	565920	Conflict by nature. That's the way that I tend to operate. I often just bow out opt for peace
566520	567680	and
567680	569680	then
570000	571680	Two things changed
571680	575440	First off, I realized that I am leaving an awful lot of motivation on the table
575440	580180	Okay by not utilizing a very specific very potent kind of fuel
580800	585360	Because I was aware that over a long enough time span. I think it can be toxic
585360	590600	I think that if you're fueled by hate and distaste and fear and scarcity for long enough
590600	594200	It becomes something that damages you more than it helps you win
594440	598160	But it's unbelievably potent especially in times of war
598520	606640	The second thing that happened was I became a little bit more of a target for people's ire and distaste and that meant that the
608080	609680	underdog
609680	614040	Loving support that everybody has for the person that's on the come up
615520	619920	Dissolved a little bit and started to evaporate because people don't mind you doing well
619920	623840	They just don't want you to do better than them. You know when you're on the way up
623960	627560	Everyone roots for you because you remind them of their dreams and when you're at the top
628160	631120	Everyone tries to tear you down because you remind them of what they gave up on
631880	637280	So those two things changed now had a great conversation with Alex Homozy that really drove this home to me
637280	640640	Said use what you have and a lot of people have more pain than they do pleasure
641360	648280	Don't use it for too long 10 15 20 years like that's how you end up having a breakdown or some sort of dependency or addiction or vice
649280	651680	But it's potent so use it and I think that
652200	657720	The inside of enemies can bring out a side of you that you are not aware you want to where even existed is
658640	660400	Kind of like alchemy
660400	665200	Right. It's turning something that is both toxic and useless into something which is golden and your choice
666160	669560	Yes, and by the way your eyes. Okay. I'm looking at your eyes right now
670400	675000	Your eyes don't tell me a guy that is just doing this
675440	677960	To just have fun. Okay
678320	681480	Your eyes have a lot of fire in them. Okay, a lot of fire in them
682400	688240	You your eyes tell a story of maybe you have a crazy side a side inside of you
688240	693480	Okay, a side that maybe you keep inside. Okay, we're very few people maybe see
693760	699000	But that's why you're doing as well as you're doing. I walk into this place. I do a lot of podcasts
699000	704160	I walk into this place you chose a walk in. I'm like Sam. Where are we? He says honestly, I don't know
704160	705680	But I think we're at the right place
705680	710960	We walk in and I see why you do what you do and the amount of time and resources and your team putting into
711480	718520	Hands selecting a different set. We don't do that. So what does that tell me? You're maniacal your detail oriented
718840	723200	You got it. You're moving up right now on the podcast across the board competing with everybody
723440	727400	You have a vision. Maybe some of it. We know probably all of it. We don't know
727400	732040	Okay, some of it's kept even the smiles telling the story right now. You're a perfect example of this, right?
733000	738940	If you and I sit down we get the benefit I don't know if you read Elon Musk's recent book or not Walter
738940	739760	I think so not yet
739760	743680	No, I've heard from every single person that's even glanced at the blurb that you need to read it
743680	748320	You need to read it. You're gonna flip out. You're gonna love it. You'll appreciate it for a guy. That's wired like you
749440	754320	We get to judge Elon from the outside. Okay, why would somebody?
755480	759520	You sell a company for 180 million dollars. You take a hundred million dollars. You put it in a
760520	766840	Solar, whatever you take 70 and Tesla you put 10 in, you know, another company vice versa, whatever the structure
766840	772640	No, you put 100 million in SpaceX 70 million in in Tesla and 10 million you put it in solar
773360	775120	Then you're a billionaire
775120	779920	Then you want to do what you want to go to the next thing then boring company then you got Twitter
780240	786760	What for and you read a story in the book about his father on how his father was are you kidding me?
786800	793720	Oh, I mean if you some of the biggest people that we read about we watch movies about it's one of their two parents
794400	797600	That did something to them. I'm Tom Brady a
798360	800360	month ago we haven't met the event and
801000	808200	The the formula I see with a lot of people that do something biggest three things one at one point in their lives
808200	814440	They experience unconditional love because you need it. It's fuel. You have to have it even if it's just from one person
814440	822160	Okay, unconditional love means what you screwed up you went to jail. You got a DUI you got kicked out of school
822160	823760	You got expelled
823760	830200	Everybody ousted you and said you're a nobody you're not gonna mount to anything you're a loser. You're this but that mother
830200	832200	They're always said honey. I love you
833200	836480	You can do anything to lose this one person's love
837120	841400	One person. It's all you need. You don't need 50 of them. Just one unconditional love number two is
842040	844040	you need somebody who
845200	847200	brought
847200	850440	Unbelievable pain in your life that you loved
851160	855480	This is a person you and I loved that they destroyed our heart
856200	860640	We couldn't do anything to gain love from this person nothing
861480	867320	Perform talent. We love them go above and beyond give them money buy him gifts
867360	873480	Give them incredible experiences become buff have a six-pack drive a Ferrari have a Lambo own a penthouse
873720	878480	Have a yacht be best friends with the best athletes with billionaires no matter what you do
878920	882160	This person brought you so much pain. You can never win this person over
882560	886880	It is a battle your entire life try to win this person over you're never going to do it
886880	889440	It's not going to happen. Well, you need that person as well
889600	896240	You know what the last one is obviously choosing your enemies wisely you take a person that has those three combination by the way
897120	898760	very rarely
898760	902840	Will they ever tell you the entire reason very rarely will they?
903800	907840	Fully disclose everything some of them will take it to their grave with them
907840	912720	We will never know about it, but for someone to have the kind of a fire that goes
913240	918000	Yours beyond 99% of people would have stopped. What's the reason for it?
918320	922480	What else do you need? How many more accolades? How many more tens of millions of dollars?
922480	928280	How many more cars? How many more houses? How many more top charts on podcasts number one this? What's the reason for it?
929000	931000	You know, it's a
931240	937000	Again, we're not talking about everybody most people will listen to this whole concept of choose your enemies wisely and they'll say
937360	940680	That's hate. What a miserable life. What are this? What are that?
941000	949120	No, most people chose the wrong enemies the enemies they've chosen is about being entitled is about being victims about feeling sorry for themselves
949120	956560	And it's destroyed them the stolen stolen years away from their lives. So yeah, the way you're describing what you're saying
956840	962040	You know, you'll typically see a pattern with those three things of people
962760	969440	Who do something big they experience those three and unfortunately the reason why I like Musk's book is when you read it
969440	974120	You see the pattern with all three unconditional love mom and Kimball his brother
974920	976920	unconditional pain father
977120	979120	choosing his enemies wisely
979360	980880	industry
980880	987240	Conditional, you know guys who are like this is the way we do with NASA, you know governmental agencies
988120	992780	Censorship, you know establishment. He's just recruiting new enemies for himself every day
992780	997880	It's like bored. He needs more enemies and more enemies, but guess who's talking about him around the world
998760	1000760	Everybody is in a hundred years from now
1001280	1005760	Our kids our grandkids will look back and say and who was this Elon Musk guy
1006640	1010280	Unfortunately, we're not gonna be around to talk about who it was how we viewed him
1010440	1014840	But they're gonna be watching plenty of documentaries and movies about a guy like that because he chose his enemies wisely
1015200	1021200	Feels to me. I've got in my mind the image of Pac-Man, you know, when he is able to eat the ghost
1021200	1023080	Yeah, and the ghosts
1023080	1026400	since were previously a threat to him now become fuel and
1027200	1029200	that to me is I
1029840	1035440	learned the three most common traits of elite performers and it was
1036480	1041520	Acrippling sense of insufficiency a superiority complex and maniacal focus
1041520	1045800	Yeah, and I think that those three things map on to what you were just talking about there
1045800	1052000	Have you read this book? I've read the first half just so you know that part from your podcast is in the book. You're in the book
1053040	1059080	Did you know this or no? No, you're in your podcast is in the book. Those three things you just talked about. Okay. It's in the book
1059080	1064160	Hell, yeah. Yeah, so those three things, right? I'm scared that I'm not enough
1064800	1069480	I believe that I can do more. Yep. I have the impulse control to be able to keep me focused and keep me moving forward
1070920	1072920	What would you say to the people that say
1073200	1079280	What you're describing sounds an awful lot like a competitor. Okay. Yeah, what's the difference between a competitor and an enemy?
1079280	1081280	Yeah, it's not a competitor because to me
1081880	1084240	So so in the last 20 some years
1084240	1090840	I have worked my tail off to figure out a way of writing a business plan that I can teach others how to write a business plan
1090840	1092840	So when you go buy books on business plans
1093240	1095240	It's all boring
1095240	1100440	Technical it's for a fortune 500 company or somebody that wants to go raise capital and it's so
1101120	1104440	Complex and dense you will not think about a business planning book
1104960	1108160	That you're gonna walk away and here's how I can write a business plan
1108160	1111520	That's simple that I can look at it over and over and over again. Great. I'm good to go, right?
1111760	1118120	There isn't something like that out there. This is supposed to be a business planning book that turned into an
1118840	1121720	enemy's book so when I'm talking to the
1122160	1125040	CEO the the publisher of a portfolio, okay
1127040	1132360	Adrienne and we're going back and forth we had five hour zooms five one hour zooms
1132680	1137640	Just on the title and in many cases we would sit there for 15 minutes. No one's talking
1138200	1140960	We wanted what who won what he wanted what?
1141720	1146920	So they wanted to figure out a title that was a straight-up title like you know
1146920	1150880	Well, how to think and grow rich, you know, how to just stay very much of a business
1152320	1157320	Exactly something like that and then eventually I'm selling Adrienne. I'm simple. That's not what it is
1157320	1163840	This is much deeper than that. It has to do with enemies and eventually on the fifth time of choosing the title
1163960	1169040	Guess who finally says the title the book has to be choose your enemies wisely Adrienne does from portfolio
1169040	1171040	And I said that's the one it was a battle of attrition
1171040	1174360	It was a battle of attrition a few hundred of them, right?
1174640	1177800	But but it's an interesting concept when you're saying
1178480	1183160	Competition to me the 12 building blocks that I talked about in this book, you know
1183160	1188640	We have different categories because one side of the building block has to do with emotion
1188720	1193400	The other side of the building block has to do with logic and you read this when you were going through the book
1193400	1199640	So on the emotion side, you know, it's gonna move us. So for example, I mean, what skill says do I need to learn?
1199640	1201960	Well, I need to learn how to do podcasts how to ask questions
1202160	1208400	How to do research you told a Churchill story at the beginning with the sword the size and hey, your enemies are not ahead of you
1208400	1213280	They're behind you. Okay, you have to go find that story. That's content, right? Okay, so that means you're constantly reading
1213320	1217920	Why is this guy so good at what he does with content? Okay? He's very detailed. Look at the lighting
1217920	1220920	Look how he doesn't look at his sets. He's intentional. He's not winging it
1221320	1226600	Everything you're doing for the most part 95% of it can be replicated by somebody else
1226600	1231800	But the 5% is your wit is your interest is the curiosity. I did a person has it or they don't have it, right?
1231800	1239760	Okay, so yes, I can pick up those skills, but do I have your willpower? That's emotional. Yes, I can go study the competition
1239760	1244720	Let me see the top podcast is out there what they're doing. What is the category for politics for business for sports for comedy?
1245160	1248680	Yes, but enemies bigger study competition all you want
1248920	1253160	But enemies a complete different criteria that you're talking about you can have all the money in the world
1253720	1257800	Fantastic, that's finances. That's money. You can go raise money. There's plenty of companies that raise money
1258040	1262200	Quibi a few years ago raised two point thirty billion dollars from who all the big money guys
1262600	1267960	Everybody gave Quibi money. What happened to them Katzenberg make Whitman. Everybody behind it went out of business in
1269200	1271200	1962
1271360	1273360	1962 was a super-saving center
1273800	1278520	Which is the year where Target came out Walmart came out and Costco came out all the same year
1279280	1281280	1962 okay in
1281360	1283360	1962 when these companies came out
1284360	1290960	Kmart goes and raises a ton of money five years later Kmart has 250 locations
1291720	1295200	Walmart has nine locations five years later
1296080	1303320	Kmart on a leader's bulletin within five years guess who's winning Kmart's dominating all logical all numbers
1303880	1307520	Spreadsheet etc. Etc. You couldn't tell me the founder of Kmart
1307840	1311600	Who he is if I ask who's the founder came you're not gonna say mr. Kmart, right?
1311600	1317440	That doesn't make any sense. What happened to Kmart a few years ago Kmart goes out of business. They're no longer round
1317600	1322040	You know how many employees Walmart has around the world 2.3 2.5 million employees
1322240	1326480	Do you know Walton Sam Walton when the best books you can ever read is made in America?
1326480	1328960	It's 200 pages. He walks to you through how he built
1330080	1331200	Walmart
1331200	1335720	Do you know what his poorest kid is worth today poorest kid is worth 50 billion dollars today?
1335720	1339120	He's got four of them. Can you imagine these guys at Thanksgiving? They're like hey Johnny
1339120	1342320	I noticed man. You're only at 50 billion. Do I need to you know go for me?
1342320	1345840	You know raise some money for you now. It's gonna be all right. You're gonna make it through
1346080	1348880	What's the moral of the story the moral the story is
1349440	1355760	One is logic the other one is emotion emotion brings out a different set if it can be controlled madness
1356160	1357920	Controlled emotion
1357920	1363520	It's gonna go into a different gear that a normal person's not gonna have we'll get back to talking to Patrick in one minute
1363520	1365520	But first I need to tell you about element

1419520	1422000	Let's start competition. You're saying competitors, right? Okay. No problem
1422080	1424080	um
1424320	1425920	In high school
1425920	1430880	You can see somebody who was the best basketball player super competitive at that level say they're tall
1431120	1435600	They're six six. They can jump 40 inches. They have a quick first, you know step
1436160	1442240	They're very athletic in every way. They're the best athlete in the county even in the state for that position. No problem
1442880	1444240	They go to college
1444240	1445520	They can compete
1445520	1450240	But maybe they're coming off the bench average in 7.2 points a game three rebounds to assist no problem
1450720	1452480	They may not make it to the NBA
1452480	1455280	But let's just say he makes it to the NBA plays a year two years
1455280	1456560	Then he goes to Puerto Rico
1456560	1461840	Then he goes to spain then he plays in turkey then he plays in china 10 years later never comes back to the NBA
1462240	1465200	He's out now. He's an assistant coach in Puerto Rico or somewhere else
1466080	1470480	Then there's a guy that comes to the NBA. He competes. He's talented. He shows into work
1470880	1475360	He's a very good worker stable guy doesn't do the drugs doesn't do the alcohol
1475600	1478000	He hooks up with a lot of girls, but he doesn't get in the way
1478240	1481440	He doesn't respect, you know, he respects his teammates wives. He doesn't do anything
1481680	1484560	He plays for 15 years makes 200 million dollars good for him
1485600	1487600	Then you have the cycle competitor
1488320	1489120	who
1489120	1490240	Counts
1490240	1495360	The 55 kids ahead of him that were chosen as the best high school basketball player
1495840	1499360	And he's ranked number 56 and one by one by one
1500000	1503280	He targets every one of them until he takes him out his name is Kobe Bryant
1503600	1505600	Then you have michael jordan in 1984
1506000	1512800	Where the number one draft pick is a kimalajuan fair good a lot good selection for the rockets number two is sambui
1513280	1518080	I think portland picks him up or seattle picks him up. Number three is michael jordan. You pick me number three
1518880	1520880	Yes, what happens to michael?
1521680	1523440	these guys
1523440	1527760	michael was never the highest paid guy in the NBA the only time michael was the highest paid guy in the NBA was
1527760	1529760	The last year made 33 30 million dollars
1530080	1532800	Scotty pippin made more money in the NBA than michael jordan ever made
1533520	1537600	michael jordan today's worth 30 billion dollars scottie pippin is not what's the difference
1538080	1542400	It's a very different mindset scottie's a competitor, but he's not at michael's level by the way
1544160	1547120	It's very easy to criticize a guy like you who wants to compete
1548080	1550640	And maybe internally you don't want to compete you want to dominate
1551040	1555760	Maybe internally you want to show everybody. No, I'm going to be number one. Let's just say with him because professionally want to do this
1556880	1558880	totally cool
1559280	1563840	But there's a lot of other competitors out there that have good podcasts and they're doing a good job
1564160	1568640	It's just a different mindset when you have that enemy. By the way
1570400	1579440	Very rarely will those guys ever truly again reveal their top driver and the top enemy why?
1582160	1586880	Because it's it's it's an element of insecurity. Yeah, it's a signal level of status
1586880	1591600	It is it's it's and it's also I don't want to give the other person credit power
1592160	1596320	I don't want to give that other person more power than the person thinks they have you don't have power
1596400	1601440	Or because somebody may be like, oh, I'm your enemy. I control you exactly
1601840	1606000	Well, when it's a part of the come-up story. Yeah, it's romantic
1606560	1610960	Right. It's it's uh, it's grassroots. It's what's keeping you
1611600	1617680	Going look at look at how I was mistreated by my first high school coach. They didn't see the I'm going to prove it to them
1618320	1619360	That's
1619360	1621360	a beautiful origin story
1621600	1623360	age 20
1623360	1624880	age 45
1624880	1627520	That just sounds like someone who can't get the chip off his shoulder. Yeah
1628480	1633680	So yeah, I think it's it's interesting how the tools that got you here aren't the ones that will get you there
1634480	1639680	And how the strategy this is again one of the reasons why continuing to rely on
1640240	1645600	Resentment and bitterness and the chip on your shoulder and enemies for too long becomes a very toxic fuel
1645680	1648480	And it's also importantly optics are very very important
1649120	1651120	It's a signal of low status
1652000	1656640	Okay, you brought I don't disagree when you brought up a story of Churchill, right? Okay
1657360	1661760	The world is weeks away from all speaking german
1663040	1666240	Okay, if we lose the war the guy wins no problem
1667200	1668960	chamberlain
1669040	1671760	Cannot hold it together and the story about
1672400	1675920	How the only way Churchill said he was going to come back is for chamberlain to come and beg him
1676800	1678080	The only way
1678080	1683440	Does it sound like something Churchill would do by the way? Absolutely. Yeah, Churchill sat there and said, okay
1683600	1687520	He has to come and ask me because chamberlain sent other people he said no no no no no
1688000	1690000	Only one person
1690000	1692000	Has to come look at me face to face
1692640	1698160	And say you can do a job. I can't do come back and help us think about
1698800	1700800	Think about that now
1701360	1705840	Visualize that scene we can see it in a movie or we can read in a book and by the way
1706480	1709920	Say 50% of it is true. The other 50% is true, right?
1709920	1713520	The other 50% is a lie and it's like build up mythical over generations, right?
1714160	1716960	I believe that Churchill would want to hear it from
1718000	1725920	A chamberlain. Have you heard of Churchill's ministry of ungentlemanly warfare? No, so this is a phenomenal book that everybody can go and read
1726160	1727280	uh
1727280	1729280	Before the second world war
1729760	1735280	It was considered ungentlemanly to use guerrilla style tactics and in fact one of the
1736400	1741120	British politicians said something to the effect of if this is what it takes to win the war
1741200	1743360	I am prepared to lose they were
1744480	1746480	The brits saw
1746480	1751360	anything shy of gentlemanly conduct in war as a loss even if it resulted in a win
1752080	1755680	And Churchill came in and changed that he was the one that changed that culture
1756000	1759680	So he puts together this crack squad of eccentric weirdos
1760000	1762320	One guy invents the limpid mine, right?
1762320	1767200	Which you can descend to depths and then it'll attach using magnets and it'll blow things up another group
1767600	1774400	Develop what is the uh predecessor to the sas another group are working on disguises and and guerrilla tactics to disrupt
1774960	1780240	Infrastructure as the german advance is trying to move forward. Uh, so yeah, Churchill was prepared to play dirty
1780480	1784320	But you know, you look at the tactics that were used
1784480	1790480	They only came about because of one man who legitimated it and and he said we will do whatever it takes to win
1790800	1792960	Now, here's the thing when you hear a story like that
1793760	1798480	Um, somebody may say well, you know, what a what a what a cold-blooded bastard?
1799200	1801280	Oh my god, no wonder people hate him
1802320	1804320	No wonder he is who he is
1804480	1808720	Where many president moved the bust of Churchill in the white house of wins that take this out
1809120	1814080	So I don't represent what he represents. Everybody acts all hard, right?
1815200	1817200	We can hate a Churchill during peacetime
1817760	1819520	but during wartime
1819520	1822320	You you beg for a Churchill to rise up
1823200	1826320	wartime leaders like Churchill you only appreciate during
1827040	1827840	wartime
1827840	1831920	There's a really interesting insight from evolutionary psychology here. There's two types of leadership
1832000	1837360	One is from dominance and the other is from prestige, right? One is uh more authoritarian
1837440	1843360	It's tyrannical. It's very aggressive. The other is uh more altruistic. It's uh the
1845280	1848080	The rise to power is denoted
1848880	1854960	It's spread through the group everybody chooses together that this is someone who we all believe has the skills and
1855680	1861200	The dominance is not the same and there are specific times when you want dominance and when you want prestige
1861520	1863520	And in times of conflict you want
1863520	1868240	Dominance sure sure you could say it in business. It's startup versus when it's more established, right?
1868560	1872320	But here's also the thing like the part where you got to give a lot of credit to steve jobs
1872960	1875360	steve jobs had a startup mentality
1876000	1879600	and then he took that to the company and then he hires
1880640	1884960	You know his uh scully that comes in from pepsi and he says you want to sell sugar
1885040	1887600	Can you know water for the rest of your life or you want to change the world?
1887920	1891200	He brings him in then he ends up being the reason to fire jobs
1891680	1893680	Jobs leaves goes builds Pixar
1894320	1898960	Sells it to disney most of his wealth is tied to disney not at apple then he comes back
1899680	1905440	And he realizes that style of leading is not going to work to take the company to the next level when he comes back to apple
1905920	1910480	The first phone call he says he says the idea of thinking microsoft is the enemy is behind us
1910480	1911680	We can't think like that anymore
1911680	1917200	This is what steve job says and he goes to microsoft and he gets 300 million dollars from microsoft
1917680	1923840	To invest into apple and these guys hated each other microsoft came out in 76 apple came out in 77 a year apart
1924160	1927600	And everybody was always comparing the two together bill gates ended up being much richer than
1928080	1931760	steve jobs, but steve jobs was admired way more than
1932400	1934400	Bill gates. So what does this mean?
1935040	1937040	The individual has to
1937040	1939040	Evolve like you have to also
1939280	1944320	Recreate yourself as you're going through this the same enemy that drives you when you're 22 years old
1944560	1947920	Should not be driving you at 32 years old or else you haven't matured
1948240	1950720	You should also out matured that enemy
1951280	1957200	And then 32 something else should be driving you then 42 then 58 and 63 then 75
1957760	1960800	But you are going to have those love affair with those enemies
1961440	1962480	That's a love affair
1962480	1967920	You had an affair with this enemy over an eight year span over a 13 year span over a six year span over a six month span
1968480	1973600	But you know, there is truth in the idea of you still being driven by that enemy
1973920	1976720	18 years after you beat that enemy 13 years after you beat that enemy
1977280	1983760	Someone who I think is particularly good at creating enemies from modern pop culture and our industry is bench of hero
1984000	1989040	Okay, what do you think about what he's doing at daily wire from an enemy perspective and and generally
1989280	1993200	You talked about recently with his feud with Tucker Carlson or period everything overall
1993840	1994880	um
1994880	1998720	I think Tucker's a true believer. I think Tucker is not somebody that
1999520	2002320	If he's doing it intentionally to get under your skin
2003040	2008720	Let's say that's 20 percent. Let's say it's 10 percent because he's witty and he's smart and he's sharp
2009440	2012800	Tucker or ben i'm sorry ben ben Shapiro. So you're talking about right? Yeah
2013040	2016880	Let's say ben is doing that 10 or 20 percent intentionally to get under your skin. Okay
2017600	2022720	But this guy at a young age wanted to be supreme court. Just you know, he's been wanting to be that for a long time
2023040	2027920	This is not a regular guy. I think at 12 or 13 years old. He performed in front of a couple thousand people
2028560	2034560	His level of intelligence of how early on he got a degree went to college 15 16 years old that all the stuff that he did
2035040	2036000	so
2036000	2038000	He's 100 true believer
2038560	2040560	Does he have an element that he can
2040720	2044720	Talk to somebody and say I can murder you in a debate right now if you really want to go there. Yes
2044720	2050000	He has that element as well. Yeah, does he have a side of him that's a maybe a bully type a little bit? Sure
2050400	2054560	Well, don't forget during school. He was very heavily bullied himself very heavily bullied
2054640	2058720	But that's what happens typically to people like him, but that may be
2059680	2061680	the number one driver
2062000	2067520	That he's continuing because he wants for the rest of his life for those bullies to talk about that ben Shapiro used to be a
2067600	2068720	Classmate
2068720	2073520	What makes him go out to pace that he goes you think it's just all these other guys that we see there's no way
2073680	2077120	You think he would ever tell us you think his own family knows that highly doubted
2077200	2079360	It's to himself many of these people that he has in his life
2079760	2084000	Anybody that goes at that pace like tucker Carlson today. I don't know if you saw the approval
2084000	2089440	He got I think they got 150 million dollars today from some organization who did took his organization
2089520	2093120	Yeah, so finally today the ward is out that he raised money. It's it's a hundred
2093200	2095440	It's a big amount of money that he finally raised today
2095920	2101200	Who's his enemy? He's got a very easy enemy. He's got fox news former employer as an enemy
2101520	2104640	He's got a lot of political people as an enemy people with silo some as an enemy
2104800	2109360	You know how many enemies tucker got you think tucker needs another 300 million dollars that he has in a bank account
2109360	2110800	I highly doubt so
2110800	2117520	He's doing it for a complete different reason because he wants to give the middle finger to five 10 15 different people in his life
2117680	2120000	You just sense it with tucker and by the way, you know, it's wild right now
2120480	2127520	Ben Shapiro went after tucker this week. What happened because of uh, uh, israel tucker's position where he says we should focus on
2128160	2129600	a hundred thousand
2129600	2135200	Uh, uh, people in america that are dying from fentanyl not focused on what's going on in israel and gaza and ben Shapiro says
2135680	2139760	You know, we can chew gum and walk at the same time specifically from the moral standpoint
2139760	2145840	We can handle two different moral issues, but you know, they're going back and forth whether it's a seasonal thing or not
2145840	2149280	That's a complete different, you know competition that we're talking about. I suppose
2150480	2154320	Uh, how would you say enemies of convenience are sometimes good for optics?
2154640	2160320	You know, what have we just seen dylan danis logan paul ksi tommy fury jake paul tommy fury
2161120	2162880	logan paul
2162880	2164880	jake paul and
2166400	2168400	Who's the jiu-jitsu guy stocked in slaps
2169280	2171680	Diaz, thank you. Nate Diaz love that guy
2172400	2178880	Enemies of convenience. Yeah, you know like nothing gets people's tongues wagging more than you creating a little bit of a feud
2179440	2181040	on the internet
2181040	2182560	dc, uh
2182560	2186080	They announced yesterday speaking of feuds and speaking of disney
2186560	2192240	That the daily wire are going to do that own version of snow white with brett cooper starring in snow white. I saw that
2192960	2196960	I saw that I mean that to me is you know, largely a
2197920	2200800	declarative statement of culture war on what's happening with
2201520	2206800	Children with children's movies, you know, it's synthesizing down all of the little tangential issues that have been included
2207120	2210640	Is there anything to do with the push toward the sort of books that are in school? Is it us?
2211040	2217840	You know denying this uh rachel's ziggler ziggler throwing snow white under the bus like she doesn't have a prince charming
2217840	2220560	She has a stalker. We don't need that. What do you think about that?
2221840	2226000	I think that it is a very dangerous lesson to teach young girls that
2227040	2230320	Boys that show interest in them are dangerous and to be avoided
2230480	2233280	I think it makes for a generation of fragile
2234000	2236000	narcissistic fearful young girls
2236240	2240720	That I wouldn't want as a daughter and that I don't want as a mother. You know what a perfect example that is
2242080	2247200	The movement of feminism is the ultimate example of not choosing your enemies wisely
2248560	2251360	You chose men as being the enemy
2252480	2255920	40 years later 50 years later you're 65 years old
2256560	2258560	Single not married no kids
2259440	2261920	You're living in an apartment or a condo with a dog
2262640	2268160	Or a cat that that's all you ever talk about and you're lonely and you're sitting there saying
2268800	2270080	I was wrong
2270080	2272080	Men are not the enemy, but guess what?
2272640	2277040	That movement stole 50 years of your life. You know how painful that is
2278240	2281680	What what she's doing right now with the messaging she's given and then getting out there and saying well
2281680	2283440	I don't want to be able to have to do this. No, you know
2284160	2287040	That's not necessarily going to be that way nowadays, you know, women don't need that anymore
2287040	2291440	It's a completely different era right now. We're talking about and to do this at a hundred your anniversary of disney
2291680	2292640	Yeah
2292640	2293600	Really
2293600	2299200	With what waltz and many of us I remember living in iran watching disney cartoons translated in farce
2299920	2301920	Literally in farce
2302000	2307360	It's it's very weird when you watch it in farce because the language is a rough language, you know, you watch pinocchio
2307920	2312080	In farce it's not as appealing right, but we grew up with this stuff
2312160	2315200	You know, we grew up with watching these cartoons to see that taking place
2316240	2322240	Is uh, if you ask me, it's absolutely pathetic, but you're seeing how many back-to-back-to-back flops disney has right now
2322400	2327600	Yeah, and it's not a good look. Um, by the way, the buyers who want to buy disney. They're loving this
2328480	2332400	Apple's one of the most qualified buyers. They they hope disney makes five more flops
2332880	2336720	apples sitting there saying make five more flops. Iger, please by the way
2337680	2344160	Have you read the ride of a lifetime by bob Iger? Okay another interesting guy what he did with a 38 career at abc
2344160	2347040	Obviously he's been there a lot longer, but when you read the book the first 38 run
2348320	2350320	To be one of the best power brokers
2351040	2353440	Then to finish your career up the way you're doing right now
2354080	2355440	very
2355440	2360800	Very bad way of finishing it. He's not an idiot, right? You don't have the excuse of not knowing
2360880	2365680	He is for what a point you just made he is 100 not an idiot
2365920	2370320	This guy was about to run for president bob Iger was gonna he was one of the guys that everybody was trying to get to
2370320	2374880	Run for president him and oprah. They were supposed to be this literally. This was the conversation
2375520	2379600	so he also ended up choosing the wrong enemies and
2380240	2381920	The wrong allies
2381920	2387120	Not realizing your best allies are parents. You're losing parents who have been watching this for years
2387680	2391520	You're losing the people that this is a legacy product
2392400	2396800	It's another example of a complete screw-up that's going to come out of discount for somebody else like apple
2397040	2400560	I mean look at to go back to ben and what jeremy are doing over the daily wire
2402720	2408320	Hershey's do a campaign that they don't like within five days. They've released their own chocolate bar
2409760	2412400	That shaving company does something they don't like within
2413040	2417040	24 hours, maybe they filmed a video with a mclaren for jeremy's razors
2417760	2421760	They don't like the way that's fantastic commercial by the way. Well done. Jeremy's got jeremy's got skills
2422000	2425760	I listened to him and shepiro talking about the fact that originally jeremy was the talent
2426480	2430880	And ben was the money man and the the the uh data guy behind the scenes
2430880	2435600	Do you know zack levi? I think it's him exactly by the actor who played the uh, what is the movie?
2436320	2437840	the the
2437840	2438880	the
2438880	2443760	Super hero for kid movies. What is the guy's name? Ben 10? What is it? Ben 10? No?
2444240	2449360	It's a recent one. You're the one with like yeah four kids. Yeah, trust me. I've seen this movie a couple times
2450080	2454560	He played kurt warner a recent movie that came out the american underdog. He played kurt warner
2455360	2456480	him
2456480	2457200	and
2457200	2460400	Jeremy used to have a production company apparently 10 15 years ago
2460720	2464160	And zack ended up being a big time actor in hollywood doing very good for himself
2464800	2469200	And by the way, jeremy is another great example of a guy that's got enemies. Just look at his eyes
2470000	2472000	When you talk when you hear jeremy speak
2472240	2476800	You see the fire built for enemies. He's got enemies and he wants to take those enemies out
2476800	2484000	But that's why I thought the daily y was an illustrative example because they are as far as I can see largely a company built on
2484720	2490080	Identifying enemies, you know, they're very much in opposition to ideas that they don't like to movements
2490080	2492880	They don't like to people that they don't like and uh
2493920	2497040	Yeah, man, I mean it's you have to be built for that
2497280	2503280	You really really do need to be built for it. And it certainly seems to me that what ben and what jeremy are doing over there is
2504480	2506240	Purpose built to be
2506240	2511920	The anti this the anti that and a lot of the time it's new movements that they don't just they don't agree with
2512960	2515760	The market's gonna prove if the concept is gonna work or not
2515840	2519760	And if it can't sustain because if it's a built to solve concept, they're gonna be they're gonna succeed
2520320	2526080	But can somebody else come and pick up that concept and continue with that with the same level of fire?
2526720	2531520	It's gonna take a couple decades to figure that part out. It's interesting to think, you know from from our side
2531840	2536880	When you see those rachel ziggler interviews and she's saying courting is stalking
2537360	2543520	Um a girl doesn't need to be saved by a prince. You know, she's busy thinking about how she can fulfill her own dreams
2543520	2546000	And becoming the woman that she always knew that she could run and so forth
2546480	2548480	You think a lot of people are
2549120	2551120	Is that really the you know the highest
2552000	2556160	Manifestation is that real self-actualization for young women nowadays?
2556160	2560400	That's the question they ask and you're totally right that look ultimately the market will choose
2560960	2565440	There's no question about it. The market will choose the market is brutal. You know, you know, it's a great thing about
2565440	2571600	It's always right. It's always right, you know, you can you can say well, let me tell you I'm the best bodybuilder in the world
2571920	2576880	Yeah, okay. Look at your calves. Yeah, good luck. You go put those a little skimpy, you know
2577840	2579440	Shorts on and see what your
2579440	2584000	You know legs look like now. You're not as good as you think you are you're full of it. Yeah market is brutal
2584640	2588240	podcast business concepts investments drinks
2588960	2592480	You know alcohol books you write when we first wrote
2593120	2597040	When I first wrote your next five moves and we launched at august of 2020
2597280	2598960	This is during the peak of kovat
2598960	2602320	My publisher simon and schuster asked and says so how do you think the book's gonna do?
2602640	2605600	How you gonna judge the book me and greg dinkin are talking I said
2606080	2608880	If the book is doing well three years from now, it was a good book
2608880	2612320	You can have a great marketing campaign the book does well the first 30 60 90 days
2612880	2614880	But is the book selling three years later if it is
2615600	2617600	That's a great book because the market will tell you that
2619360	2621360	Yeah, very interesting to think about how
2622480	2623840	optics
2623840	2624880	and
2624880	2627440	There are ways to game the system and I think people are very
2628800	2630400	They're hyper aware of this
2630480	2632480	They understand that there are
2632960	2634960	People who have managed to use
2635360	2642640	Tactics and hacks to get themselves into a position that they maybe didn't quite deserve that the legitimacy of the product the book or whatever it is
2642960	2644960	the person who
2645680	2649600	Maybe uh when megan markles autobiography comes out perhaps people would
2650160	2654960	Accuse her of doing something like this, right? It's not to do with the actual product. It's to do with the positioning
2656160	2658160	And sometimes that does work
2658480	2660320	but ultimately
2661120	2663760	Form is temporary and class is permanent
2664560	2666560	navals got this great quote where he says
2666720	2667520	Um
2667520	2669520	Karma is just people repeating their beliefs
2670080	2672880	Actions and behaviors until they finally get what they deserve
2673360	2675760	You just roll the dice you keep rolling the dice, right?
2675760	2678800	Every single time every single thing you do the way that you interact with the uber driver
2678880	2683440	The way that you pay or don't pay the bill or invoice that you've got every tiny little thing each time
2683840	2688000	Is an opportunity for your true nature to come up and people just keep on rolling the dice
2688640	2693360	Keep on rolling the dice and then every so often someone hits double one and you go. Oh, there we go
2694560	2700000	But it's temporary you can't do permanently megan merkel whether her motives are really because she loves
2700720	2706000	The prince and it's like harry. She's in love with them or she's using the power to bully and
2706640	2708640	Get what she wants out of it
2708800	2713920	The market is brutal. Look what happened to amber herd for how many years did everybody think?
2714000	2718880	You know johnny depp was a bad guy for how many years? Oh johnny depp was an abusive
2718960	2722240	You know relationship all this up and then they start showing the clips
2722960	2726080	The videos and johnny's comfortable. Would it be in public?
2726720	2728720	and all of a sudden
2728960	2730480	180
2730480	2733040	The world is like what an asshole
2733840	2735120	She is
2735120	2739120	Not him. I love johnny the next thing you know the love affair was like
2739600	2745920	How many more men are going through like johnny is and then how many women said she ruined it for women who were actually abused
2746560	2753440	So yeah for longest time. Oh my god crying is so such a so difficult time what he was so when he hit me
2754000	2755440	We fell for it
2755440	2759840	But we will only fall for it temporarily not permanently the market will reveal eventually
2760480	2766080	Hopefully yeah, I again man form is temporary classes permanent and people will ultimately get what they deserve
2766240	2769280	Uh when it comes to the courting is stalking
2770400	2772400	Culture that we have at the moment
2772640	2774640	You've got a daughter. You've got young sons
2775120	2778400	You also spend some time undervalutainment talking about
2779040	2781520	Intersexual dynamics and what's going on between the sexes
2782080	2788160	What do you make of the current dating scene for men and women and why do you think it's being demonized in some ways?
2788560	2792640	From what perspective from I think that there is an anti dating culture at the moment
2793040	2799360	I think that men and women are being encouraged to be treated as equals. Uh, sorry as adversaries not as equals, right, right?
2800000	2804480	Um, I think it's transactional today. I think it's easy today
2805120	2811840	I think the swipe right community is it's friday night 11 o'clock. Let me swipe right. I'm gonna use 20
2812320	2816800	Someone's gonna get back to me if they swipe right and they so and typically I would go after an eight and a half nine
2816800	2819680	But it's friday night. I'm gonna go do a six and a half seven. No one's gonna know
2820000	2825280	I'm gonna invite her back to my place. She knows if she's on tinder. I'm not on bumble. Whatever these dating apps are
2826080	2828720	And so it's transactional strategic
2828720	2835520	No one's gonna know and literally not a lot of people are gonna know you can really run through 20 40 50 100 nowadays and it's not a
2836480	2838080	Big deal. Okay
2838080	2843040	So what does that do? Whatever is too easy to come you devalue it. You don't value it that highly
2843680	2846000	You know my era you had to court
2846480	2851520	You had to prospect you had to have scripts. You had to build relationship. You had to follow up
2851520	2856480	We didn't have these types of things to do. We had my space the last time I was single. There was my space
2856960	2858960	Okay, I DM'd uh
2859280	2863040	My wife on my space my wife and I knew each other for five and a half years
2863600	2868640	Eventually we're in palm springs for the first time. She's single. I'm single ever for five and a half years
2868880	2870880	We're both single
2871440	2872480	And
2872480	2874480	You know we go on a date first date
2875040	2877440	PF Chang's December 29 of 2007
2878000	2881760	Used just when PF Chang used to be good when they had their uh, their their noodle soup
2881760	2887520	They don't have it anymore used to be they took that away phenomenal item on the menu. I'm convinced they they fell apart after that
2888160	2891040	So anyways, we go to well PF Chang's by the way, if you're watching bring it back
2891120	2895520	It was actually a very good item on the menu. So we go on a date. There's magic
2896000	2899520	She's smiling. I'm smiling. You know the smile. That's kind of like I'm happy to see you
2900240	2902960	And then it's midnight where the last people left at PF Chang's
2903600	2906640	You know waiter comes up to me and he says what's going on
2907120	2912160	I said, you know, my wife wants to follow divorce. She doesn't want to be with me anymore. So your wife why?
2912960	2917840	Yeah, I come from a different religious background and her family's convinced we got to split up and he has no clue
2917840	2919840	We're not married. We're just on our first date
2919840	2924720	He sits down for 15 minutes convincing her to stay with me if you love him stay with him
2924720	2926400	It was a beautiful, you know
2926400	2930880	Seeing that we have we go in the car she goes home the next day I take her we go do stairs in Santa Monica
2931440	2934320	We go to church. We go to earth cafe in Santa Monica
2934880	2935840	Then we go to boarders
2935840	2941520	I buy her book on our second date called 101 questions to ask before you get engaged on our second date by norman right
2942400	2947200	She's like, what's this? I said, I'm not looking for a girlfriend. I'm looking for a wife. I'm 28 at the time
2947920	2952160	Uh, I said, I know exactly what I want. I've already done this exercise with three other girls
2952320	2954080	If you want to go through it great
2954080	2958400	You need to answer the questions. Let's meet up when you're ready and let's go through it week later
2958720	2962800	Six hours at her place one by one by one each question we go through
2963280	2966880	I said, this is somebody I can date and by the way, it's ugly because you got to talk about everything in the book
2968000	2969840	so today
2969840	2972160	That's not it anymore today. It's too
2973200	2977840	Risky today. It's you don't have access to that anymore today percentages are coming out where
2978480	2983440	marriages from dating sites have the least chance of working out versus marriages where you meet somebody through a referral
2983440	2988160	Where you say pat I've known mary for seven years. I think you and her should talk not know what's going to happen
2988160	2992080	Let me set you guys up. Let's take our girls and do a double day. Cool. Hey, I kind of like her
2992080	2995920	This is good. Well, you're telling me seven years. I've only seen her be with one guy larry five years
2995920	2998800	He was an asshole then she's been with this other guy two years, but she's single now
2999280	3001440	Now I have some kind of a history I'm dealing with right
3002880	3007520	So it is a different climate now with kids. It's a different story on how you raise him
3008880	3010480	my
3010480	3012480	10-year-old son he's he's been
3013040	3017440	He's had a girlfriend since he was five years old literally at a birthday party at five years
3017440	3021280	So he's making out with this other girl at this they've embossed they've embusters. I'm like babe
3021280	3025200	What is going on his mom is asking me, you know, our kids are kissing. I said, well, I got a son
3025200	3027760	You got a daughter. You may want to stop your daughter, but I'm not gonna stop my son
3028480	3032320	So she's like well guys guys. No stop stop. They don't even know what's going on
3032880	3036000	So there's you need to have the conversation with kids early today
3036640	3041520	Uh, I remember having conversation with my boys when they were six and five in the shower and I said, okay
3041520	3047360	We need to have this conversation together. What's that? Okay, stand up. That's your dangling. That's his dangling
3047440	3049120	This is my dangling
3049120	3052800	Only you get to play with your dangling one day. You're gonna find a girl
3053360	3055280	That's gonna play with your dangling till then
3055840	3059280	God gave you that dangling for only you to play with your dangling now. You got to see how they're looking at me
3059280	3065360	By the way, they're looking at me like this and my wife leaves quickly. She's like, babe. This is unconscious, babe. You can leave
3066000	3067520	So we have that conversation
3067520	3070960	I think you need to have the conversation today because most parents are on middle eastern
3070960	3072960	They don't have those types of conversations
3072960	3075760	No one's talking about sex and condoms and all this kind of stuff
3076240	3078560	You need to start early but the dating scene today
3079680	3082560	Very very different than what it was when I was single
3083040	3089600	Uh, I if I wanted to go date today and find a wife my approach would be very different than what most people are doing today
3091040	3091680	Very different
3091680	3093440	We'll get back to talking to patrick in one minute

3181360	3186080	Okay, you're telling me about dean and what dean does he's been with you two years three years?
3186160	3191360	What you said 2,500 episodes and how many uh, uh 700 episodes two and a half thousand videos

3196400	3202400	Okay, if somebody works with you for six years, what are they gonna learn about you your temper your expectation?
3202720	3204160	Hey boys, are we ready?
3204160	3210240	This is all standard and expectation the expectation that you have that is a reflection of he likes working with you
3210240	3213360	Why does he like working with you? I don't know but you do something right for him to want to work with you
3213360	3217520	And then you told me what you're doing with them structure. That's private stuff that you told me
3218240	3220240	So you watch people you watch
3220880	3227680	Values principles you watch how they treat people you watch how people treat them you watch how people respond to them you watch
3228480	3234720	How they are with powerful people you watch how they are with regular average day-to-day people you
3236800	3237840	You look for that today
3237840	3244720	It's not the cars the the lambos the ferrari's the houses all that stuff. By the way, i'm a capitalist and I love all that stuff
3245600	3246480	but
3246480	3248480	I like that stuff because
3248480	3251200	Different reasons. I enjoy the game. I'm a kid
3252560	3257360	I'm turning 45 tomorrow. I'm 44 today for the last day tomorrow. I'll be 45
3257920	3260880	But there's an element of childlike stuff that brings out
3261360	3265840	The 14 year old kid when I look at a baseball card. I'm a kid when I look at a baseball card
3265840	3269200	The average person's like who cares about baseball cards. That's a different element, but
3270800	3275840	The relationships the way they treat people values and principles what they value
3276400	3278400	you look for those types of things and
3279200	3282080	Eventually enough will be revealed the more you pay attention
3282640	3283760	That's one of the byproducts
3283760	3289440	I think that is dangerous sometimes of people who play the game that they get captured by the game and they forget that it is a game
3289760	3292400	And they see the game as reality
3292720	3296880	They don't realize that there is something which is supposed to be deeper which is hidden below the surface
3297200	3299200	So I did rogan's show last year
3299280	3303120	And I listened back to the episode he said something on it that I really wanted to dig into
3303600	3309040	And he listened back I listened back and and pulled this this really really powerful insight for me
3309040	3311040	It was one of the most powerful things I learned last year
3311600	3313280	and he said
3313280	3316960	Just because something is hard to obtain does not mean that it is valuable
3318560	3324320	Just because something is hard to obtain doesn't mean it's valuable. Correct. Yeah, just because it's difficult to get
3324800	3326400	Doesn't mean that it's valuable
3326400	3329040	Look at the car. He's arriving. Look at the watch. He's wearing. Look at the girl
3329040	3332720	He's with these things were hard to obtain so you presumed that they were valuable
3332800	3337680	But you didn't realize that what's genuinely valuable are friendships and relationships
3338080	3341840	And a comfort and a confidence in yourself and peace of mind and sanity
3342240	3345760	And being able to positively impact the people around you. So it got me thinking
3345840	3347920	I've been really sort of reflecting on this over the last year
3348960	3351600	And I did some research into the history of the pineapple
3352320	3353120	so
3353120	3356320	1492 christopher columbus lands on the island of guadalupe
3356720	3360160	And for the first time ever a westerner sees a pineapple and you look at it
3360160	3363920	It's kind of a royal fruit that's got this stupid crown on its head and he writes in his journal
3363920	3368000	He describes the taste of a pineapple if you've never had a pineapple before you blow your head off
3368000	3372240	You know if you haven't got processed I remember the first time I had a pineapple. Yes, it's insane
3372320	3376000	Of course, anyway, they take a shipload literally back to
3376880	3378880	the prince of spain
3379040	3381040	Prince aragon the second
3381360	3387760	Take this entire shipload back one of them makes it that isn't rotten and the prince is allowed to eat it
3388880	3393120	And again almost gets this sort of mythical quality to it the pineapple
3393600	3396720	Very quickly the british quite rightly so they
3397360	3401680	They start to see it as this symbol of opulence, right? They see it as this symbol of wealth
3401920	3404880	So they would parade pineapples around at dinner
3405440	3408560	On a platter and they would use them over and over and over again
3408560	3415280	You could rent a pineapple, right for the evening. This is the sort of house in which you might be able to see a pineapple, right?
3417360	3420480	Castles had pineapple statues on the top of them there would be
3421360	3424000	Fountains with pineapples at the front of someone's estate
3425600	3430400	All of this occurred because of the scarcity of a pineapple. It was 8 000 pounds to get one pineapple. Wow, right?
3430480	3432480	That was the equivalent back then
3432560	3436240	8 000 pounds. It was a symbol of of privilege and opulence and wealth and
3437440	3440080	What it meant was that people really
3441120	3446640	looked up to this one object then the french a couple of hundred years later. They invent greenhouses
3447520	3452560	And that allows us to grow tropical fruits at higher climates higher
3453520	3455520	latitudes
3455520	3457520	Price drops and guess what?
3457760	3459760	No one starts parading the pineapple around anymore
3460880	3464240	The scarcity of it was largely determining the value of it
3465760	3472640	And that story and what I called rogan's value difficulty conflation just because something is hard to obtain does not mean that it is valuable
3473360	3476720	Now I would argue that a pineapple is valuable no matter how hard or difficult
3476720	3480480	It's like a dialed fruit no matter how good or how difficult it is to get a hold of
3481200	3485360	But I really love that insight because I think that it shows how
3486240	3487680	non valuable
3487680	3491280	But difficult to obtain things get slipped into our desires
3492240	3498080	I see that particular expensive possession that intrinsically I don't actually care about maybe I've never been a watch guy
3498480	3500800	Maybe I've never been a shoes guy. Maybe I've never been a car guy
3501280	3503680	But I want it I want it because it's hard to get okay
3503760	3507120	Well, what if there is a quicker route to what fulfillment?
3507440	3511040	What if there is a more direct path because there are some people out there for whom
3511520	3515200	Keeping up with the jonesism materialism is an inbuilt part of their life
3515600	3520240	But I can say as someone that doesn't have that bone in my body particularly that for me material possessions
3520320	3524160	They don't make a massive difference to my quality of life. I like nice things. I like to fly business
3524240	3526080	I like you know, I like a nice house and blah blah blah
3526720	3532160	But there's people who are tuned into that, right? Maybe it's the upbringing the genetic predisposition whatever whatever whatever
3532960	3536320	But I think that people should be very cautious. Why is it that I'm chasing this thing?
3536640	3541440	Am I chasing this thing because it's something which is valuable or am I chasing it simply because it's something that's difficult to get
3541680	3543680	Yeah, that's a by the way a very good story
3544160	3546160	And a great quote. I remember in iran
3546640	3549760	Pineapple is on on us. That's how we say we say on on us
3550480	3554960	And anybody in iran who had pineapple you were rich two things pineapple and banana in iran
3555200	3559120	Only rich people have pineapple and two good fruits. Yeah, two good fruits. And then I go to germany
3560000	3562000	And bananas are everywhere
3562160	3567280	But the first time I had pineapple. I had it in the states. I couldn't believe we were having pineapple
3567280	3570640	I thought we were rich when we had pineapple. I said mom, are we finally rich here?
3571760	3575760	We made we retired on a pineapple. Yeah, it was on on us and I remember I was in
3576560	3582560	Ninth grade first time ever we went and ate at sizzlers. I thought we had made it. I'm like guys you will not believe what restaurant
3582560	3586720	I don't know if you know sizzlers, but sizzlers in us is not a fancy restaurant
3586720	3588720	I thought we made it because we ate at
3588720	3590720	sizzlers. Yeah, you know what say
3591440	3593440	I used to think
3594560	3598320	And you know this whole concept of people who are too much about
3599040	3603200	Fancy things it's kind of like well look at this guy all he cares about his money all he cares about his fancy things
3603200	3606800	All he cares about is these cars and life with the rich and famous and all this other stuff
3607680	3614400	Eventually I realized not everybody is driven by the same thing all I care about that's something that drives you
3614560	3620160	Okay, my oldest son could care less. You know what he wants for a car his favorite car a jeep
3620640	3624160	That's his dream car. My daughter says I want a white Ferrari
3624560	3627600	Okay, and I said, who do you think's gonna buy that for you? Well daddy, you're gonna buy
3627840	3630160	I'm not buying you white for are you gonna buy yourself a white Ferrari?
3630560	3634000	Dylan wants a completely different car my oldest son. You know what you know what is
3634640	3638000	Absolutely a great day for him outside
3638800	3640320	in the dirt
3640320	3642160	playing with lizards
3642160	3644160	catching animals
3644160	3646160	Playing with dogs and cats
3646240	3649440	That's an incredible day. By the way, he's been like done since eight months nine months
3649920	3654480	My youngest son 10 years old first time I take him to my barber to get a haircut
3655040	3657040	And one of the girls at this place they give
3657600	3661040	Massages at the end when you get the haircut my oldest son says don't touch my back
3661680	3665200	Don't don't touch me. He would go like this. He's like no no dad. I don't tell her not to touch me, right?
3665520	3667520	But my 10 year old son it was five at the time
3668080	3670080	She's like, can you also massage me over here?
3670800	3674000	Oh, he likes to find the things in life to find her things in life, right?
3674400	3677040	My oldest son loves dogs. He loves animals my youngest son
3677760	3679760	Don't get on my bed get off my bed
3680000	3685280	My oldest son wants a dog right next to him the youngest son doesn't want any of the dogs next to him and his dad loves dogs
3685280	3686880	I love animals, right?
3686880	3689200	so I'm not I'm not you know
3690000	3691440	I think
3691440	3697440	Joe specializes in doing the heart if there's anybody that specializes in doing the heart is joe. You kid me like joe is a
3698640	3700240	enamored by doing the heart
3700240	3705360	But also joe's learned to be so self-aware of himself to know what he likes
3705760	3709520	I said joe, what do you think about sports? Is uh, I know nothing about sports. I don't watch sports
3709520	3711520	The only thing I watch is ufc
3711520	3715760	Joe now that you're getting all these eyeballs. What's your vision? What if we can do this pat?
3716080	3721120	The only thing I want to do is I just want to podcast. Yeah, I want to go hunt. I want to be my family
3721200	3725920	I want to do ufc. This is all I want to do the level of clarity. He has of where he's at
3726880	3728880	Props to him now Dana white
3729280	3730800	slightly different
3730800	3734080	Dana's not worth a few hundred say he's worth a half a billion dollars today
3734640	3736240	Why is he still driving?
3736240	3740720	Why is he still pushing? Why is he still competing? Why is he still wanting to be number one?
3740960	3742080	Who's his enemy?
3742080	3747040	He drives around in nice cars likes to go to the casino likes to be around with people having fun late night
3747920	3751760	Two different dynamics two different personalities. Look at the organization they built with you
3751760	3752640	I mean
3752640	3757200	Thinking of someone who chooses their enemies tactically Dana is not someone who's shy of a fight
3757360	3761200	He loves it, you know, if you were to think of a c-suite level fighter
3762160	3766000	Dana white is is pretty well and bring the crop. Yeah, you've you've spent a good bit of time sort of
3766560	3769920	Orbiting that that whole crew of people. What have you learned from your?
3770880	3774400	Insights about the UFC and sort of what that says about Dana. Oh
3776240	3778000	listen
3778000	3780560	what I'm about to say about Dana is
3782320	3785680	Some people are not gonna like it, but I'm gonna say it anyways
3786240	3791360	UFC is what UFC is because of Dana white you can sit there and talk about all these fighters and
3791760	3797040	Yeah, but you know if it wasn't for this guy if it wasn't for that guy if it wasn't for what this person did and that
3797120	3800400	Totally get it. Listen different players come and go right totally understand
3802960	3808880	Dana has made it about the sport. He never made it about the fight. He never made it about one fighter
3809520	3811040	He is very
3811040	3814240	Quick to call out anybody. It doesn't matter if it's the number one guy in the league
3814240	3818560	He'll call him out. John Jones. He'll call out Connor if he screws up, but he'll back him up
3819120	3822320	To the highest level. He'll say that was some stupid shit. He did
3822960	3825760	He'll sit there and straight up tell you what he likes what he doesn't like
3826320	3832000	But everybody learned during covet. He was the number one commissioner in all of sports
3832640	3834640	Every commissioner in america caved
3835200	3836560	mba caved
3836560	3838560	nfl caved mlb caved
3839440	3847280	Every commissioner caved except for one guy who had brass balls called dano white who said I don't give a shit
3847760	3852480	We're going to find a place to do the fight. So during covet. You know, it's the only sport the world watched
3852560	3856960	We watched ufc. No one's watching the freaking football game with no fans out there and card boards
3857120	3859120	What am I going to do with card boards? Oh, no, we're gonna watch
3859200	3862000	Hey, you can buy this seat for your face to be on the you know
3862480	3865680	Basketball game who gives a shit. It was the most boring finals lakers one ever
3865680	3869920	They shouldn't even deserve to have won that finals. There was no audience. Nobody boon against you
3870480	3875840	But everybody realized here's dano as a commissioner. Then it's everybody else. You're not at his level
3876320	3881280	He's a wartime leader as well as a peacetime leader. He's learned how to balance both
3881280	3882480	prestige moving together
3882480	3885840	He said something in an interview says listen, man, maybe it's just the fact that I'm getting old
3886240	3889680	And I'm getting soft, but I have a hard time seeing what's going on with some of these guys and
3890640	3891680	You know
3891680	3895440	In the way his personal life when he went through that crisis and the way he put it
3895440	3898080	He says you want me to be embarrassed? How much more embarrassed you want me to be?
3898320	3901680	You know how embarrassing it is to talk to my wife and my kids. You know how embarrassing that is
3901920	3904720	This is nothing compared to embarrassing the two have to face my kids
3906640	3909920	You respect that you love that there's a degree of clarity
3910320	3912160	especially to dano
3912160	3913280	that is
3913280	3914320	very rare
3914320	3915200	and
3915200	3919360	I think that one of the things that ufc has done is make boxing particularly
3919680	3926000	Feel so antiquated and pedestrian and the fact that ksi almost speed tommy fury. You know how bad that would have been for boxing
3926000	3930160	That's not good. That's not good, but he ksi does not represent ufc either
3930960	3937200	He doesn't but what would have happened if a youtuber would have beaten a professional boxer with the last name of fury
3937840	3941920	It's humiliating correct and many people would have said he could have won on the points
3941920	3949280	But what was it that you said you made some comparison about jockeys and horses to do with dano white?
3952720	3958000	Yes, I made the analysis with ilan musk where you either bet on the oh the same goes with dano white as well
3958000	3960640	Yeah, yeah, so you got the jockey and the horse. Okay
3961200	3968240	You got dano white is the jockey the horses ufc ilan musk is a jockey
3969440	3977200	Tesla is the horse. Okay, so if tomorrow ilan musk resigned from tesla to only do twitter
3977600	3979600	What happens to tesla?
3979600	3984560	It's going to be disturbing for a lot of investors because a lot of people bought tesla because it's ilan musk
3984960	3986960	A lot of people are selling tesla
3986960	3990000	Tesla and getting rid of their cars like aoc
3990720	3995840	It's ilan musk ever since yeah about twitter double-edged sword. Yeah, it's a double-edged sword
3995840	4002000	But you know to me in a perfect world is if you can have both I think ufc is a great product
4002800	4006640	Phenomenal product addicting product. Okay viral product
4007760	4012000	But dano white is an incredible jockey. Do you remember someone brought up?
4012560	4015440	I think it was israel adesanya had been using the n word
4016160	4019680	And it's at the press conference. I mean it must be fun for the press
4020160	4024160	You know to sit down and dano sits down. He goes. All right guys. What's going on the gate tonight was
4024960	4029520	We broke this he would have the fight of the night and then he just looks up and someone asks him a question
4029760	4034720	And he just says what he thinks you know, he doesn't say something that the media team has prepped him on
4034800	4038800	Although i'm sure he's got training and he understands the boundaries, but nothing feels
4040080	4042080	prescribed
4042160	4043920	manufactured
4043920	4045360	Conceited
4045360	4046560	Nothing
4046560	4049760	Contrived nothing feels like that. It just feels like this is what the guy thinks
4050720	4053680	Someone I saw this on the internet. Someone had talked about
4054960	4059680	Many organizations and youtubers at the moment are trying to speed run authenticity
4060560	4068080	Right. They're trying to growth hack relatability. How can I make myself seem more authentic and relatable than I actually am
4068640	4071520	And obviously it's kind of a self-defeating prophecy
4071680	4074800	Which is that the only way to be authentic is to be authentic
4075280	4079520	And there's a degree of trust, you know, I mean dana dude the start of this year was rough for him that
4079840	4084880	Him and his mrs. Got into a scuffle and it got videoed and it was maybe like new year's eve or something like oh
4085120	4089520	January 1st. Guess I was starting 2023 the worst way possible and
4090080	4092240	He comes out and you have faith that you go
4092960	4094320	Yeah, this guy
4094320	4095920	Meant what he said
4095920	4099840	There's I don't think that there's any demons looking in the closet because I may
4100720	4105040	Regret saying that at some point in future, but I don't think that I'm going to need to because I just have faith that
4106080	4111840	I'm not a dana white. I don't have stock in dana white. I just I'm a good judge of character and I see in him someone
4112560	4117680	That seems to tell the truth more often than not and seems to be very open and honest and own his mistakes
4118320	4120720	And people love that people really really like that
4121200	4122720	So, yeah, it makes him incredibly likable
4123840	4126720	Authenticity at the highest level that brand is a very
4127520	4129520	authentic brand
4129760	4133040	He said is uh, you know his enemies. He's had the people that have
4133520	4135520	challenged him and given him a hard time, but
4135840	4138400	Dana in a in a past life could have been a gangster
4139040	4141440	Maybe he was but he could have been a gangster. He could have ran a
4142080	4146880	Family that's how Dana's he could have been he Dana is almost not a
4147760	4149440	mob boss
4149520	4152320	You know of a Gambino family or Genovese or colombo
4152640	4156960	Dana's more the guy that ran the commission like a Luciano. That's Dana
4157680	4159680	And to be that guy
4161120	4165120	There is no book you can read to be that you can read 40 lots of power 100 times you can't be that guy
4165200	4169200	You either are that guy. You're not that guy big boss energy Dana is that guy Dana's that guy
4170720	4174880	One of your quotes is when you're winning you're not as good as you think you are
4175520	4179120	When you're losing you're not as bad as you think you are. What's that mean to you?
4179680	4183840	Both of them lie, you know, both of them is exaggerated, you know, both of them
4185440	4186720	are
4186720	4191280	When you when you're winning everybody's telling you how amazing you are. Oh my god, let me tell you do you
4191600	4193600	You know what you're the best
4194320	4195600	You're amazing
4195600	4198320	You know, you're just better than that guy and you're better than this guy
4199120	4203840	And it always takes me back to that quote of Marcus Aurelius who had a slave
4204640	4208720	That would sit behind them and always whisper to him. Hey, you're just a man
4208800	4212080	You're just a man. You're just a man. That's right 40 laws of power, right?
4212080	4214160	You're just a man. You're just a man. You're just a man
4214800	4219440	And then he would get up and he became the best emperor what 62 ad to 69 whatever the time is
4220160	4222160	And he becomes who he becomes
4222800	4230400	And we read about him now, you know, you pick up the book meditations. You're like, this is like mandatory reading for anybody
4230720	4232720	What is this all about? Right?
4232880	4234560	You know a simple book
4234560	4237920	Not that big you can read it in one hour. No, it's not it's not
4238400	4242560	And you're going through it saying what was this about then you google what did he mean by this?
4243120	4246960	Wow, I don't think about it that way. So and then when you're losing
4247680	4251360	Everybody tells you I told you shouldn't have done that. I knew you weren't gonna make it
4251840	4256880	Yeah, I told you it wasn't for you. You weren't that guy and you believe that as well
4257600	4261200	So both of them are are lying for me politically
4261920	4267120	Politically, I'm a capitalist hardcore capitalist. I fully am a capitalist to the core
4267760	4273680	I think the free market will create solutions to problems. I think the free market is going to filter out
4274400	4276400	all the fakers in
4277200	4278960	pharma in
4278960	4283520	finance in podcasting in sports in real estate and insurance
4283920	4288800	It takes two decades, but it'll filter people out. It's not it's got zero sympathy for you
4288800	4294000	It doesn't care to be friend. You can give capitalism as many compliments as you want. He doesn't feel it. He has no emotions
4294400	4301040	You can't flatter capitalism. All he's interested in is results. Are you good enough? Can you last can you recreate yourself? Great
4302480	4305680	But when it comes on to politics, I want to hear both sides
4306000	4309520	Okay, I'm a christian, but I held a podcast four weeks ago
4309520	4314640	I brought two muslims and I brought two christians and I had them go at it for two hours discussion
4315440	4317440	because my
4317680	4322480	Conversation was more about okay if we agree on seven different things we disagree on seven different things
4322960	4326720	But you agree on 23 different things. Can we figure out a way to make this work?
4327520	4328640	Why do you feel the way you do?
4328640	4331920	Why do you feel the way you do and they go back and forth and your sinners in okay?
4332640	4336320	Interesting to date israel palestine with what's going on with hamas
4337200	4339200	complicated lots of issues
4339600	4343520	You know on one end the question is where pro israel
4344080	4346080	Where folks are going back and forth
4346080	4350560	You know, I'm a pro-israel guy. I'm from iran when I lived in iran for 10 years
4351040	4357360	Iran was safer when reza pahlavi was there because they were strong and they had allies with everybody
4357920	4360480	And israel was safe the middle east was safe you could go
4361120	4364560	And say, you know what patrick next week, you know where i'm going. Where are you going?
4365120	4366800	I'm going to tehran iran
4366800	4373440	Because frank sinatra is performing there i'm gonna do a podcast with frank sinatra said you're doing a podcast with frank sinatra in tehran iran sick
4373840	4377040	You would have been able to say that in 76 in 75
4377760	4381680	So the middle east was fairly peaceful not perfect, but it was peaceful
4382480	4385120	But at the same time it you know, you got to ask the question
4386480	4388560	Had it israel with the best
4390160	4396400	Intelligence masad not know that for one year hamas was training for this
4397280	4402720	How did you not know that they went and built a city similar to the one that you haven't trained on how to break into homes and take hostages?
4403280	4405520	You didn't know that you really didn't know that
4406080	4409120	And intelligence gave you a report from here from egypt
4409520	4413680	But you didn't know that it's a fair question to ask but when you ask that question guess what people say
4414320	4418320	What kind of a question is that this is not the time to ask that question. Do you realize what they're doing to kids?
4418880	4420240	I don't support it
4420240	4425120	I'm not supporting any of that stuff. Then I got another question because palestinian said that's exactly right
4425600	4429440	This was intentional by israel. They know what I asked palestinians and they also don't ask this question
4429600	4431120	Here's a question
4431120	4433120	If you're so peaceful
4433440	4435680	Who knows more about palestinians?
4436240	4437120	us
4437120	4443120	Who live in america or uk or your neighbor if you live in a condo or if you live in a house
4444160	4446640	And you've been living in this house for five years or 10 years
4447120	4449360	You have a neighbor on this side. You have a neighbor on this side
4449840	4452800	You know when they do barbecues, you know, how much they drink
4453280	4458400	You know who in which in-laws comes in, you know the son when he sneaks in the girlfriend at one o'clock in the morning
4458640	4463600	You know the daughter when she sneaks out and changes her skirt and gets into a car with that bad boy and goes out and does
4463600	4468320	What she does and she comes back at four o'clock. You know your neighbors. You see all their mess. Okay
4470240	4472240	If if palestine
4472880	4476800	In gazes filled with so many peaceful people. Why is egypt not taking them?
4477440	4481920	As refugees to go to egypt egypt knows a lot about you. Why is it only 800 people?
4482480	4485680	Why are they not letting a million people come to you? So somebody may say
4486320	4492720	What a shameful question for you to ask. How dare you ask the question? I think both questions need to be asked
4493440	4499040	What you do with it is up to you. Okay, so for me this whole concept of when you're winning
4499520	4502080	Don't believe the hype when you're losing. Don't believe the hype
4502720	4508080	Whatever story even your own side is saying. Why don't you be skeptical a little bit and question it for yourself and see if you can
4508240	4509920	entertain both ideas
4509920	4515600	I want to find ways to entertain both ideas as much as possible because I find myself becoming sharper when I do
4515680	4518400	That and I eliminate blind spots anytime
4519200	4523520	100% one side have way too many blind spots. We'll get back to talking to patrick in one minute
4523520	4527280	But first I need to tell you about fountain life. Here's a crazy statistic
4527360	4530560	Nearly 70% of heart attacks occur without any
4531040	4537040	Prior symptoms simply put the human body is really good at hiding disease and this is where fountain life comes in
4537200	4542880	They provide top of the line health snapshots vetted therapeutics and a team of longevity physicians
4543040	4550880	So that you can live a longer healthier and more vital life in seemingly healthy adults fountain life's initial results have shown
4551280	4558080	2% have cancer 2 and a half percent have a potential ruptured aneurysm looming in their future and over
4558880	4562160	14% have a critical life saving finding right now
4562240	4567680	You can get the exact treatment that I got by going to the link in the description below or heading to fountain life
4567680	4574720	Dot com slash modern wisdom using the form on that page to get $500 off their apex membership
4574800	4576800	That's fountain life dot com
4576800	4583280	Slash modern wisdom. Do you think that we're obliged to have a take on everything because I haven't
4584240	4589280	Got involved in the israel palestine conflict and there's a lot of people that are very unhappy
4589520	4596480	The silence is violence crowd your silence is deafening. Why haven't you come out in support or against this group or that group?
4596800	4599440	Is it an obligation for us all to have a take on everything?
4599680	4604880	If if the background has to do anything with you, I think you are obligated to talk about it
4604880	4609360	Meaning if you're a jew, I think you have to if you're palestinian you have to
4609920	4615360	If you're a muslim, I think you have to because it's your community. It's your pride. It's your background
4616320	4620960	If you're a political show and you've spoken about ukraine and russia
4621840	4625680	And you've touched that topic. Why are you not touching this topic now?
4625840	4630720	I don't know if you have no no no no to all of the above then guess what that means then you're consistent
4630720	4635200	So no you don't have to if you've been consistent with all of it. You don't have to talk about it
4635200	4639760	That's not what the show is about you could simply say you want to hear that show go to ben Shapiro
4640320	4645600	Well, what people are saying they're not saying why haven't you commented specifically what your position is what they want
4645680	4653120	What they're saying is why haven't you said the thing that supports the stance that I want you to take for each of them
4653360	4656240	No, why haven't I come in and done edit at all?
4656400	4657280	I mean listen
4657280	4661520	There there's a lot of events in the world that if you and I have to comment on all of them
4661680	4665760	We don't have a life you would have to do 12 hour podcasts to cover everything on a daily basis. No
4667440	4669440	But this is a
4669440	4674720	Once in 50 years type of crisis that could lead to a world war three numbers came yesterday
4674800	4678880	Were ray dalio, I don't know if you've sat down with ray dalio. Okay, so you know who ray dalio is
4678880	4681280	He's a 20 billion dollar man built an incredible company
4682640	4686080	I had him on as well ray dalio yesterday said
4686640	4691040	The chance of world war three is officially at 50% and jayme diamond yesterday said
4692000	4694960	These are the most dangerous times we're living in decades
4695680	4697680	Okay, so one may say
4698480	4702400	Well, you get tens of millions of eyeballs
4703120	4705120	You're no longer somebody that gets
4705280	4709280	Back in the days your first show when you did were 220 people watching a mom and dad didn't watch it
4709280	4712640	Your siblings didn't watch your best friends didn't watch it. No now you're getting
4713120	4714720	Well, that's the interesting question, right?
4714720	4720800	Whether somebody with a sufficiently large platform is obligated to comment on things simply because they have a large platform
4721040	4724000	And you ask why whether I haven't why I haven't if I haven't
4725280	4729760	I found out about the incidents that were going on in the middle east on twitter
4730400	4737840	Two days after they happened and I wondered why hammers was trending and I thought what the fuck's hammers. Oh, fuck. That's Hamas
4738720	4741280	That was two days after everything had happened by this time
4741280	4743360	I'd already had texts from people saying dude like
4743920	4746240	Are you gonna get you're gonna do an episode on this and I was like
4746720	4747600	bro
4747600	4753040	The requisite amount of understanding for me to be able to add an educated opinion to this topic
4753600	4757200	Is not one that I have time to do. I mentioned to you earlier on we've been traveling. We were in la
4757680	4761920	We were there for two days all I did all I've done for the last week is travel
4762240	4767520	Sleep research and record and I've researched very specific guests. I haven't been researching stuff about the middle east, right?
4767760	4770240	So that's all I've had time to do
4771360	4777360	Is it not the precise problem that people who do not know what they're talking about have given
4778080	4784640	Cod psychology insights way outside of their domain of expertise and just added to the noise rather than adding to the signal
4784640	4788800	And yet there is a group of people on the internet that would say no
4788800	4792400	But this is so important to me that it's something that should move
4792880	4797520	Aside the other things that you're doing in life. And I think a final element of this is
4798320	4800320	people who are chronically online
4800880	4803760	Cannot understand what it's like to not be chronically online
4804560	4806880	I am chronically online for periods
4807280	4812880	And then I am chronically traveling around and researching and recording and going from hotel to hotel coming out to florida
4813520	4815520	This is one of those periods during which
4816400	4818400	There's a lot of reading that needs to be done
4818400	4822960	To make a comment to contribute to something that lots of people who are better educated than me can do
4823200	4825200	It's the same reason I didn't comment on covid
4826640	4829120	Covid was something that was happening. We did a a couple of
4829600	4834640	Episodes explaining how we felt people could better work from home some mental health tools that we thought that they could use
4835040	4840240	Some strategies that they could do to improve their time blocking and some stuff like that
4840240	4843200	Here's how we would design your homework station. I'm like
4844320	4848080	If you want me to comment and just throw horseshit at the wind
4849200	4852480	I can do it, but I don't think that it's going to benefit anything. So yeah, there's this
4853600	4855120	compulsion
4855120	4857120	this obligation I think that uh
4857840	4859840	certain groups on the internet feel
4860480	4866560	Anybody that comments on things should get themselves involved with and uh, it's just are you surprised?
4867200	4870640	No, no at all because what they want, but again, they don't want you to comment
4870800	4876320	They want you to support their side. No, that's a different story that that that's a different story. There's a difference between
4877360	4879360	commenting and supporting right
4879760	4883360	I'm not if I comment i'm giving you my thoughts
4884160	4886160	and i'm gonna share with you my
4886960	4888480	uh, uh
4888480	4890480	You know opinion
4890480	4894800	Thoughts on my life experience on what I think is going on and then from there
4895280	4898960	Agree or disagree for the people who are asking you to contribute
4899840	4902960	if your thoughts and your life experience led you to
4903520	4904240	Uh
4904240	4908640	Implicate one side rather than the other sound like you were being more generous to one side rather than the other
4908960	4912160	They would very quickly say I wanted you to comment, but I didn't want you to say that
4912480	4915760	They would very quickly have an issue. Is that your brand though? Is your brand?
4916480	4920080	Uh, uh of 700 episodes 2500 clips
4920720	4926320	You know is your brand given opinion on current events? Have you done that in the past?
4926960	4928960	Because here's what happens. So
4929600	4936000	In the market, you know how in hollywood. They say this guy's a triple threat. What's a triple threat act sing dance
4936640	4942880	Okay, in podcasting. There's also triple threats. Okay. What's a triple threat a great interviewer?
4943360	4945840	Which you are but that's one of three
4946800	4948800	two is
4948800	4950800	perspective and opinion
4950800	4954880	Which joe rogan is people want to hear what joe has to say about this
4955680	4957680	And in three is entertain
4958160	4962640	Can you entertain me while you're giving me your perspective or asking questions where i'm kind of like
4963920	4968240	Man, I was funny as hell. Yeah. So joe the reason why joe is number one is because
4969120	4970560	joe's
4970560	4972560	great host
4972720	4975600	We want to hear his perspective agree or disagree. He has the
4976480	4982400	He has the conviction and the confidence to give a side and be willing to change. Hey one minute. You're voting for bernie sanders
4983440	4987200	Four years later. You're saying to save america. You got to vote for trump and republican. What?
4987920	4989920	What are you talking about? Right?
4990400	4993040	So then three is he entertains you he makes you laugh
4994560	4996560	Your brand
4997360	5000480	You have to take the risk whether you want to go to two
5001280	5005120	I don't think you need to comment on absolutely everything if joe was to be asked
5005120	5007680	What do you think of aron roger's most recent achilles rupture?
5008560	5012160	As you said earlier on that's not a but there's a different story with that
5012480	5017760	You asked about consistency earlier on ukraine russia didn't comment on covet didn't comment on and that's your brand then
5018080	5020880	But but by the way, what you just said is
5021920	5027120	Your perspective absolutely, but it's a meta perspective on what's going on. You're not going to please everybody though
5027120	5030320	Look, i'm armenian and assyrian. Okay, so now i was born in iran. So here's where i'm screwed
5030720	5033360	i'm a half armenian half assyrian born in iran
5033840	5035840	And i'm an american, okay
5035920	5040640	So for the emulsmen of the apocalypse. Oh my god. So whenever something happens with armenian genocide
5041120	5043920	I have to within a second comment on it. Okay
5044720	5047920	And I do but now within a second because I don't have intel
5048160	5051280	So when you're talking about your days what it looks like research all that stuff
5051920	5053280	You're telling the truth
5053280	5056880	But i'm running nine companies and I got a wife and I got four kids and i'm
5057200	5063280	Transitioning with another company and i'm doing research on a podcast and i'm doing the interviews and i'm running a tech startup
5063280	5066480	And i'm running a consulting firm with clients that are traveling worldwide to come to us
5067200	5070000	And i'm doing our our best to kind of see what's going on with stories
5070240	5072800	Yeah, there's going to be days you just don't have time and the audience
5073440	5076480	Can't understand and cannot understand it right? That's a decision they got to make
5077120	5081040	Uh, so assyrians. Hey, did you see what happened at that theater?
5081360	5084480	What are you going to comment at this wedding that just took place and a hundred people were dead
5084720	5089120	And a place caught on fire and these people. Okay, great. Let me get some intel and then i'll comment on it
5089120	5095920	And then I did you know or iran or you know, but but the natural part where I would take it as a
5096720	5098720	compliment is the audience
5099040	5100080	is
5100080	5101600	leaning on
5101600	5105760	You to see how you would assess this issue and they trust the way you reason
5106640	5109920	And nowadays there's not enough people who are able to reason
5110400	5113840	To give a different perspective because they simply don't trust mainstream media
5114560	5117920	But then the next step is do you want to take the risk of going in that side?
5118000	5124800	If your brand is not on covet not on uh, ukraine not on this then you're staying consistent. I think largely the main
5125600	5129760	Lesson I learned I learned this from douglas murray is that there are a lot of people in the online space
5129920	5133760	Who do not have expertise within a particular domain and have it in another one
5134160	5140560	They have expertise within psychology or climate change or whatever it might be and then they start thinking to themselves. Well
5141120	5143120	Why
5143200	5146720	Why shouldn't my thoughts on the ukraine be important to people?
5147200	5153600	What everybody thinks that my insights about climate change are absolutely wonderful and they start to get out over the skis
5153680	5157680	Outside of their domain of competence. If you want to talk about my domains of competence
5158320	5160160	I'll comment on it
5160160	5162160	For me, there are people out there who are
5162400	5167920	Capable prepared to do the work have the time and have the expertise. I don't think that the internet needs more noise
5167920	5172000	I think it needs more signal and I would be contributing nothing short of noise if I did that
5172480	5179520	I'm also just not passionate about learning about this topic and I understand that in order for me to give the
5181120	5187200	For me to meet the bar of evidence and insight that I would want to to feel proud about my opinion
5187680	5192080	I need to be passionate about it. Right. I need to be compelled to learn about passion about life
5192560	5193920	Of course I am
5193920	5197040	Would you like to live 200 years old? Yes. Okay
5198000	5201280	So do many of your listeners because the feedback you give
5201840	5205120	Has to do with living a great life because people are watching the life you're living
5205440	5209040	The only thing I would encourage you to consider from the audience side
5209680	5211680	Is this is a different crisis
5212400	5213840	This crisis
5213840	5219840	If reasonable people like you can find a way to lower the overreaction that people are having
5220400	5225120	With everything that's out there. I would say you would actually contribute to lowering the
5225760	5227760	overreaction community
5227760	5228640	so
5228640	5233680	I'm I'm simply complimenting you to consider the fact that people are looking to see
5234480	5240320	How a reasonable person like you that can give a logical perspective because that's what's missing today
5241040	5242000	and
5242000	5243760	When a Ray Dalio
5243760	5248320	When a Jamie Dimon when many of these guys are saying 50 percent
5249360	5253040	And you with your millions of people who listen to you can and it's not a
5253520	5258720	Niche audience where it's in one country or two countries your audience is worldwide 100 plus countries. You got people listening to you
5259920	5261920	I think maybe from that level the
5262960	5265920	Feedback from the audience could be this is not a regular issue
5265920	5270160	We'd like to hear your thoughts and then whether you choose to do it or not. It's your prerogative and we move on
5271040	5272640	Yeah, you've got uh
5272640	5275920	You mentioned there about this sort of loss of faith in our institutions
5276320	5280080	Right the previous gatekeepers the people that we would have relied on to
5280720	5282720	Tell us what what in the world?
5284240	5287600	What do you think about this rising skepticism?
5288320	5291440	Uh, there is also a degree of conspiratorial thinking
5292240	5295440	heterodox cynicism around what we're being told
5296480	5301120	Is this leaving a vacuum where people's uncertainty is making their lives worse?
5301760	5307520	What is going to happen from a a sense making because how do people make sense of the world when we can't trust the
5308400	5309680	information
5309680	5311440	communicators
5311440	5317920	Well, that's the that's why they want to hear from you. So so what you're saying is is validating their point. So in america today
5318800	5324800	We are at the lowest levels. We've ever been for americans trusting mainstream media and trusting the government
5324960	5329680	Not one or the others the lowest in both. We don't trust the government. We don't trust mainstream media
5330080	5336000	The last time the the people trusted mainstream media and the government the highest was right before kennedy died after that
5336000	5340320	That was at 72 percent. It's gone from 72 65 60
5341040	5344560	Down to today 27 percent people simply don't trust
5345280	5350320	The mainstream media to get feedback on what's really taking place. There's a reason why rogan
5350880	5356560	Gets more eyeballs on his show than all these guys combined and people are watching to see what he has to say
5356880	5361680	There's a reason why shepiro gets the eyeballs. He gets there's a reason why you get the eyeballs
5361680	5363680	There's a reason why all these other guys get the eyeballs
5364160	5367760	Is because they want to hear a different perspective, you know, we're going back to
5368480	5373280	The the the story where you know in this quote's been criticized many times. It's not really true
5373280	5374800	You know amateurs build
5374800	5379360	You know professionals build the titanic amateurs build the arc, you know, this whole story that they go back and forth
5379920	5383040	professionals run mainstream media amateurs run podcasting
5383760	5389680	But the world is trusting amateurs running podcasting more than the people that build the titanic
5390000	5392800	because a lot of people think mainstream media is about to
5393520	5397120	Sink like the titanic dick now whether it did or not who knows but
5397840	5401680	People want to talk to somebody just a regular guy says, you know, what's your story? What do you think about this?
5401680	5405840	What are your thoughts on this? Do you really agree? Do I does anybody else feel I kind of feel that way as well?
5405840	5408960	I'm a little bit skeptical. I'm a little bit worried about this. What's going on?
5408960	5411920	Is it really as big as they make it out to be should I trust these guys?
5412400	5415360	So I'm not surprised this is taking place. By the way, you know, what's the
5416080	5420640	Only thing that's keeping mainstream media in business. It's only a couple things that keep in mainstream medium business
5421600	5423600	number one is
5424000	5425520	75 year olds
5425520	5430960	70 75 year olds are keeping mainstream media in business. Okay, so that's another 10 to 15 years
5431280	5437440	Before that generation is no longer here. That audience is gone. Number two is big pharma if
5438640	5444560	Two countries in the world that allow big pharma companies to advertise it's us and new zealand every other country in the world
5444560	5446160	You cannot advertise
5446160	5449760	The only two countries in the world where pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer
5450400	5454720	That can advertise is us and new zealand everywhere else. There is no commercials on tv
5455440	5458960	Do you realize what would happen if a president?
5460480	5467280	Did an executive order got congress everybody in it to say moving forward big pharma can no longer advertise on mainstream media
5467440	5469440	You know what happens the next day
5469840	5471840	Every one of them goes out of business
5471920	5478560	And all these talented guys at espn or at cnn or fox or abc that are getting the 5 10 15 20 million dollar contract
5479920	5480880	gone
5480880	5482560	80 percent of revenue is gone
5482560	5486240	And a lot of these guys now have to go and try to make it in the world that you're making it
5486240	5489600	And this is what you're doing is hard. There's not a teleprompter behind me
5490240	5495680	There's nobody whispering in your ears what to say follow up with this question. This is all you doing it, right to them
5495840	5501680	Hey, ask him this follow up with this. We just found data 63 percent. He's lying follow up with this
5501840	5506240	Did you watch any of the late night hosts when they tried to do a podcast between them? Yes
5506560	5513840	What did you think from a professional's perspective a amateur professional's perspective? There's a reason why they can't do anything without writers
5514880	5519040	You know, I mean don't get me wrong to me fallon is a very talented guy a very talented guy
5520800	5524960	And you're not going to get to that job without having talent these guys got a lot of talent
5525360	5529200	They're workers, but the moment writers are done. You mean to tell me for may 12th
5529840	5534240	You guys can't do an episode until what october which they just started with two weeks ago
5534960	5539360	You realize writers control this world now the writers are worried that chat gbt can write the
5539840	5542880	Jokes of what's going on and what if a i can pop out these, you know
5543360	5548480	Jokes and what could take place no this game is a very very hard game. This is not an easy game
5549120	5551120	Think about what spot if I did
5551440	5556080	What other president in the last 20 years has been as popular as obama
5556880	5562960	And let me get this straight obama and another guy named bruce springsteen start a podcast and spot if I drop some what?
5564000	5572000	Who else has been more popular in the last 20 years on television than kim kardash in with 300 million followers on instagram
5572480	5576640	Spotify signs a podcast with her then they drop her what?
5577600	5583680	Who else has been more on tv and every magazine newspaper than harry and megan
5584240	5587440	But spot if I drop their podcast and hasn't
5588000	5594000	Fully is like we're not renewing the contract and then they give rogan a few hundred wait what?
5594480	5599200	So let me get this straight just being famous doesn't help to have a podcast. No wow
5600000	5604640	I thought it was just about fame. No, this is hard. This is an art. This is very difficult to do
5604640	5608000	It's not easy to do so if mainstream media
5608480	5610480	Sinks like the titanic
5610480	5616880	90% of that talent is going to disappear and they're not going to know what to do 90% of them
5617360	5621440	It's not an easy game. There's does this mean or does this contribute to?
5623440	5625440	Complicity or
5625520	5626880	those
5626880	5630320	Commentators and all of the other people whose wages ultimately are paid for by
5631360	5633360	those adverts
5633360	5640400	Does this does this create a perverse incentive for them in what way that they may be
5642080	5646800	Prepared to compromise something they truly think to not jeopardize the people that ultimately pay their wages
5648240	5651120	That there is a risk to them saying something out of turn which may
5652000	5655840	I mean are you really asking that question or you know the answer to that question? You already know the answer
5655840	5662000	You're a smart guy. Yeah. No, of course they they they have to they don't have a choice to take that position, right?
5662240	5667440	I'll give you an idea. Chris Cuomo was on cnn for god knows how many years and he was a number one guy for two or three years
5668160	5670160	What does cnn do to chris?
5670240	5671440	fired
5671440	5673440	his brother andrew Cuomo governor
5674000	5675120	fired
5675120	5678640	And then he's got a hundred twenty five million dollar pending lawsuit against cnn
5679360	5683520	and now cnn folks can't talk to chris. I had him on the podcast and
5684080	5687200	For the longest time Cuomo was hated by a lot of people on the right
5687680	5690080	Absolutely hated because of the stuff you would say where is jesus?
5690240	5694720	Jesus going to come and save you with covet. What's jesus going to do for you and all this stuff you would say, right?
5695680	5696720	well
5696720	5698560	He came on a podcast
5698560	5705360	And i'm with one of my partners in dalas. He's a billionaire himself in the insurance, but he's the number one power player in insurance
5706080	5711360	We're at his uh, uh office corner office on the top one the sickest office you'll see in your life like 60 at floor
5711360	5713360	He's overlooking all of dalas
5713600	5715600	brine and he says
5715920	5719600	You know, it's kind of weird watching Cuomo on your podcast. I said why?
5720320	5722320	He says he sounded different
5722880	5727280	You know those moments where I kind of liked him when I was watching this and this is not a guy
5727360	5729760	I can say something like that with you know how many people said that
5730320	5737680	What happened to him? He's now a free agent. He's got a shirt. He sells that's called free agent. He's got a podcast that says, you know
5739040	5740080	You know
5740080	5744640	With something Cuomo project that he's got a podcast and how does he dress like you?
5746000	5749040	we're with him a couple weeks ago in uh, what do you call it in um
5750640	5753120	sag harbor in uh, up in uh
5753840	5756480	That entire area whatever that area is I forget the name
5757040	5759520	uh, sagaponic sag harbor all that stuff
5760240	5764640	And we'll go to his house. My kids are running on the back. He said pat somebody wants to talk to you
5765040	5768800	I said, who's that facetime? It was like this like, oh shit
5769360	5771840	What's up robert downey jr. How you doing?
5772560	5774560	So i'm having a conversation with him
5775200	5780000	But forget about talking to robert downey jr. I wanted to see my kids reaction, especially my two boys
5780320	5782320	Because my boys when he died
5783200	5785200	My kids were devastated
5785200	5791120	When he dies iron man dies in you know in the do you know what today is in the marvel cinematic universe?
5791520	5794000	Today is the canonical death day
5795120	5801040	Of tony stark when he clicks his fingers today is the day the date get out of here today is the date
5801040	5802320	I did not know that
5802320	5805120	What is the chance of me bringing up the sword and I don't even know that story
5805920	5810000	So I said dylan tico come here. So daddy will run around with the dogs. I said trust me
5810800	5812080	Come here
5812080	5814640	And chris turns the camera around he goes like this
5815280	5816720	My son goes
5816720	5818000	Oh my god
5818000	5822720	Zion man, I know you and then the other son tico his reaction dylan's reaction
5823120	5826880	You know, you love robert downey's one of those guys that you absolutely love when you go back to his journey
5826880	5830080	I was talking about the movie that my dad and I watched 30 years ago only you
5830800	5836000	And the only movie I've ever watched four hours two hours and two back to back in a row was judge
5836080	5840480	This by robert downey jr. What's the moral of the story the moment chris coma was free
5842560	5844560	And he didn't give a shit
5845120	5847120	He just kind of told you what he was kind of going through
5848240	5853040	Would you like it or not? You may not agree with everything, but he's finally free a lot of these guys working on mainstream media
5853040	5855600	They're not free. I mean now see took his transition
5856240	5858240	And guess what he's killing it. Okay
5858720	5861280	Love them or hate them when tucker puts on a show
5862480	5866560	Everybody's watching what this guy's got to say. So I found out from the guys that
5867280	5872560	Light and tech all of this stuff that we're doing here who understand very very very closely what's going on
5873280	5877520	Bennett was it anamorphic lenses? Is that what they shot took his first thing in his garage with?
5879280	5885280	Yeah, so anamorphic lenses a very particular type of lens very particular type of shooting very
5886240	5889360	Uh short wide so it has the
5890080	5895680	Image of maybe it was his garage or something like that or a living room with the background behind him make no mistake
5896160	5897200	that is
5897200	5898720	lit and shot
5898720	5899680	in
5899680	5906160	Cinema quality right with the facade of it being a sort of low budget thing, right?
5906240	5912240	So it's this beautiful on an iphone. Yeah, precisely. It's this beautiful blending of both and uh
5912800	5917040	That's exciting. I think it's exciting to see what these guys do and also, you know, I love this about
5918880	5921680	Given that we spend so much time talking and and people have this
5922160	5928160	Uh concern about whether or not someone's gaming the system. Are they trying to growth hack relatability? Right or authenticity?
5929440	5934480	Seeing I would be lying if I said that I didn't take an amount of pleasure to see late night hosts
5934480	5940960	that have got massive platforms struggle to hold a conversation together for an hour over zoom because
5941920	5948480	That is ultimately the battle place of ideas, right? It's not how well can you read a script from a teleprompter?
5948720	5953120	I mean, there is skill absolutely skill in being able to do that and I couldn't I couldn't do the writing
5953200	5956320	I couldn't do the performance. I couldn't do the bits and the blah blah the music
5957440	5958960	but
5958960	5965280	Largely you are a marionette, right? That's being ventriloquized by a handful of writers and and execs
5965840	5968400	Ultimately seeing what you can do
5969280	5974720	When the gloves are off is more interesting to me. This is very hard. This is this is very hard because
5975440	5977440	How long is your average podcast?
5977600	5978400	Hour and a half
5978400	5979200	Okay
5979200	5986160	So an hour and a half of keeping people's interests with no breaks and nobody talking to you and touching up the makeup to them
5986960	5993040	What are you talking about? That is absolutely insane to do something like that. No
5993520	5998000	This is very hard and the market is proven that this isn't for everybody
5998400	6004160	The market is proven. You cannot keep my attention for that long. This is very very difficult when when people start to say
6004160	6006160	and I remember I hired a
6006160	6007520	marketing expert
6007520	6012800	You know 13 years ago 14 years ago. He came in and said well studies. I've shown you're making one of the mistakes
6012800	6015520	You're making on youtube your videos are about 12 minutes long
6016000	6019280	And the only videos that do well is 12 minutes after 12 minutes that I said nah, man
6019280	6022880	I'm doing 42 minutes 28 minutes hour and 20 minutes. That's a mistake
6023280	6026400	Number one thing we have to do is no video can go past 13 minutes
6027200	6032880	Like dude, okay, maybe this guy's the expert. He sold this company for a couple million. You know what happened the day we fired him
6034160	6037840	60 days later our first video goes viral and gets 40 million views today
6037840	6042640	It's got a half a billion views. Okay for the life of an entrepreneur in 90 second takes off, right?
6043440	6048400	And we start making other clips and other videos and other stuff and ec joe takes it to a whole different level
6048960	6053360	Three hours and you got lex freedman takes it to a different level four hours three hours and 48 minutes
6053360	6056240	You know, yeah, what lex does he did seven hours with balaji
6058160	6060160	Glutton for punishment
6060960	6063840	Yeah, you um you tweeted something that I thought was quite interesting
6063840	6070240	You said why do so many people who come to the america from other countries with little to no money at all?
6070960	6075200	within 10 years outpace the average person who was born here
6075280	6084320	What is going on where americans who have all of the i'm an immigrant to this country, right?
6086400	6090560	Many people who are given from the very beginning all of the benefits of being from this country
6091280	6094640	Why is it that they are outpaced by people who weren't born here?
6096400	6097520	so
6097520	6099040	Six seven months ago
6099040	6103360	I'm sitting with my state planner and one of the fears I have for the last 10 years is
6104080	6106720	What i'm going to do with my kids with the wealth with money?
6106720	6109520	Am I raising them in a way that they're not going to turn out being the
6110080	6116080	You know the snobby arrogant kid that you know the spoon. Oh man, I cannot say I never liked those kids in school
6116160	6118560	Those are the kids I got into fights, but I never liked those kids
6119120	6123360	So I don't want to raise those types of kids and then you go and read these books about which families
6124080	6128800	Generationally created a wealth that state like Vanderbilt raised a bunch of snobs
6129200	6133920	So Vanderbilt's money only lasted one generation generation later. There's no money left
6133920	6137440	So when you read the story about that anderson cooper's a Vanderbilt
6137440	6141040	But his mother said even though we were Vanderbilt don't expect any kind of trust fund baby
6141280	6143760	You ain't got no money here. Nothing's coming over till you got to make your money
6144720	6149680	You know and but you look at the medici family and what they did five six seven generation
6149840	6152560	What did they do differently? You look at Rockefeller still has the money
6153200	6156400	You look at some of these other families that kept the money within the family
6156400	6160800	What did they do? What did they structure and there's a state plan and we can go do, you know
6161200	6167680	10 15 20 50 thousand dollars then there's hot guys. You can hire. That's a hundred thousand quarter million a million dollars
6168160	6172400	But those are state planners when you hire, you know what they do they interview your kids
6173360	6176000	so they go sit down with your kids and
6176800	6180960	After they talk to you and they'll say how do you want to set the stuff for the money with your kids?
6181440	6184720	Who gets money? What do they need to do? What's the criteria or your gift to get this?
6184720	6188640	What kind of cars do you now want them to buy to waste the money? Who do you want it to work for?
6188640	6191600	What happens with this business? Can they lose all the money? Are you given equally?
6192000	6196000	Here's what this family and they give you all these suggestions on how to properly set it up
6196560	6200080	Once you and your wife agree on what you want to do with that wealth
6200800	6203680	These guys have meetings with all your kids
6204400	6206160	without you there
6206160	6210880	And they'll record it so you can see how the meeting went went but they're setting it up with them
6210880	6212880	So they'll say okay kids. This is uh
6212880	6216080	On behalf of your parents, here's a few things you need to know
6216720	6217920	number one
6217920	6222000	Um, the good news is your parents are very prepared on what they've done with you
6222560	6224960	And here's what you can get your parents have worked very hard
6225360	6229280	And they have made a lot of money and if you do it, right? Some of that can be passed over to you
6229360	6232720	But if you don't you're not going to get it either. Let me go through some of these criteria
6234880	6238320	These three things you do you're not going to get anything these two things you do
6239360	6242720	If you do this, here's what's going to happen. This is what they want to see use the money with
6242880	6244880	And then they kind of break it down to them
6244880	6245520	now
6245520	6247520	You know how many families actually do that
6247520	6251920	Very few those conversations most people don't have most people are so much about go go go go go go go go
6252240	6257520	And then you die unexpectedly. Oh, we didn't set up the state planning let alone the detail the state planning. No
6258000	6262400	Okay, now your kids are spoiled right and doing what they're doing. I've had this conversation with a number of friends
6262880	6266720	Ben Francis who is the CEO of gymshark his net worth is triple drakes
6267280	6271840	Um, he's the start of a guy by the way. He's a serious. I had him on the podcast a couple years ago start serious dude
6271840	6275360	Yeah, uh, I was talking to him and I think that it's the same with you
6276320	6282000	One of the things that you value the most in your upbringing have been the hard times the spit and sawdust
6282720	6285440	Lessons and rules the hard school of hard knocks, right?
6285440	6290000	That's given you the work rate that has permitted you to be able to achieve the success that you have and
6291440	6296960	Reverse locally reverse entropy, right? So you've been able to wrangle your reality in a way that you want it to
6297600	6299600	Mm-hmm. And yet
6300320	6304000	You have worked so hard to be able to give your kids
6305520	6310640	Opportunities that you never had. Mm-hmm. And yet, you know that they need to go through the hardships
6310960	6315440	And that those are where the lessons are learned that are going to bear them. This to me seems like a very
6315840	6321680	Uh, interesting tension, right? I want to give my kids opportunities that I've worked so hard for if I don't
6321760	6326560	What the fuck was the point in you working so hard, right? And yet they need to go through the difficulty
6326640	6331680	They need to do how have you found this tension between the two?
6331920	6332960	Well, that's a great question
6332960	6335760	But I want to finalize by making a point when you ask the question about
6336160	6340400	Why is it that so many people come to america within 10 years to have more money than the people that were born in america?
6341120	6342720	because
6342720	6344720	unfortunately
6344880	6349680	The way we've ran america if the american-born kids
6351200	6353200	Are kids of these families?
6353200	6355920	They're the kids of the families that spoiled
6356560	6358560	them in america
6358640	6363200	There's no more earning things in america. It's just handed out to them. We're printing money left and right
6363760	6368160	We're giving away income to people left and right. We're making life easier
6368640	6375680	We're incentivizing the wrong things. Do you know in 1940 in america what percentage of kids were born to single mothers in 1940?
6376320	6377680	in america
6377680	6382320	What percentage of kids were born to a single mother who's not married with no father in the household?
6382560	6387200	4% is the number. Did you know the number or no? It's 4%. You know what that number is today?
6387840	6389040	Over 50
6389040	6392000	It's over 40 shy of 50 percent. You're right there at the number
6392720	6397120	You mean to tell me we went from 1944 percent to today. So what happened there?
6397680	6398720	first of all
6398720	6400320	policies by fdr
6400320	6406880	Social security and incentives of taking care of single mothers then linden johnson in 1965 took it to a whole different level
6407280	6411440	Mothers are sitting there saying the more kids I have the more entitled programs. I get great. Why would I get married?
6411760	6413760	If I get married, I lose those benefits
6413920	6416320	The incentive programs america set up
6417040	6422400	Totally screwed everything up. It incentivized the bad behaviors like telling a kid
6422640	6429280	Can you imagine if you're in estate planning you say for every kid you have not married? I'll pay you 700 dollars
6429920	6431920	Whose fault is that parents fault?
6432320	6435520	Bad policies have consequences. Yeah, you create a bad policies
6436000	6438480	What person in the right state of mind?
6439200	6442560	When they have their wealth america's a family. It's a corporation
6443360	6448400	What person in the right mind would incentivize what parents would incentivize kids to say i'm gonna have more kids
6448720	6451920	And i'm gonna give you money out of the living trust nobody in the right mind would do that
6451920	6454880	But america did so what happened to us now we got all this crime
6455440	6459280	Now we're paying the price for it because all these years there's no father in there to
6459760	6462800	Put him in their place to challenge him to straighten them up. That's not in place
6463200	6466160	You know, so that is a missing piece that these kids
6466640	6468400	Don't have in america
6468400	6474240	So to me if we looked at america as a family as a corporation estate planning matters
6474800	6478400	You know living trust matters the right policies matters
6478960	6483920	Listen, I even think to the point where you know how in america voting starts at 18 years old
6485840	6487920	I would much rather this was a very
6488400	6492880	Strange policy i'm gonna share with you when I posted this on on youtube a lot of people very upset with me
6493280	6495280	I would much rather
6495440	6498080	Have somebody who's 14 and a half years old
6498720	6500720	Who's had a job?
6500720	6503840	And paid a thousand dollars in taxes vote
6504800	6508480	Then a 28 year old kid who's never had a job
6509120	6512560	Never paid taxes. I don't want that guy to vote. Why?
6513280	6519200	Because he contributed to society the 14 and a half year old kid the 15 year old kid contributed to society
6519600	6522720	And realized how hard it is to pay the taxes into
6523200	6526400	Whatever they're spending money on you want to spend a hundred billion dollars to
6527040	6529200	Ukraine we could have built 20 walls
6530720	6534400	We could have built 20 walls with that money that was sent you're not saying ukraine. I'm saying this so you're safe
6534400	6536720	Don't worry. They're not they're not gonna come after you. They're gonna come after me
6537360	6541760	So all of these things that you look at we're going away from earning
6542400	6544400	When a immigrant comes here
6544560	6548480	All they're looking at saying wait a minute. I can go work this and do this and do this and do this and i'm gonna earn this
6548480	6551680	Yes, i'm going i'm going town all day. I'm good with this
6552880	6557040	Many americans don't have that mindset because bad policies have consequences that we're suffering
6557680	6561200	Uh, uh the negative impact of that but you ask the follow-up question
6561520	6564720	Right with kids and your question is how to balance it with
6565120	6568800	Challenge in them yet still having the opportunity. What was the question you were asking?
6568880	6573440	Yeah, the tension between you affording your kids the benefits that all of your hard workers
6573920	6578640	Allow them to do and some greetings. I'm very greedy and here's what i mean by i'm very greedy
6579360	6581360	I want my kids
6581360	6583360	As close to me for the rest of my life
6583680	6585680	We have a family that lives in our community
6586000	6589520	Uh message just bought a house right next to our house and he just moved into the community
6589520	6592480	He caused a lot of mayhem. It's all over the place cops are coming in every week
6592560	6595920	We have you know, what do you call it paparazzi craziness that's going on
6596080	6601600	But one of the families that lives in our community they they run a medical company with six seven thousand employees
6602320	6605360	So the the founders the mom and dad their house is here
6606240	6608240	Right next door to the house
6608240	6613680	They have two sons the other son lives here. Who's the chief marketing officer? They're all the son's house is here
6614560	6616560	Each son has four kids
6617360	6618960	Each son has four kids
6618960	6625200	Both sons are doctors both sons married someone who's a doctor and they each have four kids
6626080	6629040	They have a structure on what they do monday nights every tuesday night
6629040	6634320	They have dinner together and they talk about god everyone's there's a system to everything they do
6634320	6638400	He'll call me and say hey, we went fishing this morning. I got a bunch of fish. Can I drop it off to you?
6639040	6644560	I am enamored by how those parents created that kind of a structure where their kids are respectful
6644880	6649840	Their grandkids are respectful go on a halloween. We're walking in halloween doing trick or treating and
6650800	6652400	The
6652400	6658160	Son comes by 17 year old son comes by and he says yeah, he doesn't have his iphone with him
6658640	6661760	I said, how does he know it not have it not have his iphone with him? He says in our family standard
6661760	6665040	It's very easy. You want your phone you got to have straight a's he's got to be
6665680	6670800	I said, well, let me get to straight your 17 year old son doesn't have a phone because he doesn't have one
6671200	6673200	Because he has one because yeah, it's our standard
6673520	6676800	I said, what are you talking about? This is very simple. You just got to make sure you got straight a's
6677120	6679120	You'll get a phone you get the car you get this
6679520	6685280	Now somebody's going to listen to this and say what what a freaking extreme set of standards. That's tyranny. That's tyranny
6685680	6691760	That's exactly the type of kids that end up becoming da da da. No problem. It's called standards and expectations
6692160	6694720	And for a family who has the ability
6695280	6698480	To use money and waste it and do whatever they want to keep that kind of standards
6698480	6702080	I respect that even more and guess what the son loves his father
6702640	6705440	Loves his mother loves their grandparents respectful kids
6705840	6707840	So it's it's not easy to do
6708080	6710960	But if it matters to you eventually in my life when I say I'm greedy
6711280	6715680	I would love to create a proposition for my kids. We're 20 years from now. They want to run one of the companies
6715680	6716720	I want to be within the company
6716720	6721040	They want to work with one of the companies and I like them to live close to me. Will it happen
6721440	6726480	It's going to take us 30 years to find out because dude pan generational housing. I'm seeing it in austin, right?
6727280	6732160	Commune or ranch where someone's buying up a ton of land and then there's another one of those puppies down there
6732160	6736320	If you want to they're buying up a ton of land and we're going to not just have us
6736400	6738320	We're going to have somebody else come and live with us as well
6738320	6742480	We're going to have grandma and grandpa and they're going to be that this is the way that it was
6742880	6745600	This is the way that it was and here's another thing to consider, right?
6746400	6751280	Would you rather have drinking too? Going to do anything to me or no, what's you're going to survive?
6751360	6754320	You're going to be dialed in you're going to survive. I promise
6754960	6757520	Whatever whatever the internet throws at you. You'll survive. So
6758480	6760480	What is the uh
6761200	6765840	Yeah, so we've got that's citrus that one's orange one sunrise. Okay, yeah wild citrus so
6767680	6770400	One of the interesting questions that you have here would be
6773920	6777760	Would you rather have a parent who pities you more than they believe in you?
6779680	6783440	You didn't do well. It's okay. That teacher doesn't understand
6783920	6787280	Let me pat you on the back come here little timmy will take you for ice cream
6787440	6789440	Or would you rather have a parent who says
6790480	6792640	I believe in you more than more than I pity you
6793920	6798160	I mean look, I'll tell you my dad very annoying man. Okay
6798880	6800320	because
6800320	6802960	Never sympathized never felt sorry for anything
6803760	6807200	Never it was always stands on expectation, but he always loved me
6807680	6810720	So when I was six years old and my teacher asked me what do you want to be when you grow up?
6810720	6814080	I said I want to be a father. Why I said because I want to be like my dad
6814640	6819040	I had a very good dad. My dad's still with us. He was in a hospital this week, but he's out. He's doing good. He's at the house
6819760	6823520	Kids love him. Everybody loves him. My kids all have a relationship with him. He's 81 years old
6825200	6828880	It took a lot to please my dad my dad wasn't impressed by anything
6829280	6831280	He wouldn't be there and say, oh my gosh
6831360	6835520	And by the way, he's a middle eastern father, which means I've never played catch with the guy
6836000	6841600	We've never thrown the football. We never played anything. No sport. Why why he just he was a worker since eighth grade
6841600	6846640	He dropped out in iran and started working to take care of his mom and dad. Their family was very very close
6847440	6852400	You know, but again, remember how earlier on when we're talking about, you know, choosing your enemies wisely
6852960	6856560	We talked about how the the top performers have
6857360	6858320	a
6858320	6864080	Person that gave him unconditional love and one that brought a lot of pain and then they chose their enemies wisely
6864960	6866960	I think
6867360	6869760	The role of a person that is gentle
6871680	6875280	And another one that nothing's ever good enough is a great combination
6876080	6880960	I think if both parents are gentle, that's a problem and I also think if both
6882400	6887200	Parents are nothing's ever good enough is also a problem. Yeah, I think you need a little bit
6887200	6890080	There's a reason why the creator god
6890720	6892720	Created the dynamics that he created
6893520	6897280	You know, I have a one of our guys we're spending our photographers with us
6897680	6900560	And he's holding his daughter while we're doing a photo shoot this Saturday
6901280	6903280	And she keeps asking for mom
6903520	6906880	She keeps asking I said she's she daddy's girl. Oh, it's just now. It's all mommy
6907360	6910000	I said, when does she want you whenever she's scared? She comes to me
6911360	6915600	So the kid runs to daddy when she's scared but goes to mommy when she's hurt
6916720	6920640	That's your interesting dynamic. How it is she feels safer
6921920	6923920	By dad when there's a risk
6924880	6929920	But feel safer by mom when she's hurt because she's gonna be pampered and taking care of it. Yeah
6930640	6935360	I think that's very healthy combination. There was a quarterback bread far many years ago
6935360	6939840	I don't know if you know, bear bread far. He's a famous texture. That's an inside joke if you know who he is but
6942800	6944560	He has his quarterback
6944560	6946560	He has his coach so tough on him
6947360	6951440	So tough on him. Nothing was ever good with this quarterback kicking his ass
6952000	6956400	Talking shit to him in the sideline. How could you throw that interception? What the fuck was that all about?
6956400	6960320	What was that all about and he's afraid of the coach and he's always escaping the coach
6960800	6964240	But there was a guy that was I think his name was mariochi stave mariochi
6964800	6968480	And he would always put his arm around and listen. He believes in you. Why don't you prove him right?
6968960	6972640	Deep down inside. He believes in you go through the past that you know, he knows he can throw
6973200	6975920	Show him exactly what we got. Let's go win this game for him. Let's go
6976480	6982800	So that dynamic worked incredibly well for bread far as well as many other players out there
6983200	6984560	So I think
6984560	6988000	You know one without the other is a problem if you got both. It's a great combination
6988880	6990960	Yeah, there's a lot of problems with
6990960	6992960	fatherlessness in homes
6992960	6996400	Melissa carney just wrote a new book called the two parent advantage
6996880	7002960	Two parent privilege. Sorry and uh, dude, it's terrifying just the raw data the raw outcomes that you get
7003520	7007920	Your mom and dad stay together. Yes. Okay. Uh, we till today. Yep only child
7008320	7012400	So only child only child. Do you have the only child uh syndrome? Yes. What do you mean?
7012480	7014960	The guy that's the center of all of these lights and stuff
7016320	7020800	In some regards, okay in some regards. Yes, but I think I had quite a stern upbringing
7020800	7027440	I was held to incredibly high standards. Uh, it was very non-rebellious as a kid. Um, non-rebellious very non-rebellious
7027600	7031440	Very very non-rebellious. Um, you know, wasn't going out wasn't sneaking out
7031680	7034640	I don't think I ever got grounded once the god play role or no
7035360	7039680	Standards and expectation was a tough standard high very high. What did your mom and dad do?
7040400	7046880	Dad is an engineer mom stopped working for probably 10 to 12 years to raise me while dad was out working
7047200	7050640	Uh, but this isn't you know, dad was on the working class of most working class
7050640	7056160	We live in a a city in the uk that was famous only for having the highest teen pregnancy rating in the uk
7056320	7060880	And then it lost that so it didn't even have that as a as a title anymore at least you could brag about it
7060880	7064240	Now we got nothing to talk about. Yeah, we haven't even got that. Yeah, uh, so
7064880	7067920	But it was it was very formative and you know, I'm just thinking more and more
7068720	7071760	About this tension between success making people soft
7072320	7077040	Uh, I spoke to David Goggins about it on the podcast, you know, he's this guy who can command
7078080	7084000	Millions of dollars for speaking gigs and he's choosing to go smoke jumping. Have you seen this thing that he's doing?
7084240	7089120	So smoke jumping is when there's a wildfire in the middle of nowhere and they need to air drop in
7089680	7093040	The firefighters so they parachute in with a
7093680	7099360	Pack around their waist with all their stuff on and they also put water huge
7100000	7105840	Water bucket things that they'll attach their hoses to separately parachute them in and they just live in the fire
7106160	7109200	Until they put it out. Sometimes they're out there for a week pretty sure he makes
7109920	7111920	It's either seven or twelve dollars an hour
7112560	7116720	That he makes for doing this smoke jumping as it's called. It's in canada for the most part
7117440	7121600	Instead of going and doing this speaking to it and I asked him about success making you soft
7121840	7126640	He says I see it way too much and that's why I don't like it. I'm not about the flash
7126640	7128800	I'm not about any of that when the best books in business
7129280	7134240	Was written by a legend see legendary ceo in silicon valley
7134720	7138080	Who ran intel? I think he's the only guy that for a decade straight
7138080	7143840	He grew the company a hundred percent every year unheard of what this guy did and the growth hungarian guy
7144080	7147520	Okay, you know what the book's title is only the paranoid survive
7148400	7153840	Only the paranoid say that before so I had a question to you around only the paranoid survive
7155760	7157280	I don't disagree
7157280	7162400	That paranoia is an unbelievable competitive advantage. It's a very useful performance enhancer, right?
7162480	7167280	You are paying more attention. You are more detail oriented. You're more fearful
7167920	7169600	all the rest of it
7169600	7174080	Ultimately, is it worth it? Do you think is paranoia worth it as a life strategy?
7174800	7178880	It the you are protected by those who take that seriously
7179360	7184000	Okay, you know burden is not something that's a sexy sell
7184640	7188480	You know, there's a lot of things that you and I can sell that's very sexy
7188960	7195520	Okay, work from home very sexy yet the loneliness epidemic in america right now is record breaking numbers
7195520	7197520	we've never seen before right on
7198320	7204560	What people are doing how lonely they are numbers on depression is off the charts right now compared to what it was just 10 years ago
7205360	7206240	So
7206240	7212160	Yeah, you can sell work from home. You can sell three and a half day work week. You can sell
7212800	7214800	Laptop entrepreneur. You can sell
7215760	7218240	These are all sexy things to sell right you can sell
7218720	7222240	Set up a funnel and make 20 grand a month and don't have to do anything
7222640	7226560	These are all very interesting easy things to sell try selling burden
7227200	7229040	go ahead and sell burden
7229040	7237120	Oh, dude of the incredible honor of having burden of the responsibility of a nation or a state or a military or freedom
7237120	7238320	I thought was a
7238320	7243280	Try selling it. It's no, but it's not an easy sale. It's a hard sale. Responsibility isn't sexy
7243440	7248160	So why are so many great leaders turned on by that burden?
7249040	7251040	Why because someone's got to do it
7251120	7253120	So it all depends, you know
7253120	7255600	In the in the book your next five moves I talk about how
7256160	7258480	The most important question you got to answer in life is
7259040	7260480	Who do you want to be?
7260480	7263840	What type of life do you want to live? That's simple. Okay, so what does this mean?
7264400	7267120	Do you want to be a founder? Yeah, you sure?
7268240	7269680	Yeah
7269680	7273520	Positive I think so it's kind of cool right want to be a founder entrepreneur
7274000	7276800	You sure you want to be a founder? You sure you want to be the number one guy?
7276800	7279840	Tom Ellsworth who is my business partner said one the best things to me
7280400	7281920	this guy was at
7281920	7286800	Talk about the legendary interview of all time. It's the last interview of steve jobs and bill gates in silicon valley
7287040	7288240	Okay, wherever it was
7288240	7292800	300 people were invited at this meeting tom was one of them said recorded. It's record. You got to see it
7292800	7297520	By the way sick. It's the red chair when you see the red chair. You're watching the right one steve jobs is super skinny
7298240	7301280	Tom Ellsworth tells me says pat it took me 50 years to realize
7302240	7304400	I don't make a lot of money when i'm the number one guy
7305120	7307120	The most money I ever made
7307120	7309120	Is when I was number two through number six
7310560	7312400	Think about saying that
7312400	7316720	I think about taking 52 years to realize 50 years to realize the most money you ever made
7317280	7319680	Was when you were the number two guy or number six guy?
7320240	7322240	Because there's burden with number one
7322400	7324080	Number one has got to sell the dream
7324080	7325840	Number one has got to sell the vision
7325840	7328320	Number one has got to seem like even though we're about to go out of business
7328800	7332320	They're at peace. They're calm. They carry the burden sleepless nights
7332960	7337760	Your finances you can't reveal to people if you're about to run out of money. We're gonna make the expenses
7337760	7343200	We're gonna make salaries. We're gonna pay payroll. That's the number one person who wants that burden. Nobody wants that burden
7344000	7347120	So no if the idea is to sell that
7347920	7349920	No, it is not an easy sale
7350160	7354240	but if you want to know why you right now are here
7354960	7357840	And we are able to do this podcast at a
7358880	7361360	Pretty unstable time in the world today
7362000	7364480	It's probably because around 500 people
7365280	7369520	Have the burden of making sure nobody messes with you and I where we are right now
7369920	7371920	And those 500 people have
7371920	7376480	A thousand people underneath them or 500 people underneath them why you and I are able to sit here
7376720	7381760	So it's not the most sexy attractive thing like in in smithsonian. I don't know if you've been to the smithsonian in dc
7382240	7384240	There's a part where you go and it shows
7384880	7388720	You walk this way. It shows how lincoln aged over
7389440	7394080	It's an incredible thing to see and there's a quote they buy by lincoln about burden
7394960	7398480	Okay, the the being a president is the greatest burden
7398960	7402400	A person can never have right some some quote like that. I'm paraphrasing
7402800	7405600	So it's not for everybody and it's not a sale the person chooses to do it
7405920	7407920	Obama before and after
7408160	7412320	His eight years right. He still looks good though. Oh, he's still got he's still got swagger
7412320	7414320	But I mean that was 20 years in eight years. That's right
7414800	7421520	So this is something I wanted to talk about you have spent a lot of time reading about and researching and speaking to
7422240	7424240	powerful people
7424320	7426320	Who do you think really runs the world?
7427920	7430560	You're gonna go there, huh with the question. Who do I think runs the world?
7430640	7432640	Um
7432880	7436000	So I used to ask the question I said who who's got the most power in america?
7436000	7440000	Is it congress is a president is it the CEOs of virtual governments?
7440000	7442000	We're talking google twitter facebook
7442480	7446240	You know those guys amazon, you know, or is it billionaires?
7446560	7452080	Okay, you know the most richest man in the world. Who's got the most power and you'd be amazed how few people said president
7452960	7454400	Does it come and go?
7454400	7458000	You know the famous quote with putin that he says, you know
7458720	7461920	American presidents you don't have to worry about it. They're gonna be there four to eight years
7462000	7464800	Some suits are running, you know and run the country behind closed doors
7465360	7468320	And he's got a very good point when he says something like that putin
7469120	7471040	but to me
7471040	7473040	There are a lot of
7474800	7480800	Alliances being built so if you and I were to think about aspirational type of people, okay, you know how they say
7481760	7486240	You know, well michael jackson eventually got to a point where he got so many different girls that he started trying with this
7486240	7490320	And he started trying with this and a lot of these people in hollywood have so much sex with so many different people
7490320	7493760	That they become creative and they do dumb things, right? Okay
7494640	7496880	Tiger woods the reason why he got these girls because what do you know?
7496880	7500320	What it is to be the greatest golf golf in the world and everybody throws their panties at you
7500720	7501920	You want to judge a guy like that?
7501920	7504960	Why don't you go be the greatest golfer and see what it feels like to be one out of eight billion?
7505200	7508400	You don't know what it's like. So they're kind of trying and experimenting with all this stuff, right?
7508720	7512240	It's almost like i'm so much in a prison jail. Everybody's watching what i'm doing
7512240	7514720	I'm going to break the rules a little bit to see what i'm capable of doing. Okay
7515440	7521360	So so let's go process and dissect some of these guys that make all the money in the world. Okay, you become a billionaire
7523600	7529760	And you're still dangerously ambitious not from a good place, but more selfish place
7531280	7534880	Okay, you took over an industry now you're worth five billion dollars
7535120	7540160	Now you were 10 if you're a billionaire, you're the best at what you do in your space for the most part or you help build
7541040	7543200	The best in that space for the most part. Okay
7544000	7546000	cool, so
7547120	7550640	Maybe your marriage didn't work out. Maybe you're not the best father in the world
7551920	7553920	And you're like, well
7554800	7557440	I want more control. I want more power
7558720	7559920	I can't be a president
7559920	7562240	I don't want to be a president because if I run for president
7562240	7565920	They're gonna reveal the things that i've done in my life and god forbid if that gets all the light
7566000	7568000	I don't want that that's embarrassing
7568000	7570880	But you know what i'm gonna do? What if I can take over the world?
7573680	7577920	Are there other people like me that are driven by wanting to take over the world?
7578800	7582880	What if we could make the world one place and we make all the decisions for everybody because
7583920	7585840	I'm probably one the smartest people in the world
7586560	7589520	I'm proud and you know that conversation is taking place again
7590320	7594400	You really start having that godlike figure like I don't know if you're familiar with george soros
7595120	7600480	You know in one of the interviews he gave to la times. He says I always fancied myself would be in a god
7601440	7603200	I fancied myself would be in a god
7603200	7607680	This is an la times interview 20 plus years ago if you type in george soros la times god
7608240	7612320	It's the most disturbing interview to read about this guy a lot of people are very skeptical about him
7612320	7616720	Right, he's like the boogie man of a number of conspiracies. How many how many people have you heard say?
7617760	7620160	I always fancied myself with being a god
7620800	7622400	he says but
7622400	7626800	What's great about where i'm at right now is it's no longer a
7627760	7629760	Dream it became a reality
7630400	7633440	I have a friend who has spent a lot of time with
7633760	7638400	Super super powerful people and he told me about a meeting that he had with one individual
7638960	7642880	In particular who spoke about being an apex predator
7643360	7647200	He said that apex predators don't care about prey and even though
7648000	7650480	The prey that he was referring to was still his own species
7651680	7656720	It was really haunting the story the way that that was told to me because you had someone who not only
7657520	7659520	Had the motivation
7659680	7662080	to be able to go and enact whatever
7663040	7665040	nefarious malicious plan
7665360	7669680	But also had the actual resources to be able to go and do it right those two things together are
7670480	7674080	They're scary and that was something that really opened my eyes
7674160	7678560	I'm very non conspiratorial in the way that I think I always lean toward
7678800	7682080	You know do not attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity
7682160	7685760	Do not attribute to coordination that which can be explained by coincidence
7686480	7687680	Uh
7687680	7690960	And yet the more that I read and the more that I learn about things
7691920	7694320	The more there there seems to be there
7695040	7696640	right
7696640	7699760	Yeah, you know people are offended by different things
7703840	7710000	Some people being offended in their deepest insecurities
7710240	7715600	They're willing to use their ambitions to go to certain levels
7716320	7718320	That at that point they're not
7718720	7724240	Thinking about the consequences of ruining a lot of people's lives. That's not something they're thinking about at that level. So
7725360	7729680	Hitler was offended when you read my comb for you study what Hitler did. He was simply offended
7730320	7735440	Somebody offended him. So his entire life was about doing what he did just because he was offended
7736320	7739600	Now most people who are offended they do what they forget about it
7740240	7743840	And they move on some of these guys want control some of these guys
7744480	7749520	Want to make decisions for you some of these guys on the money side at least they go and make money to get power
7750000	7754400	Some people don't go make money to get power. Some people cloud swab. They're like no, I'm not going to go make money to get power
7754880	7759280	I'm going to get power by creating laws and thinking. I know what's best for you
7759920	7763120	So there's a lot of different people that you can put in these steps of organization
7763120	7765120	You just have to think like if you were to think about
7765680	7770880	The commission of the mop always go back to it. Lucky Luciano created a commission with the five families
7771200	7773600	He was the one that ran the commission right up the five families. Okay
7774240	7779680	When you think about what meetings in the world happens where all the powerful people show up you get the g20
7780480	7785840	You got the un you got the world economy. You got davos. You got all these guys that come together
7786480	7788080	You got nato
7788080	7789440	you got
7789440	7791440	So nato could be like well nato's
7791520	7796640	Original when the 12 or 14 countries were part of nato. What was it really all about to fight ussr?
7796880	7800400	There is no ussr. Why are we still funding it? What's the outcome now?
7801040	7806480	Are we still fighting communism? So what a lot of people might say is that those organizations are
7807280	7810400	So obvious that they can't be the ones where the real shit's happening, right?
7810400	7815520	That's just the smoke screen the real shit is the shit that's behind it and the shit that's behind that and so on and so forth
7816000	7818640	In your opinion, do you think that nato wef
7819440	7822240	who that's those people there's no
7823120	7830480	Further upset of strings that are playing the ventriloquized game behind those ones. Do you think that that's where a lot of power actually lies?
7831440	7832640	um
7832640	7837120	I don't know what I will say listen to you is with the questions you're asking
7837840	7838880	I think
7838880	7843440	There's a reason why the audience wants to hear what you think about what's going on right now because you're asking some heavy questions
7843680	7846880	Right now, which means you're curious and if i'm the audience
7846880	7852640	I would like to know what you can come up with if you took a deeper dive and really wanted to get into these types of
7853120	7854880	you know informations but
7854880	7856880	you know
7858080	7860640	Think about what things people are most addicted to
7861280	7865520	Okay, addictive personalities video games porn sex
7866160	7867280	cocaine
7867280	7868880	ecstasy
7868880	7870640	weed
7870640	7872000	steroids
7872000	7873440	party in
7873440	7875440	all of that stuff
7875440	7877440	But what's one of the most addicting things?
7878560	7881600	That many of those guys can't get power
7882240	7884240	Are you kidding me power is like
7884800	7886240	power
7886240	7887600	porn
7887600	7889600	The porn of having a lot of power
7890160	7895040	And getting the look and people that look at you that are afraid of you some people love that
7895920	7900640	Some people love that you know the quote like if you really want to test someone's character given power. I mean some people
7901360	7902480	really
7902560	7907440	Love having power take a company and see some of the guys that they hired they hired a wrong person at the top
7907840	7909840	The guy was all driven by power. What happens?
7910480	7916720	Take a president that becomes a president and he realizes he can use the justice system against his opponent. What happens?
7917280	7919840	They got that power. It's a lot of power to give to somebody, right?
7920800	7922080	um
7922080	7925920	Yeah, so you know those people I believe are out there some of them are
7926720	7932000	100 money people because money talks and you can have a lot of you need funds to do anything, right?
7932160	7934240	You do it's it's going to be the money people
7934880	7935840	um
7935840	7941680	But there's also the other power players behind closed doors that you know in the in the movie money ball
7942400	7946080	Uh, Jonah Hill plays that. I don't know if i'm saying his name correctly. He plays the role
7946720	7948160	of the guy that
7948160	7949760	Brad Pitt is sitting there saying
7949760	7952800	Why is this gm of cleveland indians keeps looking at the guy?
7955120	7960160	Doesn't gotten based who the hell are you right in john john maxwell or or
7960640	7963440	Dale Carnegie wrote about this in a book saying the law of e.f. Hutton
7964480	7967920	E.f. Hutton was in the room that every time the guy was making a decision
7967920	7969920	He wouldn't make a decision until he asked about e.f. Hutton
7970560	7973520	So here's what we're going to do. So what's your proposal? Okay, great
7974320	7976320	Hey, e.f. Hutton, what do you think about it?
7976560	7978560	Okay, we're not going to be doing it great
7979360	7983680	The world is filled with like henry kissinger. I don't know how much you know about henry kissinger
7983760	7986320	That guy's an e.f. Hutton if there ever was one
7987440	7988800	There's a lot of
7988880	7990880	those guys
7990880	7992320	that
7992320	7997840	Are the brains behind the faces that we see and most of the times the best e.f. Hutton's
7998400	8000400	No one ever finds out who they were
8001600	8003600	No one ever finds out who those guys are
8004000	8006400	one of the other tensions that I felt when
8007200	8009520	Learning about you and also when watching your content
8010240	8012320	You've spoken about this specifically to do with kobe
8012560	8017840	But I think it also probably plays a role in almost everybody's life is this tension between self love and high standards
8018240	8022000	Right, it's the desire to maximize everything you can and to not leave
8022560	8028720	More on the table than you need to and also the ability to enjoy the moment and to be able to actually take some some pleasure in that
8029280	8032800	And there was a something that came up from a friend that I wrote about this week
8032800	8034640	So I wanted to explain this to you
8034640	8036640	He did a psilocybin journey in
8037120	8043280	Australia and a question came to him and the question was do people love you for who you are or for what you do
8044000	8046000	This is uncomfortable to consider
8046320	8050480	People loving us for who we are feels more real genuine caring empathetic and robust
8050720	8053520	It feels like we're less fickle and more difficult to lose
8053840	8057600	On the other hand people loving us for what we do feels transactional and transient
8057840	8062560	The love that we receive becomes contingent on what achievements and successes we can offer in return
8062960	8067520	And the obvious fear is that if a point came where we no longer had anything to offer in return
8068000	8070000	Would our love be taken away?
8070000	8072240	So here's an even more uncomfortable question
8072800	8075840	Do you love you for who you are or for what you do?
8077120	8078640	This highlights our hypocrisy
8078640	8084480	You see we want the world to love us for who we are a balanced caring view of our true value independent of our accomplishments
8084960	8088960	Meanwhile, our own self-love is largely determined by what we do
8089520	8092080	If we fall short even though we know we tried our best
8092320	8095440	We still castigate ourselves for being insufficient, unworthy creatures
8095840	8100880	So we want the world to show up for us in a way that we are often not prepared to show up for ourselves
8101280	8104080	You demand more than this demanded of yourself
8104960	8106960	powerful
8106960	8112880	Do you see that resonating this tension in high performers desire for more requirement for self-love?
8114400	8116400	Yes, but for me
8117120	8119120	There's a part of it. That's also honest
8120080	8124240	Because again the relationship with between a man and a prostitute
8125440	8127280	What is that relationship?
8127280	8129280	Each side is getting something in return
8129920	8131920	The prostitute is getting what?
8131920	8139680	Money, what's the man getting pleasure? Okay, and they walk away. It's done. It's a very honest relationship, right?
8139680	8144640	There's no depth in that relationship. It's straight up. It's honest done. We move on. Okay
8148640	8150640	Working at a company
8151120	8153120	Say you work with a company
8153680	8158800	And he helps the youtube channel go to the next level doing all the work behind closed doors all this stuff
8159920	8161920	Would he do that job for free?
8162320	8167040	Or would he do it because you're offering something back to them? How many of my employees would be with me?
8167760	8169760	If it was working for free
8171280	8176960	That non-profit would be kind of weird guys. What we're doing is very important, but I need you to work for free
8177840	8182240	What do you mean? Are you gonna make money? I am but I want you to work for free. It's kind of weird, right?
8182240	8184560	There needs to be an exchange again. It's honest
8185360	8187360	exchange, okay
8187920	8189600	Um
8189600	8194560	If I go above and beyond everybody else and I work should I deserve the right to get paid more?
8195440	8199920	Yes, okay. Is it beneficial for me to work with somebody like you?
8200320	8202400	Of course, why because you're driven
8202800	8207600	So should I hang on to your co-tail because if I go with you big things are gonna happen in my life? Absolutely
8208080	8214720	Is that a selfish decision? Yes, but it's also a wise decision. Do you know that you know that do they know that they know that
8215440	8219760	Do they also know that you have options because now you're at a point that a lot of people would love to be working for you
8219760	8222400	Of course, they know that they're not dummies, right? They know that
8223040	8227440	Okay, but you still choose to stay with them and they still choose to choose to stay with you
8227840	8232800	Is there benefit of somebody hiring your person that's helping with your podcast and paying twice as you pay to go with them?
8233200	8234720	there is
8234720	8236720	If he chooses to take that
8236880	8238880	Just for the money. That's his loss
8239280	8243840	If you're doing your part, he was never in it for believing in you. It was only about the money part
8244800	8251440	So these are all and the reason why this is so interesting what what you're reading about self-love and all these other things
8252160	8256800	Is when you look at some of the people that make it at the highest of the highest of the highest level
8257360	8260000	They typically have been backstabbed so much
8260560	8264480	That in the back of their mind, sometimes they're just waiting to see who's going to backstab next
8265040	8269600	So so the desire to have a straight up relationship is no longer the same. Okay
8269920	8272720	There's a difference between you dating somebody who falls in love with you
8272960	8275280	And you're making 22 bucks an hour working at ballies
8275840	8280240	And she loves you and she stays with you. There's a difference between you getting married when you're making
8280960	8282640	$300,000 a year
8282640	8286560	And then there's a difference between you making marrying somebody when you work half a billion dollars
8287040	8290720	How do you know the girl that marries you at the end is worth? You know is with you because
8291840	8298080	She loves you versus she loves what you offer them, right? And is that a sin? Yeah, is she making a mistake? You know
8300320	8302320	I think in an ideal world
8303200	8309040	I am very comfortable knowing that other people are also there in your life to get what they can out of you
8310880	8312880	I'm very comfortable with that
8312880	8315040	Because there's a chapter in the book here
8315600	8320560	Where I talk about choosing running mates and I put a clear criteria on how to choose a running mate
8321040	8324320	You know what they bring to the table their level of trust with you
8324800	8327840	All these ways of scoring people in your life to see hey
8328320	8333040	Is this a person because the whole concept would choose a new enemies wisely also need to choose your allies wisely
8333520	8338080	So somebody like you you need true believers in your life. You can't have 50 true believers
8338160	8341680	That's just naive to think that you can't have 10 true believers
8342160	8347520	Can you have two to five true believers? Yes. How how valuable is that a lot? So
8348320	8351280	No, I uh, you know the more and more I moved up
8351840	8356720	The more I realized almost everybody like and I'm talking 99 percent of people
8357360	8361520	Listen to the radio show wiifm. What's in it for me?
8362080	8363120	and
8363120	8367600	A part in this book that we dissected your question, which is fascinating question is
8368400	8371840	In in the company. I've been running a sales organization for 20 something years
8372320	8376880	And when I started the insurance company in online, we grew it from 66 agents today. We have 50 000 agents
8376880	8379380	We've licensed nationwide. We have a few hundred offices nationwide
8379380	8381380	but
8382020	8383620	my
8383620	8387860	Idea of looking at who's got the biggest upside to contribute to the company has also changed
8388420	8390420	It used to be men that guy so selfish
8391620	8395140	All that guy cares about money. I mean this guy's the nicest guy in the world
8395860	8397460	and then I realized
8397460	8399460	the nicest guy in the world
8399780	8401780	Who had no selfish desires
8402420	8404420	Was happy making five thousand dollars a month
8405940	8408500	And so then I created a scoring system
8409380	8414500	What percentage of you is selfish and selfless and what's the good balance?
8415220	8417220	If you're a hundred percent only you
8417220	8422660	And everybody else zero well, guess what you're still a bigger net positive to society than the person at the bottom
8422660	8427860	That's what zero percent selfish and a hundred percent selfless if a person is a hundred percent selfless
8428500	8431780	They probably don't eat well. They probably out of shape. They're probably not healthy
8431780	8434420	They're probably gonna have to go to the hospital. It's gonna cost you money and taxes
8434660	8438020	They probably smell because they don't take a shower. They spend their money on everybody else
8438660	8440660	So then you'll see the profile
8440660	8445700	Good people to give you counsel or around the 50 50 range. You can always trust them to give you counsel
8446420	8450660	Drivers of a company or somebody like you doing what they do 70 30 is a good split
8451300	8453700	Okay, 80 20 is a little bit problematic
8454180	8460340	Because 80 20 sometimes will compromise to beat everybody. So you want the 65 70 so so you're asking a technical question
8461060	8462500	and
8462500	8464500	I've just come to a conclusion
8464500	8465540	that
8465540	8466580	you know
8466580	8470500	Both parties if they want to selfishly be pleased
8471380	8473380	if we can please each other
8474020	8479460	And one of us takes the lead and we're getting mutual love and benefits out of the relationship
8480900	8484980	You're in a good situation every once in a while you'll find somebody that's going to be a writer that they're going to say chris
8486020	8490340	Dude, no matter what you do and with you till the day you die and you think they're telling the truth
8491540	8493540	A year goes by they're still there even more
8493780	8497300	Five years go by they got married like one wing and money gets married and ask you it's going to change
8497380	8501540	Still there 10 years later still there you're like this guy's really a true believer. Wow
8502100	8504820	But it's not going to be that many people. That's a very short list of people
8505940	8511380	Patrick bet David ladies and gentlemen Patrick. I appreciate the hell out of you. I appreciate how much you pay attention
