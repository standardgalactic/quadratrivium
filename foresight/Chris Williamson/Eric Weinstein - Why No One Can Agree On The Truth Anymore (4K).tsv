0	5000	You just came back from your first holiday in quite a while.
5000	10000	Well, my first holiday of, let's say, three weeks or more in quite a while.
10000	11000	How was that?
11000	13000	Astounding.
13000	21000	Really very good to see what's going on in the rest of the world at this particular moment.
21000	26000	We had previously gone to India in the year to visit family.
26000	32000	This was to go back to Turkey and to go to Portugal, but also to the Azores Islands.
32000	39000	I can't tell you how meaningful it was for me to be back traveling.
39000	40000	Why?
40000	44000	Well, I mean, partially it's reacquaint.
44000	48000	When you have children and children change your game for about two decades,
48000	51000	you have to realize that that's a transient period.
51000	54000	It felt like it was going to go on forever.
54000	59000	This was sort of trying to figure out what is it like to go from traveling in your 20s and 30s with that kids
59000	65000	to traveling with your kids at the last moment that you still have them at home.
65000	68000	Now you're going to have the rest of your life without them again,
68000	72000	but you can't go back to backpacking and doing certain other things that were easy for you.
72000	77000	You have to figure out how to rejoin your previous life that has been in progress without you actually.
77000	78000	Ending for a long time.
78000	79000	Exactly.
79000	81000	That's sabbatical from life almost.
81000	84000	Another thing is that you forget about parts of yourself.
84000	94000	I forgot that I spoke Turkish not well, but I spoke rudimentary Tarzan Turkish 30 years ago.
94000	101000	To be back in Istanbul and suddenly have words and phrases and things come back
101000	106000	and be talking to cab drivers and just people in the street seeing the change.
106000	110000	Obviously, there's been an enormous amount of change in Turkey.
110000	115000	Portugal is fascinating seeing certain things at the end of their life cycle.
115000	120000	We were at a synagogue in Bursa where the home of the Ottoman Empire,
120000	125000	where they were down to their last 50 people, which is a common enough thing
125000	131000	when we visit diaspora Jewish communities at the tail end with the embers still glowing hot
131000	134000	but no chance for a rebirth.
134000	143000	Then in the Azores, I was not prepared for the level of beauty that we encountered.
143000	149000	There is a level of beauty that I've only experienced two, maybe three times in my life
149000	154000	that sort of leaves you physically sick, like ill.
154000	158000	It's so beautiful that your body is the weak link.
158000	162000	You might think that sugar is tasty, but if you were to eat a bag of sugar,
162000	164000	you'd probably be sick to your stomach.
164000	171000	I would say this was so much beauty that it was at an almost pathological level
171000	176000	and more than I think my family could really take in.
176000	177000	We're just so moving.
177000	181000	I've heard you say before about how a lot of the time you don't realize
181000	184000	the last time you're going to do a thing with a person.
184000	188000	A lot of friends, especially ones that are fathers, have told me the same thing.
188000	190000	The last time that you'll bounce your daughter on your knee.
190000	192000	You don't know when it's going to happen, but it's going to happen.
192000	196000	There's also a really strange realization when you get deeper into adulthood
196000	199000	and work out that probably by the age of 18 or 20,
199000	204000	you've spent 97 or 98% of the time you're going to spend with your parents.
204000	207000	All that you wanted for the last four years was to be away from them
207000	211000	and now all that you want is to have a little bit more time and it's all gone
211000	212000	and you squandered it while it was there.
212000	214000	I'm on the ethnic program.
214000	216000	We don't believe in this stuff.
217000	220000	My children don't become adults at the age of 18.
220000	224000	I don't care about the laws of the United States or the state of California.
224000	227000	I think we do family wrong in the States.
227000	231000	You send them off to college and then you tell them,
231000	236000	go follow your dream and they bounce into some locality that you aren't in
236000	239000	and you don't get the benefit of these very strong families
239000	243000	because the market has been so strong in the US for so long.
243000	247000	And the market more or less took over all sorts of duties
247000	249000	that were assigned to families historically.
249000	251000	And so the reason that people always say,
251000	255000	oh, your families are weak was because our markets were strong, right?
255000	258000	And so insurance and opportunity,
258000	264000	all of these things that could be handed over to the market were.
264000	268000	And as a result, when we find out that the markets are not safe,
268000	272000	we realize that we've abandoned the structures that we needed to retreat to
272000	276000	that our families are quite small, below replacement rate very often.
276000	278000	And we don't live in the same place.
278000	280000	And so, you know, I married a woman from India
280000	284000	and I basically carry a lot of Eastern European norms.
284000	287000	And so my feeling is that my children are my children forever.
287000	289000	And I'm not letting go of them.
289000	293000	And this idea that it's your life and you can do what you want
293000	295000	is only true up to a point.
295000	297000	You also have a continuity issue.
297000	299000	And this is normal, by the way.
299000	303000	And it may sound weird in an American context,
303000	306000	but I think that the world recognizes that we're links in a chain
306000	309000	and there's a certain amount that you get to do that's just yours
309000	313000	because it's your life, but never go full Billy Joel.
313000	314000	Yeah.
314000	317000	Pan-generational housing is something being in Austin,
317000	320000	people getting ranches, starting even commune,
320000	323000	you know, 10 family mini villages with a bunch of other people.
323000	324000	Yeah.
324000	327000	It's something that I'm seeing occur more and more.
327000	332000	And, you know, in an atomized, like mass solipsism,
332000	335000	mass individualism society, this doesn't sound like a bad redress.
335000	336000	We got to the end of it.
336000	338000	We got to the end of that dream.
338000	341000	And it didn't work.
341000	344000	You've been around a lot of very powerful, very rich people
344000	345000	throughout your career.
345000	346000	No, no, that's not true.
346000	349000	Only relatively recently, only in the last decade and a half.
349000	352000	That's quite a while in many people's lives.
352000	360000	What do you think that most normal people would be surprised to know
360000	366000	about the powerful and the rich individuals, world views,
366000	369000	the way that they hold themselves, what is and isn't true?
369000	373000	They feel powerless.
373000	379000	That's one of the craziest things is that very often you're at a table
379000	385000	of people of immeasurable wealth and they're talking about the rich
385000	387000	or the hyper-connected.
387000	390000	They don't see themselves in these terms.
390000	391000	Why?
391000	394000	I think there's different kinds of rich, to be honest.
394000	402000	I think that if, for example, you got rich from, let's say, arms manufacturing,
402000	406000	you've been entwined with government your whole life or agriculture,
406000	413000	something that's highly regulated that extraction oil and gas.
413000	417000	Those people, I think, have always been close to power.
417000	421000	A lot of the dream of tech, for example, was we don't need the government.
421000	426000	We'll just build stuff in our garages and if it's cool, it'll take care of itself.
426000	431000	And therefore, we're minimally dependent on the traditional ecosystems.
431000	436000	So a lot of tech money felt disenfranchised.
436000	439000	They didn't know how to play the game.
439000	443000	That was both to its credit and a huge danger.
443000	447000	But I think one of the things that I find very interesting is that when people are
447000	454000	not rate-limited by money, they're rate-limited by all sorts of other things.
454000	457000	They may not want their number to go down.
457000	462000	So they go from 6 billion to 4 billion would be a huge blow,
462000	467000	even though it doesn't seem to impact normal things.
467000	472000	Another thing is that most of them have given up on the retail notion of reality.
472000	478000	Whatever mainstream media, if you have a worldview that allows you to listen
478000	484000	to national public radio that then reads the Wall Street Journal
484000	488000	and The Times and The New Yorker, whatever that point of view is,
488000	496000	most of the very powerful rich people I know have checked out at a level that is astounding.
496000	502000	They don't believe that they can afford to depend on normal institutions.
502000	504000	How does that show up in their lives?
504000	506000	Weird ways.
506000	508000	They don't have a regular doctor.
508000	510000	They have concierge medicine.
510000	515000	Their fire policy comes with a private fire department that will fight for their home
515000	518000	but won't necessarily fight for homes next door unless it's just-
518000	521000	I didn't know that that was a thing, okay?
521000	526000	You know, it's not until you travel with some of these people
526000	530000	that you realize that there's a secret corridor in the airport
530000	532000	or a way of getting onto the plane.
532000	537000	There's a lot of infrastructure built for a very small number of people.
538000	542000	For the most part, they can't figure out what to do with the money.
542000	544000	It's my belief.
547000	550000	If you believe that the world is headed towards an apocalypse,
550000	553000	you're very unlikely to want to contribute money
553000	557000	because that's the only fungible thing you have in an emergency.
557000	562000	I think that a lot of the sort of apocalyptic thinking of very powerful people
562000	567000	is very destructive because they're trying to figure out
567000	570000	how to survive a mild apocalypse,
570000	572000	like a six months of your-
572000	575000	You know, if I have six months of canned goods
575000	583000	and I've got four X Navy SEALs on my property in a remote location in Montana,
583000	586000	can I weather the storm with a few diesel generators?
586000	591000	So if it's a very mild apocalypse, maybe they've got six months' plan.
592000	595000	But I think that there's a lot of thinking
595000	599000	that you should husband your resources because you don't know what's coming
599000	601000	given that things are going to have to collapse.
601000	606000	And I think it's very sad because those are the people who could shore up the system.
607000	612000	It's interesting to think about helplessness at the top end of the wealth distribution
612000	617000	given that a lot of people feel like they are restricted by their material possessions.
617000	620000	But it seems like despite there being a lot of abundance,
620000	624000	at least monetarily, the scarcity mentality scales all the way up.
624000	625000	It really does.
625000	628000	And particularly if you've been deprived early in your life,
628000	632000	there's something that happens where you're nervous till your dying day
632000	635000	that you're going to die under an overpass, right?
635000	637000	I'm not kidding.
637000	640000	One thing that I highly recommend, people never take me seriously,
640000	645000	is a video game called a tower defense game of plants versus zombies.
645000	650000	And plants versus zombies ends in a situation where you win
650000	653000	all the things you can inside of the game,
653000	657000	but somehow you still have the ability to continue to earn
657000	660000	even though there's nothing left to purchase.
660000	664000	And the reason that I find this fascinating is you get to watch your own psychology,
664000	667000	which is now that you've given yourself the ability to earn,
667000	672000	you can't bring yourself to stop earning even though earning has lost meaning.
672000	675000	And so if you can't get to that in real life,
675000	678000	you can at least get to that inside of plants versus zombies.
678000	683000	And I highly recommend it because you have to give yourself some idea of
683000	686000	we have to cross finish lines as they come.
686000	689000	If you decide, okay, when I get to $10 million,
689000	691000	that's when I can afford to become a philanthropist.
691000	693000	Then you're going to get there and you're going to realize,
693000	696000	no, the goals are going to move.
696000	698000	So think about how a waitress sees this.
698000	703000	Waitresses do philanthropy almost from the beginning.
703000	707000	They'll overtip somebody who gives them good service and they can't afford it.
707000	712000	And it's sort of a poverty trap when you're at the very low end of the earning spectrum.
712000	715000	But I think there's something to take from that,
715000	720000	which is practice a little bit of philanthropy and a little bit of kicking your shoes up
720000	727000	and not always deferring taking profit in some sense on your success.
728000	731000	So make sure that all throughout your life,
731000	735000	you're treating yourself to some luxury even when you can least afford it
735000	739000	and you're just exhibiting a little bit of goodness
739000	742000	even though you feel like you desperately need to build yourself up
742000	744000	because otherwise you'll always push it out.
744000	746000	There's a Morgan Housell quote where he says,
746000	750000	the best way to win the game is to stop moving the goalposts.
750000	754000	And he's wrote this great book called The Psychology of Money.
754000	758000	And it's true that most people treat their goals.
758000	763000	Their relationship to their goals is like the horizon that for every step toward it they get,
763000	765000	it then moves one step further away.
765000	769000	It's probably more like the horizon on a spring or on a rubber band.
769000	773000	Then it gets a little bit closer and then it bonk, it snaps away from you.
773000	779000	And I've been around a lot of people that have got chunks of wealth
780000	787000	and it's a rare thing to see someone who doesn't still have that scarcity mentality
787000	788000	despite the fact that they've acquired it.
788000	790000	You need to keep the scarcity mentality.
790000	792000	It's not a mistake.
792000	795000	The problem is that you also need an abundance mentality
795000	799000	and then you need to selectively access them in different circumstance.
799000	801000	Talk to me about the tension between those two.
801000	806000	Well, it's just this regulated expression idea that we keep trying to find settings where we don't,
807000	811000	just let me set the air conditioner at 68 and then I'll be happy forever.
811000	816000	In reality, more or less you need contradictory facilities
816000	819000	and you need to know when to pull one in and let the other out.
819000	822000	And this is the heart thing.
822000	827000	Anybody with multiple children knows that with one kid you're saying,
827000	830000	you cannot afford to take these risks.
830000	833000	If you jump off something like that and you don't look below, think what you could do.
833000	835000	The other kid needs this.
835000	837000	Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
837000	839000	Come on.
839000	845000	I've heard your brother say that him and his wife's advice to the children was
845000	848000	as long as you don't do anything to your eyes,
848000	850000	you can take the risks that you want.
850000	851000	Yes and no.
851000	853000	I mean, there's teeth, there's throats.
853000	856000	Anything somebody who does combat sports knows has to be regularly.
856000	857000	He's going to try and attack.
857000	859000	Small joints, whatever it is.
859000	862000	There are plenty of ways to get yourself into real trouble.
862000	867000	The key thing that you're trying to use childhoods for is to go through the mistakes
867000	871000	that are not permanently disfiguring.
871000	874000	It's one of the importance of having fathers around.
874000	879000	The importance of rough and tumble play is facilitated almost exclusively by fathers.
879000	883000	And you learn the limits of your strength.
883000	885000	You learn the limits of your body.
885000	887000	You learn how high of a tree you can jump off
887000	889000	and how high of a tree you can't jump off.
889000	891000	You also learn to lose.
891000	897000	I mean, I really hate some of this winter talk where basically people have no plan to lose.
897000	899000	And then when they actually experience loss,
899000	902000	they tend to throw everything away to say,
902000	905000	I didn't lose, you know, that's very interesting.

964000	969000	You met Jeffrey Epstein once.
970000	977000	Talk to me about what that's like coming face to face with somebody of that caliber.
977000	980000	Whatever that means.
980000	987000	Well, one thing is that there is a physiological reaction that corresponds to this phrase that,
987000	991000	you know, the hair on the back of my neck stood on end.
991000	994000	Like that's a real physiological feeling.
994000	998000	I don't know whether the hair actually does that, but it's exactly what it feels like.
998000	1002000	You're meeting somebody who is unholy.
1002000	1009000	And, you know, one of the most interesting things is that he was beckoning into a world
1009000	1016000	that didn't seem to exist, but for him as the doormat.
1016000	1023000	I think that's one of the things that freaked out a lot of these rich people is that he felt rich in a movie
1023000	1030000	sense, which is not something that you find among actually rich people.
1030000	1035000	What do you mean?
1035000	1042000	Well, a lot of very wealthy people don't own an island.
1042000	1046000	Islands are really tough to maintain.
1046000	1048000	I'm obsessed with islands.
1048000	1053000	And, you know, in general, I have to be obsessed with islands that have airports run by other people
1053000	1056000	because, you know, they have populations on them.
1056000	1063000	But every rich person starts to wonder, can I afford an island or how many jets?
1063000	1069000	And if you look at Jeffrey Epstein's wealth, it was beaten, it was like gold beaten into gold foil
1069000	1074000	so that it could cover a vast area and leave the impression of a solid gold life.
1074000	1081000	But it was really probably a mid nine figure fortune that had been used to buy islands and planes,
1081000	1086000	which is not what any nine figure person is going to do.
1086000	1093000	So you had a felt sense and embodied sense of discomfort?
1093000	1095000	Oh, hell yeah.
1095000	1099000	And where did that come from?
1099000	1106000	The fact that he had a lipstick camera pointed at me from an art object that he laid a table
1106000	1111000	that was preposterously long and thin with a tablecloth made of an American flag
1111000	1116000	to make it look like a coffin so that I would spill my coffee on the flag of my own country.
1116000	1123000	I mean, the fact that he looked like a mutant Ralph Lauren with this kind of labricious quality
1123000	1127000	and he's talking all of the science and market stuff and nothing adds up
1127000	1132000	and there's an heiress bouncing on his knee to get his boobs to jiggle to see whether it can distract.
1132000	1139000	I mean, it's like one of these crazy scenes where nothing about it was normal.
1139000	1143000	There was no trace of a normal world.
1143000	1145000	That sounds like a script from a movie.
1145000	1150000	Yeah, I mean, I think part of it, John Travolta is like putting a gun to your head
1150000	1153000	and forcing you to drink and break a code in a minute.
1153000	1155000	Yeah, like that part of it.
1155000	1161000	And then there was some sort of like, you know, remember that story,
1161000	1166000	the most dangerous game where a man invites you to his island so he can hunt you.
1166000	1173000	You know, this was scary and it was meant to be scary.
1173000	1174000	Sounds menacing.
1174000	1176000	Well, I think his product was silence.
1176000	1181000	People think that his product was sex or finance, but it was silence.
1181000	1182000	I'm pretty sure.
1182000	1183000	What's that mean?
1183000	1187000	If you're scary enough, look, rich people can get sex,
1187000	1194000	but they can't necessarily get people to shut up afterwards.
1194000	1201000	So my take on it and my take on it instantly was this is not an actual human.
1201000	1205000	This is a construct of someone's.
1205000	1209000	Someone has created a fake human being called Jeffrey Epstein,
1209000	1214000	who's a mysterious currency trading financier with crazy rules
1214000	1217000	so that no one would ever invest with him.
1217000	1223000	And I think that was to keep people from seeking his investment services.
1223000	1228000	I mean, you know, he's labeled disgraced financier,
1228000	1231000	but nobody has a record of trading with him.
1231000	1232000	He was sitting there.
1232000	1234000	He comes into the meeting and he says, you know,
1234000	1237000	well, Eric, I was just doing some currency trading.
1237000	1243000	And I thought about that scene that you sometimes see in as a meme
1243000	1246000	with Steve Buscemi with a skateboard over his shoulder.
1246000	1248000	Hello, fellow financier.
1248000	1250000	Hello, fellow financial traders.
1250000	1251000	Exactly.
1251000	1259000	So I'm thinking you don't really look like a rich guy who trades in markets.
1259000	1265000	The thing that's interesting that I'm finding myself intrigued by here is
1265000	1269000	it takes a moderate amount of cognitive horsepower
1269000	1278000	to be able to piece together this theater that you sat down at.
1278000	1284000	Deployed in a nefarious, malicious, manipulative way.
1284000	1286000	But it's smart.
1286000	1288000	What do you mean it's smart?
1288000	1289000	Say more.
1289000	1294000	It's not something that could be done by a simple mind.
1294000	1296000	You think he did it?
1296000	1298000	Oh, he has a team of manipulators?
1298000	1302000	No, when I say I think he was a construct, I literally mean that.
1302000	1307000	I think he was constructed, like fitted with a story.
1307000	1309000	Oh, so you think he was a plant?
1309000	1311000	No, I think he was a construct.
1311000	1312000	What's that?
1312000	1313000	Okay, you're going to have to dig in.
1313000	1325000	I think Jeffrey Epstein, a super genius financier, was not a thing that existed.
1325000	1329000	Where did the money come from?
1329000	1333000	You're going to mumble, okay, so that's what you mumble.
1333000	1337000	But then there's this missing fortune of Robert Maxwell
1337000	1340000	and this fortune of Jeffrey Epstein that we can't explain.
1340000	1342000	Are those the same fortune?
1342000	1347000	The conservation of money principle, that if you have a fortune that's missing
1347000	1351000	and you have a fortune that can't be explained in there connected by Guillain Maxwell?
1351000	1354000	I don't know.
1354000	1358000	Why is it that no hedge funds, what is it?
1358000	1362000	They file form, I forget it, it's 13F.
1362000	1366000	There's certain forms that you have to file.
1366000	1368000	Nobody's ever asked for these things.
1368000	1369000	Who's his prime broker?
1369000	1372000	Has somebody gone over the prime brokerage?
1372000	1374000	What are his trades?
1374000	1379000	He would have to move the market if he was doing a yard of euros or Swiss francs
1379000	1384000	or who knows what, like a billion, that would move the market.
1384000	1392000	So there's no way you can fake retroactively a hedge fund of immeasurable size that trades currencies.
1392000	1394000	I don't think he was a currency trader.
1394000	1396000	He told me he was a currency trader.
1396000	1399000	So when you say a construct, who constructs?
1399000	1400000	Who's the builder?
1400000	1401000	I don't know.
1401000	1406000	I would imagine some version of the intelligence community.
1406000	1410000	You know, sometimes somebody's cover gets blown.
1410000	1416000	We have a very famous unfortunate story of Ellie Cohn with the Mossad,
1416000	1424000	where Ellie Cohn was an Egyptian Jew who was fitted with a backstory that he was an Argentinian playboy
1424000	1429000	who'd made a fortune in Argentina, but was Arabic in origin,
1429000	1434000	and then he moves to Damascus and he takes out an apartment where he holds orgies
1434000	1440000	and becomes the best friend of Hafiz al-Assad, right?
1440000	1445000	And so that's an example of a story we know.
1445000	1451000	We know how the intelligence communities of the world create people who don't really exist.
1452000	1458000	I know that this is just a one-time thing here that you got to see,
1458000	1465000	but the construction of the coffin-looking American flag, the spilling of the coffee,
1465000	1468000	this weird power play thing that's going on,
1468000	1477000	that seems, now that you say that it wasn't him even pulling his own strings, perhaps,
1477000	1480000	it makes a lot more sense, but even that,
1480000	1483000	that degree of sophistication, I learned this from Daniel Schmacktenberger.
1483000	1486000	We sat down and he's spent some time with particularly powerful people,
1486000	1494000	and he told me this really harrowing story of somebody who has both the desire and the means
1494000	1499000	to treat themselves like an apex predator against their own kind,
1499000	1501000	and they said so.
1501000	1504000	They broke the fourth wall about this and said,
1504000	1509000	apex predators don't care about the prey, but they saw their own kind as prey.
1509000	1515000	I asked Daniel, how does it feel to sit opposite somebody who isn't rate limited by the resources,
1515000	1519000	who can not only dream to have this,
1519000	1526000	plus have the motivation or lack of virtue or integrity to go ahead and consider doing it,
1526000	1530000	and then has the capacity, the assets to be able to enact it.
1530000	1535000	It's reminding me, it's giving me this same something.
1535000	1538000	It feels like it's up on the top of my head.
1538000	1542000	It's giving me some sort of a sense like that.
1542000	1544000	This was intended to be terrifying.
1544000	1546000	It wasn't an accident.
1546000	1551000	It was intended to be as fascinating as it could possibly be, which it was,
1551000	1558000	and terrifying at the same time, and it achieved both objectives.
1558000	1562000	I mean, I was given an opportunity to meet him again.
1562000	1565000	I didn't know what to do.
1565000	1570000	I mean, the other thing that I just found really weird is that he knew about my research,
1570000	1575000	and it turned out that he was connected to my graduate department at Harvard.
1575000	1580000	So he had a connection to the Harvard Math Department unbeknownst to me.
1580000	1583000	I don't know when that began.
1583000	1588000	I know two of the professors he was connected through.
1589000	1591000	This is some unholy story.
1591000	1595000	It has nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein.
1595000	1597000	It has to do with whatever this thing was.
1597000	1602000	We tripped over a thing.
1602000	1605000	We tripped over a structure.
1605000	1611000	We named the structure Jeffrey Epstein.
1611000	1619000	It must be very unfortunate in some regards for whoever it was, if that's true,
1619000	1625000	that was in charge of this construction, that it became that people got t-shirts
1625000	1627000	with his name printed on them.
1627000	1633000	This was already going wrong in the early 2000s.
1633000	1639000	You see, my sense of this is that this was a pre-internet plan
1639000	1647000	that lived into the internet age and couldn't survive contact with the internet age.
1647000	1650000	What did the internet bring in that didn't allow it to survive?
1650000	1652000	Eyeballs, discussion.
1652000	1653000	Level of surveillance.
1653000	1656000	There's a claim that nobody cares about Jeffrey Epstein
1656000	1660000	because it's this many years later and we've all moved on.
1660000	1662000	That's completely untrue.
1662000	1666000	We know that it's true because if you start talking about Jeffrey Epstein,
1666000	1668000	the engagement goes up.
1669000	1675000	You have these fictions that are put out by mainstream media
1675000	1680000	or traditional news desks, which is nobody cares about that story.
1680000	1684000	You can see from social media that that's not true from the internet.
1684000	1689000	The internet is constantly providing an ability to check
1689000	1692000	whether or not these claims from inside the structure are true.
1692000	1696000	Jeffrey Epstein is an example of what I called an anti-interesting phenomenon.
1700000	1701000	What's that?
1701000	1706000	Well, an anti-interesting thing is something that would normally be fascinating.
1706000	1710000	Imagine, for example, you had a story where you could get a Pulitzer Prize for breaking it.
1710000	1711000	Everybody cares.
1711000	1717000	You'd sell papers like hotcakes, blah, blah, blah, and nobody wants to report on it.
1717000	1719000	And it's like right there.
1719000	1723000	You could just ask the dumbest questions and it would, like,
1723000	1725000	New York Times says, disgraced financier.
1725000	1728000	Well, tell me, did you find his prime broker?
1728000	1729000	Did you find the forms?
1729000	1731000	Did you go to his offices in Valard House?
1731000	1733000	No, nobody does, ever.
1736000	1739000	The story is anti-interesting and it's very different than being uninteresting.
1742000	1746000	Which would suggest more collusion, more coordination?
1747000	1748000	Hello?
1749000	1754000	I mean, see, this is one of the most uncomfortable things.
1754000	1759000	I think there was a time when mostly when people said collusion or coordination,
1759000	1763000	their presumption was, well, that's kind of, that's pretty far out there.
1763000	1769000	We now know, like post Elon Musk's $44 billion adventure at Twitter,
1769000	1775000	that there are these coordinating groups, coordinating social media with the intelligence
1775000	1780000	community or with the Department of Homeland Security or with the State Department.
1780000	1786000	We now know that we're living in an orchestrated, curated, choreographed world.
1786000	1792000	And we can't know it officially, but we all know it if we want it out.
1792000	1794000	Which is hysterical.
1794000	1797000	Now we have to talk about, well, are you a conspiracy theorist?
1797000	1803000	Like, I read, I read the Slack messages, I read the emails.
1803000	1806000	What are you even talking about now?
1808000	1815000	Sanbankman Freed currently being recharged with witness tampering as well.
1815000	1822000	That to me, fresh charges, releasing, even though he's totally couldn't get in touch with the press,
1822000	1827000	I think hundreds of phone calls to the press, leaked his ex-girlfriend, allegedly,
1828000	1833000	leaked his ex-girlfriend's diary entries, so on and so forth.
1833000	1841000	And, you know, this is a guy that some of my friends were flown to go and see on his island, his portion of an island.
1841000	1843000	Yeah, his portion, it's very different.
1843000	1844000	Yeah, okay.
1844000	1848000	For very different reasons as well.
1848000	1853000	There seems to be, and you hear about it, they believe they're above the law.
1853000	1857000	There was this really cool documentary on Netflix called The Murder Dark Murders,
1857000	1862000	and it was this small town, big family, lots of money, and the kids ran rampant, right?
1862000	1865000	Classic like Silver Spoon aristocracy bullshit.
1865000	1878000	But when it gets scaled up this much more, Sanbankman Freed, the biggest alleged financial crime since Bernie Madoff,
1879000	1884000	allegedly tampering with witnesses, allegedly leaking his ex-girlfriend's diary entries.
1884000	1886000	And?
1886000	1889000	Did the rules not apply to everybody?
1889000	1891000	Certainly they don't.
1894000	1895000	Why?
1897000	1901000	We stopped prosecuting all sorts of types of people.
1902000	1905000	You know, look, we stopped holding hearings.
1905000	1912000	I grew up in a world where we had the church committee, the pike committee looking at our own intelligence services.
1912000	1920000	We had Watergate hearings, we had tobacco hearings, we had Iran-Contra hearings.
1922000	1924000	Do you know how many hearings we need right now?
1924000	1926000	Where are these things?
1926000	1927000	It's ridiculous.
1927000	1932000	We've got weird stuff about UFOs with people making the craziest allegations.
1935000	1938000	Look, this is just not normal.
1938000	1941000	We're in totally weird uncharted territory.
1943000	1949000	What do you make of the recent UAPs, I think, is the new term?
1949000	1952000	Eric, you need to get up with the times here.
1952000	1953000	They're not UFOs anymore.
1953000	1954000	That's the old.
1954000	1957000	I wasn't even in this game when it was UFOs.
1957000	1958000	Okay, okay.
1958000	1963000	So what do you make of the recent UAP stories and attention and response and subsequent response?
1966000	1967000	I'd like to ask you first.
1969000	1977000	So I had a look at the first whistleblower from about two months ago quite closely with Andy Stumpf,
1977000	1980000	who used to have pretty high-level security clearance.
1980000	1985000	And he explained to me about how unimpressive that particular type of security clearance is, how very common.
1985000	1986000	Which one?
1986000	1987000	This is David.
1987000	1988000	Yes, David.
1990000	1992000	No, not David Fraver.
1992000	1993000	No, no, no.
1993000	1994000	David Fraver was the tic-tac.
1994000	1995000	Correct.
1995000	1996000	This is Dave Gurush.
1996000	1997000	Yes.
1997000	1998000	Okay.
1999000	2006000	Very common level of security clearance, that using that as some sort of, oh, this is a legitimate credential.
2006000	2008000	It doesn't really wash too much.
2008000	2015000	That it was second, it was third-hand information mostly, second-hand information kind of.
2015000	2018000	I heard from a person who saw or who heard.
2018000	2019000	Right.
2019000	2026000	It just seemed to me to be rather, on the face of it, unimpressive.
2026000	2027000	That release.
2027000	2028000	I see.
2029000	2030000	What did you think?
2031000	2033000	Well, like I've been telling everybody.
2034000	2037000	These are highly conserved stories.
2037000	2041000	This is not the only person I've heard this story from.
2041000	2043000	I've heard this from multiple people.
2043000	2050000	There are various versions of this secret world which play out as space opera.
2052000	2058000	Then MJ-12 became the real government that only, even the president couldn't understand.
2058000	2059000	It's like, okay.
2060000	2072000	So that's the weird part about it until you start realizing how sober many of the people are who believe this and who claim to have had direct contact with it.
2073000	2075000	And then you don't know what to do.
2077000	2084000	I mean, in other words, whatever this is, there is a thing.
2085000	2087000	It's not necessarily little green men.
2087000	2099000	It could be, for example, that they mock up a floating spaceship in a hangar and then they drag people past it and say, whatever you do, do not look to your left or right or you'll be shot.
2099000	2103000	And then, of course, people look and then like mission accomplished.
2103000	2108000	Now people will say, oh my God, you have no idea what we, the US has incredible technology.
2108000	2111000	And then maybe the idea is you've got a cover story.
2111000	2115000	Maybe you've got your adversary investing in things that don't make any sense.
2115000	2116000	I don't know.
2117000	2119000	But there's not nothing here.
2119000	2122000	This is not about mylar balloons and seagulls anymore.
2126000	2139000	I'm trying to come up with a word for it, but it's like a, it's like recursive false flags in a way where the goal is not to give or hide truth,
2140000	2144000	but to fire hose with information so much that the truth can no longer be discerned.
2144000	2150000	It's a haystack of bullshit to make sure that any needle is very difficult to find.
2150000	2151000	It is.
2152000	2153000	Yes.
2153000	2154000	Bullshit haystacking.
2154000	2155000	Right.
2155000	2156000	Yeah.
2156000	2157000	Okay.
2157000	2158000	So they haystack the crap out of this thing.
2158000	2166000	I have no question that there was something that was used to develop US aircraft like the B2 bomber and the SR-71 Blackbird.
2166000	2173000	So if you see something crazy in the sky, better that you think it's a UFO from outer space than some advanced thing from Lockheed.
2173000	2183000	I have no question that we use this to deal with things like the Chinese balloon shootdown where we shot down several things in a week and we couldn't recover debris from any of them.
2183000	2185000	I mean, come on guys.
2187000	2195000	You know, maybe the idea is that this is a head fake to our adversaries to develop the wrong things and to use their treasure on things that won't work.
2196000	2206000	Maybe there's a secret program where some of this stuff is actually real and true and we're not allowed to know it because it would be too mind blowing.
2206000	2215000	Maybe there's a cult inside of our government that has replaced angels with saucer shaped aircraft.
2216000	2224000	Whatever this thing is, it's being used for many different purposes.
2224000	2226000	There's something here.
2228000	2231000	We just don't know what, you know, this is the problem.
2231000	2234000	The princess can't feel a pee because that would be impossible.
2234000	2239000	The princess feels a disturbance and you can't say what the disturbance is.
2239000	2240000	Maybe it's a golf ball.
2241000	2242000	Maybe it's a cantaloupe.
2242000	2243000	Maybe it's a banana.
2244000	2247000	But whatever it is, there's something wrong with the mattress.
2251000	2256000	Yeah, it seems to me this firehosing, the goal of uncertainty.
2256000	2257000	Right.
2258000	2260000	How do things muddle out?
2260000	2262000	Who wins in a muddle is a great question.
2262000	2263000	We're not taught to ask.
2263000	2264000	Sorry to jump in on that.
2264000	2265000	No, tell me more.
2267000	2270000	Always look for who is trying to muddle to win.
2271000	2276000	Very often you're in a dispute with entrenched status quo.
2276000	2280000	And somebody will say, well, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.
2280000	2282000	I'm like, oh, well, who wins if we agree to disagree?
2282000	2283000	Oh, it's you.
2285000	2286000	Right?
2286000	2287000	Yeah.
2287000	2292000	This is like an old principle of mine, which is that you can always tell who's guilty by who first declares a time of healing.
2294000	2295000	Why?
2295000	2296000	Why is that a razor to use?
2296000	2308000	Oh, because if you do something wrong and the public is clamoring for your blood, you say, there's been too much blame and finger pointing on all sides.
2308000	2309000	At me.
2311000	2315000	I think what we need is to come together and declare a time of healing.
2315000	2316000	For me.
2316000	2317000	Right.
2317000	2322000	So I believe that in general, whoever declares a time of healing is suspect number one.
2323000	2326000	That's a very nice razor to use.
2330000	2331000	I wonder about this.
2333000	2334000	Oh, how would you say?
2337000	2339000	Epidemic of uncertainty.
2341000	2342000	Brilliant.
2342000	2343000	Speaking my language.
2345000	2346000	And I wonder...
2353000	2369000	How, first off, how as an individual, you are supposed to put up any kind of effective defense to just take some sovereignty being, you know, an agentic individual.
2369000	2370000	Right.
2371000	2374000	And secondly, I wonder what the end goal is.
2374000	2387000	I understand why uncertainty would be useful for manipulation, because if people can't discern truth from untruth, it can be easy to poke them and prod them and float them in particular directions.
2388000	2400000	But it also seems like, I don't know, kind of also useless as well, that some people, non-insignificant, large cohort of people will just reject it entirely.
2400000	2401000	Which actually...
2401000	2402000	What are they doing?
2402000	2404000	It actually makes it more chaotic and more unruly.
2404000	2409000	So it makes me think, well, maybe if this is the case, if the firehosing is happening.
2409000	2410000	Right.
2410000	2411000	It's epidemic of uncertainty.
2414000	2418000	Maybe the outcomes were predicted but haven't manifest in the way that was intended.
2419000	2421000	Maybe there's more of a rebellious streak in...
2421000	2422000	Say more about that.
2422000	2423000	I'm trying to understand it.
2423000	2425000	That if people who...
2425000	2431000	If you make the public very uncertain about most things by overloading them with information, or by even the...
2431000	2433000	It doesn't even need to be coordination.
2433000	2439000	It could be a byproduct of having 24-7 access to the entire world's population through Twitter and Instagram stories and blah, blah, blah.
2439000	2440000	Right.
2440000	2446000	There is so much I can no longer discern, even due to a multiplicity of opinions that's not coordinated to be a multiplicity that go in opposite directions.
2446000	2447000	Right.
2448000	2454000	If it was coordinated, the outcomes that are occurring at the moment, a lot of the time don't seem to be happening with people.
2454000	2456000	Just, oh, roll over.
2456000	2458000	Tell me exactly what to do.
2458000	2466000	There is a massive, non-insignificant cohort of people that say, I'm checking out and I now no longer trust anybody at all.
2466000	2467000	Right.
2467000	2468000	Or anything.
2468000	2469000	Yes.
2469000	2470000	And that doesn't seem to be...
2470000	2476000	If the goal was ease of control, that doesn't seem to be effective for the person that wanted that or the group that wanted that to be the audience.
2477000	2478000	What's the outcome?
2480000	2491000	First of all, I'm really glad to get a question about this as a sea change, which is that our lives have become wall-to-wall uncertainty.
2491000	2503000	We can't discern if the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor today, we would spend 10 years discussing whether it was a false flag, whether it was actually the Japanese, whether there was any attack, whether it was a soundstage,
2503000	2505000	whether it was a sigh-up, whether it was a...
2511000	2528000	Right now, the main institutions of our society have abdicated their role for public-spirited adjudication of what is true based on expertise.
2529000	2543000	And so what you're seeing is people coming to hate experts and coming to hate institutions because they're realizing that these institutions lie to them at a level that they've never considered unless they were Alex Jones fans to begin with.
2544000	2559000	And so what you're having is you're having a large number of people waking up to the idea that, yeah, there really are organizations and working groups that determine what you hear from a multiplicity of venues.
2559000	2561000	It's the same message relentlessly.
2561000	2565000	Do you think people are overly pattern-matching that now?
2565000	2567000	Say more about what you mean.
2567000	2572000	That they're seeing conspiracy weather isn't because the lack of faith in institutions.
2572000	2576000	Same person is saying that they see a conspiracy and they see no conspiracy.
2576000	2585000	They have part of their head that remembers that conspiracy theorists are crazy people and they've got part of their brain that remembers that normies who don't believe in conspiracies are crazy people.
2585000	2588000	And they can't integrate those things, right?
2588000	2591000	They cannot figure out how are these things being coordinated?
2591000	2593000	Am I a crazy person for seeing these patterns?
2593000	2595000	Am I a crazy person for ignoring them?
2595000	2596000	For believing them?
2596000	2598000	For when they're unearthed?
2599000	2614000	What you're seeing is a complete destruction of bedrock reality that if you weren't actually physically there, how do we know that these people actually met in a warehouse?
2614000	2617000	Is this really a table or is it just CGI?
2617000	2620000	Was it green and we could superimpose wood onto it?
2620000	2622000	Nobody knows what's true.
2622000	2628000	And, you know, if you ask me, well, Eric, how are you dealing with this?
2628000	2630000	I would say I'm failing.
2632000	2636000	I'm just flat out failing, as are all of you.
2636000	2638000	I'm just more honest about it.
2638000	2644000	Some of you have an idea that you've got one lens, which is fix the money, fix the world.
2644000	2645000	Bitcoin, that's the answer.
2645000	2647000	Yeah, Bitcoin, rock on.
2647000	2651000	But no, that's not the answer.
2651000	2661000	Or somebody else says, you know, I really think that we just need to be open and tolerant and realize it's a big world and we just have to give people their due.
2661000	2662000	Well, that doesn't work either.
2662000	2667000	You can't just let everything run riot or we have to go back to our institutions.
2667000	2669000	With these people at the helm, are you kidding?
2669000	2670000	We have to abandon our institution.
2670000	2671000	Wait, what are you saying?
2671000	2674000	We're going to abandon our institutions?
2675000	2677000	Do you know what that looks like?
2677000	2679000	Nobody has an answer.
2679000	2681000	Well, get back to talking to Eric in one minute.
2681000	2683000	But first, I need to tell you about Gymshark.
2683000	2685000	Gymshark make the best training kit on the planet.
2685000	2690000	This T-shirt that I've been falling in love with and traveling in for a very long time is phenomenal.
2690000	2696000	And these shorts, the studio shorts that they make are the best men's training shorts on the planet.
2696000	2698000	They have lasted me over a year now.
2698000	2699000	They come in amazing colors.
2699000	2700000	The length is perfect.
2700000	2701000	They're sweat wicking.
2701000	2702000	They're lightweight.
2702000	2703000	They wash and dry perfectly.
2703000	2708000	You don't need that many pairs of shorts as a guy, but the ones that you do have need to be very good.
2708000	2711000	So if you need new gym kit, this is where to go.
2711000	2716000	I highly, highly recommend that you go and check out everything that I use and recommend from Gymshark.
2716000	2720000	They've updated my product page with everything that I use and recommend for men and women.
2720000	2724000	And you can get 10% off everything site-wide with no minimum order.
2724000	2727000	And they have 30-day free returns worldwide.
2728000	2731000	You're sounding an awful lot parallel.
2731000	2736000	The conversation is moving in a similar direction to one I had with Sam Harris recently.
2736000	2740000	I would think it's very different, but I'm happy to hear more.
2740000	2745000	He identified on an episode that I did with him not long ago.
2745000	2751000	The fact that we have lost trust in our institutions and yet abandoning them is also,
2751000	2755000	wholesale is also not an option.
2755000	2760000	Sam also tried to say, I can see the problems on the,
2760000	2765000	I say I can see the problems on the right and I can see the problems on the left.
2765000	2772000	And there is a group of people who have allowed their irritation with the left
2772000	2777000	to color their thinking to the point that they don't know what to do.
2777000	2782000	I think Sam is discounting the idea that once people wake up to the,
2782000	2787000	to the concept that they were living in an orchestrated Truman show,
2787000	2790000	that they did not understand.
2790000	2793000	They're not going to have the idea of like, oh, sure.
2793000	2796000	The vaccines were a little bit more dangerous.
2796000	2797000	I don't know.
2797000	2798000	I don't know.
2798000	2799000	I don't know.
2799000	2800000	I don't know.
2800000	2801000	I don't know.
2801000	2802000	I don't know.
2802000	2803000	I don't know.
2803000	2804000	The idea of like, oh, sure.
2804000	2810000	The vaccines were a little bit more dangerous than claimed and maybe a little bit less effective
2810000	2813000	and maybe we knew a little bit more about the lab lead.
2813000	2814000	It's no way.
2814000	2819000	You spat directly in my face and told me not only that it was raining,
2819000	2823000	but that I was a crazy person for thinking that you spat directly in my face and you piled
2823000	2831000	up how many Nobel laureates to defend the idea that any inquiry into the origin of this
2831000	2832000	virus was racism?
2832000	2835520	It's like, you're dead to me.
2835520	2840400	And I think that that's what people are not understanding in the Democratic Party.
2840400	2847200	Increasingly, the basic attitude is whoever this class of people is that crawled into
2847200	2850200	our elite institutions is just dead.
2850200	2854800	Like, there's nothing Anthony Fauci could say at this moment that I want to hear.
2854800	2860560	It's not that I don't think that he doesn't know virology or epidemiology.
2860560	2865120	I know I can't trust him because of the way in which he looked into my eyes.
2865120	2870640	And then, you know, when Stephen Colbert is dancing with syringes singing the vaccine
2870640	2877920	song and Ariana Grande, you know, is in a super highly produced number from like hair
2877920	2884640	spray but converted to vaccines with a giant picture of Anthony Fauci and everybody celebrating
2884640	2888720	like it's a May Day celebration, I get it.
2888720	2894160	I live in a completely fake world and I wrote an article about this in 2011 on K-Fabe,
2894160	2897720	which is the system of lies that undergirds professional wrestling.
2897720	2903760	So now you've woken up to the idea that you've spent your life watching something like Major
2903760	2910320	League Baseball or Premier League Soccer or whatever it is, and it's all fake.
2910320	2913240	And now you don't know who you are, you don't know what your country is, you don't know
2913240	2918600	what a ballot box is, you have no idea what news is or media, you don't know what a university
2918600	2925240	is actually teaching, you've got people running around who are calling themselves scholars
2925240	2929480	who publish in scholarly journals and sit in scholarly seats and you can tell what
2929480	2934080	they're saying is completely wrong and it's directly in their area of expertise.
2934080	2940600	So the thing about pattern matching that I said was, there are still many people who
2940600	2947280	are scholars, who are in positions of authority inside of high-faluting institutions that presumably
2947280	2953000	do want to do good and do want to deploy their skills in a way that does this, is it
2953000	2964920	a case that every single institution is completely wrong or is this reflexive skepticism being
2964920	2970840	tuned up too highly to the point where there is skepticism about things that don't deserve
2970840	2972560	it and how do we determine between the two?
2972560	2976480	Okay, so we have to talk about the institutions that are fighting back.
2976680	2985560	The future which has become X is not on the same standard that the Facebooks are or Google
2985560	2988800	is, Elon is doing something different.
2988800	2990560	We can talk about what?
2990560	2997600	The University of Chicago is still fighting, my daughter just graduated from the University
2997600	2998600	of Chicago.
2998600	2999600	Congratulations.
2999600	3003840	I never mentioned where she was while she was there.
3003840	3007240	It needs support.
3007240	3010560	We have to support the schools that fought back, for example.
3010560	3016240	I believe Ohio State fought back and there's a school in Oklahoma that fought back and
3016240	3018760	leading that charge is the University of Chicago.
3018760	3024320	We have organizations like FIRE that promote free speech.
3024320	3029360	We have professors who are taking on some risk like Jonathan Haidt, but we're not seeing
3029440	3034240	the Noam Chomsky effect where you do amazing research and they have to put up with every
3034240	3039160	crazy idea that comes through your mind.
3039160	3041720	That's important.
3041720	3047520	Look up a person named Serge Lang in mathematics and something called the file to understand
3047520	3052320	how dangerous it is to screw with real scholars.
3052320	3053320	What happens?
3053320	3055960	Give us the 30,000 foot view.
3056280	3062120	People tried to put Sam Huntington into the National Academy of Sciences who was an architect
3062120	3066440	of the Vietnam War and Serge Lang just said, I look through his papers, I find the following
3066440	3067800	mathematical statements.
3067800	3068800	This is not science.
3068800	3070760	Why is this person in the academy?
3070760	3073000	Then they fight back.
3073000	3079160	I fought back with Serge Lang when he was at Harvard where we tried to engage Sam Huntington
3079160	3081000	on that topic.
3081000	3084000	You can't have these dangerous people running around.
3084000	3085680	That's why all of us are discredited.
3085720	3090360	You haven't noticed this, but like Jordan Peterson is discredited, Sam Harris is discredited,
3090360	3094560	Joe Rogan is discredited, Brett Weinstein is discredited, Ben Shapiro is discredited,
3094560	3096680	Barry Weiss is discredited.
3096680	3099400	Everybody is discredited.
3099400	3106240	Tim Pool referred to it as the IDW's walking corpse phase at the moment.
3106240	3112640	Well, my point is this personal destruction is the coin of the realm.
3112640	3116520	Some of the personal destruction that you see that looks organic is orchestrated as
3116520	3118000	well.
3118000	3122120	We're just in this thing where, in my opinion, what you're looking at is something called
3122120	3126360	de-confliction, but people don't know what that is.
3126360	3130680	De-confliction is supposed to stop what are called blue-on-blue incidences.
3130680	3134480	Blue-on-blue incidences, you have two branches of government that don't know that they're
3134480	3136080	operating covertly.
3136080	3140080	Maybe you have an investigative team and an undercover team, and the investigative team
3140080	3143640	is about to blow the cover thinking that they've got a target, but it's actually an
3143640	3145640	undercover agent.
3145640	3148800	What they're supposed to do is they're supposed to check in with these centralized systems
3148800	3152120	and say, do you have any assets in this arena we're about to move?
3152120	3153120	Yes, we do.
3153120	3155120	Oh, okay.
3155120	3159680	They find out, and this is supposed to stop blue-on-blue.
3159680	3165760	The interesting thing is, even though there are three systems called safety net, RIS safe,
3165760	3173520	and case explorer, you can't use them unless you are an official part of the government.
3173520	3177280	I called up one of them, had a half an hour conversation before I started asking about
3177280	3184080	Jeffrey Epstein, and then they immediately said this call will be terminated in five seconds.
3184080	3189160	Maybe it was case explorer for South Florida, something like that.
3189160	3198560	What happens when you have a civilian that's not signed up for nondisclosure under no rules?
3198560	3203800	You're an American citizen with full right to free speech, and you stumble on something
3203800	3206880	that you're not supposed to know about.
3206880	3211360	That is a deconfliction problem that nobody has ever solved.
3211360	3215920	The first thing I'd like to throw out is if we have three separate systems to keep the
3215920	3221880	intelligence community and local police departments from tripping over each other, what do you
3221880	3228880	think we do when ordinary citizens get wind of something amiss that's some super-secret
3228880	3232160	operation?
3232160	3236560	My claim is, we discredit them.
3236560	3242440	We pre-bunk them in the language of the GEC, I believe.
3243440	3250680	We're all familiar with debunking misinformation and disinformation.
3250680	3254000	You've got some disinformation that's spread it around, and we debunk it by giving you
3254000	3255280	the truth.
3255280	3260880	What happens when somebody is spreading the truth in a way that is unhelpful to a statecraft
3260880	3262400	level narrative?
3262400	3267480	Well, we didn't know what the words were, but we just found out, and it's you pre-bunk
3267480	3269080	the malinformation.
3270080	3277720	Now, if you didn't grow up knowing what malinformation is, here's a quick refresher.
3277720	3281600	Malinformation is actual information, but it's harmful.
3281600	3282600	Right.
3282600	3285440	The equivalent of politically incorrect incarnation.
3285440	3291600	Well, or you're trying to make sure that there's support for the war in Ukraine, and
3291600	3296560	somebody actually realizes that things are much more desperate than they thought.
3297040	3303600	Well, that would be deleterious to our efforts if the objective is to get Putin to capitulate.
3303600	3311600	Now you have to pre-bunk the malinformation, which means destroy the reputation of the
3311600	3318240	person spreading the information that's countering the official disinformation and misinformation.
3318240	3322920	I can't work out why anybody's confused and why they're having trouble existing in the
3322920	3325960	state and school kids.
3325960	3331120	The point is, I've got all of these friends who are pre-bunked malinformers.
3331120	3332120	That's what a club.
3332120	3333120	What a club to be in.
3333120	3334120	That's what I do.
3334120	3335120	I'm a pre-bunked malinformant.
3335120	3338120	There's never been a sexier title, actually.
3338120	3341680	I spread malinformation, and I need to be pre-bunked.
3341680	3344000	So of course, I'm going to be a grifter.
3344000	3346160	I'm going to be, I don't know, a charlatan.
3346160	3349400	I'm going to, well, he's over.
3349400	3351440	Can we stop trying to make Eric Weinstein a thing?
3351440	3352440	Blah, blah, blah.
3352480	3360080	There's giant farms of people in bots that are dedicated to spreading bad feelings about
3360080	3362200	anybody who's going to contradict narrative.
3362200	3367880	Well, don't forget as well that the coordination doesn't necessarily need to be there because
3367880	3371280	the incentives align online for...
3371280	3372800	There's an emergent part.
3372800	3374840	There's a non-emergent part.
3374840	3379760	I will not agree with anyone who tells me it's all one or all the other, but part of
3379760	3381680	this is actually coordinated.
3381920	3382920	Yeah.
3382920	3392480	So, close that loop on the agentic, sovereign individual existing in the world.
3392480	3393480	Holy fuck.
3393480	3399800	I'm getting bookockied with this total awfulness of information here.
3399800	3402680	Bookocky just means splattered in Japanese.
3402680	3405040	That's why it's not a terrible term to use.
3405040	3406040	Absolutely not.
3406040	3407040	Thank you.
3407040	3409920	It's actually been appropriated by the adult industry in a way that I think the Japanese
3409920	3410920	should reclaim.
3410920	3415000	And Melissa Chen has probably done more to popularize this in intellectual circles than
3415000	3416000	anyone else.
3416000	3417160	So, shout out to Miss Melissa Chen.
3417160	3421640	Melissa Chen and Bookocky in the same sense and something that we weren't expecting today.
3421640	3425360	I think there was a period of her life where she would use it in every public appearance.
3425360	3426360	Just sneak it in.
3426360	3427360	Right.
3427360	3428360	Okay.
3428360	3429360	The Bookocky of the gaps.
3429360	3434400	So, anyway, you have a situation where nobody knows what's going on.
3434400	3437160	And I don't think Sam is comfortable, by the way, being here.
3437280	3439360	Like, you're in open water.
3439360	3442880	And you have all of these instructions about what to do when you're swimming in your land,
3442880	3445240	which is, you know, try to align yourself with the shore.
3445240	3446240	Don't fight the current.
3446240	3448440	And like, that's not where you are.
3448440	3450920	You're just in open water.
3450920	3454840	And you're treading water and you don't know whether there are oceanic white tips around
3454840	3458680	and you don't know whether you can keep this up for much longer.
3458680	3460520	But there is no land.
3460520	3466080	There's a big difference with Sam.
3466080	3467080	Go a little deeper.
3467080	3470360	Make that a little planer for me.
3470360	3475080	You cannot trust Harvard or nature.
3475080	3481360	You cannot trust the Office of Management and Budget or the Lancet or the Lancet or
3481360	3484200	the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
3484200	3489280	You cannot trust any newspaper that I'm aware.
3489280	3495960	You cannot trust the CDC or the NIH or the WHO.
3495960	3502880	Now, people will hear that and they'll say, oh my God, Eric, you're spreading distrust
3502880	3503880	and fear.
3503880	3505240	It's like, I'm a pastor.
3505240	3507800	Shoot the messenger all you want.
3507800	3513320	All of those institutions are out of control and we all know it.
3513320	3514320	And say-
3514320	3516040	And it's highly out of control?
3516040	3517040	No.
3517040	3518040	Mostly out of control.
3518040	3519280	I did this on trigonometry.
3519280	3521920	We have this anti-institutional point.
3521920	3529360	How is it that the airlines can't keep my seat clean and can't make sure that I'm able
3529360	3535600	to recline it properly or that the Wi-Fi doesn't go out and then their planes never crash?
3535600	3539480	So the institutions are functioning and not functioning.
3539480	3541240	They're lying and telling the truth.
3541240	3545120	They're getting it done and failing outright over and over again.
3545120	3550120	And it's even worse because if the planes crashed all the time and you'd say, okay,
3550120	3553360	well, these people are incompetent.
3553360	3559080	But it's like the selective incompetence and madness.
3559080	3564320	And what I think is, is that Sam wanted to treat this as, look, it's pretty annoying
3564320	3568600	what's going on on the left and it's pretty annoying what's going on with the institutions.
3568600	3574080	But let's not lose sight of the fact, January 6th.
3574080	3575520	People don't feel that way.
3575520	3578400	People feel like, wait a minute, I don't know which end is up.
3578400	3580200	I don't know who's telling me the truth anymore.
3580200	3583760	I can spot these lies that are so transparent.
3583760	3587600	And this is the theory of lies as a checksum.
3587600	3592000	So when you get a binary for a computer program that you want to install on your computer,
3592000	3596200	you want to know, well, is this what came from Microsoft or did somebody adulterate
3596200	3597200	it?
3597200	3600400	And when I click on this thing, it's going to install ransomware on my machine.
3600400	3606680	So there's something called a checksum, which is generated by how the program was compiled
3606680	3611160	and it would be almost impossible to come up with a second program that would generate
3611160	3612160	the same checksum.
3612160	3613160	Verification.
3613160	3615160	Yeah.
3615160	3620520	If the checksum is off, I don't install the thing and the checksums are all off.
3620520	3622400	And that's why people are going crazy.
3622400	3627520	And that's why, to your earlier point, isn't it interesting that we're not talking about
3627520	3631160	the level of uncertainty, right?
3631160	3632560	This is not sustainable.
3632560	3636360	So Sam is 100% correct on a lot of things that people are making fun of him for.
3636360	3641280	And I assume that I will be keel hauled all over Twitter for saying this.
3641280	3643840	You cannot have a world without institutions.
3643840	3645320	We're not built for it.
3645320	3650160	We're just, there's no part of you that is prepared to generate all your own electricity
3650160	3657320	and, you know, kill all your own game and get your own clean water.
3657320	3659960	You need an army.
3659960	3661480	You need a police department.
3661480	3668720	You can only play frontier, you know, Wild West so long before you realize that modern
3668720	3672720	life can't be supported this way.
3672720	3677020	And we can't go with the institutions we have.
3677020	3678280	So we need institutions.
3678280	3681600	We can't go with these institutions, not because the institutions are wrong, but because the
3681600	3688280	inhabitants are wrong to a person they've been selected for by this ability to lie because
3688280	3689480	growth evaporated.
3689480	3690480	That's one of my main rifts.
3690480	3694240	We don't have to go into it, but basically that in the absence of real growth, everything
3694240	3697280	turns pathological.
3697280	3700740	And so it's just heartbreaking to see some of these people saying, look, we've always
3700740	3702440	known that the institutions were wrong.
3702440	3706080	We finally have the ability to prove that let's tear them all down.
3706080	3709920	So that's a very popular perspective at the moment.
3709920	3713680	Other people want to claim, let's cling to the institutions because we know we need them
3713680	3717280	and we'll look past the fact that they're obviously lying about almost everything of
3717280	3719440	importance.
3719440	3720720	That's not really tenable.
3720720	3728120	We can't vote these people out because like Diane Feinstein could beat me easily in a run
3728120	3729120	for Senate.
3729120	3736040	I don't know why because the machine is stronger than actually the vision we had for democracy.
3736040	3744000	So we've got Mitch McConnell having a temporary ischemic attack on camera.
3744000	3748960	We've got somebody post-stroke in Pennsylvania having defeated Mehmet Oz.
3748960	3750360	We've got Diane Feinstein.
3750360	3755280	We've got Nancy Pelosi trading up a storm.
3755280	3757280	We can't get rid of any of these people.
3757280	3764160	Joe Biden is way too old for this job and has been in government since he was 29 in 1972
3764160	3766080	when he won his Senate seat.
3766080	3767080	This is a joke.
3767080	3769400	It's beyond preposterous.
3769400	3773720	And by the way, it comes out of not loving your children.
3773720	3776560	How's that?
3776560	3781560	People who love their children don't drill holes in their children's life raft.
3781560	3788320	And the modern world at post-World War II was a life raft to get us to the next stage.
3788320	3799200	And the number of older people I see liquidating everything so that they can live out their
3799200	3803680	final days in the same style to which they've become accustomed is impossible in a world
3803680	3805800	where people love their children.
3806520	3812360	Yeah, I don't think they care.
3812360	3815320	You familiar with Toby Ord's analogy of the precipice?
3815320	3816320	No, Toby.
3816320	3817320	Really cool.
3817320	3820800	So his book, The Precipice, that everybody should go and read, it's my best primer on
3820800	3821800	existential risk.
3821800	3827400	Toby Ord's from the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford with Nick Bostrom and he's a colleague
3827400	3830800	of William McCaskill, long-termism, EA, et cetera.
3831400	3838560	He uses this example of, you can imagine, on a journey, a particular individual getting
3838560	3847400	to a beautiful, lush, abundant meadow would have to take a treacherous mountain path.
3847400	3854880	And along this mountain path, there is a particularly thin, small, steep, sharp, uncertain, unstable
3854880	3856160	part of it.
3856160	3857680	That's the precipice.
3857680	3862120	And he talks about, I like to think about it like an hourglass, you have width with
3862120	3864880	room and then you have a choke point.
3864880	3867840	And at that choke point, things can get dicey.
3867840	3874360	And it's Toby's contention that if we make it through this precipice, you broaden out
3874360	3879520	and you have the meadow, you are a multi-planetary species, you have redundancy, genetically
3879520	3887000	redundancy, civilizationally, you have overcome some of the limitations of the castoffs from
3887000	3890280	your energy production and consumption.
3890280	3894480	You don't have value lock-in in a bad way that means that it's despots all the way down
3894480	3895680	or it's tyrants all the way down.
3895680	3897000	I assume that I hear you.
3897000	3898000	Yep.
3898000	3902640	Where do you think we are?
3902640	3904000	It feels very precipice.
3904000	3906000	Yeah, doesn't it?
3906000	3907000	Yeah.
3907000	3912920	What's more, as one of the only people who are really seriously hitting this multi-planetary
3912920	3917580	note, there is no interest in this.
3917580	3919080	From who?
3919080	3920080	I'm interested.
3920080	3921080	Are you?
3921080	3922080	Fuck yeah.
3922080	3923080	Don't I count, Eric?
3923080	3924080	All right.
3924080	3930920	Am I not legitimate in the future of this civilization's direction?
3930920	3934600	What are your best stories for how we become interplanetary?
3934600	3937040	I say it because you brought it up.
3937040	3939000	Stories or strategies?
3939000	3940520	Stories about how we get to be interplanetary.
3940520	3944200	I'm not sure what you mean by story.
3944200	3954680	Tell me a story by which we have 10 planets that humans have settled.
3954680	3958280	If you want to do 10, we're going to have to go to planets that are outside of the solar
3958280	3959280	system.
3959280	3960280	Right.
3960280	3964200	There's this one which is really troubling.
3964200	3970000	Mars is really screwing up this whole story because Elon has gotten everybody focused
3970000	3976880	on Mars and it's a marginal planet that would be very difficult to get to using chemical
3976880	3983640	rockets and it's not a stepping stone because once you master Mars, if, if, if, which we're
3983640	3990240	not going to do, it doesn't really get you anywhere.
3990240	3993040	It's just Mars.
3993040	3998960	So Avi Loeb, new book that recently came out, Interstellar, spoke to him last week about
3998960	3999960	it.
3999960	4000960	He asked him about this.
4000960	4005360	I said, um, do, will we ever visit other galaxies?
4005360	4008560	And he made this cop out answer of saying, well, Andromeda is going to crash into the
4008560	4009560	Milky Way.
4009560	4010560	I was like, that doesn't count.
4010560	4013880	Avi, we can't blend two together and say that we've been there.
4013880	4014880	Right.
4014880	4018240	Um, and he's talking about, uh, interstellar travel, right?
4018240	4023720	From here to Proxima Santori, pick, pick your other star, right?
4023720	4029000	They are trying at some point in the not too distant future to do the light sail laser
4029000	4030880	pointed added thing.
4030880	4036560	Maybe we can, and this was me asking him, uh, my conception was generation ships, you
4036560	4042640	know, you and the next 500 generations of your progeny, you condemn them to be locked
4042640	4049960	in this tin box and it's group sex and, and plants and CO2 for the next however long until
4049960	4052900	you get to Proxima Santori, hope that it's not totally wrecked.
4052900	4062420	This point was light sail, uh, desktop DNA sequencer, artificial womb, send it out.
4062420	4064740	You guys are being ridiculous.
4064740	4066420	It's, it's a thought.
4066420	4067420	This is my story.
4067420	4068420	I know.
4068420	4069420	This is my story.
4069420	4070420	Okay.
4070420	4074180	This is my story and I'm allowed to tell my story, but it's exactly why I wanted it.
4074180	4076980	If I could, it just to riff, okay.
4076980	4079980	It's an innervating story.
4079980	4082180	What's that?
4082180	4086300	We're not energized by this story, except for the, except for the group sex and the
4086300	4087300	plants, right?
4087300	4088300	Yep.
4088300	4090900	So the issue is, if we could sprinkle some Bukaki in there, everybody would get on board
4090900	4091900	a Melissa champ.
4091900	4098340	Moving, moving, moving at light speed, um, what we're doing is that we're telling people
4098340	4105620	we've crawled inside our modern theories and our modern theories make our imaginations
4105620	4107820	our enemy.
4107820	4111580	We're not excited about the, we don't really believe that we're going to open a wormhole
4112580	4115860	we don't really believe in multi-generation ships.
4115860	4118380	We don't believe that we're going to reboot from tardigrades.
4118380	4123260	We don't believe that we're going to scan all of our synapses and reconstruct the brain,
4123260	4127260	uh, from the beginning.
4127260	4130700	Einstein is the problem.
4130700	4139700	Now I know Avi decently well and Avi for the Galileo project that he's heading up, doesn't
4139780	4143180	want people to consider new physics.
4143180	4149700	So whenever I speak at all as somebody affiliated with the Galileo project with wearing that
4149700	4151700	hat, I don't think about new physics at all.
4151700	4154220	I accept the constraints of the physics we know.
4154220	4155220	Yes.
4155220	4156220	Yes.
4156220	4157220	Yes.
4157220	4162780	When I take that hat off, it's all about new physics.
4162780	4169380	It's not about new technology using the old physics and the way you can measure whether
4169420	4176420	people are serious about interplanetary is how much they're focused on new physics.
4176420	4181220	Anybody who isn't focused on new physics is not serious about interplanetary.
4181220	4185580	Is this because with the current conception of physics that we have, it's going to be
4185580	4187580	essentially impossible for us to go into planetary?
4187580	4188580	Yeah.
4188580	4190060	And the word essentially is doing some work there.
4190060	4195420	And so what you get is you get these innervating workarounds like, oh, if we use time dilation
4195420	4197460	if we went really fast, then it wouldn't be that fast.
4197740	4199500	Can you just explain the word innovating, please?
4199500	4201740	Do you mean as an innovation, or is this ER?
4201740	4202740	No.
4202740	4203740	Innervating.
4203740	4204740	What's that?
4204740	4215120	Means to lessen in potency, to sort of discourage and as long as I have to do things that don't
4215120	4221060	involve me cruising to new planets and taking in the, oh, it'd be your great, great, great,
4221060	4225900	great, great, great, great, to the 12,000 power grandchild who actually sees a new planet,
4225900	4227260	that's not going to work.
4227260	4230780	Or you're going to open a wormhole, or you're going to have an Alcubierre drive,
4231420	4236540	all of these sorts of things discourage us. And we know that we're telling lies about it.
4237660	4240540	And so we don't work on it. You want to know how to work on this?
4241580	4246380	We're abandoning the one field that has the chance of making us interplanetary.
4246380	4250380	And I don't know what to do about it because nobody sees this as the emergency I do.
4250380	4254060	We'll get back to talking to Eric in one minute, but first I need to tell you about cozy earth.
4254060	4260380	Look, we spend one third of our lives asleep. You do not want to spend 33% of your existence

4310700	4313340	Okay, so let me see if I can get the topology of what you've said right.
4314700	4321820	The fact that Mars is within reach broadly and chemical rockets.
4321820	4327740	Correct. Of current technology, of current physics. And we do it. Hooray.
4327740	4331180	Super hard. We did it. Interplanetary. Right.
4331900	4340700	But your point is that, well, it seems like that is insufficient and also kind of like a
4340700	4347500	false duck type scenario where we did it, but we didn't actually do the thing we needed to do.
4347500	4354220	So we may have even been better off had the nearest closest planet been two light years away.
4354220	4358460	Assume Mars didn't exist. Correct. And assume that Elon was still the visionary
4358460	4364940	that we want him to be. And he didn't have a chemical rocket company. I'd like to think
4364940	4370380	that he would be focused on physics. I would like to think that any of these people would be
4370380	4379580	focused on physics. Take anybody with 11 figures. What is your allocation to building a life raft
4379580	4385020	to get humans out of here? You don't, you haven't even thought about it.
4385740	4389740	Immediately you're going to think technology. Well, what kind of a whole would I need? It's
4389740	4396860	like, no, you need a blackboard. You need blackboards and physicists who are not afraid
4396860	4402860	to do physics. Right now we are destroying the fundamental physics community at a rate that
4402860	4406540	you could not believe. What's happening? Give me the gossip from inside.
4407340	4413820	For 39 years, we've been dominated by one community's madness. And that community is
4413820	4422140	called quantum gravity, string theory or M theory. It changed what we were researching.
4422140	4427180	It's cardinal sin is not about string theory. It's not about quantum gravity. It changed the
4427180	4433580	questions that defined what it meant to be a fundamental physicist. So if I say to you,
4433580	4440620	how many generations of matter are there? I don't know. You don't know that it's three
4441340	4447500	because we don't talk about that all the time anymore. Or if I say, do you know why is matter
4447500	4452300	chiral? You wouldn't know about that. Or if I said, what's the nature of the quartic potential
4452300	4456540	for the Higgs field? Or why is there a Yukawa coupling in one case and a minimal coupling somewhere
4456540	4466620	else? All of the real physics questions that would cause progress got subtly replaced between
4466620	4475260	1984 and like 1987. And then we had questions like, how do we quantize gravity? And that became this,
4475260	4482780	oh, that is the ultimate question. Well, it's not. That's just wrong. This comes out of Bryce
4482780	4488780	DeWitt. This comes out of a guy who in 1952 went with his wife to the Tata Institute of Fundamental
4488780	4493180	Research in Bombay, then wrote an essay for something called the Gravity Research Foundation
4493180	4497340	that was about anti-gravity. And he was supposed to write an essay and then he said, well, to get
4497340	4502780	anti-gravity, what you'd really need to do is to do quantum gravity. And for 70 years, we've been
4502780	4509820	trying to do quantum gravity and it's an abject failure. And the physicists at the helm changed
4509820	4515340	the questions. The official questions should sound something like this. Why are there three
4515340	4519900	generations of matter? Why is it flavor chiral? What is the nature and the origin of the Higgs
4519900	4527980	mechanism? Why are we in one comma three dimensions? And what is with SU3 cross SU2 cross U1, which is
4527980	4532460	a bunch of symmetries? And why does it seem to represent on a 16 dimensional space with the
4532460	4537020	observed quantum numbers? That may not mean a lot to you. But I guarantee you, if there are
4537020	4542700	physicists in the audience, they're getting pissed off right now because they allowed their
4542700	4548780	subject to be dragged away from our real questions for reasons that are unclear and put in the service
4548780	4554140	of these questions that can't be answered. And we can't even question them 39 years into this
4554140	4559580	complete train wreck that is the community that could build the life raft. What is so seductive
4559580	4568780	about quantum everything? Quantum gravity? Yeah. It allows for toy problems so that you can not do
4568780	4576620	your work on the world that we have. And you can say, well, world that we have is too complicated.
4576620	4581180	So I created this fake world over here that's not in four dimensions. It's in two dimensions. It's
4581180	4586140	not in Lorentzian signature. It's in Euclidean signature. It's not the full gauge group. It's
4586140	4592220	just SU2. And I've changed all the parameters. And then I say, and I've made some minor incremental
4592220	4599260	progress in that fake world. And then everybody claps. And meanwhile, 10 years later, you don't
4599260	4604220	even remember what the particles are that are present in the universe. You don't even remember
4604220	4610700	the standard model of particle theory. And this is a very real effect. Today's physicists, a lot
4610700	4616380	of the young ones are completely ignorant about the physical world. They could not find the men's
4616380	4627260	or women's room at CERN if their life depended on it. Yeah, so it seems like a hijacking of attention
4627260	4639580	and focus from difficult problems to from useful difficult problems to useless or less useful
4640780	4645580	easier problems. But if you try to talk about the real problems, you can't get engagement. And
4645580	4649740	they will say it as, well, maybe people just aren't interested in your ideas. I was like,
4649740	4654460	yeah, but you're not listening to it. So far as I can tell, everybody who comes from outside with
4654460	4661020	an interesting new idea isn't being listened to. It's not personal. And we also have a responsibility.
4661020	4665820	This is like, this is a really crazy part. We doomed humanity.
4667900	4672780	Like Francis Crick, who was a co-discoverer of the three dimensional structure of DNA,
4672780	4679100	was a physicist. Edward Teller was a physicist. Stanislav Ulam was a geometer.
4680620	4690300	We doomed humanity on Earth. And then we're treating science as if, oh, it's a series of puzzles.
4691020	4694620	Well, what do you want to work on today? Well, I don't want to be arrogant. I'll just work on
4694620	4702860	this tiny little problem. And I'm just thinking like, do you not feel any basic responsibility
4702860	4710380	after Hiroshima and Nagasaki and COVID? All right. Just how crazy are you?
4710380	4713740	Is that, you know, we've spoken about the interplanetary
4714540	4720220	challenge. Right. And the fact that physics needs to make some progress in order to facilitate that
4720220	4725260	if we're going to do it. Yeah. Is, in your opinion, forgetting the fact that chemical
4725260	4733340	rockets, limitations, all that sort of stuff, is going into planetary as useful. Is it the
4733340	4738460	highest priority? The highest priority. You cannot stabilize this place.
4739020	4750700	Just imagine every communalist dream came true. We turned away from fossil fuels towards a,
4750700	4757020	the greenest new deal you could possibly imagine. All billionaires realized the errors of their ways
4757020	4763500	and contributed their money to bring up the poorest of the poor. AI was as beneficial as
4763500	4771100	it could be and only helped humanity to live its dream. Just go full wild, polyana optimism.
4772380	4774700	You still can't stabilize it. Why?
4778700	4783420	Too many people. Not for long. Say more.
4783420	4787020	Not for long. Population rates, birth rates at the moment.
4787020	4792860	We're talking at totally different scales. I'm telling you that with
4794220	4799260	CRISPR-Cas9, with the Teller ULAM design. IVG.
4800540	4808460	IVG. You know IVG? IVF, but being able to use from any other, yep.
4810140	4813500	I was trying to think in a different context.
4814220	4818060	You are going to have
4824140	4829900	people, what happens when you distribute the coronavirus because everybody's had it? You've
4829900	4838540	had it? I got an antibody test and I had it, but never felt it. You have this platform,
4838540	4843340	this viral platform that's spread all over the world and you have the ability to edit it.
4844380	4849900	Are you telling me that people aren't going to figure out how to come up with fun viruses and
4850540	4853420	gain a function projects and people are going to be able to do these,
4856380	4859340	polymerase chain reaction I think was taught in my daughter's high school?
4860460	4865020	Are you familiar with Nick Bostrom's balls from the urn analogy?
4865020	4865820	Yeah, vaguely.
4865820	4869980	Yeah. For the people that don't know, you can imagine that you have an urn and each time that
4869980	4874940	you make technological progress, you pick a ball out and you don't know what color. Some are white,
4874940	4880620	perfectly good. Some are gray, a bit of good, a bit of bad and some are all the way down to
4880620	4886860	black and black is permanent, unrecoverable collapse. And the unrecoverable bit is important.
4888300	4892060	And each time we just keep picking out balls.
4892060	4897980	So my take on it is there's already too much leverage, too much leverage, too little wisdom,
4897980	4898940	too many people.
4898940	4902700	What was it that you once said, we are gods, but for the wisdom we're just shitty gods?
4903820	4910620	I don't know if I said the second part, but I guess when I heard the story about this kid who
4910620	4915980	scavenged the americium from all of these smoke detectors in Brooklyn and built a self-sustaining
4915980	4921820	nuclear reactor from these tiny little radioactive strips, you don't know what people's creativity is.
4922460	4928620	You know, I found it fascinating when I was growing up that I was the only kid who knew
4928620	4936780	that gunpowder or black powder was 75% potassium nitrate, 10% sulfur, and 15% carbon.
4936780	4948700	Like you could just make it, you know? And that's the recipe. And that just blew my mind
4949420	4954380	the rate limiting step was that people didn't know that potassium nitrate was saltpeter or
4954380	4961820	where to get it, like meat tenderizer. But mostly we're saved from this stuff because nobody's so
4961820	4967260	sociopathic and competent that they go for these high leverage attacks. That's going to end.
4968460	4972380	You know, that was like what happened on 9-11. I always wanted to know why were little kids
4972380	4976540	allowed to go into the cockpit of a plane? You used to be able to meet the pilot. I remember
4977420	4982700	doing it. Yeah. So that's where we are now is that we've got all this high leverage stuff
4983340	4986460	and you're going to see nuclear proliferation. Eventually you're going to get some
4987820	4992780	desperate backed into a corner who says, well, this is my only move. Well, I mean,
4994540	5000620	for the nuclear concernists out there, at least what I know, wouldn't that be all of us? Everybody
5000620	5006300	is concerned, but for the people that are nuclear war is a genuine X risk, permanent
5006300	5013260	unrecoverable collapse. You can set them all off unless there's like 10 to 100 times more than we
5013260	5020460	think that we have, which they're very well could be. It seems difficult for it to be permanent
5020460	5025900	unrecoverable collapse for me as a true, true, true, true X risk. May I say something? Yeah.
5025900	5033180	This is ridiculous. It's bad enough that it would completely transform life as we know it.
5033180	5038940	You would agree with that. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's time to get serious about
5038940	5044380	things we can actually do. And the most interesting thing is that nobody's interested
5045500	5051740	in interplanetary physics. I've never seen anything like it.
5052460	5057340	Interplanetary physics would be physics in service of us becoming interplanetary,
5057340	5060460	or is there something specific about the way that planets figure together?
5060460	5067020	No, no, no. It's about... Let me give you an analogy that's more than an analogy.
5067020	5075820	Assume that somebody hands you a physical paper map, an enormous one. And you're trying to navigate
5075820	5080860	it on this table that we have here. You're starting to do motions like this,
5081580	5086620	where you're moving the paper across the table to get from Los Angeles to Fresno,
5086620	5090780	California, if it's at the right scale. And it might take you a long time to do that.
5092220	5095340	Okay, but now you have somebody trained on an iPad. What are they going to do?
5097260	5100380	Well, they might do that, but that's not the key thing they're going to do.
5102780	5107900	They're going to do what is called multi-touch gestures. And the one that you're thinking of
5107900	5114540	should be pinch to zoom. So the most natural way to do this is to treat it not as if it's
5114540	5119420	a paper map, but a stack of paper maps. And you want to go to the one with a different scale.
5119980	5126460	If you were doing this on an iPad that was mirroring this, the key point is that the paper map
5126460	5134620	doesn't have an extra dimension to play with. But the pinch to zoom dimension is a scale dimension.
5134700	5140060	So imagine what you did instead was you looked at your house, you pinched to zoom out,
5141820	5145500	you then do this motion or whatever it is to get to your friend's house. And then when you land
5145500	5154700	there, you expand it again. Imagine that you only know about paper maps, but your adversary has an
5154700	5161180	iPad. That's what I'm worried about. We're not looking for pinch to zoom.
5161420	5163980	What would that be in this?
5166620	5172860	Well, I claim that there are going to be 10 extra coordinates. And four of them
5175100	5179100	are pinched to zoom. And six of them are what I would call
5181420	5187740	shear to tilt. So imagine that you have a copy of a picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa on your
5187740	5194540	iPad. You should be able to do something in paint, which changes the angle. So if you go
5194540	5198460	into MS Paint, there's this little thing that allows you to change by a particular angle.
5198460	5205900	But you could do that as a gesture. So my claim is if you have four dimensions of time
5206700	5214060	and x, y, and z of space, you have pinched to zoom on all four of those. And then for any two
5214060	5223820	dimensions like x and z, you have shear to tilt. So the first are the four rulers. And the next
5223820	5227980	are the six protractors. And that's something called a symmetric two tensor or a metric,
5228540	5232700	which Einstein knew all about, but he only chose one through his equations. And he let
5232700	5238140	all the other ones lie fallow. And my claim is I don't think that's where we are. I think that
5238140	5242860	interplanetary physics is going to involve moving from what we called spacetime to something called
5242860	5250940	the observers, which contains pinched to zoom and shear to tilt. And you want to get off this
5250940	5254460	planet, you're not going to get there using general relativity, and you're not going to get
5254460	5258460	there using the standard model, it's time to take your pacifier out of your mouth and go back to
5258460	5264620	doing real physics. I think if we were serious about this, we would be struggling with the physics
5264620	5269660	of the world in which we live, not toy models, we'd be taking massive risks and listening to people
5269660	5275820	from various perspectives who haven't failed or have not been invited to fully explain their ideas.
5275820	5282540	And we'd be looking for things that would be new, new variables, new ways of working with the world
5282540	5289180	that allowed us to do things that were previously considered inconceivable. So if you look at 1911,
5289180	5293980	which is when I think Rutherford first starts talking about the neutron as a hypothesis,
5294460	5304060	it's 41 years later, we have the hydrogen bomb. We can do incredible things that are not possible
5305420	5312140	yet, because we don't know the framework. And my claim is, if you imagine somebody used to
5312140	5318300	paper maps being put on an iPad, and not knowing about multi-touch gestures, that is pretty much
5319260	5323500	an exact analogy of what happens when you do too much general relativity,
5324060	5328860	is that you start to think in general relativistic terms as if that's the last word.
5329420	5331180	Einstein would never have put up with that.
5331180	5334060	That's a question you've mentioned, Einstein, a couple of times today.
5335820	5342140	The most famous physicist of all time. How different do you think the landscape of physics
5342140	5348140	would be had Einstein lived for another decade? Just how good was he?
5349260	5357100	He was that good. The rare situation in which the man and the myth are roughly at the right level,
5358380	5364940	the same level. I don't think you could solve the puzzle of theoretical physics
5365900	5370300	and a final theory before the mid-1970s. We just didn't know enough.
5373420	5379180	In particular, quarks in 1968, you needed confirmation, because they're not obvious
5380460	5384620	in the world. They're stuck inside of protons and neutrons. And if you thought that protons
5384620	5391180	and neutrons were fundamental, you wouldn't be in contention. I would say that the first time
5391180	5399500	you could really guess the answer would be around 1975. I don't think Einstein was in the position
5399500	5404940	to guess the answer. I think he was very caught up in a Romanian framework, which is that you
5404940	5410140	deal only with length, angle, and the curvature of the space in which you live. There's a more
5410140	5416220	modern viewpoint on this that he could have understood. I don't know to what extent he
5416220	5423900	showed any recognition of it, but a lot of his thinking was really well suited for the world
5423900	5429100	in which he lived, where he could do these thought experiments in his mind about falling
5429100	5438780	elevators or train cars or whatever. You know, Dirac was every bit Einstein's equal.
5439900	5445260	We don't know how to interact with Dirac, because Dirac was so strange. Einstein kept
5445340	5450860	throwing off wisdom at an incredible rate. If you read ideas and opinions or out of my later
5450860	5456860	years, you have an idea of just what a sage this person was, even when he's screwing things up and
5456860	5465580	making mistakes. It's all sage-like. Dirac was the singular human being, and occasionally he says
5465580	5473100	something about life. I think when he was given a Nobel Prize, I think shared with Schrodinger,
5473100	5479100	he's given two speeches. He uses his lunchtime speech to talk about the bond market and the
5479100	5488060	importance of using the toolkit of physics within any sphere that is numbers-based.
5489900	5497580	We don't really know much about Dirac's views on humanity. We know about his beautiful aesthetic
5497820	5508300	of the quantum. He gave the quantum poetry. I think that right now, it's up to us. They're
5508300	5514940	not here right now. It's time to make guesses. I'm very partial to an example which happened
5514940	5521100	on the Wheel of Fortune program. Fold this into the cutting edge of physics.
5521820	5528060	Sure. I'm waiting. Okay. There's a guy named Ken Wilson who's discouraged all modern physicists
5528060	5533180	from making guesses about the ultimate theory because he taught us that you can only observe
5533180	5537660	the world at the energy scale that you're at. You and I are in a classical world. We don't see
5537660	5546700	the quantum. On Wheel of Fortune, there was a puzzle. It said, okay, Fraser expression,
5546700	5552220	there's one apostrophe in the first word with three letters, and it's a long answer,
5552220	5562780	and person guesses R, and there are no Rs. Then I think that goes to the next woman.
5562780	5569020	I think she guesses N. Oh, yes, there's one N, and she says, okay, I'd like to solve.
5569980	5576220	The host looks at her incredulously like, well, I guess you could try to solve. She says,
5577260	5582780	I will always remember this. I've got a good feeling about this, and it was right.
5587100	5590380	You'd never guess that there was enough information for a solve.
5592780	5597100	Whatever we have is what we've got. It's time to solve the puzzle.
5597740	5598540	What would that look like?
5600860	5605660	Ask somebody else. I try to solve this. I've got a theory, but Peter Wojt has a theory.
5606220	5610700	I'd like to hear what the string theory think their theory is. I'd like to understand where
5610700	5617020	asymptotic safety is. Everybody who's got a theory, whether it's David Deutch or Julian Barbour
5617660	5623500	or Garrett Lisey, needs to come to a conference. Somebody needs to hold a conference and say,
5623580	5628540	who can solve this puzzle? Let's put the sword in the stone, and let's let everybody try to
5628540	5633580	pull it out, because now is the time. The idea that we're not doing this and that we're letting
5633580	5638300	this community that has run itself into the ground continue to adjudicate what is physics,
5639260	5647180	it's like, you boys haven't really done anything in N years. You're not the arbiters of what is
5647180	5652860	science and what isn't. You've allowed this madness to creep into your university departments.
5652860	5657740	You're signing loyalty oaths. I have physics professors telling me that their boss is some
5657740	5664700	dean who writes to them about what they posted on social media. It's like, no, you're the boss.
5664700	5670780	You, the professors are the soul of the university. Stop sucking your thumb. Stand up for what it is
5670780	5675180	that you're supposed to be standing up for, which is excellence and research. Kick the people out
5675180	5680940	who don't belong there, and invite the people in who do, and let's get on with it. It's just,
5680940	5686700	I couldn't be more angry about anything else in the world. How can you take the lifeboat community,
5687660	5691260	the only community that can get us a way out of here and run it into the ground?
5691820	5693420	I like the term the lifeboat community.
5695260	5702700	It's time to save everybody, and we've got huge responsibilities. We carry a lot of responsibility
5702700	5706300	for getting everybody into this mess, and now we've got to offer everybody a way out.
5706620	5713740	Yeah, it seems, I don't know. I don't know the inner workings or the machinations of the physics
5713740	5721180	world, but the first time I ever spoke to Sabine Hossenfelder, she explained to me that physics is
5721180	5727740	as much about politics as it is about physics. In bad eras, that becomes more true. Sabine's
5727740	5733660	entire career has taken place inside of the stagnation, and she's like one of these
5733660	5738300	truth-telling people. I think she's basically truthful. I disagree with a lot of stuff that
5738300	5742620	I don't like that she, I think she does, which is a disservice to the community,
5743420	5746380	but she is truthful that this community is off the rails.
5748060	5754060	Moving from physics to something that you mentioned there, poetry, your cover photo on
5754060	5758540	Twitter was the first thing that we actually ever connected about long, long, long time ago,
5758540	5764620	and I'd just been to the Sagrada Familia. So I went for the first time to a wedding,
5764620	5768780	a friend's wedding that he was holding on the outskirts, and it was very enjoyable.
5771900	5776620	I had known about this building, I had read about it, I had seen all of the videos,
5777340	5782140	and it's your cover photo. First off, why? And then secondly, what does it mean to you?
5782140	5788220	What does this Sagrada Familia mean to you? I'm dying to hear, obviously we know it's important
5788220	5791500	in my life. I don't know whether it had an importance in yours.
5794380	5799340	Beyond beauty, no. It has no greater meaning to me than that. But one of the lessons that I did
5799340	5808540	learn was, there's that quote about humanity will flourish when men plant trees under which
5808540	5812860	they will never sit, something along those lines. And that's the first time that I've ever seen
5813820	5822300	a purely joyful expression, architecturally, artistically, that was created with the intense
5823100	5829740	intent purpose that that would be the end goal, that this is a, where are we at now,
5829740	5836220	in construction, 70 years, nearly 100 now? How many? I don't know. But it's a lot.
5836220	5839740	Still going. Yeah. So it's not done. And I think it's-
5839740	5843740	And we can't even figure out what his vision is. So we've allowed other people
5843740	5847580	to put their vision- Step in and- Yeah. Because there's only one of him,
5847580	5852860	Gaudi. Okay. The ceiling of that thing, to me, is transcendence.
5855820	5865340	You can't even believe it's real. There are things in this world
5866220	5872620	that remind you of the transcendent in all of us, that it's possible.
5878220	5884940	I can think of particular pieces of music or poems or pieces of architecture. I was just
5884940	5892860	inside the blue mosque in Istanbul, which is a few feet from Hagia Sophia. And the
5892940	5899660	interior of these two structures just are mind-blowing. And La Sagrada Familia,
5899660	5901660	I mean, these are religions that I'm not a part of.
5904300	5910540	If you're talking about the sacred family and you have a skylights to heaven,
5912780	5916700	how better to honor the creator, whether the creator exists or not,
5916700	5925980	than with genius and elegance and grace and humility and arrogance and everything that
5925980	5929820	went into that ceiling. That ceiling is like nothing else I've ever seen.
5932380	5937420	And you can touch- Sam Harris is famous for saying that you can either learn how to meditate
5937420	5941340	or I can give you a few micrograms of the substance and you're gonna have a profound
5941420	5947180	experience. Well, okay, just getting back from Sao Miguel and the Azores,
5948700	5954460	you could take LSD or DMT or you could go to Sao Miguel. I mean, it's just crazy
5954460	5961580	that there is that much beauty on earth. And I guess that space is something that I wanted
5961580	5965900	people to understand. When I named the show the portal and people did not understand,
5965900	5971260	it wasn't intended to be a show. It's intended to be a search for the actual portal out of here.
5971740	5979100	It's an attempt to find pinch to zoom. I believe that we are not doomed here,
5979980	5987500	but that we have developed this very weird focus on psychology. To challenge Einstein
5987500	5996140	is almost seen as arrogance. And yet, if Einstein is to survive as a legacy,
5996940	6003580	it's only going to be because somebody basically undermined general relativity status as a
6003580	6011340	fundamental theory because we're not going to make it. And I'm trying to remind people
6012460	6018780	in a world that now, like you can look up on Twitter, say lone genius theory,
6019740	6022060	people don't believe in the lone genius theory.
6025660	6030700	Well, then what was Gaudi? What was Dirac? What was Einstein? What was Yang?
6032540	6038620	What was Emmy Nerder? Somebody tell me why I have all of these lone geniuses in my life.
6039900	6043500	And aren't we supposed to be doing that and thinking that that's admirable?
6044460	6052940	I think we're supposed to be building the theory that can realize that the ceiling
6052940	6058860	of La Crada Familia is a portal. We're supposed to inspire ourselves with beauty and luxury.
6058860	6064220	We're not supposed to consume it to pig out for status reasons. We're supposed to get ourselves
6064220	6071260	into a state where we can dream at an interplanetary level. A lot of the things that we've spoken about
6071340	6077420	today are to do with cerebral horsepower, cognition, the difficult things that need
6077420	6081340	to be done in the head. And yet you're talking here about the transcendent. You're talking about
6081340	6086620	something which is embodied, which is spiritual by whichever definition of the word you want to use.
6088620	6093260	Do you find in yourself as somebody who does rely on cerebral horsepower for a lot of the
6093260	6099420	things that you try to do and presumably takes pride in your ability to have workout problems,
6099420	6106300	have thoughts? Do you feel attention in yourself between the transcendent, the relinquishing,
6106300	6113260	the embodied, and the cerebral, the cognitive, the purposeful on that side?
6113900	6119260	You know, I have a dumb expression which I don't use in public and I'm sure I'll be castigated for it.
6119260	6122540	Yeah, brilliant. But it's head, heart, and loins.
6123180	6132060	If it doesn't speak to your head, heart, and your loins, leave it for someone else.
6132700	6134140	What's that mean? How do you enact that?
6135340	6139260	You have to try to realize that these things have to be balanced and tempered.
6140060	6146700	You don't want to live by your heart. Just every time, you know, you see a daffodil blowing its
6146700	6151180	seeds into the wind, you'll be transported and you'll stop paying your electric bills.
6151740	6156380	And you don't want to be led around by your loins. That's not going to end well.
6156380	6159580	And you don't want to be led around by your head, too, because then you'll get yourself
6159580	6163100	into one of these cul-de-sacs and you won't even realize that you can't think your way out of it.
6163100	6166060	You were given all of these facilities and motivations.
6166060	6168460	How do you pull yourself from head to heart?
6169820	6176220	Well, you brought this guitar.
6177180	6178300	A Gitalely.
6178300	6178940	A Gitalely.
6178940	6181100	It's just on your right. Grab it. Show it to everybody.
6184540	6187580	So I don't, I do not play the Gitalely.
6188220	6191100	I don't think anybody actually technically does play the Gitalely.
6191100	6193340	It's like a guitar that's too small for your fingers.
6193340	6195180	Yes. You've got your pixel in it.
6197180	6202380	So you take some piece of music that actually means something to you, right?
6203100	6208220	And one thing that I remember hearing when I was growing up was this.
6218380	6222300	So it's the Asturias of Isaac Albanese. It was originally written for piano.
6223260	6228780	And you see sort of these things on Ud where you have a tremolo.
6228780	6232780	You've got two, two fingers playing the open B string,
6232780	6235180	and then you've got this melody which is played with the thumb.
6242540	6246220	So the combination of these things produces this different effect.
6250860	6252460	I can't really get my fingers in there.
6254540	6257660	And then I started thinking about, okay, well, that's a great effect.
6257660	6260860	What if we tried to write and to create using the same idea?
6260860	6261420	And I started,
6264220	6264540	so.
6264540	6291660	So that's not the same song, but it's using some of the same techniques about
6292380	6296380	just getting these things to ring out and to get the melody going on the bass line.
6297180	6301980	And then you have to forget this. Now, you know, if I was able to play this properly,
6301980	6306380	and I'm sorry if I'm embarrassing myself, you're trying to do this thing where you're
6308780	6316460	recognizing that the transcendent lives in particular structures,
6317020	6322380	that they elicit this feeling, and that we have this opportunity to go back and forth
6322380	6326460	between the analytic description. If I'm thinking about this, I can't really feel it.
6326460	6331500	And if I'm feeling it, I can't really figure out how to use it or think about it or compose with it.
6332140	6338700	And so, you know, to me, what we're trying to do is we're trying to
6339020	6349180	camp and de-camp. Well, that spoke to my head and my loins, but it didn't speak to my heart.
6350220	6356700	Or that spoke to two out of three. We need ultimately to be fully embodied. And that's a
6356700	6360700	challenge. And we have to, we either accept the challenge or we don't accept the challenge.
6361260	6364460	And we have to go back and forth between these lenses. You can't necessarily
6365420	6370060	be in the same, you know, if you see your child and you're a physician or surgeon,
6370060	6376220	you could see your child as a bunch of tissue hooked up to itself, you know? And that's important
6376220	6380460	if you're hiking and you're in a bad spot, you actually have to do an operation on your child.
6381660	6387020	But it's a terrible way to put your child to sleep when you're reading a bedtime story.
6387100	6395660	Is there a, is there a challenge that people are facing at the moment with
6399020	6407500	an over-reliance on a brain-based economy, an unlimited amount of information at your
6407500	6418220	fingertips with Wikipedia and chat UPT for them to struggle to find something transcendent when
6418220	6423340	it can be broken down into its component parts and explained by somebody who understands the child
6423340	6428220	as a connection of ligaments, organs and blood vessels as opposed to as the beautiful progeny
6428220	6435340	of the person looking at them? Well, keep in mind that there are people who can weave poetry
6436300	6440460	through their description of something very technical. Herman Vile, for example, wrote in a
6440460	6446860	very Olympian fashion about abstract algebra. He talked about the homosexuality of certain
6446860	6451340	symbols as filiating with themselves, you know? Completely crazy.
6451340	6452700	Ultrogyn arithmetic.
6453820	6461100	And, you know, there are people who just write beautifully. I think that Jim Watson,
6461100	6465660	who may be a son of a bitch on many fronts, is one of the great writers in the English language
6465660	6472700	if you read the double helix. It's an incredible narrative from one of the most memorable first
6472700	6484620	sentences to the conclusion. We need the Carl Sagan's to animate our head and our hearts
6485500	6490140	at the same time. Do you think there is an over-reliance on head at the moment?
6491340	6496140	I'm worried that our head, heart and loins are all disengaged.
6498620	6501020	So what do you use if you're not using any of those?
6501020	6502140	I use them all.
6502140	6504380	No, but what are the people using who are not using those?
6505100	6509100	They're not watching what's happening to them. They're being denatured by their phones.
6510860	6515500	Your phone is not a phone. It is a very, it's an environment.
6516460	6521500	You know, you pick it up and suddenly you're some place that you don't realize
6522220	6527180	isn't relative to your physical surroundings. You get very angry that you get a text message
6527180	6532940	while you're driving and you try responding to it. Well, you're going 45 miles an hour in a
6532940	6539340	several hundred pound or a thousand pound vehicle. You've lost track of where you are.
6539340	6547900	Our phone is, you know, and I talk to people about the crisis in pornography.
6550060	6557580	The only fans movement, the pornographic stuff that you're seeing, people are not getting easily
6557580	6565980	excited and aroused inside of any kind of context. Like the erotic is taking it on the chin, I think.
6565980	6572780	I think that's really important to remember that eroticism, for example,
6573340	6578620	is at least a combination of the loins in the head and it bests the heart as well.
6579900	6586060	What you're starting to see is people can't actually derive excitement from normal stimuli
6586060	6590380	that has to do with falling in love or having children or, you know.
6591100	6595500	So you're talking about an ever-escalating stimulus that people require to get the same
6595500	6600700	arousal response. And they can't. Yeah, Mary Harrington calls this one of her three
6600700	6605020	laws of porno dynamics. It's the law of fap entropy that whatever you start out wanking to
6605020	6614060	will get progressively more extreme over time. Well, what's the cure for that? Something high end.
6614380	6624700	You could just try to do it all on loins. Show me something where my psychogenic arousal gets
6624700	6629740	greater and greater because I've never seen that and holy cow is that far out. Or you could say,
6630300	6634300	you know, it's more like a cob-douglas utility function. You're going to have to bring this
6634300	6640060	down to my level. Multiple inputs. In other words, if I could offer you only food or only water,
6641020	6647100	that would not work. You'd rather, if you have a lot of food, have a little water to complement it
6647100	6651020	because that water becomes that much more valuable. Or if you have a ton of liquids and you have no
6651020	6655260	nourishment, you probably want really value a little bit of food. Well, in my opinion,
6655980	6663340	part of what we need is we need more things that reward us when we're integrating rather
6663420	6671180	than when we're extra-mising. Get back to that discussion about technology, not only fracturing
6671180	6677340	our attention, but also fracturing our experience. There seems to be a wistfulness, not just in the
6677340	6682700	dating realm, but in the experiential realm for a bygone time where we felt connected to the things
6682700	6690300	that we do. And it's interesting for someone of my age, I'm 35, so I'm like slap bang in the middle
6690300	6695580	of the millennials. So I remember a time before ubiquity of iPhones, before internet,
6695580	6701100	but there was like there's a whimsy of childhood in any case, and me being able to
6702140	6707500	tear those two apart is kind of difficult. But I definitely think that when I read history,
6707500	6712860	when I read Ryan Holiday, for instance, and I think about Zeno Obsidian walking around the
6712860	6719980	Stoa Poíclei, where I've been, and I'm there, and I think about the degree of connection to the
6719980	6726380	experience. What is technology and what are our smartphones doing to our ability to connect?
6726380	6730380	So they're changing our, our wetwear. We're not,
6733020	6739340	if you can have 12 life-changing experiences in the space of a minute and none of them are yours,
6740300	6742140	what do you think that's going to do to your mind?
6744700	6749580	You know, at some point I was in an oculus situation. I was deep underwater in a blue whale
6749580	6756780	swam past me. Well, none of that actually happened, but it felt like it did. Or you know,
6756780	6764460	that you can do this nuclear explosion on Henderson Island in oculus. That's just a more immersive
6764460	6775340	phone. And look, you have to be, you know, that's one of the things about La Sagrada Familia.
6776060	6781740	You go in there and it's real. You see the Grand Canyon and it is actually grand.
6783740	6789820	You know, there's certain things that don't easily live up to their billing. I think I went to
6789820	6796380	Pamukkalei in Turkey years ago, which Pamukk means cotton and Kalei, I guess, castles. It was a cotton
6796380	6803180	castles of mineral deposits and they formed these pools. And there weren't enough pools and there
6803180	6807180	were way too many people. So it was like one of those moments where the tourists have totally
6807180	6813740	destroyed the natural attraction. Okay, but I went into the blue mosque and it was every bit as
6813740	6816780	mind-blowing as it was the last time I was there 30 years ago.
6816780	6821580	It's the same way that I feel every single time I step into the Vatican, every single time.
6821580	6823980	Every single time. And I've been there three times now.
6823980	6825100	I've been there three times.
6825100	6832380	And it's just holy cow. Well, I shouldn't have said that. Anyway, very good. I didn't mean to.
6835420	6840540	Yeah, you have to, there have to be things that you actually viscerally relate to that stop you,
6840540	6845900	like the Bach cello sweets. How many times have I heard the Bach or whole lot of love
6846860	6853100	could do it either way? Or you shook me all night long, you know? That's holy. You shook me all night
6853100	6858300	long is a transcendent song.
6863260	6869020	It's less transcendent if you see it as part of a 60-second TikTok montage.
6869020	6872540	No, because the schmah is transcended and that'll fit right in there.
6879420	6879900	Can't hit that.
6879900	6893500	That's prayer.
6900620	6905500	You know, if that doesn't move you, you need to check into some place.
6906060	6913420	Those four notes recur in all of these songs that matter. It's basically Mary had a little
6913420	6921020	lamb with pho thrown in as well. You know, and I bring up this example. My wife was watching
6921020	6925820	a film. I didn't want to watch it, but some chick flick. And it all hovers around this one scene
6925820	6931900	where this guy drags this girl into a music store because he can't afford a piano.
6931900	6941820	He goes, I don't know you, but I want you. Going up to that fourth.
6943340	6951180	All the more for that. And I was transfixed. I could not continue to do my calculations.
6951180	6956540	Like, what the hell is this movie? So those four notes is a great place to ground yourself.
6956540	6962940	And there's a reason that they work. The second note brings up in your mind the
6964460	6971260	thing called the fifth, the dominant chord. The first note is spread between the tonic and the
6971260	6975980	subdominant. The third note belongs to the tonic only and the fourth note only belongs to the
6975980	6982060	subdominant. And so this idea that Western harmony revolves around these ideas of the
6982060	6987260	tonic, the subdominant, the dominant are carried by these notes. So even if you're not playing it
6987260	6995740	on a chordal instrument, that this pattern of four notes that keeps recurring grabs us because we
6995740	7002620	know what the chords are behind it. And it's basically Mary had a little lamb or proud Mary,
7002620	7009020	you know, but that's a great place to start for transcendence. Just check on something really
7009020	7018540	simple, whether you're feeling it. All and dread to emotions that I miss in my life.
7018540	7023820	Same one. So when I look up at the night sky, I get it in equal dosages. Oh, good.
7024540	7028060	You know, when it's good, I've been out to Joshua Tree, taking an edible,
7029020	7033740	didn't need the edible at all. That was unnecessary amplification. You know, we're having this
7033740	7040380	discussion in the middle of the Perseids meteor shower. No. I highly recommend get yourself
7040380	7044700	to a place where there's no light pollution and lay on your back right before dawn, you'll have a
7044700	7051660	blast. Oh, and but the awe and the dread is very much there. Yes. And I don't know, it makes you
7051660	7058540	feel insignificant in a way I think that keeps your ego small and helps to recenter your.
7059260	7063980	Do you want your ego small? Have you been told that was a good thing?
7065260	7068460	I've been told that it's a good thing. I would say for me,
7072460	7079660	remembering finitude and not insignificance, but the
7082460	7087420	temporary nature of our time here, the vastness of what is going to go on, the things that have
7087420	7094620	come before the things that will come after the scale. Yeah. I think that it grounds me. I struggle
7094620	7101500	to get into my head to describe the thing that is almost exclusively in heart and lines. And
7103820	7107980	it makes me feel good when I do that. And yet I find myself, I've got emails to do.
7107980	7113100	I heard this term the other day, John Lovell, Warrior Poet Society said the tyranny of the urgent.
7113900	7119100	And fuck, I love that. The tyranny of the urgent.
7119980	7122460	You're familiar with this concept of bathos? No.
7123340	7130700	The alternation between the transcendent and the mundane and the pressing. We will conquer
7130700	7139340	the cosmos, but I have to pick up my dry clean. Yeah, I think that there is that tyranny,
7139420	7145980	but I also want to just talk about arrogance and humility. I meet too many people who have
7145980	7151260	one without the other. And I see all these discussions online about so and so has this
7151260	7158060	beautiful epistemic humility or somebody else's, you know, preposterously arrogant or whatever.
7159180	7165580	And I sort of sit and wonder at this discussion. You want both.
7166300	7171180	What is humility without arrogance?
7173420	7173660	Well,
7176460	7180780	you know who I think actually had this in kind of pretty decent balance that was on display
7180780	7185660	for the world to see was Khabib Nurmagomedov.
7187820	7192700	What an unbelievably good example. Right. So tell me how it lands for you.
7193660	7198140	Khabib is very, very high on a list of people that I would love to speak to.
7198140	7203900	And you hear that Khabib? Listen, Khabib, if anybody in Dagestan has got Khabib's email address,
7203900	7208060	please tell him to get in touch. Okay. This is fascinating to me.
7208060	7216300	So the more, I'll do a timeline of it. So Conor McGregor, very seductive,
7217020	7223260	very obviously seductive, working class, the Irish hate to be told that they're a part of the UK.
7223260	7227820	They're not, they're near, you know, close enough. It's like an adopted son type thing.
7227820	7235900	Okay. And I'm thinking God disguised like a savant of war and artistry as he's coming up.
7235900	7242220	And then he beats Chad Mander's and it's a war as a fight. And then he's crying.
7242220	7248220	And then he does the other side of it. And he's doing with Ida Potal. He's balancing
7249020	7257180	in the middle of maybe Vegas or California somewhere on a walking rail, on a side rail.
7258140	7262860	And he's, I think Nate Diaz accused him of playing touch butt with that dork in the park.
7263740	7267340	And he's doing handstands and he's got this sort of fluidity to him.
7267340	7273580	And then there's this amazing interview that was clipped and put in perfectly of
7274780	7279660	a journalist reciting back to Conor what he said before the Aldo fight. And he said,
7280540	7284700	at the press conference, I saw his right hand shaking. That was a subtle tell for me.
7284700	7288300	He's going to overload with that right hand. And when he thinks I will be that I will not,
7288300	7292220	I will create gaps within that octagon. He will fall into those gaps. And that is when I will
7292220	7296540	strike. And then there's a clip of him backstage before he's about to fight.
7296540	7300300	And he's bouncing backwards and forwards in that sort of long karate stance that he does.
7300300	7304620	And he steps back and he throws that left hook practicing and they placed it in time
7304620	7310060	with the fight. Amazing. And it's the same move. And this guy says, you said these things,
7310060	7317180	recites that thing post fight. How'd you do that? How'd you do that? And Conor talks about if you
7317180	7321420	have the bravery enough to speak it and the courage enough to be able to pursue it then.
7321580	7328940	And I'm just fucking enthralled by this guy. I got put onto a reality TV show in my 20s
7329660	7334060	that we had no internet, no contact with friends or family or any sort of news.
7334060	7337420	And it turned out that while I was there, I think it was Rafael Dasaños,
7338540	7341980	it was injured. So I was terrified I was going to miss McGregor's fight,
7341980	7348620	because that's how inspiring it was to me. And then there's this talk of this guy,
7348620	7355900	this other fighter, unbeaten, undefeated. And it's the Bane Batman type scenario,
7355900	7361340	at least that's the model that I had in my mind. And I'm like, you know, you've got the almost the
7361340	7366780	Rocky versus who was the Russian guy that he's training for in the fight? No.
7368460	7373420	Who's the Russian guy that Conor fights? The Rocky fights, sorry.
7374300	7383580	Yes, I'm Dragov. So it's almost that, right? You've got this training in the mountains and
7383580	7391900	chopping wood. And then there's the Dolly, Conor throws the Dolly, and you start to see,
7391900	7396860	that was the first time I really took notice of Khabib. And you remember that video?
7397500	7400620	Send me location. Send me location. Just tell me where.
7401420	7406220	Send me location. And there's a number of tribute videos called the location,
7406220	7413100	it's about with a K, about Khabib. I'm like, fucking hell. This guy is something else.
7413900	7421260	This guy is real. Correct. Conor McGregor was spread between real and fake.
7421580	7431740	Right. The showmanship was a part of, it was backed up, particularly by his striking,
7431740	7437580	by his ability to sense his opponent, sort of almost using your antenna.
7441180	7447420	But I really believe that in part, trying to get into your opponent's head with somebody,
7447660	7455180	I really wonder whether Westerners have any idea of what happens in places like Central
7455180	7458540	and Eastern Europe, when you start talking about somebody's mother.
7467260	7471900	I had this really bad cultural reaction, which is that there are people who are bought into the
7471900	7480700	whole trash talking thing. And if it had been like, I don't know, Conor McGregor versus,
7480700	7483420	and I don't know how to pronounce it, Child Sonan or something like that.
7483420	7488860	Yes, Child Sonan, yeah. It's a fag game. Yeah, they're both accepting the game.
7490220	7492620	And with Khabib, I just had this other thought of like,
7492620	7498620	have you never met anyone from Dagestan before? Yeah. Like anyone from Dagestan. It's not just
7498620	7506860	Khabib. It's so bad. Have you ever done improv? No. Well, inadvertently.
7507820	7514220	In improv classes, there's something called punking the game. Okay. And let's say that we're in a
7514220	7518780	circle and we're supposed to whoosh, we pass energy around whoosh, and you can go boing,
7518780	7522620	and it goes back the other way, and you can like send it across and stuff. There's only one rule.
7522620	7529660	One rule is don't punk the game. Punking the game is like not playing by the rules.
7529660	7534540	Game rejection. Yes. And what you see is Conor playing a game of tennis,
7534540	7541260	and he keeps on serving this ball across. And I saw it 100% from Khabib's perspective.
7541260	7545100	Not only does the ball not come back across the net, he doesn't even have the racket in his hand.
7545900	7548380	You know, he's there. He's got to be there. There's obligations to be done.
7549340	7556540	And it was that series of press conferences that really made me fall in love with Khabib,
7556540	7562860	and then how it gets me emotional thinking about, thinking about his tribute to his father.
7562860	7566220	I'm telling you, I can't see it from Conor's perspective.
7567500	7568860	Of why you would behave in that way?
7570860	7576460	Two seconds facing this guy is not a question of fear. It's a question of respect.
7578780	7583260	Maybe I just don't get it. But I spend enough time, I have spent enough time
7584540	7589500	in, I don't know, the north of India or the center of Turkey or places in Egypt,
7590940	7594700	or Ukraine or Russia, wherever. You don't...
7597420	7601900	I can tell the internet's gonna completely tell me I don't get it. You don't do this stuff.
7602540	7607980	You just don't. It's like, I can't explain to people who are convinced that the internet is
7607980	7614380	the gift to prove that dunking and dragging is man's highest function. There's so much stuff you
7614380	7620620	don't do. And this whole move towards like anonymity and let's make fun of everybody and
7620620	7629900	everything because mockery is good. This way, this is the direction to madness.
7631500	7637180	I certainly think that, Peterson said this a while ago, one of the main problems with Twitter is
7637180	7643820	it's driven the proximate price of being a prick down to zero. Sure. And the combination of real
7643820	7649340	people and unnamed accounts and bot farms and the inability to work out whether it's been said in
7649340	7654620	earnest or said in a... Or whether it's been coordinated so that 100,000 people go off at
7654620	7661900	once on the exactly the same point. Getting back to the issue of arrogance and humility, what is
7661900	7677660	Khabib? Competent, unwavering, humble. He's both arrogant and humble.
7680380	7687260	And you have to look at the move that he does when you compliment him. What does he do?
7687740	7697740	Alhamdulillah, right? Or Mashallah or something with the name Allah in it. It's like, I give you
7697740	7704700	this praise. Oh, no, no, no. It's not for me. It's for the God, all for my father or for my father.
7705740	7713580	And so this issue about... This is a beautiful thing when you have Muslim friends is that they
7713580	7723980	learn to deflect all of this positivity out. If they're getting it, they deflect it
7724620	7728620	so that they don't keep it and they don't become insufferable. On the other hand,
7729260	7734140	if they're extraordinary at what they do, they know that they're extraordinary at what they do.
7734140	7739420	Khabib is under no illusions as to how good he is. He set the highest standards for himself.
7739420	7741660	Tomorrow night, I'm going to smash your boy.
7744940	7751660	He is simultaneously... You said competent. It just wasn't fair to him.
7753500	7765660	He's way beyond competent. I guess I just want people to realize that you need arrogance to stand
7765740	7773660	up against insuperable odds. And you need humility to stop your arrogance from driving you insane.
7773660	7780380	And to keep asking that people be constantly humble is an affront to what we are as humans.
7780380	7789660	I really don't grasp it. You need that deep humility, 100%. But so many people need arrogance
7789660	7794300	in order to take on the challenges that they could... If you took the world seriously,
7794300	7797020	you'd never take on those challenges if you were just humble.
7798620	7806140	Yes. One of my favorite clips of Khabib, post-fighting, post-career,
7807660	7813420	he's doing an interview and talking about the training camps, the gym that he looks after,
7813420	7819100	and some of the fighters that are there. And I think they train six days or six and a half days
7819100	7824620	a week. And he tells them they need to get up. Some of the guys complain and he says,
7824620	7830300	it's okay. You go home, your mom, she'll tuck you into bed at night, she will cook you dinner
7830300	7835420	and tomorrow, you'll be comfortable. But that's not why you're here.
7836460	7842060	Put that coffee down. Do you know coffee is for closers?
7842060	7848380	Ah, yes. Yes. Good reference. Your name's Lavie. You call yourself a salesman,
7848380	7854620	you son of a bitch? I just love... I really, really love this.
7856140	7861660	I had a conversation last week and I was told a quote,
7863260	7866380	self-love is holding yourself to a higher standard than anybody else.
7868220	7874300	You know, I'll be honest with you, I get tired of these things. I think that there's a lot of men
7874300	7880780	in particular looking for simple answers. And all of these things fall flat for me.
7882620	7887660	They're front-loaded because they simplify things. Imagine that that's all that self-love was.
7888860	7894220	Well, then I'd have a definition. But it's not going to work. And I think that this is one of
7894220	7900540	the things that I don't know how to fight exactly is that we're in a world that's convinced that
7900540	7907900	the truth must be simple. And all of these simple truths don't survive the collider that is
7907900	7915260	modern social media. So I don't disagree. The problem with a truth which is boundlessly complex
7915260	7921580	is that functionally, it's useless. And I'm so glad you made this point. That's the puzzle.
7922780	7927900	We're now in a world where to do the nuance is to get yourself tangled because the internet
7927900	7935020	is not friendly to nuance. On the other hand, to say something simply and crisply leads you into
7936140	7940300	disappointing everyone who's believed in you. And you know, we were talking before a little
7940300	7945020	bit about Christopher Hitchens. Yes. Tell me about your thoughts on Hitch. I asked Sam this
7945020	7949020	question. Sam spent a good bit of time with him. What would the modern culture be like if Hitch
7949020	7956140	was still alive? Hitch, I think, would have been forced to either self incinerate or
7958140	7963100	adapt. And I'm not sure what you would have done. What self incineration in this context?
7963900	7969420	One of the things that makes Christopher Hitchens a hero to so many people, almost oddly a secular
7969420	7978220	saint, if you will, is that he held the promise that one could simply stand in some place that was
7978220	7986060	reasonable and hold forth from that simple perspective like, yep, there is nothing to Islam.
7986060	7989020	It is nonsense. It might be something he would say, or you might say,
7992700	7997180	you know, free speech is absolute and you have every right to say anything you want. And I have
7997180	8003020	every right to say and the better ideas will prevail. Now you watch what's happened with Sam
8003900	8010860	and this question of Trump. Sam perceives Trump to be an asymmetric existential threat
8011980	8017580	and was willing to go and back the idea that the Hunter Biden laptop story
8018780	8026380	might not have benefited the election. And he's lost an enormous number of people who otherwise
8026380	8030460	agree with him. And now what's the reasoning? The reasoning and something I, oddly, I,
8031260	8036620	first time I met Sam, I went on his show to warn him that you can't just optimize for truth.
8037340	8043020	You have to optimize. I said, I have four variables I can't live without. Truth, meaning, fitness and
8043020	8050620	grace. So Trump is a fitness puzzle to Sam, which is if we allow Trump to destroy the country
8050620	8055820	in Sam's mind, then we've lost fitness. There's no, there's no point in being truthful.
8055900	8062380	And then there's a question about what is the meaning? Do you destroy the meaning of a democracy
8062380	8067020	when you hold back information? Maybe you do. Maybe it no longer feels like it's an actual
8067020	8072700	democracy. What is the graceful thing to do? What is the just and right thing to do?
8075500	8079180	I am convinced that some of Hitch's positions
8079660	8087980	were attractive because he was using his big brain to suggest that life could be lived simply.
8090620	8095420	If we were just strong enough of character, if we were clear enough of thought,
8095420	8099740	we could espouse something like free speech or reason, and it would be enough.
8100140	8107820	Without requiring that we hold it up to a higher power.
8107820	8113740	Or that you get caught in some very serious situation where you're in an edge case.
8114460	8119820	Free speech does not exist in an absolute forum under American law.
8121660	8128940	It just doesn't. We mentioned Miller versus California, which was a sort of a
8128940	8134620	follow-on decision to memoirs versus Massachusetts. You don't have a right
8135980	8142940	to broadcast pornography because pornography does not enjoy First Amendment protection.
8143900	8149020	Now, how do you discern that pornography doesn't? Well, the justices claim that it doesn't.
8149580	8154780	And there's a three-factor test for what is pornography, which was, I believe,
8154780	8160700	attenuated under something called memoirs versus Massachusetts, but that was not allowed to stand.
8160700	8168940	You're not allowed to necessarily endanger troop movements by blabbing information in a war.
8168940	8173900	You're not able to slander or libel. There are all sorts of adjustments to free speech.
8175260	8181820	And when you come at one of these perspectives from an absolutist frame of mind,
8182300	8187020	you have to hope that you're not going to meet the edge case. A good example for me was the Second
8187020	8194940	Amendment. I noticed that many Second Amendment types took an absolutist perspective, saying the
8194940	8199100	right to keep and bear arms will not be infringed and don't bother me about a well-regulated
8199100	8204700	militia. I said, okay, I'm not going to talk to you about a well-regulated militia. My question
8204700	8209500	is, should the Davy Crockett be sold at K-Mark? And they would often say, well, what's the Davy
8210460	8217900	Crockett? And I said, well, it's about 100-pound personal nuke. Well, first of all, I was very
8218460	8222780	flabbergasted that a lot of gun enthusiasts did not know that there was a personal nuke developed
8222780	8230060	by the United States. But then immediately, many of them saw where this was going, which is, okay,
8230060	8236540	if we're going to restrict personal nukes at K-Mark, then you've got your foot in the door,
8236620	8240940	the camel has its nose under the tent. It's a difference of degree, not a difference of kind
8240940	8245740	all the way down. Exactly. So I think that personal nukes have to be sold at K-Mark,
8245740	8249420	because the American population needs to keep parity with the American military.
8250540	8254300	And then I say, well, do you realize what you just said? Do you realize that you've
8254300	8261420	bounced out of your very simplified framework? They don't. And this is partially the problem,
8261500	8268860	which is that if you can't talk about taste and trade-offs and balance, because it's all squishy,
8270300	8276460	then you have all of these people running to these different ultra simplifications, none of which
8276460	8283500	work. There's a quote from one of my smartest friends, Gwinda. A dilemma of tweeting is that
8283500	8287660	you're aware of exceptions and conditions to your statements, but can't include them without
8287660	8292300	turning an elegant aphorism into a clunky mess. So you must choose between writing
8292300	8296620	tinniered garbage or getting torn apart by pedants and replies and quote tweets.
8298620	8302940	I've chosen to fail in a particular fashion. No, but this is really important.
8305180	8308700	I'm failing. How about you? Depends what your goals are.
8309260	8314460	Well, but my point to you is I don't think we're meant to succeed here.
8314460	8315980	What's that mean? What's the criteria?
8318620	8322380	Was that a herd? What's the criteria?
8322380	8323740	No, sorry, the person who just said that.
8323740	8324700	Gwinda, no, a guy.
8324700	8332780	A guy. What he said was that you're aware of the trade-off and there's no way out of the trade-off.
8336220	8342140	I believe that there are ways out, but they have their own problems. Once you start to understand
8342860	8348780	all of the different forces that are arrayed against you, you realize that if somebody
8348780	8356060	chooses to hyper-focus on various things, they can effectively destroy your credibility in general.
8356060	8358540	And you brought up Wikipedia and I wanted to talk about that.
8359100	8364060	An interesting thing that's happening with Wikipedia is the difference between individual
8364060	8372220	Wikipedia entries and Wikipedia entries on a subject or a plant or a geographic place.
8373980	8377100	So isn't it strange that if you were to look up, for example,
8378780	8383660	pneumatic drill on Wikipedia, there'd be a huge technically accurate article about
8384460	8385340	pneumatic drills.
8385340	8387580	Constitutes it. Who invented it?
8387580	8392700	Right. And then you look up Jordan Peterson and I guarantee you it's going to be a war zone.
8395020	8404780	And now you fuse these two things together, which is weaponized Wikipedia and factual Wikipedia.
8406300	8409100	And this is like some really dangerous new object.
8409100	8415260	And I always knew that Wikipedia, the genius thing that it was, had a finite shelf life
8415820	8420300	because it made the fatal flaw of using authoritative sources as bedrock truth.
8421260	8424620	What happens when trolls get access to bedrock sources?
8424620	8428460	What happens when the State Department or the Department of Homeland Security
8428460	8431420	or the intelligence community or people who hate you?
8432460	8437820	That was the headlines that happened after my episode on Joe's show,
8438700	8447740	where it was the weekend that somebody had nudged the definition of recession on Wikipedia to no
8447740	8454700	longer be two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. And this was a Monday and it happened
8454700	8460540	over the weekend. I mentioned it and all hell broke loose. It had already broken loose over
8460540	8465500	the weekend. And then obviously anything Joe touches gets amplified to high heavens.
8466140	8476940	And you're like, okay, so the definitions that we use, I think Shapiro calls it semantic overload,
8478860	8481420	that's the battleground, ultimately almost all.
8481420	8486220	Tell me the frame and I'll tell you the argument. Like somebody will say,
8486860	8495020	you know, is it worth stopping Donald Trump by suppressing stories? Yes or no? Go.
8496380	8504700	I was like, well, first of all, the question was designed to subsume that we have to stop
8504700	8510060	Donald Trump. I might agree that with that. I believe maybe we should stop Donald Trump.
8510700	8515260	But you did make that the argument and then you piled on a question on top of it and you subsumed
8515260	8521180	that within the frame. And so more or less, this is everything at the moment, which is if you can
8521180	8525980	define misgendering and dead naming, you've won the argument.
8525980	8529980	You suppose there's a world in which, yeah. So I'll give you an example for the fledgling
8529980	8533980	podcasters out there. When you first start doing a podcast, you're nervous that the guest
8533980	8538620	doesn't like you. You're nervous that the guest isn't interested in you, that your question sucks,
8538620	8544300	that your question doesn't make sense, and you're terrified of silence among millions of other things.
8544300	8549020	Did any of those happen in this episode? Oh, you've been very welcoming. How could I know?
8549020	8555740	After you serenaded me with you, Gitta Laylee, it was a perfect aphrodisiac. So what you do,
8555740	8563100	and what I noticed with a lot of young new podcasters, is they do multiple choice offering.
8563100	8569100	So I'll ask you a question. Eric, Trump 2024, what do you think is going to happen?
8569660	8574060	Is it going to be that, and as soon as you say is it, and you then create either a binary or
8574060	8579580	a trinary of options, you have now, not only, you've restricted for the entire universe of
8579580	8583420	different things that you could have come up with, I don't know whatever you're going to say.
8584940	8589580	I've given you two choices. So it makes it difficult for you to take a third because you
8589580	8595340	need to say no and why, no and why, and then take the third. So you often offer up this
8595900	8602540	very narrow, very unidimensional landscape. Exactly. And it ruins the conversation.
8603180	8610700	It's funny. Lex makes assumptions in so many of his frames that I unweave, but I think he gets like
8612620	8617340	some of the best out of me as a guest. And there's something about unweaving
8618300	8623500	Lex's questions, which I hate doing to him because I want to just answer his questions.
8623580	8626940	But on the other hand, there's something about the process of unweaving the assumptions that
8626940	8632460	actually benefits some of our interaction. So I think that there's a lot of this
8633740	8642940	just grooming us, grooving us to only think about certain possibilities. And
8643820	8653980	what I don't know is how do you get nuanced thought to propagate at the speed of the meme?
8653980	8660300	You need to make it sexy. Well, to an extent, I do this with acronyms and the acronyms have taken off,
8661020	8665900	but then there's a different population that gets very angry, which is why are you allowed to create,
8666780	8673580	we're allowed to create these memes with a distracted boyfriend, but you're not allowed
8673580	8681580	to create an acronym to make a concept sticky. So what we're in is some sort of warfare for
8681580	8694620	mind share. And I'll be honest, I'm not seeing high-level interactions the way I was five years
8694620	8701900	ago between people. What's happened? I think that they've done a pretty good job of disconnecting
8701900	8707420	us. You remember the old data and society report where you looked at chains of association,
8707420	8711340	and the whole game was to tie everyone back to my loyianopolis or something.
8711980	8717100	So I go to Interject, I go to Qatar to do this debate about masculinity about six months ago,
8717100	8722540	and they put up on one of the segments. I was pro-traditional masculinity, and there was a gentleman
8722540	8727980	on the other side, and they said, here is a montage of some unspeakable people that represent
8727980	8731980	masculinity. And there was Joe Rogan and John Peterson and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
8731980	8737660	but the first person was Milo Yianopolis. I said, look, if you have brought me to the Middle East
8737660	8744140	to defend Milo Yianopolis, did you have brought the wrong person? I'm like, we need to shift that,
8744140	8748700	get that to one side. Milo can go over there. Do you see his debate with destiny that he did
8748700	8756300	a couple of weeks ago, maybe three months ago now? Milo looked like an old touring singer
8756300	8762940	in a rock band, still doing the shows, but can't hit the high notes anymore. And the whimsy
8763820	8772780	and that sort of playful jester-joker kind of game, gamesmanship, had been abandoned in place of
8773500	8778700	bottom of the barrel, backbiting and genuine emotional sniping. And then destiny said,
8778700	8784620	after he's been pushed and pushed and pushed for 90 minutes, he says to destiny,
8787500	8791100	back in the olden times, they would have left your kind on the side of a hill to die.
8791820	8797420	And destiny said, well, I think that the gays would have been left there first. Milo said,
8797420	8801580	well, I don't think that you can tell whether a baby's going to like dick when it comes out or not.
8802540	8806300	Destiny said, well, you'd know all about young boys liking dick, wouldn't you?
8806940	8813180	Wow. And it broke Milo, it broke his brain. Sorry, what was that? And no one had any sympathy,
8813180	8819580	because for 90 minutes, he'd called destiny's wife a public fleshlight. He'd said everything
8819580	8828300	under the sun. Why are we dealing with these people? Because it is entertainment, it is mental
8828380	8836780	masturbation, it, a story about people will always be more seductive to a broader group
8836780	8845500	than a story about ideas. Got it. I think. Am I wrong? I don't know. I just,
8845500	8852140	despairing. So much stuff, so much beauty in this world. And I just, I wonder at what point does
8852140	8863500	middle school lunch table, when you compare it to amino acids, you compare it to,
8871260	8876300	you go scuba diving? I have done. I suck. What's the most beautiful place you've gone scuba dive?
8876460	8885260	Ghillie T, off the coast of Bali. Okay. I remember scuba diving off
8885260	8890940	Manjungan Island in Bali. Amazing. But the Red Sea totally blew my mind.
8892620	8897820	I can't tell you how little I care about Miloianopolis and how much I care about scuba diving in
8897820	8904860	the Red Sea. I don't know. Maybe I'm just wrong. There's something wrong. It's just to get back to
8904940	8910300	it. We all used to talk to each other. And then this thing started dividing us.
8912940	8917340	You know, you started seeing all these messages. Oh, your boy said this. Your boy said that. Time
8917340	8924860	to come collect your boy. Who talks like this? The internet. And then we stopped seeing each other
8924860	8935980	in our feeds. And I said, well, this is Vijaya Gade under Jack Dorsey. Jack had gotten some system
8935980	8940860	whereby he took his hands off it because he knew that terrible things had to be done, I think.
8941500	8945900	And he just had this idea, well, if I have to intercede at Twitter, then something has gone
8945900	8951100	wrong with the system. And you had this person who was just very happy bringing health to the
8951180	8957420	internet, but it disconnected all of us. It was very clear that our engagement just
8957420	8961820	dropped. And then if you complained about it, it was because you actually sucked and nobody
8961820	8968300	cared about your tweets. You had no idea where you were. And so all of this kind of good feeling
8969420	8974220	evaporated in part because people didn't know how to fight as a team. And this is just,
8975260	8978220	I would love to get back to the masculinity riff a little bit.
8978620	8987500	I don't think men know how to fight as groups. And it's a key part about masculinity. And it
8987500	8994700	really makes me upset to see all of these people in individual masculine space. If you're ever
8994700	8999660	faced with three attackers, two of whom have knives and one of whom has a gun, here's your best
8999660	9003500	move. It's like, you know, you don't know. You've never faced this.
9003580	9004540	You've never faced this.
9004540	9007900	Is the best move to have a group of five friends with you?
9008460	9015420	Well, first of all, yes. And having people's back.
9016780	9021420	So this is something that I've spent an awful lot of time over the last couple of years thinking
9021420	9031420	about. The definition of addiction is that you can find fulfillment alone.
9032380	9033980	It's something that I heard a few weeks ago.
9038220	9049340	The atomization of everybody, the generalized risk aversion syndrome that we are seeing,
9049900	9054700	something called extended adolescence or slow life strategy from Gene Twengey.
9055580	9057420	Talking about young people are getting their driver's license.
9057420	9059820	Don't know it, but let get immediately from the title.
9061420	9066060	People getting their driver's licenses later. They're partying less. They're drinking less.
9066060	9069180	They're leaving home later. They're getting occupations, starting jobs later.
9070540	9072860	Could this have been contributed to through COVID? Yeah, probably.
9074140	9076620	But it was catalyzed. It was already a trend that was happening.
9078060	9085100	It's affecting men particularly because male friendship groups are
9086060	9095900	more fragile in some regards than women's. In 1990, the number of men who said they had zero
9095900	9101500	close friends was around about 3%. In 2020, that number was 15%.
9102140	9103020	That's insane.
9103020	9107420	The most common answer to the question, how many friends could you call on in an emergency,
9107420	9110620	is zero. The most common. It's not the average, but it's the most common.
9111500	9114220	More people have zero friends to call on than have any other number.
9117580	9123580	The challenge of modern masculinity relates to that addiction quote,
9123580	9128060	the belief that you can find fulfillment alone. You see this in the sigma male meme,
9128060	9130380	sigma male grind set. I don't know this.
9130380	9136540	So you have alpha, beta, the sort of red pill, the blue pill, the purple pill,
9136540	9138780	halfway between the two. I don't know this either.
9138780	9144380	Okay. So the sigma male steps outside of the existing dominance hierarchy.
9144380	9147340	He doesn't try to lead. He doesn't try to do anything. He is a lone ranger,
9147340	9152380	Lauren to himself. Over the top of a lot of this meta meme, which is being created,
9152380	9157980	is a guy called Chris Bumstead, who is a three-time, four-time classic physique champion,
9157980	9162940	Mr. Olympia. Classic physique is they have weight limits, which means that they have
9162940	9169420	a much more Arnold-esque. It's all about shape and sculpture, massive, but not a mass monster.
9169420	9174620	Phil Heath was sat in that seat not long ago, mass monster. I sit down with Chris,
9174620	9181100	this guy who is the face of the sigma male meme, perhaps the one of the driving forces
9181100	9187260	behind young male belief at the moment. And I asked him, how much of what you've done and
9187260	9190940	achieved in business, in personal life, and in your sport, could you have done on your own?
9191420	9197580	Zero. I could have done none of it. I couldn't have gotten through the difficult times
9197580	9201900	emotionally without my fiance. I couldn't have built my personal brand without my best friend
9201900	9206060	and videographer Calvin. I couldn't have run my business without Vaughn and my other business
9206060	9210860	partners that are here. I couldn't have done any of this stuff. And this is the guy that
9210860	9214860	he's in the ice tub as there's dubstep music over the top of him saying,
9214860	9220380	you don't need anybody else and so on and so forth. The belief that you can find fulfillment alone
9221180	9232140	is a lie. It is a lie that people who have been hurt and scorned and rejected by the world
9232140	9239020	retreat into. There is a safety blanket of cynicism that people can use. It's sour grapes at an
9239020	9245740	existential level. The belief that the upside of never trying is never having to feel the pain of
9245740	9253900	failure. And the generalized risk aversion, the extended adolescence, the slow life strategy
9254700	9259660	permits that to seep ever more into people's lives. In a world where we have hyper convenience,
9259660	9269660	why should I feel discomfort? So what's going on with the modern masculinity movement?
9270540	9275900	It's fractured. So there is the manosphere, which is the broad term that describes people
9275900	9281500	talking to men. I've never identified with it. I'm not a part of it. In as much as I speak to men
9281500	9286140	about things that I struggled with and they listen, perhaps someone could put me in it,
9286140	9290540	but I don't think that they help. I think fundamentally at the moment the masculinity
9290540	9294540	movement sees women as adversaries and competitors rather than compatriots.
9295500	9302620	I think that they treat women largely like an enemy to be avoided or a resource to be used
9302620	9309980	and discarded. I think that largely much of men's advice benefits some men at the expense of most
9309980	9315180	others that if being a high value man means sleeping with as many women as possible,
9315180	9320540	but a low value woman is a woman that slept with many men, what you are doing is creating a wake
9320540	9326300	after you that other men have to pick up the pieces of if your goal is to be this high value,
9327340	9336540	many high body count male. Let me give you this. So this is actually going into a paper,
9336540	9341500	my first academic paper that I've ever been a part of. So this is the male sedation hypothesis.
9342060	9348140	Okay. There's an effect called young male syndrome. You heard of this?
9348140	9353980	Nope. If you have a large number of dispossessed sexless men throughout all of history,
9353980	9357740	bad things happen. Yeah. Testosterone drops when you get in a relationship and drops again
9357740	9363740	once you have kids. This means in large part that women domesticate men in some regard.
9363740	9368540	They have to. You don't want to take risk taking behavior when you've got a newborn at home. Don't
9368540	9376220	jump off that fucking cliff. Okay. Like let's be, go home, go home. So when you have
9376220	9378940	large numbers of dispossessed young men who aren't having sex,
9380060	9386780	what's the reason for integrating into society? They take a brilliant study is done of men crossing
9386780	9390380	the road and the difference between when they cross and the distance from the nearest car
9391340	9395420	with or without the presence of women. You put a woman there, the distance
9395500	9399740	closes massively. No women there. They're not bothered. Risk taking behavior is a show. Look
9399740	9403500	at my excess fitness. Yeah. Look at all of these risks that I can take. Look at the plumage on the
9403500	9411500	back of my tail, right? So throughout all of history, it seems like they set cars on fire and
9411500	9420220	push over granny and cause havoc. In Portugal, 1700s, the first son, there was a disparity in
9420220	9425500	the sex ratio. I'm not sure why the first son was allowed to marry. Every subsequent son was put
9425500	9431900	on a ship, go explore the new world. Don't burn our home was what they were saying. There is a
9431900	9437820	question. We have very high rates of sexlessness and we have very low rates of integration amongst
9437820	9442220	young men at the moment. Why are we not seeing them going around and setting a setting cars on
9442220	9450780	fire? Jordan Peterson was featured as the incel god. He inspired a movie by Olivia Wilde
9450780	9453740	starring Harry Styles a little while ago. I brought it up to Jordan.
9456540	9463580	The incel god? He was the king of the incels. Yes, this incel. I am so pissed to hear this.
9464380	9470300	Jordan laughed it off in classic him fashion. Yeah, but as a guy who opened for Jordan Peterson
9470300	9478060	on Harmonica, I've been to some of his shows. Jordan Peterson recognized this demographic
9478060	9486780	early and he had the courage to speak directly to it. If you want to see me break out in tears,
9487420	9492620	have me tell you the stories about the people who went up to Jordan Peterson and said,
9492620	9499420	I was smoking weed, masturbating in my parents' basement. Six months later, I've got a job,
9499420	9508140	I've got prospects, I've got a fiance, et cetera, et cetera. To turn him into the incel king or
9508140	9514380	whatever, no, Jordan Peterson tried to become the one person answer to the world uncle shortage.
9519020	9526780	I just have no patience for dismissing that much good. If some of his message seemed off to you,
9526860	9531340	it's because you didn't need it. You didn't understand what clean your room was about.
9531340	9537340	You laughed it off because you weren't screwed. He gave people a path just the way Sam gave people
9537340	9543660	a path from that abusive religious household where they didn't know to escape. To an extent,
9544940	9551820	all of these people spoke to people at different stages of their lives. A lot of this female
9551820	9556620	behavior which is, oh, I'm on only fans, I'm going to get my this, I'm going to get my that.
9556620	9566540	Well, good luck to you. I hope it works out. The gold digging or the misogyny, it's of a piece.
9566540	9571420	People are listening to each other's strategic conversation and saying, why would I want that
9571420	9578060	for my life? I'll round out the sedation hypothesis. You have this large cohort, dispossessed young
9578060	9582460	men, high tea, high risk taking, they cause problems. There is a question to be asked,
9582460	9588060	although many of the almost all mass shooters, including the ones that hit all of the headlines,
9588060	9595020	were sexless young men. Given that we have the highest rates of sexlessness amongst young men
9595020	9599180	that we've seen in a very long time, there is a question, why have we not seen an in kind
9599180	9606220	increase in antisocial behavior? It's my belief that young men specifically are being sedated
9606220	9612700	out of their status seeking and risk taking and reproductive behavior through a combination of
9612700	9619340	social media, porn and video games. I was waiting for it. So there is an idea from Diana. Sorry,
9619340	9622940	social media, porn and video games does not include weed.
9622940	9628380	I think ubiquitous weed.
9631420	9632540	The motivation killer?
9637020	9641900	We don't have a ton of culture around open weed. We have a lot of culture around open alcohol,
9641900	9647260	about open coffee. We used to have culture around open nicotine. We don't have a lot of
9648460	9651100	culture around open weed. We have culture around closed weed,
9651740	9654860	served dishes weed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I do think that in part,
9655660	9660540	the video game thing is an absolute as if drug. What's that?
9662300	9667020	You meet people who come from the gaming community or social media and they have an idea
9667020	9674060	that life permits you to do certain things that are absolutely not tolerated in civil society.
9675020	9681900	Like a lot of the people, an interesting feature of social media is the difference between critics
9681900	9688300	and trolls who call you names and people who actually try to find a way to ruin your life offline.
9689660	9696140	Like there's a huge connection between the gaming community and certain sort of bulletin boards
9696780	9701340	and this freak game about how can we destroy people offline?
9702220	9711980	Yeah, yeah. And once you meet these people and you read their messages to each other,
9711980	9716460	they're talking about, oh, yeah, I've got a cool exploit where I'm going to invite somebody to
9716460	9720700	someone's house because I think that person might be dangerous. You realize it's a video game.
9722540	9728460	Yeah, so I had this idea specifically about Jordan, but it would apply to yourself. It would
9728540	9737020	apply to Joe. After a while, there is a particular threshold of exposure and notoriety that people
9737020	9745020	cross. And when they do, they are no longer treated like a human. It's easy online to dehumanize
9745020	9749820	because you don't see any there, there, you don't see that. But there's something specific about
9749820	9754460	crossing a particular threshold where you're no longer a person, you're a representation of ideas,
9754460	9761100	you're a conglomeration of viewpoints. And I think that really allows people to dehumanize
9761100	9765660	the other side. Really, there is no one reading these tweets. Well, you think Jordan Peterson's
9765660	9772380	reading these tweets about the incel God thing? Yeah. Is he? I don't know. I think he is. I think
9772380	9776860	Jordan spends, I would love Jordan spend less time on Twitter. Okay. I think that would be,
9776860	9783260	I think that that would be good. But even if they're not, there is a person there that is the
9783260	9790060	representation of the person. And I don't know, like saying something to somebody online that you
9790060	9796300	wouldn't say to their face, to me seems like a coward's way of communicating. Or you view it as an
9796300	9801500	adaptive landscape, which is new exploits have been created. I mean, if I explained to you a
9801500	9805820	mosquito life cycle, okay, you're going to find somebody with excess blood, and you're going to
9805820	9810140	steal some for yourself. That's my video guy who's been eaten alive since we've been in LA.
9810300	9815580	Is that right? Yeah. Okay. But you see the same cookie cutter sharks do the same thing for large
9816220	9823180	marine wildlife. They'll just take a plug of flesh out. It's like, can't afford to go after
9823180	9829180	cookie cutter sharks. When you have those kinds of strategies, am I going to sit around in the
9829180	9834540	ocean and say, no, that's not a legitimate strategy. You're a parasite. It's like, yeah.
9835420	9838940	Like that's my whole game where I'm a predator. I just murder things for a living.
9839900	9844780	It's really what predation is about. And in a certain sense, what you've done is you've changed
9844780	9852060	the adaptive landscape. And these are the new exploits. Yes. So to get back to the video games,
9852060	9857020	porn and social media, Diana Fleischman has this idea she calls uncanny volvers.
9858060	9863740	Tell me more. She says that porn has been able to hijack the mate seeking behavior specifically of
9863740	9872700	men by giving them a very titrated dose of what it is that they would usually get. Which means that
9876380	9881580	part of that motivation to go out and do the risk taking behavior has been tuned down.
9881580	9887020	But what do you get from video games? You get camaraderie. You get progressive overload in
9887020	9893500	terms of your achievements. You get a sense of belonging. You get a dopamine when you achieve
9893500	9896940	something. You may even get some serotonin because you feel like you're lumped together with your
9896940	9901500	group of friends. Okay. And then once you get on social media, with social media, we've gamified
9901500	9905500	the status hierarchy. It's there. There's a number right in front of you. And there are
9905500	9909100	levels that you can get to. There's your silver plaque on YouTube. There's your gold plaque.
9909100	9913500	There's your blue tick. Look who followed me today. Elon Musk followed me today.
9913500	9921500	Whatever. I got a retweet from Paul Graham. It has been able to, and I don't necessarily think
9921500	9926220	that this was by design. It could be by side effect. It has been able to specifically for men,
9926220	9934940	maybe also for women, give a titrated dose of most of the key drivers that got people out of the
9934940	9943100	house to go and do things. Scott Galloway trended earlier on for saying that unless you're asleep
9943100	9947660	as a young person, you shouldn't be in the house. And his point is life is for living.
9947660	9953980	There is lots for you to learn outside. Fuck off. Go out. Come on. And he got tons and tons of
9953980	9962540	pushback. And maybe he's wrong. But when I get advice, sometimes on Q&As, people will say,
9963100	9967980	young guys and girls will message and say, I'm 13. And I love your podcast. Like, what the
9968780	9973260	fuck? Fantastic. You are in a growth period that is unbelievable. And the people that you're
9973260	9977660	getting exposed to, I wish that I'd had access to at 13. What should I do if I want to improve
9977660	9982780	myself? What books should I read? What practices should I do? I don't mean to be patronizing,
9982780	9988300	but just go outside and live life. There is so much low hanging fruit from knowing what it's
9988300	9992220	like to have an argument with your friend and having to cycle home with a flat tire.
9992940	9998540	Just things. There is so many life experiences that I think you will gain massive amounts,
9999500	10005500	huge, huge amounts of benefit from over and above a 2D lesson. So me and my friend George
10005500	10010460	have this conception of a 2D lessons and 3D lessons. So a 2D lesson would be reading about
10010460	10015580	Warren Buffett's wealth through an autobiography or watching it. A 3D lesson would be hanging out
10015580	10021180	with Warren Buffett at his house for an afternoon. And no matter how immersive we try and make learning,
10021180	10025980	3D lessons are always going to win because you can't forget them. They're so visceral.
10025980	10029740	And in a world where most of our time and increasing proportion of our time is spent online,
10031100	10036540	the in-person 3D lessons become more and more and more powerful. So this is my conception of the
10036540	10049340	male sedation hypothesis. How do you judge our sperm counts and testosterone over time?
10050220	10053180	Yeah. So there's some evidence. Andrew Heumann shared some evidence that although
10053180	10056700	sperm counts are decreasing, penis length is increasing, which...
10057660	10063660	But that's not... If I recall correctly, and I hesitate to get into...
10063660	10065420	Get into your penis literature, Eric. Come on.
10066220	10071900	Well, there is some trade-off in various reproductive systems between
10072780	10078380	things that we would classically associate with masculinity. So for example, dung beetles have
10079020	10086540	weaponry on their head called antlers, giant hook, and their copulatory apparatus and their antler
10086540	10089980	is in inverse proportion. It's the gorilla and chimp thing again, right?
10090700	10095500	That one of them has lots of testicles and very little penis length and the other one has the
10095500	10100940	reverse. So you have a lot of these conserved systems where somehow reproduction says you
10100940	10105820	can have this many total resources, but you have to figure out how to budget between various things
10105820	10113820	that appear to be strongly masculine. So I think that declining testosterone is a big concern.
10114780	10121500	I would say that it certainly contributes to a generalized change in male behavior,
10121500	10129740	risk-taking. It is... Talk about, oh, and women that take birth control can impact the local
10129740	10134300	ecology of male testosterone by basically making it feel like they're around infertile women when
10134300	10138940	they're not, they're just artificially suppressed women. That impacts a man's testosterone level.
10138940	10144380	Men that are around weapons, if mean you walked past a table of guns, the testosterone would go up.
10144380	10147740	If we walked past, there's a chainsaw over there, so perhaps it's already high, I'm not sure.
10150940	10152540	Do I see how many volleys we can get?
10153980	10163180	Do football freestyle. The issues of sperm count, the issue of testosterone production,
10163180	10168700	I think contributes to this in a large way. What it is that's causing this, is it phthalates in
10168700	10173340	the water? Is it women peeing out their birth control and we've got estrogens in the water supply?
10174620	10179260	Is it the foods that we're eating? Is it seed oils? Is it the lack of time outside? Is it grounding?
10179260	10184940	Is it... There are a whole host of things that are contributing to this, but I started working
10184940	10189020	with a blood testing company, MaricHealth, about six months ago, and I had my bloodstone for the
10189020	10194300	first time. My testosterone was about 500, and I'm 35, and I was like, it should be higher than
10194300	10197900	that, so what should I do? They gave me some lifestyle interventions and some boron that
10197900	10201660	frees up free tea from sex hormone binding, globulin and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
10201660	10205820	No pharmaceutical interventions, but they gave me a ton of lifestyle ones. I had my bloodstone
10205820	10214620	a couple of weeks ago and it was 900. Over the last six months, there's been some minor but
10214620	10220300	noticeable changes to my demeanor, one of them being I'm more aggressive. Like my frustrations
10220300	10227020	come to the fore more. Love it. And so, I mean, I'm dying to ask, are you, first of all, are you
10227020	10235260	married? No, in a relationship. In a relationship. Do you find that women, heterosexual women,
10235260	10243100	respond to classical masculinity? I have to be very carefully as I ask, because they certainly
10243100	10248540	respond more than they're supposed to, according to modern rules of femininity. But my guess is
10248540	10256140	that it's greatly decreased from the market for masculinity in the 60s, let's say. So look,
10257420	10262060	again, inter and intersexual dynamics, something I've spent an awful lot of time
10262620	10265980	learning about. I'm writing a book at the moment with David Busse, evolutionary psychologist,
10266860	10279820	on this. In the early 2010s, after the success of 50 Shades of Grey, there was a proliferation
10279820	10288140	of dark romance novels. And they, there was a pushback from the feminism movement,
10288860	10295900	saying that the portrayals of men as dominant, masculine, bearded, big chested, in a loincloth
10295900	10302300	or a plaid shirt, wielding an axe, wasn't what women wanted. They wanted a softer, more like the
10302300	10307740	brawny guy or the Marlboro man. Correct. They wanted a softer version of this. So they started
10307740	10312860	putting more agreeable, more feminized men on the front cover of books. They didn't sell.
10313580	10317580	Right. But I wouldn't guess that either of those would be where modern women's heads would be at
10317580	10322460	now. In the space of 10 years. So I think that there's, there's, there's massively a difference
10322460	10326860	between stated and revealed preferences. Sure. Right. And also to, you know, to caveat that,
10326860	10330060	the thing that you may sexually fantasize about is not necessarily what you want to get into a
10330060	10336780	relationship with. Guys will say. Say more. That what you optimize for in a one night stand and
10336780	10339740	what you optimize for in a marriage partner aren't always necessarily the same thing.
10339740	10343980	I would think they would be wildly disparate. Correct. Which means that the front cover of
10343980	10348220	the romance novel is not necessarily the partner that you want long term. They're the one that
10348220	10355020	you want to fantasize about. Most of these stories are driven by sex rather than driven by love.
10356300	10360460	So I have this hypothesis and I wonder if you, you have names for all sorts of things that
10361020	10366460	before you give me, I just need to bunch this up. Your acronym, your ponchant for acronym acronyms.
10366460	10371500	Yeah. And a friend, Mary says meme first, explain later. And I think that
10371900	10378220	some of my favorite episodes, they rely on aphorisms. They rely on creating memes. Sure.
10378220	10382940	Small, quippy razors and so on and so forth. First off, because it makes it easy to remember.
10382940	10386860	But secondly, because that's what gets the hooks into you. This is how you make things.
10386860	10391020	So if you are somebody that's listening that has an idea that really loves that idea,
10391660	10395340	give it a name. Give it a name and give it a cool name. Yeah. I came up with fame
10395340	10400940	seesaw the other day, which is that on your way up, people want to support you because you remind
10400940	10404060	them of their dreams. When you're at the top, they tear you down because you remind them of
10404060	10409020	what they gave up on. Yeah. Fame seesaw. Beautiful. And even if it's fucking wrong,
10409020	10418620	you can't forget it. So it's good. Very nice. You were saying that when women, when heterosexual
10418620	10424300	women realize that they have several possible life cycles and they don't have a clear sense of which
10424300	10430140	one they will actually live. Am I going to get married and raise children and be at home with
10430140	10435980	the children? Am I going to get married and have one child, maybe two, and be a career person?
10435980	10440940	Am I never going to couple, but have children? Am I going to have no children whatsoever?
10440940	10443500	Am I going to do that in a coupled situation? Yeah. Yeah.
10445180	10449900	Their decision trees blow out as to what it is that they're actually looking for.
10450140	10459900	And one of my strong senses is that women encountered something they weren't expecting,
10460460	10464940	which is that they might even be smarter than the guy at work who they're competing with,
10465660	10472540	but he's happy to come in all of Saturday, all of Sunday, and work hours that are completely
10472540	10477660	psychotic. And so then the idea, well, we need work-life balance. We don't want people coming
10477660	10482140	in on Friday and Saturday because that's sort of an unfair advantage that somebody who wants a
10482140	10488700	healthy life is different from somebody who wants an extreme life. And so now you have this problem,
10488700	10493900	which is I'm attracted to the sort of man I wouldn't want to compete with at work.
10495260	10500060	If I'm going to be in the office, I want to know that I'm not going to have to deal with the guy
10500060	10504700	who's willing to give up every weekend and work hours that I'm unwilling to work because that's
10504700	10515980	not how I'm set at the factory versus I want that guy as the go-getter while I'm pregnant and
10515980	10522700	incapacitated and raising children to make sure that not only he can shepherd our family through
10522700	10527980	anything because he's highly capable, but can also get me back into the workforce when I'm done raising
10527980	10539020	children. And this is somewhat what I believe is responsible for the sort of incoherent messages
10539020	10543820	that men and women are sending to each other is that when we don't know what life cycle we are
10543820	10550780	going to be inhabiting, our eroticism and our romance and our desire is unstable.
10550860	10559340	One of the most uncomfortable correlations that I've found over the last few years is that as
10560300	10565420	gender inequality, pay inequality between the gender's increases, relationship satisfaction
10565420	10571260	for both men and women increases as well. Sorry, decreases. The more egalitarian,
10571260	10578380	the more equal the pay, the less satisfied both sexes are with relationships. Men who are in
10578380	10582060	relationships where the woman is the primary breadwinner are 50% more likely to use a rectile
10582060	10589260	dysfunction medication, where a woman is contributing more than 70% of the household
10589260	10596380	income, the marriage is twice as likely to end in divorce. Women for a man, sorry, for a
10598620	10603420	woman to move herself the same distance on a 10-point scale in terms of attractiveness
10603420	10610700	that a man can by increasing his income by $100,000, she would need a 10,000 times increase
10610700	10617020	in income. In short, women are interested socioeconomically in the status of their partner
10617020	10620780	in a way that men aren't. Now, the problem that you have is that women now have access
10620780	10624220	to education and employment in a way that they never have done before, so they're no longer
10624220	10629740	financially dependent on men. Sure, but you're seeing something which is particularly heartbreaking
10629820	10636700	in my group of females, which would be women in their mid to late 50s. I have to be honest,
10636700	10645340	I've seen some of the women I was most impressed by never coupling. When you talk to them,
10645340	10649980	there's some very uncomfortable things that get said, one of which was I was looking for a man
10649980	10657740	I could look up to and the pool was just so small. You're thinking, well, okay, it's illegal to say
10657740	10662940	I'm looking for a man that I could look up to because that's not in accordance with modern
10662940	10671020	feminism and egalitarianism. On the other hand, this idea that when you're one of the world's
10671020	10677980	leading chemists or something, there's just not that many men that are going to be in that position.
10677980	10682700	I got another meme for you. I got in a lot of trouble for this. It's called the tall girl
10682700	10687180	problem. If you stand atop your own status hierarchy, it's very difficult to find somebody
10687180	10691020	else across and above from yours. If you're a six foot one girl without heels, you're looking
10691020	10696540	at professional athletes and two women for every one man completing a four year US college degree
10696540	10702700	by 2030. Between the ages of 21 and 29, women earn 1,111 pounds more on average than their male
10702700	10707980	counterparts. But women still have this vestigial attraction to the man who is across and above
10707980	10713740	from them. That's hypergamy. This means that as you rise up through your own dominance hierarchy,
10713740	10718860	it amounts to a opportunity of diminishing returns. Then why are we not allowed to build
10718860	10728700	better men? This is this thing that just floors me. I'm now, through being a father, looking at
10731020	10739660	the subset of young men who are absolutely looking to crush it. The advice they're being given is
10739740	10749980	so horrific. What like? Well, that doesn't seem mentally healthy. I think it's much better for
10749980	10756780	you to enjoy this time with everyone else. It's just like watering down raw ambition.
10757660	10767740	Is it ludicrous who said, get out of the way? Get out of the way of these people.
10768460	10775180	These people want to invest and blow your socks off and just do amazing things. There's some
10775180	10782300	administrator or nanny or nurse ratchet who's like, well, that would be arrogant. We can't have that.
10783260	10791020	You're saying, I don't think you understand it, but ambition is a necessary input for certain
10791020	10796060	humans. If you sit there and say, why do you have a right to innovate when nobody else has
10796060	10804140	innovated? Don't you realize that your go-getter personality during the COVID situation was based
10804140	10809340	on your privilege? In fact, a lot of other people are suffering from mental health. You're just
10809340	10816300	thinking, why am I taking the most promising people and tying them to the most damaged people?
10816300	10822620	Why not instead take the most promising people and have them get a PhD by the age of 2021
10822620	10826460	and study what to do for their fellow souls who are struggling?
10827660	10831500	Do you remember when Elon took over Twitter and he started to rip out the tech team?
10833180	10837740	He said, I want to make Twitter a place where the people who want to work the hardest on the
10837740	10845740	biggest problems can come and work. People said, they looked at that and said, this is going back
10845740	10850460	to an archaic form of Silicon Valley where people are forced to sleep under desks and it's a blah,
10852620	10858140	those people do not have theory of mind to understand what it's like to be someone as driven
10859020	10863900	as it takes to look at that from Elon, not as modern-day slavery.
10864860	10869500	No, he was saying, it can be modern-day slavery or it could be the person saying,
10869500	10874220	for God's sakes, I'm burning to solve this problem. Let me go. Let me sleep under my desk.
10876220	10881100	Unhook the leash and let me go at this. There is a cohort of people out there for whom
10881100	10883900	that's their calling. They didn't want to work at Twitter if they got
10884860	10889580	frappuccinos and mindful Monday afternoons off and to be able to play ping-pong for half the
10889980	10895340	whatever it was that was going on. They want to go and they want to feel like they're contributing
10895340	10903180	to an astronomically-sized goal, an unreasonable goal, and they want to feel the rush of going
10903180	10911580	toward it. I think you're right. I think that there is a dampening of ambition. Since being in
10911580	10917740	America, since moving to America 18 months ago, the fuel that I've had from the enthusiasm from
10917740	10923580	the people I've been around has fueled me and powered me in a way that I wasn't, it was alien.
10923580	10932700	I was 33 years old and I'd never felt it before. There's so much to do and it requires ambitious
10932700	10938780	people. Those people have to be both arrogant and humble. It's a complicated thing. It involves
10938780	10947900	mentorship. I want to say also something about elitism. Elitism is incredibly unfair.
10950380	10955500	I've hung out with Stanley Jordan and I am never going to play any instrument the way
10955500	10962140	Stanley Jordan plays the guitar. He's an elite object. I am not going to be that guy. You have
10962140	10968780	to learn how to let elite people do elite things where you can't compete with them.
10971100	10976700	I don't know what to do about this. The idea that we're turning against the concept of elite,
10976700	10981500	because we've got this pretend elite that sits in these chairs that screws everything up,
10982540	10988940	and you've got all of these ambitious people who are being destroyed by enforced helplessness.
10989820	10997180	How do we fire the administrators necessary to return universities to being universities?
10998620	11009100	How do we explain that some people are built to fly wingsuits? It's a super dangerous activity,
11010460	11017980	but somebody needs that rush or they're not alive. People need danger. They need risk.
11017980	11024540	They need to be able to create. They don't need you in their way all the time. I have this very
11024540	11032220	strong sense that school has become the most dangerous place that we're pushing so many
11032220	11042620	people through school. School is basically destroying vitality. By the time you get
11042620	11048220	through this education that is so laden with administrators and people telling you things
11048220	11056380	that are wrong, I don't know how to say this, but when a friend of mine gets a call as a
11056380	11062460	chaired professor in a technical discipline from a dean who says, we have a little bit of a problem
11062460	11067740	with some of your current tweets. What did I say? It's not what you said, but it's that you liked
11067740	11074700	somebody else's tweets and you're thinking, I don't care who you are. You'd never talk to a
11074700	11081420	professor like that. You cannot have these people. We need the University of Chicago
11081420	11088140	to spread its middle finger across the country and get rid of these people.
11088940	11097900	You can't talk to them. They're a plague from hell on thought.
11100620	11110300	You can't tax all thought by making it nice. Something I really don't know how to communicate,
11110300	11113900	but I saw you got Sam Harris a certain amount of trouble, so maybe I'll buy a little bit of
11113900	11124060	trouble for myself. You can't have terrible ideas circulating everywhere,
11125180	11131500	leading to pogroms and riots and killings. I was just in Istanbul, maybe my favorite
11131500	11139260	city on earth, and I was reminded of the Turkish Kristallnacht that happened in the Beolu
11140220	11145820	Karakoy area of Istanbul where there was a rumor about the desecration, I think,
11145820	11152060	of the birthplace of Adatürk. People died as a result, and ethnic minorities could not be
11152060	11159740	protected. You cannot allow free speech to circulate every dumb idea infinitely until
11159740	11168140	people are killed in pogroms or holocausts or whatever. You've got two options. You either
11168620	11174780	constrain speech by rules or by culture. This is the reason that I was so against
11174780	11182940	Myloyanopoulos. You want a culture in which everyone is allowed to burn the flag and it
11182940	11188380	doesn't even occur to you that that's something you would want to do. That's culture. You've
11188380	11196460	got to load the inhibiting factor on culture. People say, well, that's what cancellation is
11196460	11201340	about. It's like, well, but if you misuse the concept of shunning, let's call it by something
11201340	11208700	older than cancellation. If you shun people for good questions, if you shun people for
11209580	11214860	speaking truthfully and decently as if they had done something horrible, then you lose the ability
11214860	11220940	to control bad behavior through social norms. One of the things that I've now come to understand is
11221580	11228860	we are either going to restore a culture which shuns only when shunning is really the correct
11228860	11234140	course of action, or we are going to have rules that prohibit what you can and cannot say. I am
11234140	11239660	absolute in that we should not have rules. We've got to put this on culture and we've got to get
11239660	11245180	a culture in which, in general, you are very careful about the negative things that you say.
11245900	11251580	One of the things that Milo did that I really disliked was he said, well,
11252380	11257100	the purpose of free speech is to protect outrageous speech. The answer is not really.
11258460	11263260	Yes, if I'm forced to stand up for your right to say horrible things, I can do that if the
11263260	11267820	culture generally retards horrible things. If the culture now starts to encourage it,
11267980	11276780	we can't have terrible ideas being the precursor of communal violence, let's say.
11278780	11283820	We really shouldn't be having rules determine what we can and can't say. It should be that
11283820	11289020	when somebody starts to say something that is the beginning of an incitement to madness,
11289900	11295500	that the cultural prohibition against that is very strong. In my recent travels,
11295500	11301740	I've been shocked. I've been in Bombay, I've been in Istanbul, I've been in Lisbon, Porto,
11303500	11309660	in the islands of the Azores. None of these cities has fallen as far as San Francisco.
11311500	11319820	Bombay is madness, but we don't have a homelessness problem in San Francisco. We have a zombie
11319820	11326540	apocalypse problem. We have a dysfunctional government problem. When you can't say we
11326540	11333020	cannot have this in Union Square, we just can't. We cannot have a zombie apocalypse in Union Square.
11333020	11338540	When that becomes controversial in and of itself, you've lost the plot. And partially,
11338540	11344540	what's happened is that we've given up on high trust societies where we more or less share
11344540	11351900	each other's values. That's the concept of the loyal opposition. We both know what the goal is.
11351900	11355740	You have an idea of how to get there. I have a different idea. I agree that we're going to have
11355740	11360140	a contest and one of us will win and one of us will begrudgingly go along with the other person's
11360140	11367580	idea. When your idea about what a just society is, well, let's vindictively punish successful
11367580	11371580	people. Let's pretend that male and female have no difference or all the difference according to
11371580	11378860	some set of rules on alternate Tuesdays. Let's decide that we can redefine what a recession is
11378860	11384460	or the consumer price index. Let's decide that we don't need masks. Yes, we do. No, we don't. Yes,
11384460	11392780	we do because of the science, science, science. Can somebody get rid of these people? We need
11392780	11403660	to be in a society that makes some semblance of sense. We cannot go in these opposite directions.
11403660	11409260	As far as I'm concerned, when you say, we don't want no more police, you and I cannot be the
11409260	11418220	loyal opposition to each other. You're not the kind of a person I even understand. Somehow,
11418220	11423820	that idea got into your head and it made sense to you. It's now carrying the day.
11426780	11433740	I have always supported some amount of reasonable gun control. I changed on a dime with that
11434380	11437660	abolish the police. We don't want no more police to fund the police.
11439340	11444140	Are you telling me that people are not going to be allowed to own a weapon and you're going to get
11444140	11448620	rid of the thing that was supposed to centralize the violence on behalf of the state and make it
11448620	11454140	follow rules? There's no coming back from that. I think that one of the things that we just have
11454140	11459420	to learn is that many of the voices that we've been listening to because they got jobs in our
11459420	11465180	organs, whether it was the New Yorker or the Washington Post or a professorship at Duke,
11466060	11471260	we have to stop listening to these people wholesale. We have to stop being tolerant
11471260	11477820	of the intolerant. If you come from a position that is sufficiently extreme and your whole point
11477820	11484540	is to try to use and weaponize democracy, to weaponize free speech, to weaponize good faith,
11484540	11492540	to weaponize what it means to hold a debate, you need to not really have a voice at the table
11493180	11499980	because we don't have a solution. If you say that I am entitled to sit at this table as a
11499980	11504620	member of the suicide bombing community strapped with a vest filled with high explosives,
11505420	11510220	the presence of C4 in your vest invalidates you being at that table that's trying to come up
11510220	11515500	with a solution. If you say fundamentally, I don't believe that we should be having children
11515500	11521180	because humans are evil and we need to bring this all to a close, it's very important that you not
11521180	11530940	be on the city council because that city is a generational endowment and you hand it to the
11530940	11536620	next generation and eventually you don't live there anymore. We are somehow seating people who
11536620	11543980	are so nihilistic and so freakishly divorced from anything that we should be able to assume as a
11543980	11551820	default. Certain positions that probably had 10 adherents appear to have millions of adherents
11552540	11560220	and if we don't get rid of these self-extinguishing theories, we are going to self-extinguish,
11560220	11567980	so I believe that civil society has an obligation to stop listening to positions that are avowedly
11568060	11574380	self-extinguishing. Eric Weinstein, ladies and gentlemen, Eric, I really appreciate you.
11574380	11579580	What's next? What can people expect from you? Have you got anything interesting coming up?
11581500	11588860	More than anything, remember that the whole point is when you see a person with a shirt that says
11588860	11594780	there is no planet B, look at the night sky and remember that the only way to get to planet B
11594780	11599820	is to change what we understand about physics and so look for me on that front.
11600620	11601820	Thank you. Cheers, mate.
11601820	11602700	Thanks. Be well.
11603500	11607180	Thank you very much for tuning in. If you enjoyed that episode with Eric,
11607180	11615660	you will love this one with Jordan Peterson. Go on. Press it.
