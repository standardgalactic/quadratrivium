00:00.000 --> 00:10.040
Tessellations of the plane offer an interesting approach to create visually appealing structures

00:10.040 --> 00:12.760
from simple geometric shapes.

00:12.760 --> 00:17.200
One way to create such a tessellation is by repeatedly rotating and translating a single

00:17.200 --> 00:21.000
polygon, resulting in a space-filling tiling.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.240
Such structures are widely used as purely visual patterns in ornamentation, but what

00:25.240 --> 00:30.000
happens if we fabricate structural elements from these tilings?

00:30.000 --> 00:34.480
By using the shape boundaries as the template for a structure, we create networks of rods

00:34.480 --> 00:37.280
with intriguing mechanical properties.

00:37.280 --> 00:42.360
How these structures stretch and bend is highly dependent on their geometry, creating a synergy

00:42.360 --> 00:44.440
of appearance and function.

00:44.440 --> 00:50.640
However, the mechanical properties of these structures are hard to predict.

00:50.640 --> 00:55.680
We present a method to characterize the mechanical behavior of structured sheet materials, allowing

00:55.680 --> 01:00.680
us to capture the macroscopic deformation behavior under stretching and bending.

01:00.680 --> 01:05.740
With our approach, users can explore structures and find or create materials with desired

01:05.740 --> 01:09.120
macromechanical properties.

01:09.120 --> 01:13.600
To characterize the mechanical behavior of the tiling on the macroscopic level, we start

01:13.600 --> 01:18.120
by considering a small periodic patch of the tiling.

01:18.120 --> 01:22.880
On this native resolution, we compute a series of test deformations that fully describe the

01:22.880 --> 01:27.320
behavior of the material.

01:27.320 --> 01:32.540
Based on this data, we then fit a thin plate model that averages away the small-scale deformation

01:32.540 --> 01:37.120
behavior while keeping the large-scale behavior of the structure.

01:37.120 --> 01:42.200
We can then use this model to show the mechanical properties of the material, the Young's modulus,

01:42.200 --> 01:45.200
Poisson's ratio, and Bendig stiffness.

01:45.200 --> 01:49.880
The direction-dependent nature of these properties is captured by radial plots, making it possible

01:49.880 --> 01:56.800
to visualize anisotropic materials.

01:56.800 --> 02:01.000
Our method allows us to efficiently characterize a large number of structures.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.020
To demonstrate this, we applied our characterization to a collection of isohedral tilings, periodic

02:06.020 --> 02:11.220
tilings built from a single polygonal shape.

02:11.220 --> 02:15.560
We can then explore the space of mechanical properties that these structures cover, look

02:15.560 --> 02:21.360
at the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Bendig behavior of individual structures,

02:21.360 --> 02:25.620
and investigate the material properties of different structure families.

02:25.620 --> 02:30.980
Ultimately, it allows us to find and fabricate structures with desired material properties.

03:11.220 --> 03:25.820
We can also apply our characterization method in an inverse design approach, directly looking

03:25.820 --> 03:28.740
for a structure that fits the target behavior.

03:28.740 --> 03:33.300
In this example, we start from an initial structure and use a simple gradient descent

03:33.300 --> 03:38.420
approach to find a nearby structure that has isotropic material behavior.

03:38.980 --> 03:45.260
Similarly, we can use optimization to search for specific anisotropic material properties.

03:45.260 --> 03:49.540
By using multiple starting points, we find materials with different structures but a

03:49.540 --> 04:07.420
similar mechanical behavior.

04:07.420 --> 04:08.420
Thank you for your attention.
