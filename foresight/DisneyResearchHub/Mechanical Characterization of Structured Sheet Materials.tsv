0	10040	Tessellations of the plane offer an interesting approach to create visually appealing structures
10040	12760	from simple geometric shapes.
12760	17200	One way to create such a tessellation is by repeatedly rotating and translating a single
17200	21000	polygon, resulting in a space-filling tiling.
21000	25240	Such structures are widely used as purely visual patterns in ornamentation, but what
25240	30000	happens if we fabricate structural elements from these tilings?
30000	34480	By using the shape boundaries as the template for a structure, we create networks of rods
34480	37280	with intriguing mechanical properties.
37280	42360	How these structures stretch and bend is highly dependent on their geometry, creating a synergy
42360	44440	of appearance and function.
44440	50640	However, the mechanical properties of these structures are hard to predict.
50640	55680	We present a method to characterize the mechanical behavior of structured sheet materials, allowing
55680	60680	us to capture the macroscopic deformation behavior under stretching and bending.
60680	65740	With our approach, users can explore structures and find or create materials with desired
65740	69120	macromechanical properties.
69120	73600	To characterize the mechanical behavior of the tiling on the macroscopic level, we start
73600	78120	by considering a small periodic patch of the tiling.
78120	82880	On this native resolution, we compute a series of test deformations that fully describe the
82880	87320	behavior of the material.
87320	92540	Based on this data, we then fit a thin plate model that averages away the small-scale deformation
92540	97120	behavior while keeping the large-scale behavior of the structure.
97120	102200	We can then use this model to show the mechanical properties of the material, the Young's modulus,
102200	105200	Poisson's ratio, and Bendig stiffness.
105200	109880	The direction-dependent nature of these properties is captured by radial plots, making it possible
109880	116800	to visualize anisotropic materials.
116800	121000	Our method allows us to efficiently characterize a large number of structures.
121000	126020	To demonstrate this, we applied our characterization to a collection of isohedral tilings, periodic
126020	131220	tilings built from a single polygonal shape.
131220	135560	We can then explore the space of mechanical properties that these structures cover, look
135560	141360	at the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Bendig behavior of individual structures,
141360	145620	and investigate the material properties of different structure families.
145620	150980	Ultimately, it allows us to find and fabricate structures with desired material properties.
191220	205820	We can also apply our characterization method in an inverse design approach, directly looking
205820	208740	for a structure that fits the target behavior.
208740	213300	In this example, we start from an initial structure and use a simple gradient descent
213300	218420	approach to find a nearby structure that has isotropic material behavior.
218980	225260	Similarly, we can use optimization to search for specific anisotropic material properties.
225260	229540	By using multiple starting points, we find materials with different structures but a
229540	247420	similar mechanical behavior.
247420	248420	Thank you for your attention.
