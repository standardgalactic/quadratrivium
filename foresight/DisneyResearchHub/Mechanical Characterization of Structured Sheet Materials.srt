00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
Tessellations of the plane offer an interesting approach to create visually appealing structures

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,760
from simple geometric shapes.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,200
One way to create such a tessellation is by repeatedly rotating and translating a single

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,000
polygon, resulting in a space-filling tiling.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,240
Such structures are widely used as purely visual patterns in ornamentation, but what

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,000
happens if we fabricate structural elements from these tilings?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
By using the shape boundaries as the template for a structure, we create networks of rods

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,280
with intriguing mechanical properties.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,360
How these structures stretch and bend is highly dependent on their geometry, creating a synergy

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,440
of appearance and function.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,640
However, the mechanical properties of these structures are hard to predict.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,680
We present a method to characterize the mechanical behavior of structured sheet materials, allowing

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,680
us to capture the macroscopic deformation behavior under stretching and bending.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,740
With our approach, users can explore structures and find or create materials with desired

15
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,120
macromechanical properties.

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,600
To characterize the mechanical behavior of the tiling on the macroscopic level, we start

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,120
by considering a small periodic patch of the tiling.

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,880
On this native resolution, we compute a series of test deformations that fully describe the

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,320
behavior of the material.

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,540
Based on this data, we then fit a thin plate model that averages away the small-scale deformation

21
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,120
behavior while keeping the large-scale behavior of the structure.

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,200
We can then use this model to show the mechanical properties of the material, the Young's modulus,

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Poisson's ratio, and Bendig stiffness.

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,880
The direction-dependent nature of these properties is captured by radial plots, making it possible

25
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,800
to visualize anisotropic materials.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,000
Our method allows us to efficiently characterize a large number of structures.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,020
To demonstrate this, we applied our characterization to a collection of isohedral tilings, periodic

28
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,220
tilings built from a single polygonal shape.

29
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,560
We can then explore the space of mechanical properties that these structures cover, look

30
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,360
at the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Bendig behavior of individual structures,

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,620
and investigate the material properties of different structure families.

32
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,980
Ultimately, it allows us to find and fabricate structures with desired material properties.

33
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:25,820
We can also apply our characterization method in an inverse design approach, directly looking

34
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,740
for a structure that fits the target behavior.

35
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,300
In this example, we start from an initial structure and use a simple gradient descent

36
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,420
approach to find a nearby structure that has isotropic material behavior.

37
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:45,260
Similarly, we can use optimization to search for specific anisotropic material properties.

38
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,540
By using multiple starting points, we find materials with different structures but a

39
00:03:49,540 --> 00:04:07,420
similar mechanical behavior.

40
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,420
Thank you for your attention.
