0	6500	It's hard to believe that all your photos, videos, music, messages, and apps can be stored
6500	8600	in the palm of your hand.
8600	15080	And to most of us, it's a mystery how so much information can fit in such a small space.
15080	21000	But it might not seem so surprising when you see the complexity inside your smartphone
21000	28320	or the inside of this one terabyte solid-state drive commonly found in laptops or computers.
28520	35320	However, as seeing the outside of this memory storage microchip tells us little about how
35320	42160	these smartphones and solid-state drives can store tens of thousands of photos and files,
42160	47840	let's explore deeper and zoom in until we get to a nanoscopic view.
47840	53600	And it's here that we can see the structures called VINAND that hold all the data in your
53600	55600	smartphone and computer.
55600	58160	Here's where the real magic happens.
58160	65360	Every picture, message, and bit of information gets saved as quantities of electrons inside
65360	70400	these memory cells which are called charge-trapped flash.
70400	76400	And in this episode, we'll learn how smartphone memory and solid-state drives work.
76400	78440	Now, hold on.
78440	83800	These insanely small and intricate structures seem very complex.
83800	85360	And yeah, they are.
85360	89240	I'm not going to say this marvel of engineering is simple.
89240	91200	But you have to trust me.
91200	96480	Stick around, watch closely, maybe watch this video twice.
96480	101240	And by the end of it, this technology will amaze you.
101240	104320	It'll blow your mind at least twice over.
104320	110560	And yeah, you'll have a thorough understanding as to how such a small device can store weeks
110560	118040	of high-quality video, tens of thousands of pictures, or hundreds of thousands of songs
118040	121800	in such an itty-bitty little space.
121800	125520	So let's get started.
125520	130340	We're going to use a real-life example and explore how it works when you save a picture
130340	132800	to your smartphone or computer.
132800	136720	First, this picture is made up of pixels.
136720	138960	And each pixel has a color.
138960	143400	So let's zoom in so that we can see the individual pixels.
143400	151840	The color of every pixel is defined by a combination of three numbers, ranging from 0 to 255,
151840	155720	each representing red, green, or blue.
155720	164800	For example, the numbers would be 55, 53, 55 for this pixel's color right here.
164800	173200	And then 124, 121, and 119 for this pixel.
173200	182520	Each of these three numbers, from 0 to 255, is represented by 8 bits in binary, or 8 ones
182520	186960	and zeros, you know, because computers work in binary.
186960	196800	So three colors, red, green, and blue, and 8 bits each, means each pixel takes 24 bits
196800	198760	to define its color.
198760	201740	This picture is a grid of colored pixels.
201740	208400	So let's turn it into a grid of values, kind of like a spreadsheet in Excel, but called
208400	212280	an array instead of a spreadsheet.
212280	219000	This array of bits is what your computer cares about, and non-coincidentally, it's also the
219000	223940	information that the camera on my smartphone recorded when I took the picture.
223940	229880	One quick note, if you want to see the pixels in any picture, just open it in an image editing
229880	235520	program like paint, or 3D paint in this case, and zoom in.
235520	242840	And then if you want to see the red, green, and blue, or RGB values, just use the eyedropper,
242840	247440	click on a pixel, and then click on the edit color option.
247440	253640	Right here, you can see the three values for red, green, and blue, and the resulting color.
253640	257640	Okay, with that covered, let's get back to the episode.
257640	264920	First, we're going to zoom out to see the full picture, which is 3,024 pixels wide,
264920	274680	and 4,032 pixels tall, which is a total of around 12 million pixels, or 12 megapixels,
274680	279880	which relates to the resolution of the 12 megapixel camera on my smartphone.
279880	287220	Next, by doing some multiplication, we calculate that an array of this size where each pixel
287220	298020	is defined by 24 bits, or 24 zeros or ones, only requires 293 million bits, or a unique
298020	303340	set of 293 million zeros or ones.
303340	305460	That's a ton of bits.
305460	312100	So let's figure out how your smartphone, or the solid state drive, seamlessly stores
312100	314660	every single one of them.
315380	323020	Okay, so let's open up that solid state drive again, and zoom into a simplified nanoscopic
323020	326580	view, kind of like the one we had earlier.
326580	330700	It's here that we can see the memory cells that are used in every single one of your
330700	337460	smartphones or tablets, as well as inside the solid state drive in your computer.
337460	343460	This is the basic unit of a computer's long-term memory storage, and it's called charge-trapped
343460	344820	flash memory.
344820	346980	So, how does it work?
346980	353460	Well, in each cell, we can store information by placing different levels of electrons onto
353460	358100	a charge trap, which is the key component inside the memory cell.
358100	364460	Older technology could only store two different levels of electrons, a lot of electrons or
364460	370900	very few electrons, which were used to store a single bit as a one or zero.
370900	376340	However, engineers have been developing more finely tuned capabilities for trapping and
376340	381780	measuring different amounts of electrons or charges onto the charge trap.
381780	388540	Most memory cells in 2020 can hold eight different levels, but newer technology can have sixteen
388540	391820	different levels of electrons.
391820	397260	This means that a single cell, instead of holding only one bit as a lot of electrons
397260	401540	or no electrons, can now hold three or more bits.
401540	404660	For this example, we're going to stick with three bits.
404660	412820	So in this cell, if we were to have very few electrons on it, it would be one, one, one.
412820	420740	While some electrons get designated as one, zero, zero, and a lot of electrons are zero,
420740	422500	zero, zero.
422500	427900	There are eight different levels for all the various amounts of electron charges that our
427900	431140	charge trap can be set or written to.
431140	436940	The key to the charge trap is that it is specially designed so that after it gets charged with
436940	443500	electrons, it can hold onto those electrons for decades, which is how information is saved
443500	446180	or written to the solid state drive.
446180	449260	I mean, it's called a charge trap for a reason.
449260	456060	It traps electrons or charges for years on end, and in order to read the information,
456060	461540	the electron charge level is measured, and the amount of charge on the charge trap is
461540	462540	unchanged.
462540	468300	However, in order to erase the contents of a memory cell, all the electron charges are
468300	474740	forcibly removed from the charge trap, returning it to its lowest level, which is one, one,
474740	479740	one, and leaving no excess electron charges behind.
479740	485140	Let's move on and explore how these memory cells are organized so that we can store more
485140	487820	than three bits of information.
487820	492820	After we zoom out a little, you can see that the memory cells are stacked vertically.
492820	498260	This is where the vertical part in vertical NAND or VNAND comes from.
498260	504660	This stack of memory cells, which is technically called a string, is composed of ten charge
504660	508300	trap flash cells layered one on top of another.
508300	514340	When information is written to or read from a string, only one cell can be activated at
514340	520940	any given time, and to do that, we use separate control gates attached to every layer in the
520940	521940	string.
521940	523140	It works like this.
523140	529580	The bottom control gate first says, hey you, charge trap one, what's your electron charge
529580	530940	level at?
530940	535780	Then the bottom cell sends that information through the center of the string up to the
535780	540680	information highway at the top, which is technically called a bit line.
540680	545420	Then the next control gate for the second layer asks for the charge level in the second
545420	552300	cell and so on up the string, each cell sending their information up to the highway or bit
552300	553300	line.
553300	558420	The same kind of sequence happens when charges are being added to a charge trap, which is
558420	561260	how information is written to a memory cell.
561260	566980	The main thing is that only one layer in the string is either written to or read from at
566980	568780	any given time.
568780	570860	Let's move on in complexity.
570860	578580	Next, we duplicate this string 32 times, and this gets us a page of strings.
578580	580820	Let's review some terminology.
580820	584700	This is a memory cell, and this is a string.
584700	591740	And now here we have a page, and we're going to call this entire page of strings a row.
591740	597580	When we duplicate the string, we also duplicate the bit line 32 times.
597580	603580	However, rather than duplicate the control gates, we're going to have every cell in
603580	606900	the same page share a common control gate.
606900	613580	This makes it so that when information is written to or read from a row, an entire page
613580	621180	composed of 32 adjacent cells, all in the same layer, are activated at the same time.
621180	623980	Let's step up in complexity again.
623980	630860	Next, we duplicate these rows 6 times until we get a block, but we're going to do it
630860	633820	12 times so we can see 2 blocks.
633820	640660	Okay, so again, here we have a column, here is a row, and this is a layer.
640660	644980	And now here's a cell, and here's a string.
644980	648860	Next we have a page, and finally we have a block.
648860	654100	We're going to connect the tops of each string in a column together, so they all share the
654100	659140	same bit line, and our bit line is looking like a highway now.
659140	664860	In addition, we have to add a control gate that selects between rows so that only one
664860	667900	row is using the bit line at a time.
667900	670660	These are called bit line selectors.
670660	676940	As discussed, these bit lines are like highways, and the selectors at the top act as traffic
676940	682860	lights that mediate the flow of information so that only a single row can use the highway
682860	685100	or is active at a time.
685100	691580	Similarly, the control gates attached to each layer act as traffic lights for the layers.
691580	696620	With bit line selectors along the tops of each row and control gate selectors along
696620	703100	each layer, the solid state drive can read from or write to a single page at any given
703100	704100	time.
704100	709540	Additionally, in order to connect to the bit line selectors and control gate selectors,
709540	715780	there are wires that drop down from above and run perpendicular to the bit lines.
715780	718300	So let's quickly recap.
718300	723580	Eight different levels of electrons are placed on charge traps in order to store three bits
723580	725100	of information.
725100	732700	These charge trap flash memory cells are stacked into strings, ten cells tall, which are duplicated
732700	736140	into pages of 32 strings in a row.
736140	742980	Next, those pages of strings are duplicated until we have a block six rows deep.
742980	745820	And here we're showing two blocks.
745820	753420	Doing some quick multiplication, we find that there are 3,840 memory cells here capable
753420	758620	of storing a total of 11,520 bits.
758620	765580	With each pixel in our picture requiring 24 bits, that means that we can store 480
766340	769460	pixels, or this much of our overall picture.
769460	776380	That means you need about 25,000 times the size of this layout to store the contents
776380	778540	of this single picture.
778540	782660	And here's where we learn about the actual size of a memory chip.
782660	787540	All the principles we've discussed remain the same, so keep those in mind.
787540	793060	It's just that the size is much more extensive than we discussed in our example.
793060	798500	It's hard to pin down exact numbers because manufacturers are continually improving their
798500	804100	designs and they're very secretive regarding what their designs look like.
804100	805940	But I'll tell you what I know.
805940	812620	The latest designs utilize not ten layers as in the example, but rather somewhere around
812620	817220	96 to 136 layers tall.
817220	821620	Here's a single sheet of paper so you can get a sense of the approximate height of
821620	824100	these stacks of memory cells.
824100	828300	Now that we understand the height, let's think about the width.
828300	834500	A page is around 30,000 to 60,000 adjacent memory cells wide.
834500	840820	That means there are 30,000 to 60,000 bitlines in our information superhighway.
840820	847380	Blocks are every 4 to 8 rows and there are around 4,000 to 6,000 blocks.
847380	853580	Along the edges are the control gate selectors and the bitline selectors on the other side.
853580	857740	Together they comprise what is called a row decoder.
857740	864140	And by using both sets of selectors as traffic lights, we're able to access a single page.
864140	872460	To repeat this, only one page, 45,000 or so cells wide, ever uses the bitline to read
872460	876180	or write information at any given time.
876180	882020	All tens of thousands of bitlines feed down here to the page buffer where the information
882020	885940	of a single page is read to or written from.
885940	890740	Let's transition to see what an overall chip might look like.
890740	896900	Here we have the arrays of 3D memory cells, the row decoder and the page buffer at the
896900	897900	bottom.
897900	902860	Additional peripheral circuitry can be found here for supporting the chip.
902860	908820	In order to fit more capacity, engineers copied this layout onto the other side.
908820	915500	This chip can read or write at a rate of around 500 megabytes per second.
915500	923940	That means that it can read from or write to around 63 blocks every single second.
923940	926460	That's incredibly fast.
926460	931220	Okay, let's add the last level of complexity.
931220	935940	Engineers like to fit even more stuff in as small a space as possible.
935940	941820	So on top of having a massive array of memory cells in this insanely complex layout, they
941820	948380	decided to copy this chip eight times and stack it into a single microchip.
948380	954060	At the bottom, an additional interface chip is used to coordinate between the eight different
954060	955300	chips.
955300	956580	And that's it.
956580	962020	That's all there is in this one microchip that can be found at the center of every one
962020	967660	of your smart phones, tablets or solid state drives.
967660	972100	This video covered a lot and I hope you kept up.
972100	975580	You can always watch this video a second time.
975580	980620	And if you do watch it a second time, we added our notes and commentary into the English
