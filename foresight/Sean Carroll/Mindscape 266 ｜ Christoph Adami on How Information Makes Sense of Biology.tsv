0	4000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.
4000	9000	Long time listeners will know that I've long been a fan of Las Vegas.
9000	14000	I like to go to Vegas, play poker, eat, shop, whatever, just relax and have a good time.
14000	18000	Haven't been able to do it quite as much. Now that we're on the East Coast, that's okay.
18000	23000	There's always pluses and minuses. Now we can go to New York. It's like the Las Vegas of the East.
23000	28000	But anyway, one of the reasons why I like Las Vegas is in addition to the stereotypes.
28000	35000	So the stereotypes are absolutely there, right? There are long rows of slot machines
35000	40000	with dull-eyed people mindlessly pressing buttons hoping to get rich someday.
40000	46000	It's kind of depressing, that part. But there's a lot of weird stuff in Vegas if you look closely enough.
46000	53000	So by Vegas standards, one of the weird things that I really like is there's an outpost of Bowman Rare Books.
53000	57000	This is a well-known rare book store with headquarters in New York.
57000	64000	But they have a Vegas store in the Palazzo Hotel Casino, where I used to stay sometimes.
64000	68000	And it's just weird. Among all the glitz and glamour, here's rare books.
68000	73000	And they actually have a lot of first editions of things, but also some weird sciency books.
73000	76000	They have a signed Albert Einstein, for example.
76000	83000	And I was very amused to see in Bowman's Rare Books in Vegas a copy of Claude Shannon's Master's Thesis.
83000	88000	Claude Shannon, famous 20th century scientist for many reasons.
88000	94000	And his Master's thesis, I didn't actually know this before I saw it in the bookstore, is very famous.
94000	101000	It's been called by Howard Gardner the most influential Master's thesis of all 20th century science.
101000	105000	This is a Master's thesis that has its own Wikipedia page, okay?
105000	114000	And it's about basically using Boolean analysis to model and improve the efficiency of circuits and things like that.
114000	117000	Pretty awesome for a Master's thesis kind of thing.
117000	125000	But for my purposes today, I'm just using this as a somewhat strained segue into, of course, Claude Shannon's big contribution,
125000	131000	even bigger than the Master's thesis came 10 years after when he essentially invented information theory.
131000	135000	He wrote a paper called The Mathematical Theory of Communication.
135000	145000	And like many great scientific breakthroughs, theoretical breakthroughs, this was driven by a down-to-earth technological practical need.
145000	150000	Shannon was interested in sending signals across the Atlantic Ocean in wires.
150000	153000	And you want to send a signal in a way that is efficient, right?
153000	158000	That is least likely to be garbled or to lose the information.
158000	164000	And to do that, to figure out how to do that, you need to have a mathematical way of characterizing what you mean by information.
164000	173000	And it turns out, as he discovered by doing the math, that it's very, very similar to the formula for entropy in statistical mechanics.
173000	185000	So there was clearly some interesting hidden relationship here between information and communication on the one side and statistical mechanics and thermodynamics on the other side.
185000	189000	And of course, so this is the middle of the century, 1948.
189000	192000	This idea has blossomed quite a bit.
192000	194000	You hear about information all the time.
194000	196000	You hear about it in the political arena, right?
196000	198000	Misinformation, disinformation.
198000	200000	You hear about it in technology.
200000	203000	The information superhighway, that was a big thing.
203000	211000	And you must have heard that information as a concept is useful in biology, in neuroscience, quantum mechanics, quantum information, and so on.
211000	224000	So today, on the podcast, we have Christoph Adami, who is, like many mindscape guests, he started out his career as a relatively traditional physicist doing nuclear and particle physics.
224000	230000	And now he's a professor at Michigan State, not only in physics, but also in, I think, molecular biology department.
230000	234000	But he studies evolution and life, including artificial life.
234000	243000	And he has a new book out called The Evolution of Biological Information, How Evolution Creates Complexity from Viruses to Brains.
243000	251000	So I'm going to use this as an excuse to really get clear on what is this information theory stuff.
251000	253000	I mean, by the way, the book is a little technical.
253000	256000	I'm not going to advocate it for people who don't like equations.
256000	259000	There are some equations there, but the equations are quite mild.
259000	267000	You know, if you're the kind of person who doesn't read equations every day, but doesn't blanch when you see one, it might be a good book to pick up.
267000	279000	And we're going to talk about what information theory is in general and specifically how biologists or people who care about biology, even if they're physicists, are going to use information theory to better understand things like evolution
279000	281000	and even the origin of life.
281000	288000	I would say that 75 years later, the idea of information theory we got from Claude Shannon is still not settled in.
288000	292000	You know, we're still working through the basic implications of this.
292000	293000	So it's very exciting.
293000	294000	It's fun.
294000	298000	It's a new lens with which to look at the world in a detailed way.
298000	301000	And, you know, that's all we like to do here at the Mindscape Podcast.
301000	302000	So let's go.
309000	322000	Chris Hadami, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
322000	323000	Glad to be here.
323000	327000	You know, let's start with this idea of information theory.
327000	337000	It's always going to be a challenge when you have an idea like information theory that uses a natural language word that people are familiar with, right?
337000	338000	Information.
338000	342000	They think they know what information is, but now we have math behind it.
342000	348000	We've talked about information theory a lot on the podcast without ever just taking a breath and saying what it is.
348000	354000	So do you have a best way, a favorite way of explaining information theory to the person on the street?
354000	355000	I do.
355000	365000	It's actually strange that in this case, the mathematical understanding of the word information is actually very similar or very close to our understanding,
365000	369000	generally speaking, in our normal, you know, everyday usage.
369000	385000	So to really define information mathematically or even in words, we can just say that information is that which allows someone who has that information to make predictions with accuracy better than chance.
385000	386000	Right?
386000	389000	So there's a system that I know something about it.
389000	393000	And then that means I can actually predict some of its states.
393000	398000	For example, you know, where I can find coffee with accuracy better than chance.
398000	404000	If I would be just randomly go somewhere, well, I would most likely not end up in a coffee place.
404000	410000	But if I have information, that means I can actually say, hey, I have to go to this particular place.
410000	415000	And that's how we understand it normally in our everyday language.
415000	419000	And it is also exactly how it is defined mathematically.
419000	426000	Mathematically, information is that which is used to make predictions, but it has to be better than chance to be information.
426000	429000	Otherwise, it's just a guess, right?
429000	437000	And so because making predictions with accuracy better than chance is really powerful, that means it's also powerful in biology.
437000	440000	But of course, it's also powerful, let's say in the stock market.
440000	448000	If I have inside information, I can get rich using information because I can make predictions about, for example, the stock price was accuracy better than chance.
448000	457000	And Shannon, when he defined this concept in 1948, he defined it precisely that way, even though he didn't use exactly those words.
457000	463000	And as a consequence, there's a lot of misunderstanding about what information really is.
463000	468000	It's often confounded with entropy, which is in a sense the absolute opposite of information.
468000	471000	Namely, it is about what we don't know.
472000	479000	And so if you then confound information and entropy, then you're going to get a lot of misunderstandings.
479000	484000	But didn't, I completely agree with you, by the way, but didn't Shannon himself do that?
484000	495000	I mean, didn't he use the word information, like maximal information for him in a code or an alphabet is maximum entropy, right, when every symbol is equally likely?
495000	498000	You are right. He has done that.
498000	510000	I should say not so much in his original article, but you know, there was a book written or co-written, but I forgot it's Shannon and Macmillan or something, Shannon and Weaver.
510000	515000	In particular, in the book Shannon and Weaver, the words entropy and information get mixed up.
515000	519000	And I have a suspicion that this was mostly Weaver doing that.
519000	527000	I would have to actually look at the original article if Shannon himself does that, because in a sense, you know, he should know better.
527000	535000	Just because I saw so much of the confounding between entropy and information, I felt compelled to just simply write an article called What is Information?
535000	536000	Yeah.
536000	543000	Which this main purpose was to say, Hey guys, you know, you have to be careful. One is not the other.
543000	544000	No, that's great.
544000	551000	But I do sometimes wonder, you know, I agree with everything you just said, and I wonder if it's just my physics training.
551000	563000	Because to me, thinking like Boltzmann would have thought, a low entropy state, if you tell me that you're in a low entry macro state, all the molecules are in one corner of the room, you've given me a lot of information, right?
563000	567000	Low entropy is a lot of information, and that makes perfect sense to me.
567000	576000	That's right. Low entropy is a lot of information. You can think of information as simply a difference between two entropies, namely the maximum entropy and the actual entropy.
576000	577000	Okay, good.
577000	585000	So that's why when your actual entropy is low, then your information is high, because it's this difference.
585000	589000	And the fact that it's a difference, by the way, is a fundamentally important thing.
589000	596000	Namely, entropy itself, in a sense, has no real meaning or existence, just like energy doesn't have in physics.
596000	605000	Only differences of entropy have a meaning, just like in physics, only differences between energies have any real life effect.
605000	614000	And so the fact that it's a difference is important, but it's important that the first term is a maximum entropy, like how much there is to know about the system.
614000	622000	And if you forget about that, then your information is just minus entropy, or what a bunch of people have called negentropy, right?
622000	629000	Which is nonsense. It's forgetting the first term, which is the maximum entropy, so that this thing, which is information, is always positive.
629000	637000	So basically, in this way of talking, you would say, when I have some configuration, and I have some statistical knowledge about it,
637000	646000	I can divide the state into sort of the entropy part, which I don't understand very well, and the information part, which specifies something.
646000	657000	Right, or very simply speaking, for every system, write down or understand what is the maximum uncertainty that you have.
657000	663000	It's just really counting the number of degrees of freedom that there are, and then taking the log of that, right?
663000	668000	And then you ask yourself, well, how much entropy do I actually have?
668000	674000	In other words, do I have a probability distribution that is different than the maximum entropy distribution?
674000	678000	And if the answer is yes, then that means already you know something.
678000	683000	That means that the actual distribution has a lower entropy, and then you have some information.
683000	687000	However, you may not know at that point exactly what this information is about.
687000	688000	Okay.
688000	691000	In a gas, of course, very often you do.
691000	697000	Just like you said, when you have a bunch of molecules in a corner, well, then you have information about where these molecules are.
697000	704000	Of course, if you allow the molecules to disappear or to sort of like do their thing,
704000	708000	what happens is that your knowledge about the positions of the molecules starts decreasing.
709000	714000	And at the same time, of course, the actual entropy starts increasing.
714000	717000	That is what we call the second law of thermodynamics.
717000	720000	It's literally just the loss of information that you have.
720000	729000	And of course, during that equilibration phase, the system is returning to its equilibrium, but it's actually at its equilibrium.
729000	736000	So in other words, whenever you have information, it gives you a hint that the system is not at equilibrium.
736000	743000	It is away from equilibrium, and the amount of information is in fact characterizing how far away from equilibrium you are.
743000	749000	So when I'm speaking to you right now, you're actually in an ordered state, a very ordered state,
749000	751000	as far as the molecules are concerned.
751000	755000	And I can tell you in a sense how much ordered state there is.
755000	757000	It's about half a million bits.
757000	758000	Why?
758000	762000	Because in fact, that is the amount of information that's actually stored in your genome.
762000	764000	Ah, okay.
764000	769000	This is probably going to be leaping ahead, but what about like the particular configuration of my body?
769000	772000	Certainly that is more than half a million bits.
772000	782000	Um, that's a good question, but since in fact that organization is done by the half a million bits,
782000	790000	my suspicion is that in fact that must be the same, because how else would you achieve this ordered state?
790000	792000	So this is actually an interesting question.
792000	799000	If I just sit down and think a little bit, my intuition is that even though it seems that, you know,
799000	802000	that would be more than half a million bits, that in fact it is not.
802000	806000	However, it's such a good question that I cannot actually tell you right now why.
806000	809000	Good final exam question for the next time you teach a course based on your book.
809000	810000	Yeah, that's actually a good point.
810000	815000	I mean, if I, you know, after this interview, I'll try to sit down and figure this out.
815000	816000	Okay, that's a good one.
816000	820000	And it's simply because the information cannot be anywhere else.
820000	826000	The fact that you ordered, the only thing that makes that possible is the information in your genome.
826000	829000	And as a consequence, in a sense, mathematically, it has to be like that,
829000	834000	even though just like you said, that seems low.
834000	835000	It does seem low.
835000	837000	I like to think I can make more information than that.
837000	844000	I mean, certainly in my brain, there are neurons with certain weights and things like that,
844000	847000	and there's probably more than half a million bits there.
847000	848000	Right, okay.
848000	850000	Now, you're making another point.
850000	854000	Of course, there's information that you have acquired during your lifetime that is not being counted.
854000	856000	That is definitely there.
856000	857000	Good.
857000	865000	However, if you take, let's say a brain, before it learns something, let's say a baby brain,
865000	869000	physically speaking, of course, there are differences.
869000	875000	Yeah, but I mean, like the information is stored in the weights of the neurons in the brain in some way.
876000	881000	So, definitely, that is in addition.
881000	884000	However, that, of course, does not give you your physical appearance.
884000	888000	It doesn't change the organization of the rest of your body.
888000	891000	It's an interesting train of thought, but no doubt.
891000	894000	Either a final exam question or a paper to be written here, I think, about this.
894000	895000	How many bits am I?
895000	901000	But okay, something very interesting and important happened just now in your discussion of information,
901000	908000	because I think that if you asked people on the street, do you have information about where your car keys are?
908000	911000	They would think about that as a yes-no question.
911000	913000	I know where they are or I don't.
913000	918000	And you've sneaked in the idea of a probability distribution, which is kind of central here.
918000	919000	Right.
919000	921000	So, how does that come in?
921000	924000	How central is probability to information theory?
924000	928000	Well, actually, it is the central aspect of it.
928000	937000	So, before you can really understand information theory, you should have a very basic course in probability statistics.
937000	943000	Now, to tell you the truth, not everybody who is working in the field did have that, and that shows.
943000	949000	But simply because the concept of probability, actually, to fully understand it,
949000	954000	is not as simple as just writing down, you know, p sub i or some distribution, you know.
954000	962000	What a probability is, and I know you're familiar with this because you've thought about this in the context of quantum mechanics for a long time,
962000	966000	is, you know, not immediately trivial.
966000	970000	Some people think, oh, a probability exists by itself.
970000	980000	Other people say, no, a probability is just simply something that you can estimate, but that itself, in a sense, really doesn't exist.
980000	986000	But the idea of prediction, of course, is central to that.
986000	992000	So, when you're asking yourself, can I predict with accuracy better than chance,
992000	998000	then you have to, in a sense, have an idea of, well, what is the chance prediction here?
998000	1004000	And for that, in a sense, you need a prior, you need an assumption about what is expected.
1004000	1006000	Right.
1006000	1017000	And so, if you're going to talk about a probability distribution, then you're really talking about, what am I expecting?
1017000	1020000	So, let's go to the example of the car keys.
1020000	1021000	Right.
1021000	1027000	So, generally speaking, we could say, okay, here's a person who's looking for their car keys.
1027000	1033000	They know, with 90% of the chance, from past experience, right, we're setting up the priors now.
1033000	1036000	From past experience, 90% of the time, it's in my pocket.
1036000	1037000	Right.
1037000	1042000	But if it's not in my pocket, it could be in 10 different places.
1042000	1043000	Yeah.
1043000	1044000	Right.
1044000	1048000	If that is the case, you can set up, just set up the probability distribution for you,
1048000	1052000	because that means that there are 11 possible places that the keys could be in.
1052000	1053000	Right.
1053000	1058000	And the chance to find it in your pocket is 10%, sorry, 90%.
1058000	1064000	And then, in each of the 10 other places, the chance to find it is 1 out of 100.
1064000	1065000	Right.
1065000	1066000	Yeah.
1066000	1068000	So, now, I've set the expectation.
1068000	1070000	Before, I've done any experiment.
1070000	1071000	Right.
1071000	1073000	Now, I'm doing an experiment.
1073000	1075000	And of course, what experiment are you going to be doing?
1075000	1077000	You're going to check your pocket.
1077000	1078000	First, yes.
1078000	1079000	Right.
1079000	1085000	And now, what happens is that this measurement is going to give you information.
1085000	1086000	Right.
1086000	1092000	And in fact, we call this, you know, this outcome of this measurement, it's called a
1092000	1093000	specific information.
1093000	1094000	Okay.
1094000	1099000	It's a specific information, because I can do 11 measurements.
1099000	1106000	And the average of the outcomes of that, that's actually the information gained from the measurement
1106000	1108000	of the locations.
1108000	1116680	The interesting thing here is that if I don't find the key in my pocket, then I have a problem.
1116680	1118000	Now, it could be in 10 different places.
1118000	1122400	So, it turns out that the specific information of this measurement, namely that the key is
1122400	1124000	not in your pocket, is negative.
1124000	1125000	Yeah.
1125000	1129000	It's a negative specific information, even though the average information gained from
1129000	1132760	the car key searching measurement is still positive.
1132760	1135440	Because you're now less sure of where the keys are than you are before.
1135440	1136440	Exactly.
1136440	1137440	Exactly.
1137440	1140000	And it's like, oh my God, it's like, I thought I knew.
1140000	1141000	See, that's the thing.
1141000	1142000	Yeah.
1142000	1143600	I thought I knew means that's the priors.
1143600	1146440	From the priors, you had a pretty good idea.
1146440	1150960	Then you make your measurement and you go like, oh my God, now I don't know anything.
1150960	1155960	And this is mathematically, in fact, it's an exercise in my book in chapter three.
1155960	1157080	Very good.
1157080	1162760	And let me just raise, again, I'm super on your side, but it's my job to, you know,
1162760	1165600	play the devil's advocate sometimes.
1165600	1170720	Don't worry about this way of thinking about information because it sounds a little subjective.
1170720	1172040	It's not out there in the world.
1172040	1178000	You're talking about information as an ability for some agent to make predictions, right?
1178000	1184080	Is it truly objective or is it only relative to the capacities of some thinking being?
1184080	1188320	So you're asking, of course, the most important question about information.
1188320	1191640	And the answer is information is contextual always.
1191640	1193120	It is never absolute.
1193120	1197240	Now I'm going to give you a great example that will get you, you know, to think about
1197240	1198240	this.
1198240	1204880	Suppose you are a virus and you are, in fact, reaching a wreaking havoc inside of a patient,
1204880	1205880	right?
1205880	1207400	You are replicating fast.
1207400	1210200	Everything is going good for you, right?
1210200	1214680	Let's imagine your mutation rate is actually kind of low so you don't change much while.
1214680	1219280	So the information that you have about doing your job is doing its job, right?
1219280	1223840	Now the patient takes an antiviral, right?
1223840	1228600	The patient takes an antiviral and suddenly this virus goes like, man, you know, this
1228600	1232680	replicating thing is now really, really, really hard, right?
1232680	1238080	And what you can now do is you can calculate the information about how to do this job and
1238080	1239800	it has changed dramatically.
1239800	1247040	In fact, now the virus does not have this amount of information about doing its job anymore.
1247400	1249760	But the sequence is the same.
1249760	1252640	How can a sequence is the same?
1252640	1256680	Earlier I have lots of information and then have very little information.
1256680	1262720	The answer is because the context changed because that what you have information about has changed.
1262720	1267800	So what was the environment yesterday, isn't the environment today?
1267800	1272760	You have information about yesterday's world, not about today's world.
1272760	1274840	And that is the important thing.
1274840	1276400	Information is completely contextual.
1276400	1281840	The same sequence evaluated in different environments will have different information
1281840	1284120	and therefore different meaning.
1284120	1287120	A lot of times people think like, oh, information theory can't deal with meaning.
1287120	1288680	It's absolutely untrue.
1288680	1295440	My molecular sequence means something here on earth, actually, you know, above the surface
1295440	1297000	of the water, for example.
1297000	1303320	You put me underwater and my sequence is making wrong predictions, right?
1303840	1307600	About how to breathe, no underwater, that thing doesn't work.
1307600	1309320	Your fitness is zero.
1309320	1315440	I will have zero offspring underwater unless I actually, you know, am in a submarine or
1315440	1319560	something like that where I'm taking the environment with me, right?
1319560	1321400	Then I could still have information.
1321400	1329560	So very, you know, very nearly so in biology, information and fitness are exchangeable.
1330280	1334960	You have high information about how to do something, how to survive in the environment
1334960	1336880	means having high fitness.
1336880	1338360	They are related.
1338360	1342040	In fact, they are mathematically related and we don't have to talk about what that relationship
1342040	1344280	is, but you can read about it in my book.
1344280	1349120	So in other words, what happened in evolution is that fitness and information are essentially
1349120	1350600	intertwined.
1350600	1352880	They are almost the same thing.
1352880	1357520	And so the way you are increasing your fitness is you're increasing the information about
1357520	1359960	how to live in that environment.
1359960	1364160	I guess I was trying to make a similar point to what you just said in my book, The Big
1364160	1365160	Picture.
1365160	1368320	I mentioned the Voynich manuscript, right?
1368320	1373960	This wonderful old book full of symbols and nobody knows whether it's nonsense or whether
1373960	1374960	it refers to something.
1374960	1380720	And so I asked the question, how much information is there in the Voynich manuscript?
1380720	1382680	How would you answer that question?
1382680	1387480	The answer is unless we know what the information is about, this is entropy for us.
1388440	1394560	So if you have text or any data, that is not information.
1394560	1401760	In fact, it is literally just entropy in the sense that you are talking about, oh, it represents
1401760	1405680	an example of another similar set of things.
1405680	1410160	And so you're setting up your hypothetical ensemble so that you can talk about an entropy.
1410160	1416640	The moment that you know what things you can predict with it, then it becomes information.
1416640	1421960	If you do not know this, the same piece of information or the same text, should I say,
1421960	1426160	the same symbolic sequence would just be entropy to you.
1426160	1430400	In other words, just to repeat it, because information is that which allows you to make
1430400	1435260	predictions about a particular system with accuracy better than chance.
1435260	1438080	If you don't know what this is, it's not information.
1438080	1445400	Another example is somebody hands you a subway chart, and he goes like, well, that's fantastic,
1445480	1447640	except I don't know which city this is.
1447640	1449200	Well then it's useless to you.
1449200	1453320	And if it's useless, so in other words, useless information is entropy.
1453320	1454320	Got it.
1454320	1459160	The other idea at the technical level that I have found super important in my tiny little
1459160	1462600	forays into information theory is mutual information.
1462600	1467720	I love this concept, and it never gets explained in a popular level, so maybe you can give
1467720	1469720	us a shot.
1469720	1470720	Right.
1470720	1475320	So first of all, information is really a mutual entropy.
1475320	1477040	It's a shared entropy.
1477040	1483880	So in other words, the reason why me, if I have information, can make predictions about
1483880	1488440	another system is because, in a sense, we have certain correlations.
1488440	1494640	We know something about each other, and so information, even though I showed you earlier
1494640	1498360	that it's really a difference of entropy, you can also think of it as a shared entropy.
1498360	1503200	The mathematics to show that this is one and the same thing, we're not going to go into.
1503560	1509920	Just trust me here that if you think about a Venn diagram about a system and the one
1509920	1515840	who's trying to measure the system, the intersection of that Venn diagram, that's the information
1515840	1520760	that the measurement device has about the system.
1520760	1522360	That's a shared entropy.
1522360	1524360	That shared entropy is, of course, the information.
1524360	1531000	So when people say mutual information, they're meaning mutual, mutual entropy.
1531320	1534240	So in fact, nobody should be using that word.
1534240	1540920	In my book, for example, when I have an index where it says mutual information, I say C
1540920	1541920	information.
1541920	1542920	Fair enough.
1542920	1550040	But it's just that for the reason that we talked about earlier that people are using
1550040	1556880	information and entropy synonymously, they have taken mutual entropy, which is an information,
1556880	1560560	and called that mutual information.
1561120	1563000	But in principle, they're one and the same thing.
1563000	1564520	We just should call it information.
1564520	1568400	It is that that correlates the two systems.
1568400	1572720	Because remember, we always have to talk about two systems when we are talking about information.
1572720	1577760	One that makes the prediction and one that is being predicted.
1577760	1581880	And what is shared, the shared correlation between them.
1581880	1586400	In other words, what's not random between them, that is information.
1586400	1587400	Good.
1587400	1591240	So now we have a pretty firm grounding on information theory.
1591240	1595600	We can move on to applying it to biology, which is what your book is all about.
1595600	1598520	But let me just first ask the background question.
1598520	1607200	How popular in biology is this task of thinking about things in terms of information theory?
1607200	1610360	Is it everyone does it or no one does it?
1610360	1614240	Or it is the new hotness and it's sweeping the field?
1614240	1615720	Let me put it this way.
1615720	1621040	If this was something that everybody does, I wouldn't have had to write this book.
1621040	1626920	This book really came out of a frustration that I have this tool.
1626920	1633120	I see how valuable it is to understand essentially anything in biology and nobody is using it.
1633120	1634560	When I say nobody, that's not quite true.
1634560	1637240	There are a few people who do.
1637240	1642000	Bill Bialek in Princeton, for example, has certainly done this and he does know how to
1642000	1643880	do this.
1643880	1650560	There's a few people often, in fact, in Bill Bialek's orbit who have looked at information
1650560	1657080	transmission in cells, for example, in gene regulation and calculated the channel capacity
1657080	1661120	of a cellular communication channel and did this very well.
1661120	1664320	And I, in fact, have these examples in my book.
1664320	1668600	But it is woefully underrepresented.
1668600	1675440	There is something about information theory that presents a barrier, a hurdle in a sense
1675440	1678440	to acceptance.
1678440	1683240	I only have a vague memory of when I first learned about information theory, which was
1683240	1690760	in fact at Caltech when a postdoc that was placed into my office actually first started
1690760	1694840	explaining classical information theory to me because we were actually working in quantum
1694840	1695840	information.
1695840	1699060	And it was like, well, let's do the classical theory first.
1699060	1704200	And I remember when he was first writing these formulas on the board, which has these vertical
1704200	1710160	bars and these columns and semicolons, thinking, like, what is this?
1710160	1712080	This is not my mathematics.
1712080	1718120	My mathematics, there's integrals, there's differentials, you know, there are matrices.
1718120	1723440	And now I'm seeing these weird symbols and my brain doesn't really understand them.
1723440	1728720	In a sense, from the cognitive science perspective, is you don't have these representations that
1728720	1732480	allow you to recognize these things and they have to build over time.
1732480	1738320	And I think this barrier that I felt at the time and was like, oh, there's all these different
1738320	1743320	entropies, there's a mutual, there's a shared, a conditional, and you were like, how am I
1743320	1745200	going to keep them apart?
1745200	1749200	And you have to get used to them just like you got used to integrals and differentials
1749200	1751320	and things like that.
1751320	1757560	If I ask anyone who had algebra and calculus, it's like, would you ever confound differentials
1757560	1758560	with integrals?
1758560	1760600	And it goes like, of course not, right?
1760600	1763120	Yes, because you got used to this stuff, right?
1763120	1768520	So there seems to be this barrier and in particular, very often information theory is perceived
1768520	1772360	as being an engineering discipline, right?
1772360	1775680	And they're going like, well, the engineers, you know, like, well, they want to do error-correcting
1775680	1778240	codes and like, what does this have to do with biology?
1778600	1783120	In fact, I've seen this in print saying like, you know, the engineering discipline of information
1783120	1787360	theory has nothing to say about biology because these are very different things.
1787360	1791160	It's like saying, well, information theory can't apply to physics when in fact we do
1791160	1792720	know very well that it does.
1792720	1797560	In fact, I just explained the second law of thermodynamics in terms of information theory.
1797560	1800720	And so this barrier is very palpable.
1800720	1805840	So if somebody is an established scientist and you tell them, well, you know what, you
1805840	1809400	should really be using information theory, they're not going to do it.
1809400	1811680	They're entrenched in their ways.
1811680	1820840	And they usually are not receptive to learning in a sense a whole new bag of tricks, right?
1820840	1824680	It is not that different from what happened in black hole physics where they constantly
1824680	1829560	talk about information loss in black holes and not a single paper is trying to calculate
1829560	1832920	the capacity of the black hole channel, except of course, me.
1833800	1840000	That's because, you know, because I know information theory, but, you know, these people
1840000	1845640	have been working in this area for 30 years and not picked up a single book or article
1845640	1847040	on information theory.
1847040	1851360	Again, there's this barrier, they're saying like, this concept is different from the concept
1851360	1852360	I need.
1852360	1854040	And the answer is no, it is the same concept.
1854040	1859200	You know, I'm a little bit sympathetic because I know that when I read papers in economics,
1859200	1867000	they have this habit of denoting variables in equations by words rather than by single
1867000	1868000	letters.
1868000	1873920	And it's so trivial and silly, but it truly rubs me the wrong way and I have trouble
1873920	1875720	wrapping my brain around it.
1875720	1882280	No, I fully agree with you because that is not how we write equations, right?
1883280	1890040	You know, I still almost vividly remember this aversion where I'm like, this is not
1890040	1891040	my thing, right?
1891040	1892760	But you have to power through this, right?
1892760	1897840	And in my lab, everybody gets, you know, the basic, you know, introduction to information
1897840	1898840	theory.
1898840	1904000	And then once you've sort of internalized it, you cannot see the world except through
1904000	1905640	that lens of information theory.
1905640	1910480	It's like the hammer that makes everything look like a nail, right?
1910480	1916680	And in my book, in fact, I sort of co-op the famous saying which we all know in biology
1916680	1920480	which says nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution, which certainly
1920480	1921480	is true.
1921480	1925840	But I basically have changed it around to say nothing in biology makes sense except
1925840	1928840	in the light of information.
1928840	1931640	Then of course, information is that which evolves, really.
1931640	1936480	I mean, people would say, well, organisms involve, no, what evolves actually is information.
1936480	1939680	The information is what is essential in an organism.
1939680	1944880	The organism itself isn't really that essential in the sense it's replaceable, right?
1944880	1949880	If we have offspring, they carry most of the information with them.
1949880	1956320	But only the encoded information, of course, what we think as specific to ourselves is
1956320	1960080	of course the stuff in our brain that we have talked about about 25 minutes earlier.
1960080	1965160	The information that we acquired over a lifetime is, of course, making us special, right?
1965160	1970360	The information in your genome does not make you special, but it is what makes you alive.
1970360	1977840	So is it fair to think of Charles Darwin as an early information theorist?
1977840	1987640	Well, I would say no, simply because he didn't really, and he had no way of understanding
1987640	1995440	that the basis of inheritance was really the replication of information.
1995440	2002880	He didn't even know how any of the stuff was encoded because that was discovered in 1958.
2002880	2007760	Or we should say that John von Neumann kind of figured it out a little bit earlier when
2007760	2016680	he came up with this theory of self-replicating machines, which essentially could have told
2016680	2022640	Watson and Crick where to look for stored information.
2022640	2028480	So Darwin did not know that, but he had, via his sleuthing, in a sense, going on boats
2028480	2034680	and looking at stuff, figured out, hey, there's variation going on, there's selection going
2034680	2036800	on, and there's inheritance going on.
2036800	2042920	The fact that these three things are properties of information, so inheritance being the replication
2042920	2048640	of information, variance being the mutation of information, the changing of information,
2048640	2051280	and selection is the meaning of information.
2051280	2056640	In other words, those pieces of information that have a lot of information are fitter
2056640	2060840	and therefore will have more offspring, and therefore, in fact, because I told you about
2060840	2066920	the relationship between information and fitness, then the meaning of information is selection.
2066920	2073160	So we can think of the entire evolutionary process in terms of what happens to information,
2073160	2075520	and we should, in fact.
2075520	2080240	But Darwin did not think that way, even though, of course, I haven't read all of his works,
2080240	2085720	even though many of them are in my little natural history collection in my bookshelf,
2085720	2086880	but they are big, big tomes.
2086880	2093760	I mean, one of the things that is so astonishing to me is that Darwin had, in his head, essentially
2093760	2100080	had 12 book treaties and then was forced to publish the abstract of it as the first book,
2100080	2106200	which is now the origin of species, but he had so much more to say, and then over the
2106200	2110280	rest of his life, in fact, said many of these things.
2110280	2116000	And of course, most of those things, you know, like about worms and about plants and things
2116000	2117000	like that.
2117000	2118000	Barnacles.
2118000	2121160	We don't usually read.
2121160	2129240	But in there, if you study those volumes maybe with more attention to the concept of information,
2129240	2138040	in the idea that what makes these plants how they are, in fact, is making predictions.
2138040	2141080	But he's, in fact, a good example.
2141080	2148240	Darwin himself, at some point, noticed a particular orchid which had a very, very long neck, you
2148240	2151640	know, which he knew had to be pollinated, right?
2151640	2159240	And it was about 30 centimeters over, you know, what is that, and it's about a foot,
2159240	2160240	right?
2160240	2161240	Yeah.
2161240	2163800	Or even longer, in fact.
2163800	2166520	But basically he said, now I will make a prediction.
2166520	2170800	I will predict that there is a pollinated exists with a proboscis or a nose, you know,
2170800	2174840	what they're using for, which is about that length, right?
2174840	2182600	And even though he didn't live to see that prediction come true, in fact, his competitor
2182600	2187880	in the evolutionary field that almost scooped him, he, in fact, basically said, oh, and
2187880	2190840	I'm going to tell you that this must be a Sphinx moth.
2190840	2194680	And in fact, they later found it after Darwin died.
2194680	2197480	And that was exactly, you know, as he had predicted it.
2197480	2203760	So to some extent, you know, he knew that evolution, this idea, the theory of evolution
2203760	2206080	is a predictive theory, right?
2206080	2211420	Even though he didn't think of it in terms of information, theoretical terms.
2211420	2216600	So yeah, a typical evolutionary biologist would try to explain things in terms of there's
2216600	2221800	a population with certain traits, and there's a fitness landscape, and they, you know, move
2221800	2223840	towards peaks of the fitness landscape.
2223840	2228280	And so you're not undermining that, you're just saying that a useful way of thinking
2228280	2233360	about fitness is having the information to successfully predict what's going to happen
2233360	2235960	in your environment, and therefore survive.
2235960	2236960	That's right.
2236960	2239120	I don't undermine any of the standard population genetics.
2239120	2245440	It is really just a very different way of understanding what fitness is.
2245440	2251280	You know, after all, fitness, the way, you know, it is not the same word as we talk about
2251280	2253840	physical fitness, of course, right?
2253840	2258280	Fitness in biology means fitting your environment well, right?
2258280	2263200	It means being adapted to your environment, which means corresponding to, right?
2263200	2268400	And see, we're seeing, aha, that means in a sense that your body structure, you know,
2268400	2271840	is predictive about what world you live in, right?
2271840	2279240	So for example, E. coli bacteria, they grow best at 37 degrees Celsius.
2279240	2281200	Well, that's weird, isn't it?
2281200	2282320	Well, no, it's not weird.
2282320	2284800	That's the temperature of our stomach.
2284800	2290200	So basically, their molecular biology makes a prediction about what environment they're
2290200	2292680	in, namely one at 37 degrees Celsius.
2292680	2297640	Their prediction is off, where that means, in fact, you know, they don't have as much
2297640	2301840	information as they think, and they're actually not going to grow as fast, right?
2301840	2310680	So this correlation between the genome and the environment gives you the fitness because
2310680	2316280	it tells you, you're fitting this environment well, you're well adapted to it.
2316280	2319800	And that concept information is precisely that, this correlation, right?
2319800	2324440	And this is a very important point because it reminds us that just so people don't get
2324440	2328560	the wrong idea, information isn't necessarily conscious, right?
2328560	2332880	It's not something that you might say, you know, the information in your genome is very
2332880	2336600	well adapted to your environment, even though you personally might have no idea with the
2336600	2340680	arrangement of nucleotides in your DNA is.
2340680	2341680	That's right.
2341680	2346440	So obviously, you know, when we're talking about the fact that cells make predictions
2346440	2350440	about their environment, which they do all the time because cells have to make decisions,
2350440	2352440	it's not like they have a brain.
2352440	2356880	But to some extent, we also know that because once you understand that information is just
2356880	2362240	a correlation, which is a non-random correlation, because sometimes you get correlation by chance.
2362240	2367160	But no, we're looking for correlations that are not by chance and that are on top of that
2367160	2369200	being maintained, right?
2369200	2373200	Because in thermodynamics, you might have correlations by chance, but they are going
2373200	2375600	to disappear very soon, right?
2375600	2382280	The genome is making sure that these correlations are being maintained so that we can continue
2382280	2386960	using, you know, what we have to make predictions about the environment.
2386960	2393080	If you would be loosening this continuous maintenance, then information would go away
2393080	2395680	and we call that death.
2395680	2396680	Is that what we call death?
2396680	2397680	Good.
2397680	2398680	Now that we know.
2398680	2404160	But this does bring us to a very fun point you make in the book is that we can think of
2404160	2409960	evolution as a kind of Maxwell's demon and maybe be fun to explain what Maxwell's demon
2409960	2413680	is, not everyone knows, and what it has to do with evolution.
2413680	2414680	Right.
2414680	2418560	So that's a good point and thank you for leading me into that because it's one of my favorite
2418560	2421160	parts of the book, actually.
2421160	2430000	So Maxwell's demon, let's not talk about why this sort of devil was invented, but let's
2430000	2431680	focus on what he does.
2431680	2439120	So the Maxwell's demon basically is sitting at the intersection of two, let's say, boxes
2439120	2441760	and there's a little window inside of the box.
2441760	2448680	And now both boxes have gas in them, gas molecules who have different speeds, you know, by in
2448680	2453160	fact described by the Maxwell distribution, right?
2453160	2458800	Turns out that and now imagine that this demon who sits there, he operates sort of the door
2458800	2462120	between the two, the two boxes.
2462120	2465800	And he also has a measurement device that he uses in order to measure the speed of a
2465800	2472040	molecule, for example, one that is about to go through the through the through the door.
2472040	2476960	And then he goes like, OK, if this is a fast molecule, I'm going to let it go through.
2476960	2481760	But if it's a slow molecule, I'm going to shut the door and so that it is in fact going
2481760	2483000	to be reflected.
2483000	2489160	If he does that a lot, he's going to have one half of the two boxes, I mean, or should
2489160	2493120	say the left box as opposed to the right box, with lots of fast molecules.
2493120	2496840	And the other one will be, you know, stuck with all the slow molecules.
2496840	2502280	That is in violation, in apparent violation, I should say, of the second law of thermodynamics,
2502280	2508280	which basically says no, that can't happen, namely the formation of a non-equilibrium
2508280	2510200	situation from an equilibrium.
2510200	2518080	So mathematically, it looks like what the demon has achieved is, in fact, creating order
2518080	2521720	or violating the second law of thermodynamics.
2521720	2528720	The fact that he didn't do such a thing was, in fact, proven mathematically and fully correctly
2528720	2539880	a later by Rolf Landauer, a Rudolf Landauer, a German-American physicist.
2539960	2543680	We're not going to go into how that proof goes, but it is not a violation of the second
2543680	2544880	law of thermodynamics.
2544880	2551880	But this idea that via measurement, you can actually reduce entropy is, of course, a
2551880	2555880	very common one, because measurements give you information and information is sort of
2555880	2557600	the opposite of entropy.
2557600	2563280	So yeah, if you, for example, look into a room of molecules and then essentially measure
2563280	2567200	the speed and position of all the molecules you're looking at, you could in principle
2567280	2572200	achieve a lot of order because you could punch them, so to speak, with a laser and then all
2572200	2574000	go into one corner.
2574000	2577560	So in other words, measurements do allow you to decrease entropy.
2577560	2583080	Now that we have described the Maxwell demon, now let's think about the Darwin demon.
2583080	2590160	So in order to understand this, let's imagine that instead of these measurements that the
2590160	2597080	demon does, we're basically doing, so the molecules are now mutations.
2597080	2599200	So you have a genome and a mutation happens.
2599200	2601920	The mutation happens is completely random.
2601920	2606120	It could actually increase your fitness or it could decrease your fitness.
2606120	2612440	And now the demon basically says, look, I'm actually closing the door and not allowing
2612440	2619480	the decreasing fitness mutations to persist, but I'm going to keep those that actually
2619480	2622520	are increasing my fitness.
2622520	2627160	So in a sense, the organism now performs a measurement, but it turns out, of course,
2627160	2635640	that the mechanism of evolution is precisely that way, namely the deleterious mutation
2635640	2641720	will make it such that the organism carrying it doesn't have as many offspring.
2641720	2642720	It's less fit.
2642720	2647720	And as a consequence, its frequency in the population will go down, or else even if it's
2647720	2655240	a lethal mutation will disappear, whereas the beneficial mutations will in fact be enhanced.
2655240	2661860	So because the beneficial mutations create order, because there's now a type that increases
2661860	2668600	in frequency, maybe even very fast at the detriment of all of the other sequences where
2668600	2671440	that creates order in the population.
2671440	2676440	And it's essentially because you learn something about the environment.
2676440	2681480	You have extracted information about the environment by having this measurement of the environment.
2681480	2685320	So in other words, these mutations that are being kept, they are measurements of the environment.
2685320	2688280	It's like, ah, 37 degrees Celsius.
2688280	2694920	Okay, so let's adjust our genome in such a way that we grow well at 37 degrees Celsius.
2694920	2700200	Whereas the deleterious mutations, of course, are misinformation, and they reduce your
2700200	2703560	fitness and as a consequence, they're thrown out of the window.
2703880	2707960	That's the Maxwell-Diemann closing the door on them.
2707960	2714200	And what that means is that, well, if this is a continuous process, then it should lead
2714200	2723080	to a constant increase of information inside of an organism over time as evolution proceeds.
2723080	2729360	And therefore, we can actually formulate this as a law, namely the law of increasing information
2729360	2736480	in evolution that actually predicts that if you start out with a low information
2737040	2743280	beginning sequence, that over time, the information must increase, but not all the time.
2743280	2746960	For example, if the environment changes, well, we already discussed that,
2746960	2749600	then your information drops, right?
2749600	2752320	And you have to sort of relearn things, right?
2752960	2756640	There are other ways in which information can get lost.
2757600	2762400	For example, recombination can actually destroy information, right?
2762400	2764160	It can also lead to a good thing.
2764160	2770400	So this natural demon, this Darwin-Diemann, is not perfect in a sense.
2770400	2771200	It's leaky.
2771200	2777440	It sometimes makes wrong decisions where information can actually go down instead of up, right?
2777440	2783200	But overall, on average, this theory of evolution predicts that the amount of information
2783920	2787840	that is stored in a population of genomes has to be going up.
2787840	2793360	And that is very interesting because we've been searching for a way to understand the
2793360	2799280	bio-complexity that we are seeing around us and asking, how on earth is all of this possible?
2799280	2803360	And can I understand if one organism is more complex than another?
2803360	2808160	And this idea of complexity, of course, is difficult to put in mathematics.
2808160	2812320	But in fact, it turns out that complexity is literally just information.
2812320	2816960	In other words, complexity is just a proxy for information.
2816960	2817520	Why?
2817520	2823920	Complexity essentially is stuff that is complicated but helps you do something interesting, right?
2823920	2829520	We don't associate complexity with something that is just structurally interesting,
2829520	2831760	but actually doesn't do anything, right?
2831760	2837040	What was called a spandrel by Gould and Lewinton in biology, right?
2837040	2838560	Something that looks very complicated.
2838560	2841920	Once we understand it, it's actually just, let's say an icicle.
2842160	2843840	Oh, it's not really that complex.
2843840	2847680	But there are really complex things, for example, our brains, right?
2849440	2855520	But that is in fact reflected by the information necessary to make it, right?
2855520	2862480	So it turns out, therefore, that information is really the correct way of measuring complexity.
2862480	2869280	And therefore, the question of is complexity increasing in evolution is simply answered
2869280	2872800	as a yes, as long as you understand that complexity is really information.
2872800	2877360	And the natural demon is responsible for that law of increasing information.
2877920	2882080	Good, because naively, we might look at an organism and try to figure out,
2882080	2883440	oh, that looks complicated.
2883440	2884560	That looks pretty simple.
2885200	2888640	And we wonder why all this complexity has grown.
2888640	2893200	But you're saying that that's just a pale reflection of what's really going on underneath the hood.
2894160	2894880	That's right.
2894880	2898160	But it's almost like saying, if I look at a sequence, right?
2898160	2903280	Somebody's genome or some animal's genome or a bacterial genome, I can't immediately see,
2903280	2904880	well, this is information.
2904880	2906160	This is not information.
2906160	2907120	Here's some information.
2907120	2909840	Is it like, they look the same, right?
2909840	2912880	So we need to figure out how they're making predictions.
2912880	2915280	Or in other words, how are they functioning in the world?
2915280	2919840	So if you have something that looks complex, then you have to ask yourself,
2919840	2925440	let's observe this thing and see whether what looks such an intricate mechanism
2925440	2927200	is in fact necessary for survival.
2928320	2935280	Or whether it is just something that is a consequence of something else, right?
2935280	2939760	We see sometimes like these complex display behaviors in animals.
2939760	2942240	And they are obviously important in mating.
2942240	2946080	And if you would remove them, in fact, your fitness drops to zero
2946080	2949840	because you don't get to mate, zero offspring, zero fitness, right?
2950640	2952640	But then there are other things that are in a sense just
2953360	2955680	no, they're not important for the actual survival.
2955680	2958880	You would take them away and it doesn't change the fitness.
2958880	2962320	It's like saying, you're removing a section of the genomic code,
2962320	2965520	but if that is not predictive evidence, if it does not carry any information,
2965520	2966560	it is not important for fitness.
2966560	2967840	You can take it away.
2967840	2971760	And we don't, so to get, if I understood what you said correctly,
2971760	2976560	we don't right now have a clear cut way of looking at a genome and saying,
2976560	2978640	this part contains information, this part doesn't.
2979440	2985520	We actually do, but only if we're looking at many of them, not a single one, right?
2986160	2993680	If I have a hundred versions of a gene, there are regions in it
2993680	2995520	that are unimportant for survival.
2995520	2999200	If I then make an alignment of them, then I can recognize, oh, look,
2999200	3001920	this changes all the time at this position.
3001920	3005200	Clearly, that doesn't mean anything because you can just willy-nilly change it.
3005200	3007520	But then you go like, oh, but look at this section.
3007600	3009200	It's the same everywhere.
3009200	3010880	The same for every organism.
3010880	3014080	I bet you it is because when you change it, you die.
3014720	3016880	And that's why I haven't seen it, right?
3016880	3019440	If you would make it, it would simply die.
3019440	3021760	And therefore, it doesn't enter your database.
3021760	3024080	So you have to do these multiple sequence alignment,
3024080	3026480	as they're called in bioinformatics.
3026480	3030080	And when you're looking across column by column,
3030720	3035040	and you see some columns being completely conserved by evolution,
3035840	3038400	even though evolution constantly tries to change them, right?
3038400	3039760	Because it's through the mutational process.
3040400	3043680	And then you see columns which are willy-nilly.
3043680	3047760	Like on the nucleotide level, you see A, Cs, Gs, and Ts with 25% frequency.
3047760	3050800	And you go like clearly, not information, right?
3050800	3054560	And so that is, in fact, the basis of the algorithm
3054560	3056480	that I describe in the book that allows you to measure
3056480	3058400	the amount of information in a sequence.
3058400	3061760	But if you do not have a multiple sequence alignment,
3061760	3063280	in other words, a bunch of examples,
3063840	3066240	then you cannot understand what is information,
3066240	3067440	because everything looks the same.
3068000	3069600	And this reminds me that you, of course,
3069600	3072400	have collaborated with your colleague Richard Lensky
3072400	3075920	on his long-term, who is the boss of the was,
3075920	3077600	of the long-term evolution experiments.
3077600	3079200	You've actually seen data like this.
3080240	3080720	That's right.
3080720	3082480	In fact, we constantly see this.
3082480	3086080	We see this more easily in digital life experiments
3086080	3088480	where we have self-replicating computer programs
3088480	3090160	that live inside of a computer,
3090160	3092240	just like the one I'm staring at right now,
3092240	3093840	and that you're staring at right now.
3095200	3097040	And there, we can extract these sequences
3097040	3099760	and we can look precisely where the information is.
3099760	3101360	And in fact, we can measure the information
3101360	3105200	and see as the fitness increases, the information increases.
3105200	3108080	It's literally, if you would be taking the log of the fitness
3108800	3112240	and superimpose it with the calculated information,
3112240	3114320	they're almost on top of each other, right?
3114320	3115920	Because it's the log fitness,
3115920	3117840	which is basically the growth rate,
3117840	3120240	which is, in a sense, mathematically equivalent
3120240	3120880	to information.
3120880	3124560	So if information is zero, your growth rate is zero, right?
3125680	3129200	So my own biological knowledge is not very big,
3129200	3133040	but I do recall understanding that the human genome
3133040	3138320	is not the longest out there in the ecosystem, right?
3138320	3139520	Is that something we understand?
3139520	3143360	But, so you're addressing an important question.
3144080	3147280	In the biological literature, it's called the C-value paradox.
3147280	3150480	If you just look at the length of genomes,
3150480	3155760	there is an amoeba out there, which has 200 times more DNA
3155760	3156800	than we have.
3156800	3159200	It's called amoeba dubia, actually.
3159200	3162160	So it's almost like the W in a former president.
3162160	3162720	Yeah.
3162720	3165280	So, you know, you can think of that as you may.
3166400	3170160	So clearly, genomic content isn't information, right?
3170960	3174160	But if you would take the genome of, let's say,
3174160	3177440	a thousand of these amoeba and then align it,
3177440	3179120	then you would see that most of the stuff
3179120	3180480	is completely meaningless.
3180480	3184160	Or else, in fact, it might not be haploid.
3184160	3186720	So in other words, you have 100 copies
3186720	3189120	of the same small piece of information.
3189120	3190960	And here's another thing that you need to understand
3190960	3192240	about information.
3192240	3196320	If I have one book that, let's say,
3196320	3198560	is predictive about certain things,
3198560	3200400	and then you have a copy of the book,
3200400	3202560	that's not twice as much information.
3202560	3204880	It is exactly one time as much information.
3204880	3208160	So if you have 100 copies because you have 100 copies
3208160	3209840	of your genome, like we, for example,
3209840	3211840	have two copies, we are deployed.
3211840	3214400	There's many other organisms, like in particular plants,
3214400	3216160	which are teraploid, you know,
3216160	3218080	they have 16 copies and so on.
3218080	3221200	So this amoeba probably has over 100 copies
3221200	3222240	of its own genome.
3222240	3225120	So in other words, clearly, this amount of DNA
3225120	3227760	you have divided by 100, that still wouldn't get us
3227760	3229920	to the three billion that we have,
3230640	3234080	three billion per chromosome, right?
3234080	3234880	So, yeah.
3234880	3236880	And it's not six billion, you know,
3236880	3238400	it's six billion base pairs.
3238400	3242640	But in fact, out of the three billion nucleotides,
3242640	3247040	which in a sense give you a entropy or potential
3247040	3249440	information of six billion bits,
3250880	3252320	but it's potential information,
3252320	3254400	which is the same thing as entropy, right?
3257040	3260880	Only a small fraction of this actually encodes information.
3260880	3264400	And from the encode project, it is probably about 8%.
3265360	3268560	And that's how you're getting to that number of 500 million bits,
3268560	3275520	which is about 8%, I think, of the 3.1 billion or so, right?
3275520	3279280	And so there are some plant genomes that are enormous
3279280	3281520	because of this, you know, explosion.
3281520	3283760	But, you know, if you have several copies,
3283760	3285360	and if you have in plants, for example,
3285360	3287760	there's lots and lots of intergenic regions,
3287760	3289520	which are meaningless.
3289520	3291600	In other words, there's no information in there.
3291600	3293840	Plants are sort of spectacular for that.
3293840	3296880	They have far more intergenic stuff than humans, for example.
3298000	3300960	Some of them have up to 70% intergenic stuff.
3301920	3305200	And this intergenic stuff is probably also riddled with transposons.
3305200	3308080	So literally, if you would be taking it out or mutating it,
3308080	3310640	it would not change what the plant does at all.
3310640	3312640	So there is no information encoded there.
3312640	3315920	So if you really want to plot just information content,
3316960	3322480	in fact, Eugene Coonan, who works at the NIH, he has done that.
3322480	3324240	In fact, his plot is in my book.
3324240	3329040	And you find out that, yeah, bacteria are sort of very low there.
3329040	3332400	And humans, as far as we can measure,
3332400	3334400	in fact, have the most information.
3334400	3337280	Mammals generally, but humans the most.
3337920	3340800	So this idea that humans are, in a sense,
3340800	3346000	the apex of complexity that some people think is sort of very self-serving,
3346000	3348000	that might not be wrong.
3348000	3351200	Certainly, if you take a look at it through the lens of information theory.
3351760	3352560	I believe that.
3352560	3354560	Let me, that number went by pretty quickly.
3354560	3355360	So I want to get it right.
3355360	3359680	8% of the human genome is information theory?
3359680	3360480	It's coding.
3360480	3361040	Yeah.
3361040	3361280	Okay.
3361280	3364640	And the rest is intergenic stuff or repetitive stuff.
3365440	3367120	In other words, it's uninformative.
3367120	3368400	It seems a little inefficient.
3368400	3368800	I don't know.
3369840	3373040	Well, I mean, it's because there is so much, for example,
3373680	3378960	if you have a gene, there are regions that are called introns,
3379920	3381360	which just have junk in it.
3381360	3384960	And they're being excised before the stuff is being translated into proteins.
3386000	3388240	And so there's a vast amount of that.
3388240	3392640	And then inside of chromosomes, there's vast regions of repetitive stuff.
3393360	3398880	Some of it might even serve structural features so that molecules can attach to it.
3398880	3402800	But it does not actually provide information about surviving.
3403200	3404320	Right.
3404320	3408880	So obviously, it is difficult to measure the information content
3410320	3415760	because we would have to have thousands of human genomes that you can align.
3415760	3418880	Now, we have, in fact, now thousands of human genomes,
3418880	3421120	but nobody's actually tried to do that.
3421760	3431920	And I should say that in order for a good ensemble to really be reflective of the information,
3431920	3434640	we needed to have a good amount of variation.
3434640	3441840	In other words, those nucleotides that are mutatable, they should have had a chance to mutate.
3441840	3446080	But because we humans have a relatively common recent ancestor,
3447360	3451440	there's a lot of conservation in the genome that is common through common descent.
3452000	3452560	Right.
3452560	3457520	And it looks like it might be information if I'm making such an alignment of a thousand genomes,
3457520	3459280	but in fact, might not be.
3459280	3463680	So one of the things you might want to do is you want to take a lot of African genomes
3463680	3467200	for this alignment because there's much more variation in the African genomes
3467200	3471040	because they have, in a sense, been evolving longer.
3471040	3473120	And their common ancestor is much, much, much earlier,
3473760	3476080	which is why there is so much more variation.
3476640	3476800	Right.
3476800	3482800	And that would be a much better estimate is if you take European genomes and make that alignment
3482800	3488640	because really, we're looking at like a hundred thousand years of variation,
3488640	3494320	which, given the population sizes, might not be enough to really reveal the information content.
3494320	3498640	So if you have a population that has a fairly common recent ancestor,
3498640	3504240	then even this alignment is not going to do a very good job of giving you the information.
3504240	3508800	But very often in proteins, single proteins, for example, or viral proteins,
3508800	3512720	which are evolving very quickly, you can actually measure this information.
3512720	3517760	And I've done this, for example, for the HIV protease, which is a 99 amino acid sequence.
3518480	3523680	And then C, for example, like the example with drugs that I gave you,
3523680	3528960	but when you introduce anti-HIV drugs in the population, you see the information dropping
3529520	3530320	very rapidly.
3530880	3538240	And then because we have data over time, you can see how as the virus evolves drug resistance,
3538240	3542400	it really learns about this new world that is being cast into.
3542400	3547760	And you see the information over 10 years really approaching the pre-introduction levels.
3549120	3554800	So for certain proteins and molecules, it's much easier to actually do this analysis
3554800	3558960	and measuring information than, for example, to do it for a whole genome.
3558960	3566400	In principle, it can be done, but ideally, you would do assays where you're trying to
3566400	3570560	mutate every nucleotide and see how it reacts.
3570640	3572160	And that's, of course, not feasible right now.
3572720	3574320	And it would be unethical, by the way, also.
3574320	3577680	By the way, yeah, that happens in other podcasts I do.
3577680	3579040	It'd be fun to do certain experiments.
3579040	3580080	You just can't really do it.
3580080	3585040	But one way of saying what you just said a little while ago is that the human genome
3585040	3588080	has not had time to equilibrate in some sense.
3588720	3590320	That is exactly what I say, yeah.
3590320	3590800	Good.
3590800	3594000	So there's plenty of unexplored variation in it.
3594000	3598880	Because I was going to ask, are there sections of the human genome or, for that matter,
3598880	3604400	other advanced genomes where there is some continuity over time?
3604400	3610560	So clearly, this section of the DNA is carrying information, but we don't know what it does.
3611920	3612480	Absolutely.
3613840	3620320	One of my favorite examples is that there are untranslated regions in the genome
3620880	3623040	that seem to be completely conserved.
3624160	3627600	And it goes like it's untranslated, which means no protein is being made.
3628320	3631040	Well, an RNA is actually being made.
3632000	3635440	So in fact, these are long stretches of RNA.
3635440	3638880	And what they do is they can form molecules called ribozymes.
3639760	3643360	And it is a fairly recent discovery that these, in fact, are actually very important
3643360	3645040	in understanding brain function.
3645040	3647680	So there are these long, non-coding RNAs.
3649120	3654160	And remember, DNA has this neutrality in the third position of a codon.
3654160	3660400	So for many of the amino acids, when you mutate the third codon, because every amino acid is
3660400	3663360	encoded by a triplet, you can change it willy-nilly.
3663360	3664800	It doesn't change the amino acid.
3664800	3666800	So there should be neutrality in that position.
3666800	3669280	And you see this throughout the genome.
3669920	3674080	But then you have these non-coding regions where there's no neutrality whatsoever.
3674080	3681600	Well, yes, because if you translate it into an RNA, the ribozyme, there is no codon translation.
3681600	3683280	It's not made from amino acids.
3683280	3685840	So in fact, every nucleotide is important.
3685840	3692400	And that's how it comes that these vast, long, non-coding RNA regions are completely conserved,
3692400	3696320	which means that they carry 100% information or close to that.
3696320	3698160	They're not 100% conserved.
3698160	3704400	But that's because sometimes in these ribozymes, because they're folding into structures,
3704400	3710240	you can make a mutation on one nucleotide as long as you're making the complementary mutation
3710240	3711600	at the corresponding one.
3712400	3716880	But this is a fundamental discovery because it means that these ribozymes
3716880	3723280	that are super important in the survival of the organism, and in fact may explain,
3723280	3730080	so they did this study in brains of flies, that they are super important in controlling
3730080	3733600	mating behavior of the fly, which was previously not understood.
3734400	3736000	And you can't find a protein that does it.
3736000	3739600	Well, it's because done by these RNA sequences.
3739600	3741360	That's actually super interesting.
3741360	3743680	And I'm pretty sure I didn't know this.
3743680	3750160	So the central dogma in molecular biology is that the DNA contains information that gets
3750160	3755120	transcribed into RNA that tells the ribosome, which proteins to make.
3755120	3758000	And what you're saying is that that's not all the DNA does.
3758000	3761760	There's a separate function where parts of it get transcribed into RNA,
3761760	3765600	and then don't make proteins, they make ribozymes instead.
3765600	3767120	And those also play a crucial role.
3768160	3769040	That's absolutely right.
3769040	3772400	So whenever you hear the word dogma, then you're always going like,
3772400	3774720	well, okay, so I'm sure it's not really a dogma.
3774720	3776640	So let's actually look for the violations of it.
3776640	3780880	And that's always a fruitful avenue of investigation.
3780880	3790720	So yeah, in fact, the role that RNAs play in the molecular biology of the cell
3790720	3792080	cannot be underestimated.
3792080	3794000	I mean, these are highly functional molecules.
3794480	3796080	They modify DNA.
3797840	3801440	If you didn't know that, there's a whole bunch of gene editing going on,
3802720	3806240	certainly in single celled eukaryotes.
3806240	3809600	And I talk a little bit about that in my book about the tropanosomes,
3809600	3816640	a fantastic, absolutely stunning story of how these RNAs are ensuring, in a sense,
3816640	3821280	the survival of genetic information that should have died 100 million years ago, in a sense.
3822000	3827520	And so these molecules, they're also regulators.
3827520	3831120	So the RNA molecules, the ribozymes, which are untranslated,
3831120	3834960	are so functionally important that we cannot understand, really,
3834960	3838320	the molecular biology of the cell without their action.
3838320	3839040	Interesting.
3839040	3843200	And that's actually a great segue into the sort of final topic that I wanted to hit here.
3843200	3847120	It would be a shame if we didn't talk about the origin of life.
3847120	3851040	And of course, you know that there's a lot of people who put RNA front and center
3851040	3855200	in that story, but we don't know what the right story is for the origin of life.
3855200	3857120	So how can information theory help us here?
3858160	3866400	Right. So that's a great segue because, in fact, the current thinking is that
3866400	3872080	prior to DNA, we know that DNA and proteins cannot have been at the very origin of life
3872080	3879280	because you need proteins to, in a sense, understand how DNA is acting.
3879280	3882400	And you cannot understand one without the other.
3882400	3888240	So you cannot have this separation between storage material, which is DNA,
3888240	3893360	and machine, which is the proteins, in the origin.
3893360	3897760	Now, it turns out that RNAs, they can store information because really,
3897760	3902240	the RNA nucleotides are cousins of DNA.
3902240	3906800	They just basically have an oxygen compound more.
3907600	3913760	That's why the RNAs are called ribonucleotides and the DNA is called deoxy, namely removed
3915120	3917360	ribonucleotides with an oxygen removed.
3918640	3922960	That difference is actually very important because it affects the stability of the molecule.
3922960	3926640	And of course, if you're going to do information storage, you want to have a stable one,
3926640	3933120	and that's the DNA. However, the RNA molecule, which it's almost like a DNA, but can actually
3933200	3937520	conform in all kinds of different ways, they can play the role of a machine,
3937520	3939680	the ribozymes that we just talked about.
3939680	3944320	So according to the RNA world framework, you're going like,
3944320	3949360	hey, how do you have something where information and machine is one and the same,
3950000	3952640	and that would be the RNA world?
3952640	3959760	So in other words, self-replicating RNA molecules, like where they store information
3959760	3964480	and are folding into the machinery that replicates the information.
3964480	3969760	We, as you correctly pointed out, we don't know if that is the ancestor,
3969760	3974240	because the biochemists tell me that there are some fundamental problems
3975200	3978320	of how this whole stuff could have worked out.
3978320	3981520	And that's a problem in biochemistry, which I'd only likely touch upon in the book
3982320	3984000	because I'm certainly not an expert on that.
3985200	3988160	But the important thing to understand the origin of life
3988160	3990320	is to first understand what life is.
3991040	3996320	And what life is, is basically information, a string of information,
3996320	4001760	or a string that contains information about how to make copies of that information.
4004720	4007200	You might think, oh, but that's not so difficult.
4007200	4008880	I make copies of information all the time.
4008880	4010000	I have a copy machine.
4010000	4012080	It's like, yes, but who built the copy machine?
4013280	4016160	The copy machine isn't some random thing.
4016960	4022240	If you just throw a bunch of piles of metal together,
4022240	4024080	it's not going to form a copy machine.
4024080	4029760	In fact, it takes an enormously complex set of instructions to make that copy machine.
4029760	4032320	So yes, it makes copies, and it's great at doing that.
4032320	4037360	And you could, in fact, make copies of the blueprint of a copy machine.
4038640	4044400	But that copy machine isn't going to make the copy machine from that blueprint.
4044400	4047520	It's not. It makes copies. That's it.
4047520	4054640	But if you had a machine that is, in fact, built from information,
4054640	4058960	and therefore then, once it's crumpled up, in a sense, into this ribosome,
4058960	4063120	then makes copies of the actual information, well, that's life.
4063120	4065200	So life is information that copies itself.
4066560	4070560	But if you just have a little bit of information, it is not going to do that.
4070560	4075120	Because, like I said, to create a machine that can make copies of information,
4075120	4078880	you need a minimum amount. Five bits is not going to do it.
4078880	4080400	Maybe 100 bits is not going to do it.
4080400	4084480	In fact, we don't know what the smallest amount of information is
4087520	4089200	that has a capacity to replicate.
4089200	4093600	You know why? Because we also don't know what the environment is within which
4094480	4095760	this replication happened.
4095760	4099440	Because I told you that the information is really an information about the environment.
4100000	4105760	A string of 100 bits, that's 100 potential information.
4105760	4108880	But depending on the environment, it could be a lot and it could be a little.
4110080	4113760	We don't know a whole lot about the very early Earth,
4114480	4116560	but there could be very many different environments.
4117200	4121840	But what we do know, and I can say that unequivocally, is that there is a minimum
4121840	4126160	about information and that amount of information cannot be obtained by chance
4127120	4128400	under no circumstance.
4128400	4129200	Okay.
4129200	4133360	Right? Well, I should say, mathematically speaking,
4134000	4142880	if the likelihood of finding any of these molecules would be a chance.
4143840	4151840	However, there are in fact mechanisms that could make an avenue where information can
4151920	4156640	actually gradually accumulate without a Darwinian process.
4156640	4159040	This is speculation, but think of it this way.
4160000	4164320	We can imagine a process where a molecule that carries no information,
4164320	4171040	but is in fact a sequence in some alphabet.
4171040	4172960	Let's imagine even it to be an RNA.
4173600	4177440	We can imagine that there is a process by which it can be replicated,
4177520	4182240	but in a sense passively.
4182960	4186000	For example, it could be laying on a clay surface,
4186720	4190800	and then you can basically have a process that will make sure
4190800	4193920	that only complementary bases are being added.
4194720	4198720	Then basically it becomes copied, but there's no information in it.
4198720	4202880	So this copying of information or of a sequence, you're copying entropy really.
4203840	4207920	But now, because the copying machinery is actually in the hardware,
4207920	4214080	not in the software, it's this clay and it's the process of complementation.
4215120	4226000	Now imagine that if in fact the rate of making errors in the complementarity
4226960	4228320	can sort of vary.
4228320	4234560	So it turns out that the speed of this operation of copying varies
4234560	4239520	depending on how many errors you are making in that complementarity.
4239520	4243040	So if for some reason you have something that makes this faster,
4243920	4247120	well that's actually a good thing and you're going to make more of these copies,
4247120	4248800	even though you might think there's no information.
4248800	4255120	But now imagine that what makes this faster, which means makes it more accurate,
4255200	4261360	because you have the same thing, is actually something that is part of that information,
4261360	4263040	that sort of helps and binds.
4263040	4266080	Like something breaks off and then sort of goes like,
4266080	4274720	hey, I'm using that broken-off piece to actually make that process more error-free
4274720	4276160	and therefore faster.
4276160	4280720	What just happened then is that information just seeped into the genome,
4280720	4284880	because remember that piece that broke off is actually one of your own.
4284960	4287040	And you can imagine, but so a process like that,
4287040	4291040	that slowly but surely information about how to do the replication
4291040	4293600	moves from the hardware into the software.
4293600	4297440	It's a non-equilibrium process, but it is at least imaginable,
4298480	4303600	because you have to reach this limit until there's enough information in the sequence
4303600	4307520	that it autonomously replicates without the support of the hardware.
4308160	4311840	That is my sort of imaginary view of the origin of life,
4311840	4314960	but it is a hard thing because you have to reach this limit.
4314960	4316640	Let's say the limit is 200 bits.
4318000	4320640	Only after 200 bits can evolution take hold,
4320640	4324800	which then means I can have the evolutionary process increase this amount of information
4326560	4329840	to infinity, theoretically.
4331120	4334240	But before you have achieved Darwinian evolution,
4334240	4337680	any information that is in the sequence is now highly fragile.
4337680	4344160	It is basically prone to deteriorating due to the second law of thermodynamics.
4344800	4349920	So you basically have to have a process where you are constantly working against this law,
4350560	4356720	but it is because information from the replicative machinery,
4356720	4359600	that the hardware is seeping into your sequence.
4359600	4364320	And if this happens fast enough, you might actually get to this point
4364320	4368080	where Darwinian evolution can take place, and therefore,
4368080	4370880	you separated yourself from the second law of thermodynamics.
4370880	4372960	Okay, good. I actually think I understand that.
4372960	4376160	Let me try to run it by you again and see if I got the right idea.
4377360	4382640	We talked about Maxwell's demon and evolution, and that was pretty clear to me.
4382640	4387680	If you just had a set of genomes and you just acted randomly on them,
4387680	4390640	they would randomly walk through the space of all possible genomes,
4390640	4393680	and the entropy of that distribution would go up.
4393680	4395680	That's the second law of thermodynamics.
4395680	4400400	But you're saying that selection kicks in in the case of evolution,
4400400	4403920	and that basically acts like Maxwell's demon to lower the entropy
4403920	4408560	by sort of nudging all of the genomes towards areas of higher fitness.
4408560	4410880	And that's pretty darn efficient.
4410880	4416880	And you're suggesting that maybe the origin of life was a similar mechanism,
4416960	4421120	not quite the same and not quite as efficient, but something that was a little Maxwell's
4421120	4427200	demon to allow the distribution to become lower entropy until Darwin could kick in.
4428560	4430000	That's exactly right.
4431600	4437040	If you think about this idea that if you're making fewer mistakes in the copying process,
4437040	4442240	that the copying goes faster and you're therefore making more copies,
4442240	4445840	that means that there is a Darwin-y mechanism at work,
4445920	4448160	even though there is no self-replication.
4448160	4453920	But there is replication, but it is replication of non-informative things,
4453920	4457440	which by this mechanism, well, some of the stuff by chance
4457440	4461760	happens to increase your speed of replication, well, those are being maintained.
4462960	4466960	And that's this idea, well, yes, the information about to replicate
4466960	4471440	is in the hardware, not in the software, but it slowly starts seeping in.
4471440	4474800	Slowly or fast, it really depends on the environment that you're in.
4475680	4478720	And of course, we have no glimpse of any of that.
4478720	4482960	Because if you imagine that, you know, let's say it's actually a process that
4482960	4489760	isn't that difficult to achieve, well, wherever it constantly keeps occurring,
4489760	4492400	it would be dwarfed by any form of life that is actually there,
4492400	4494400	that has perfected this for four billion years.
4495280	4499840	So there are these dark smokers and like these underground,
4500080	4503040	what are they called?
4504480	4509200	This pure hydrogen, basically, these underground volcanoes almost.
4509840	4512800	And there is all kinds of interesting bacterial life going on,
4512800	4514800	and who knows what else goes on there.
4514800	4520080	There are some theorists that claim that, yes, these type of environments
4520080	4521760	are perfect for the origin of life.
4522400	4524880	But even if it would be constantly reoccurring there,
4524880	4527600	we wouldn't see it because bacteria have already colonized them.
4528160	4529120	Okay, that is great.
4529120	4531440	That's a very interesting set of ideas.
4531440	4533520	I hope that it's followed up on.
4534800	4538000	But we're near the end of the podcast, so we are allowed to think big now.
4538000	4542480	And it does lead into, I guess, the last question, which is,
4543600	4548320	human beings have developed capacities for manipulating information
4548320	4551600	that didn't exist before human beings came along, right?
4551600	4553440	We can not only think, but we can learn.
4553440	4556080	We can teach in ways that other species don't.
4556080	4560480	We can store information and replicate it in books and on computers and so forth.
4561200	4564960	Is this analogous to the origin of life?
4564960	4569680	Is this another way that information is reproducing itself?
4569680	4573840	Are we seeing a phase transition to a new kind of information phase?
4575600	4576880	I think you're right about that.
4576880	4584080	I mean, just imagine the advance of being able to write down what you have learned
4584160	4587520	so that other people can build upon that.
4587520	4590320	That obviously, in a sense, I'm saying obviously,
4590320	4592640	but maybe that's not obvious to everyone.
4592640	4598320	But obviously, that is the magic power that we have acquired as a human species
4598320	4600640	that no other species has.
4600640	4606960	The best that other species can do is to somehow teach young generations
4606960	4609120	about certain behaviors, hunting behaviors,
4609120	4613680	or maybe even tricks that you can use with rocks and sticks and things like that.
4613680	4618160	But to actually figure out mathematics and write it down into a book
4618160	4622240	and then teach that to other people so that they can, for example,
4622240	4626640	predict the orbit of a planet 100 million years from now.
4627280	4631360	I mean, if that is not mind-boggling, then I don't know what.
4631360	4637040	Now, if you think about it, what we call our ability
4637040	4641280	to make predictions over long distances as far as humans are concerned,
4641280	4643440	in a sense, we call that intelligence, right?
4643440	4649440	We're making intelligent decisions so that we, in a sense, can survive better, right?
4649440	4654240	But in fact, clearly, making predictions about what the environment is tomorrow
4654240	4657280	is going to be an important element in my survival.
4657280	4661040	It was an important element for survival for any hunting species that goes like,
4661040	4666240	oh, I predict that this prey is going to be at this location in about 10 seconds.
4666240	4670240	And if I can make that prediction very accurate, I will catch that prey, right?
4670240	4675040	Now, if you think about intelligence as the temporal radius
4675040	4678560	at which you can make predictions with accuracy better than chance,
4678560	4681840	well, then you realize, well, bacteria make predictions all the time,
4681840	4684480	but they make predictions about the next second, right?
4684480	4687120	Because they're making predictions about where the nutrient is,
4687120	4689840	but that could change very quickly.
4689840	4697120	But for example, this behavior of finding food, chemotaxis,
4697120	4700400	well, that's clearly, in a sense, an intelligent behavior in the sense
4700400	4705200	that it makes certain predictions that are going to come true or not within a second or so.
4706240	4712480	But other animals, for example, let's say chipmunks, they make predictions about,
4712480	4716400	well, the next season will be such that there will be winter,
4716400	4719280	so I may have to actually store some food, right?
4719280	4722080	But we as humans, by having developed writing systems,
4722080	4726000	by having developed mathematics, can now make predictions in time
4726000	4730000	over a far, far longer period that are accurate better than chance.
4730000	4732720	The fact that we are talking about global warming
4732720	4739040	and how that could affect us as a species is an obvious intelligent concept
4739040	4743440	because we have understood that if we don't do anything,
4743440	4745600	then we might be in big, big trouble, right?
4745600	4749280	That is making predictions in a time scale far removed
4749280	4752560	of our day-to-day activity, right?
4753520	4757360	And our brain does that, but our brain, of course, has been doing this
4757360	4760640	before we had figured out writing systems, right?
4760640	4765840	But now the conjunction of our brain, where information during a lifetime is stored,
4765840	4768480	and then we can make it permanent in books,
4768480	4773200	that is the real secret sauce to the success of this species, as far as I'm concerned.
4773200	4778320	Well, we'll see whether or not we have the collective strength of will
4778320	4781280	to actually act on these predictions that we're making or not.
4781280	4783760	Yeah, that's right. Of course, that's the big political question.
4783760	4786800	Unfortunately, it is a political one and not a mathematical one.
4786800	4788800	The mathematical one is very obvious.
4788800	4791360	Good. That helps us a little bit.
4791360	4794160	Chris and Tommy, thanks so much for being on the Mindscape Podcast.
4794160	4796240	It was really my pleasure. Thank you, Sean.
