0	3680	Hello everybody and welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll
3680	9080	And this is going to be one of those podcast episodes that people have been clamoring for for a long time
9080	13400	I get a lot of suggestions and a lot of people suggest the same guest over and over again
13840	18240	Sometimes I ignore the people, you know, I love the people, but I don't always agree with them other times
18240	21480	I think you know what the people are right and in this case
21480	29000	I think that they are so I invited Stephen Wolfram to be on the podcast now Stephen Wolfram was a physics prodigy at a
29000	36360	young age one of the youngest winners of the MacArthur genius grant started out in particle physics before he moved to think about
37000	39000	complexity and cellular automata
39440	43800	Maybe best known right now for inventing the Mathematica
44120	48400	programming language and analysis system as well as the underlying Wolfram
48920	52480	Language that was used to write it and Wolfram Alfa answer engine
52480	56560	I use Mathematica all the time many people in my field use Mathematica
56680	62280	But he's also still interested in fundamental physics a few years ago some years ago
62400	67200	He wrote a big book called a new kind of science where he suggested that cellular automata
67320	74120	Might give a clue as to different ways of thinking about all sorts of science right biology economics as well as physics
74400	78640	More recently he has launched what is called the Wolfram physics project
78680	86000	Which is simply an effort to start with almost nothing and get the fundamental laws of physics out of them
86080	92240	Now there's a lot to say about this and we don't say everything in this podcast even though it's a long one
92240	94740	I wanted to focus the podcast on
95280	100480	giving a sketch for what the main ideas are of the Wolfram physics project and
101000	105920	How they are not yet fully developed but might be developed going down the line
105960	113120	There were a lot of criticisms and some kudos about how he developed it sort of outside the mainstream
113800	121400	Physics research and so forth and then you know late on us hundreds of pages of work with he and his collaborators at the same time
121400	125080	And you know, it's not the mainstream of theoretical physics
125080	128920	Most physicists who are doing their own thing did not drop everything to work on it
128920	132640	But some became interested and they're inviting people to help out
133160	137240	So you'll learn a lot in this podcast not about I'm not gonna talk about you know
137240	142960	How the research was done or the fact that it was uploaded and shared with the world or whatever you can draw your own conclusions
143120	147040	about that I care about the substance of the actual ideas and
147560	151520	Mostly I'm giving Steven here the opportunity to explain those ideas
151520	157480	But there is a family resemblance between what he's trying to do and what I and my collaborators are trying to do in
158000	164520	Quantum mechanics stuff like that. So let me very briefly tell you what I how I see that relationship
164880	167480	What we're trying to do is to start with the
167920	174080	Simplest most stripped-down version of the best theory we currently understand namely quantum mechanics, right?
174160	181400	To start from almost nothing but quantum mechanics and see how things like space and time and matter and energy
181840	183840	Emerge from that fundamental description
184440	190720	Steven Wolfram and his friends are trying to be way more ambitious than that. They're starting with a kind of
191360	195000	automata a kind of discrete system called a hypergraph and
195520	197320	generalizations thereof and
197400	202680	Basically, you have a guess as to what the rules are for how hypergraphs are updated
202680	208200	And the point that they're trying to make is that some guesses lead to things that kind of look like the real world
208520	215640	So the hope is that eventually we find specific guesses for what those update rules could be that actually get us the
215640	221000	Specific real world or very very close to it. My own attitude is you know, good luck to them
221160	227160	I'm very much in favor of lots of different approaches to fundamental physics. This is one of them
227320	233680	Great let a thousand flowers bloom, etc. I actually think that our my and my collaborators
234400	239920	Approach is more promising because it leans heavily on something we already understand quite well
239920	244600	Which is quantum mechanics as I see it if the Wolfram physics project works
245000	250080	They're first going to have to find quantum mechanics in exactly the right way and then
250440	252960	Find all of the features that we have about the real world
252960	256800	So it's kind of a precursor to what I'm trying to do, etc
256960	258640	But you know, I might be wrong about that
258640	262880	It could be that this particular way of doing things leads to not just quantum mechanics
263120	269440	But a specific implementation of quantum mechanics that gives us other clues to understand the nature of space and time, etc
269600	273760	So as I said what we're trying to do here in this podcast is help you the listener
274240	278880	Actually understand what the ideas are and where they're going. Hopefully we succeed in that
279520	282640	Let me very briefly take an opportunity to as I occasionally do
283040	286240	Remind you that we have resources for the mindscape podcast
286560	290640	We have a web page proposterous universe.com slash podcast

332160	338000	Choose to donate just a little bit. It's the thought that really does count in this case. So with all that let's go
341520	343520	You
355680	357680	Stephen wool from welcome to the mindscape podcast
358000	358960	Hello
358960	365280	So it's been a little over a year I guess since you announced your physics project and I think I finally
366000	367440	By no means have become an expert
367440	373920	But at least I know enough about it to ask a whole bunch of ignorant questions to help us all understand it a little bit better
374960	376560	I mean maybe to start off
376560	382960	Is this do you consider this current project be a continuation of the cellular automata type of stuff?
382960	386960	You did in your book a new kind of science or is it a new branch somehow?
387920	392640	Yeah, so I mean it builds on basically a tower of ideas technology
393360	394960	intuition and so on
394960	396000	that
396000	399840	Uh, actually, I'm sort of amazed we've managed to get to the point we've managed to get to
400240	404080	But all those previous pieces seem to be necessary to get to where we are
404640	410000	And for example, you know, I studied a lot in new kind of science 20 years ago. I studied a lot
410800	413680	cellular automata, which are these very simple programs with
414320	419120	You know arrays of black and white squares and so on and from studying those things
419280	423680	I developed both a bunch of intuition about how sort of things work in the computational universe
424240	427760	And I managed to figure out some fairly general principles
427840	432960	Which we've been able to get more and more evidence for which are necessary to kind of launch into
433360	436880	Figuring out things about physics now when I wrote new kind of science, you know
436960	442720	It has 12 chapters and one of those chapters was called fundamental physics and it had two sections
442800	447760	One was about thermodynamics and one was about kind of the fundamental underlying theory of physics
448160	451600	And for me at the time I viewed it as being an incomplete
452480	457040	potential application of the general kinds of ideas that I was developing a new kind of science
457520	462880	And I had a bunch of specific ideas about thinking about space as a network
463280	465440	Thinking about the way time would operate and so on
466240	472480	I was very pleased with the fact that I had managed to get a fair distance in deriving general activity from that kind of
472800	478160	Theory of gravity from that kind of approach. I was not satisfied with where I had got with quantum mechanics
478880	481280	And you know that project so so now
481920	484640	restarting that project nearly 20 years later
485760	489440	with energetic young physicists and so on and
490320	496720	One kind of initially rather technical new idea that kind of made the model just seem much cleaner to me
497360	503920	It was kind of it's been a new development and and really now I've seen a lot of things that I say to myself
504160	506400	I should have been able to figure that out 25 years ago
506880	512320	Welcome to the club. That's that that does not distinguish you from anyone else working on science, right? Yeah, you always look back
513120	513760	with that
513760	519920	No, I think I think what's what's so I view it as being what what's really neat is that the formalism that we've now got
520640	524560	Is something which was sort of there were precursors of it a new kind of science
525120	528400	But the full sort of story of it is just emerging now
528960	533200	And it's really neat because it really it gives one sort of a to me
533200	536880	There's sort of this way of understanding things in terms of how simple programs behave
537120	539920	Developed a bunch of intuition a new kind of science now
539920	546240	There's a whole another level of intuition and results that we're getting that provide in the sort of formalism for this project
546320	551280	And that's so it's it's both applicable to fundamental physics and to a bunch of other things
551520	553200	And I'm I'm pretty excited about that
553360	556560	So let's imagine that first I'm sure this is not true
556560	560800	But let's imagine that there's going to be a listener who only listens to the first few minutes of this podcast
560800	564080	And we want to let them have a takeaway for what is going on here
564080	569280	I mean is it accurate my vague impression to say that the cellular automata
570160	576480	Had a grid right like you had some checkerboard or something like that and some rules for updating them and some discrete model
576560	579600	Which you're going to hope that if you squint and look at very far away
579600	583680	It looks like physics whereas here you still have a discrete set of models
583760	588080	But you're not starting with a fixed grid. You're kind of building things up by rules as you go
588720	594720	Right. Yeah, that's right. I mean, I never thought that that cellular automata would be relevant to fundamental physics
595040	598640	I mean other people were sort of saying cellular automata are going to solve fundamental physics
598960	602000	And I was like, no, please don't say that that's just not going to work
602640	609840	And you know cellular automata are very minimal models once you have a fixed notion of space and time
610320	615920	And they've been extremely fertile models for huge numbers of different kinds of things from, you know, road traffic flow
616240	620480	To chemical catalysis to you know leaf growth all kinds of different things
620880	625920	But they assume a pre-existing notion of space and time and so in thinking about physics
626320	632560	I had realized ages ago that we really need to go underneath the notions of space and time that we're familiar with
632960	635440	And see how to build those up from something more fundamental
635680	641840	And so sort of the real starting point of our project is to think about just these that they're just
642240	647520	Space is made of something that's not that has not been sort of in the tradition of physics
648000	650000	And the traditional mathematics as well
650000	654800	That's not really been a thing that people think about space just is a is is something in which
655360	657680	Things are placed at certain positions and so on
658160	663040	And so, you know in this and it's kind of like what people might have thought about a fluid like water
663440	666720	It's just water. It's just flows. It does all these kinds of things
666800	672560	But you know 150 years ago we found out no those greeks were actually right some of those greeks were right
672960	676960	It's made of discrete molecules bouncing around and with space
677520	683520	We haven't yet sort of made that definitive leap and one of the sort of starting points of this project
683920	687200	Is to think space is made of something. What's it made of?
687520	692880	It's just made of these disembodied discrete points and each point is just an abstract element
692880	697040	It doesn't it doesn't have a position. There's nothing. It's just this element
697600	701040	And then what we say is what all we know about those elements
701520	703520	Is how they're related to other elements
704000	705920	How they're effectively connected to other elements
705920	710960	So it's like you think about all these points in space all they have is a friend network, so to speak
711280	715120	They don't know where they are. They just know who their friends are so to speak
715600	722560	And so the you know the first big sort of realization is from something as unstructured as that
723280	729600	By looking at that on a large enough scale. It's kind of like how you know continuous fluids emerge from lots of discrete molecules
729680	731120	Underneath bouncing around
731120	736800	There's a there's a notion of a kind of continuous like space that can emerge when you look at that on a large scale
737280	740400	And that's that's kind of the you know, that's that's one starting point
740400	744800	I mean another important thing to realize is that in our setup
745520	747520	The only thing in the universe is space
748480	750480	And there's no
750640	755280	You know, we're not saying space is a background and there are things placed in space
755840	759040	We're saying everything in the universe is just kind of made of space
760160	766480	So what I have in mind is a bunch of dots you write nodes that are connected by lines to form some kind of graph
767040	767920	and
767920	772800	Do I imagine that the line that the dots rather the nodes are they labeled?
772880	777840	Do they come are there different kinds of dots or is there just a an ur.ness that they all share
778960	781840	It's an ur dot. Okay. That's just all identical
781920	784880	the only thing the only thing about them is
785600	792320	They are two dots are either identical or they're not identical. That is there's there's a there's a particular dot
792720	798400	Or there's another dot and so the only the only thing about them is is kind of their their
799360	801920	You know their identity so to speak they don't have
802720	806080	They don't have colors. They don't have they don't have positions
806480	809920	They just know i'm this dot and not that other dot right
810000	814960	So there's some dots and there's some lines. They make a graph or a hypergraph, I guess and there's a rule
815040	818720	There's a rule for updating to go from one collection of dots and lines to
819200	822320	The next one and then we just iterate that forever, I suppose
822800	825840	That's right and the whole universe comes out of that. That's very nice
826560	831600	That that that's the idea. So, I mean, you know, there are many pieces to that setup
831680	837760	For example, one thing is all there is is these kind of atoms of space and connections
838320	843760	There's nothing in space. There's nothing. It's not like you then say we've got space now. Let's put
844480	850080	A an electron in space if you want an electron you have to make it out of space so to speak
850320	855760	You have to make it from features of that pattern of connections between the atoms of space
856320	858400	So that's kind of the that's that's sort of the
859120	862240	The base story of what what is the data structure of the universe?
862320	868000	What is the universe sort of made of and that's the idea it's made of these discrete elements
868560	873600	And relations between those elements which we can think of as being kind of lines joining them
873920	878080	It's actually convenient and this was the sort of technical innovation of a couple of years ago
878400	883520	To realize that the best way to think about this is in terms of a so-called hypergraph
884000	886320	Where we just have elements and relations
886960	893440	In a graph you have you have nodes and you have edges connecting those nodes and each edge connects two nodes
893760	897520	In a hypergraph you can have any number of nodes involved in a hyper edge
897840	900640	And that sounds like a it is really a technical detail
900880	906480	But it makes the whole model much much easier to deal with or at least I thought it made it
906480	911280	Much easier to deal with in the end it doesn't make much of a difference and I could have figured this out 25 years ago
911680	914720	But that's that's that's the that's the way these things work
914800	918320	It it seemed to make it easier technically to make forward progress
918880	921840	But I think you were you were then talking about sort of what do these
922320	927920	What do these atoms of space do and you're describing kind of the rules that they use to get updated?
928480	934080	And um, yeah, you're right. I mean the the basic idea is you look at the local structure of this graph
934800	939680	And you say whenever the local structure of this graph looks like this particular pattern
940080	944720	Then it should be updated to be a local piece of graph that looks different, right?
945200	947200	And that's the whole story
948400	950400	Some things are just better at home
950560	954640	You can pause the movie whenever you want you can have two desserts and no one will judge you
955040	961440	An exercise is one of those things peloton delivers a workout experience that you'd never imagine was possible
961840	963840	Right in your own home one of the things
963840	969200	I especially like about peloton is the variety of classes driven by different kinds of instructors
969600	972880	If you're the kind of person who needs to be encouraged by your instructor
973120	978800	Robin Arzon is especially good at that whereas if you just want to get down to business and get the workout in
978960	981200	Adrian Williams might be the instructor for you
981440	987440	Whatever your mood or overall fitness goal you can mix and match classes for a total body workout experience
987760	992880	Choose from cardio strength yoga pilates outdoor runs meditation and more
993440	996080	With the peloton bike, there's nothing like working out from home

1004560	1010560	Slash app terms apply. That's o-n-e-p-e-l-o-t-o-n.com
1012240	1015920	I like I like the fact that you just use the word hypergraph because I like to
1016080	1020560	Share the jargon with the audience so they can go look it up because especially I mean I should note you
1021760	1026560	I don't want to talk too much about like style and procedure here because there's far too much physics to talk about
1026640	1031120	but you did announce this project with a website and a call to
1032160	1037120	Participate right if people want to dig into the details. What is the url? They should be going to
1038080	1044240	Well from physics.org there you go and and people can find out what the details are and do their own calculations
1044240	1047760	So that's that's yeah. I mean the other thing we've done kind of in terms of the public
1047840	1053120	Which has been really a big success is we've we've live streamed a lot of our internal working meetings
1053600	1057360	And we've you know all the notes from this project are all
1057760	1064480	You know posted on the web basically the the day after they're made typically and that's some and and it's been really
1064800	1069280	Interesting because a lot of people who are you know a lot of professional physicists have gotten involved
1069280	1071840	But also a lot of people who are for example
1072240	1075520	Involved in computer kinds of things and understand
1076000	1081360	Sometimes more of some of our jargon than the physicists would understand have also gotten involved
1081520	1087440	And it's it's really been an interesting process to sort of do science live and in public so to speak
1088320	1090320	it's you know and I
1090400	1092400	the it's like
1092400	1097680	It it's a good kind of generator of reality because you know we say some things that are right
1097680	1104240	We say some things that are wrong it kind of a a place where you can get to see kind of the process really happened
1104640	1108560	And there is something that is very different about what you're trying to do in terms of fundamental physics
1108720	1111280	I would I would argue and then correct me if i'm wrong
1112000	1116160	Usually not always but usually physicists work from the phenomena
1116800	1121680	To try to come up with an explanation right like there are stars in the sky. They're planets moving in certain orbits
1121760	1124240	What can we do about that? There's an apple falling from a tree
1124640	1129280	But in some sense you're just saying well here is the simplest possible thing that physics could be
1129840	1133440	Let's just see if we can guess the right one. Is that more or less accurate?
1133680	1137680	Yeah, I mean it is closer to that than the reverse engineering approach
1137760	1141760	and in fact when I see people try to sort of understand what we're doing and
1142320	1147680	Sort of say well, what about doing this and that and the other the great tendency is to try to reverse engineer
1148000	1151360	And this was a thing that that I kind of uh, you know, I as
1151840	1157840	You know, I used to do sort of mainstream standard physics back in the late 1970s early 1980s
1158400	1161040	And you know, that was what one did in those days
1161440	1163840	And the thing that was really for me very liberating
1164400	1170080	Was when I started studying well, I got interested in how the complex phenomena occur in the natural world
1170640	1175200	And the question was what are the right models to study that and my initial thought was
1175440	1179360	Let's use all the fancy stuff from physics all those differential equations and all these kinds of things
1179680	1181680	I tried doing that total failure
1181920	1187360	So I said, let's step back and see, you know, is there an alternative approach to modeling that we can use
1187760	1194880	And I had the very fortunate experience that I had been working as a practical matter on building my first computer language
1195520	1197760	as a forerunner of mathematics or more from language
1198560	1200560	This was back in 1979 1980
1201120	1205360	And what one does when one builds a computer language is one saying
1205600	1211280	Let's take all these computations people might want to do and let's in a kind of natural science type way drill down
1211360	1215360	And try and find out what are the primitives from which we can build up all these computations
1215680	1219440	What are the kind of atoms of computation and then build up from there?
1219760	1224720	And the thing that's really interesting about that process is you're just making up these atoms of computation
1224880	1230000	It's not like, you know, it's not really the same kind of oh, we've also we've got to make sure we get
1230240	1232640	You know, einstein's equations here. We've got to do this and this
1232880	1236640	You're just making it up and you're hoping that it will be in that case useful to people
1237040	1243520	And so that experience got me into this idea of just figure out the most minimal model and see what it does
1243920	1247600	And that's what I did with cellular automata and it worked great in that case
1248080	1250080	So in a sense with physics
1250160	1254320	What I was trying to do with this project is find
1254880	1258000	The most structuralist model of structure in the universe
1258720	1260720	because that was and
1260800	1264720	And it is not it is by no means self-evident that that will work
1265200	1272240	I mean, that's sort of the ultimate Occam's razor type idea is you know, just make it, you know, absolutely minimal
1272800	1275600	Now the thing that's really neat and maybe we'll talk about this a bunch later
1276080	1278400	Is that now that we have this foundation
1278400	1281920	We can start to see how a lot of ideas that people have had in mathematical physics
1282320	1287680	Over the last many decades actually plug into this idea and both inform it
1287920	1293440	And help make those other ideas more more, you know founded and it's it's I think come
1294720	1298480	So so this this notion which basically
1299360	1302640	You know this idea of find the simplest primitives and then see what they do
1303280	1306800	This is what I get for having spent 40 years being a computational language designer
1307040	1312480	This is what that's what that's what that involves and it's different from what people do traditionally
1313040	1319760	In sort of reductionistic science where you say start from the phenomena and then say how do I get this phenomenon?
1320400	1321440	right and
1321440	1323680	I do want to it's a somewhat different methodology
1323760	1328000	I do want to definitely get to how we recover all of known physics or at least you know
1328560	1330640	Move in the direction of recovering all of known physics
1330640	1334000	But there also seems to be like a couple of deep principles
1334640	1338240	That you have in mind when you're working on this stuff that maybe it's worth sharing
1338240	1341920	I mean one of them is this idea of computational equivalence, right?
1342720	1345680	I could try to gloss it, but why don't you tell the audience what that means?
1346560	1348560	Yeah, yeah, right so
1348560	1353600	You know you set up some simple program you run it you see what it does
1354560	1357920	You might think if it's a simple program it will always do simple things
1358640	1360640	That turns out to not be true
1360640	1363280	That's sort of the big thing that I discovered in the early 1980s
1363760	1365760	That for several years
1366160	1370960	I kind of resisted that conclusion and eventually realized that is really the way things are
1371360	1374320	When you look in the sort of computational universe of possible programs
1374560	1376560	If you just sort of pick a program at random
1377040	1380400	Even though the program may be very simple its behavior may be very complicated
1380720	1385520	Programs that we typically build as humans for some particular known purpose
1386000	1390320	Will tend to not have that feature because we want to have them achieve the particular purpose
1390400	1394000	We want them to achieve which is one some purpose that we can describe
1394320	1399600	And so you avoid this thing that the simple programs producing complicated behavior
1400000	1402960	That idea of simple programs producing complicated behavior
1403360	1408320	I think is sort of the essence of the secret that nature uses to make complicated stuff
1408960	1412720	And that's why you know we look around in nature. We steal this complicated stuff
1412800	1415200	We say how could it possibly make all this complicated stuff?
1415600	1420320	That's just the formal fact about what happens in the universe of possible programs
1420320	1424880	So first thing is is the realization simple program doesn't necessarily have to have simple behavior
1425360	1428240	And then the next question is okay, so you see this very complicated behavior
1428480	1431680	How do you characterize it? You could just say oh, it's very complicated
1432080	1438160	And in fact a lot of the you know people had seen these phenomena for centuries actually of you know
1438400	1440960	Fairly simple setups like you know the digits of pi
1441600	1444400	Specifying them is quite easy yet once you've generated the digits
1444720	1448960	They seem completely random and people would typically say oh, it's very complicated
1449200	1452640	There's not much we can say about that and they would try to find you know
1452880	1454800	Like the distribution of prime numbers or something
1454880	1460720	They work for a long time to try and figure out what regularity can be teased out of this thing that seems quite random
1461200	1467200	And so what I was interested in was trying to understand how do we characterize this complexity that gets generated
1467760	1472320	And so the thing that I realized is the way you can think about what's happening is
1472880	1477520	Any process of generating some pattern for example you can think of as a computation
1478160	1481360	And then the question is how sophisticated is that computation?
1482000	1486400	So for example, it might be that computation is just like adding numbers together
1486720	1490720	It's something very simple or that computation is something more sophisticated
1491120	1496480	And the question is can you kind of can you rate the sort of sophistication of computations?
1497040	1502400	And so the big discovery of the 1930s and so on was that you might have thought
1502800	1506800	Every different kind of computation you want to do you'd need a different machine to do it
1507280	1510720	But then with Turing machines and combinators and a bunch of other ideas
1511120	1516240	This notion of universal computation arose that says you can just have one piece of hardware
1516480	1519440	You just feed it different programs and it can do different things
1519920	1524960	And you know, that's been a that's been a pretty centrally important idea in the technology of the last 15 years
1525280	1529680	You know, that's the origin of software the sort of developments of the computer revolution
1530080	1536320	But in for science the implication there is well, perhaps these simple programs
1536800	1539520	Might actually be for example computation universal
1539520	1542480	They might be able to do essentially any computation you want
1542560	1547360	So this principle of computational equivalence of mine is basically the the idea that
1547920	1552720	When you pick a program if the program doesn't do something obviously simple
1553600	1559360	It will be doing a computation that is as sophisticated as the computations that anything can do
1559840	1565200	So in other words, what that's saying is, you know, you might think you start off with an incredibly trivial program
1565280	1568960	And only those trivial computations as you make the program a little bit more complicated
1568960	1572000	It would gradually do more and more sophisticated computations
1572240	1574640	And as you make a really really really complicated program
1574880	1576880	It would do really really complicated computations
1577200	1582880	But the the the somewhat surprising claim of the principle of computational equivalence is that that's not true
1583280	1585520	Once you get above some very low threshold
1585920	1590240	You're immediately at the max you're immediately doing computations that are as sophisticated as anything
1590800	1595200	And that that principle, I mean that has that principle has many implications
1595760	1601520	And um, I mean probably the most important for for immediately for physics is this phenomenon
1601520	1605360	I call computational irreducibility. That was the next one. So go ahead and say that yeah
1606720	1608720	right, so so I mean the um
1609520	1611360	You know the question there is
1611360	1614560	If you are running a program, can you tell what it will do?
1615120	1619840	One way you can tell what it will do is you just run every step just like the program would run itself
1620240	1623520	But another thing you can do is say I'm much smarter than that program
1623840	1627040	I can jump ahead and it's going to run for a million steps
1627040	1631040	But I can just jump to the end and say the answer is going to be 42 or something
1631520	1632960	and so
1632960	1634960	You know one of the ideas of
1635280	1638960	Of sort of the exact sciences the mathematical scientists for a long time has been
1639280	1643280	Sort of a sign of doing wonderful things is that you can jump ahead like that
1643280	1648800	You can make you can readily predict, you know, where will the planets be at some time in the future and so on
1649360	1658000	But so that's that's what I call computational reducibility the ability to reduce the computational effort necessary to find the answer to jump ahead
1658560	1660240	So the claim is
1660240	1665760	Actually, there are lots of systems that are computationally irreducible in the sense the only way to find out what they'll do
1666240	1670160	Is just to run every step or in effect just to observe what the system does
1670640	1675840	And the reason that happens is because the principle of computational equivalence because if you think
1676240	1678240	You're the observer you're the predictor
1678880	1681440	You are you are a computational system as well
1682000	1686400	And the question is how do you as a computational system compete with the system?
1686400	1687760	You're trying to predict
1687760	1691280	So if it was the case that you could really be smarter than the system you're trying to predict
1691840	1693840	Then yes, you could potentially jump ahead
1693920	1698080	But what the principle of computational equivalent says is no actually that won't be that way
1698400	1702320	You will be exactly computational equivalent to the system. You're trying to predict
1702640	1704640	And so the system you're trying to predict
1704720	1710800	Its behavior will seem to you sort of irreducibly complicated. So that's that's one of its implications
1711040	1716560	So in some sense, this is saying, you know, both of these principles the equivalence and the irreducibility
1718240	1722320	There are computers as we've known since touring that are universal computers
1722320	1727760	They can calculate any function you want to calculate and what you're saying is in the space of all computers computations
1728720	1734080	Computations with that capacity are generic in some sense. They're all over the place
1734080	1740800	They're much easier to find than you might have thought and there's no way to simplify the the typical one into a something that you can just leap ahead
1741920	1743920	Right. I mean principle of computational equivalence
1744720	1748960	One of its predictions in effect is that universal computation will be ubiquitous
1749360	1756480	It actually goes considerably further than that because at a technical level one of the things that one talks about in universal computation is
1756800	1760960	It is possible to program this system to do whatever computation you want
1761360	1766720	It's a little bit of a different statement to say if you are presented with this system and it is fed
1767360	1769360	Even this very simple program
1769520	1773520	Then it will already do something complicated. So it's a couple a couple of additional steps
1773520	1778640	But one of the one of the key predictions is computation universality is ubiquitous
1779280	1784320	And that that has many implications. I mean it has implications in terms of the practicalities of building computers
1784640	1789280	It has implications in terms of what aspects of physics we can expect to understand
1789680	1794960	It has implications at a more philosophical level about things like free will and so on which maybe we'll talk about
1795200	1799920	Well, and one of the implications is that it it if we buy into the philosophy of it
1800000	1805360	It gives us some optimism for this program of starting program in the human sense
1805360	1811760	Not the computer sense for this project of starting with some very very simple rules and getting the actual universe out
1811840	1815680	Right if all sufficiently complicated computations are at the same level of
1816560	1818320	Ability in some sense
1818320	1821120	Yes, that's true. I mean one of the things that is sort of a key
1822240	1826720	I would you could even say prediction statement of our physics project is
1827520	1832480	What can be done in our universe is just computation and not hyper computation
1832960	1836480	That is it's the kind of computation that can be done by a Turing machine
1836960	1841680	It's not the kind of computation that can be done by a thing that is infinitely more powerful than a Turing machine
1841920	1844400	Right that you can conceptually imagine
1844880	1849680	But you can't uh, you know the claim is no such thing exists in our universe
1850240	1852400	And in fact you can get a bit more technical about it
1852800	1856480	And the the claim of these models is even if it exists
1857120	1861040	It will be hidden by behind a cosmological event horizon from us
1861760	1863600	Um, we will never be able to observe it
1864000	1865840	So it's kind of like well, you can say it exists
1865840	1869840	So you can say it doesn't exist doesn't really matter because we'll never be able to interact with it
1870160	1874800	But so, you know, that's one of the the key statements. Yes, and and the idea that
1875360	1877680	That it's sufficient to have something
1878400	1884880	That is a simple a computational system that we humans can kind of understand how it's constructed like a Turing machine
1885120	1888880	Or like one of these hypergraph rewriting systems that is a you know
1889120	1891520	That's a that's a supposition of this project
1891920	1897600	And it's a supposition that in a sense is is sort of encouraging for us humans that that it might be the case
1897680	1901920	There's something we can kind of hold in our hands that represents everything the universe does
1902480	1907440	Even if the implications of that thing we can hold in our hands are irreducibly complex
1907840	1912720	And even if we couldn't tell, you know, given that you give us the rules for the universe
1913120	1918000	If you say can I make a warp drive the answer might be it's really hard to tell
1918240	1921360	It's an irreducibly complicated thing. Yeah, it's like, you know
1921680	1928160	Recapitulating the whole history of mathematics and so on to get to the point, you know, can we prove this theorem that there is or isn't a warp drive?
1929200	1930640	so it's
1930640	1932640	but but to me that's yes that that that's
1934160	1939520	That's that's the concept. I'll take all the reasons for optimism I can get I'm all on board with that so so good
1939600	1943840	So with those in mind, I mean, let's go back to the physics that you're actually constructing here
1943840	1945200	We have a hypergraph
1945200	1947600	We have some rules for updating it now
1947840	1949840	Should I read the specific
1950160	1957120	Is it is the idea that there is a specific correct rule for our universe and that rule basically is the fundamental laws of physics?
1958560	1963520	Okay, so this this is where things get a little bit more complicated. Yeah, so I think
1964160	1970000	That it is probably the case that there will be a rule that we'll be able to hold up and say
1970560	1973840	With this rule, we can reproduce what we observe in physics
1974480	1981520	Now footnote, which is really interesting footnote. I think you might say why did we get this rule and not another rule?
1981920	1984480	You know, it seems very particularly if the rule is simple
1984800	1990320	That's like, you know, Copernicus was wrong. So to speak, you know, there isn't nothing special about us
1990720	1994480	We got the simple universe so to speak or we got the universe with the simple rule
1994800	1998320	Not the universe with the to us incredibly complicated seeming rule
1998720	2001600	So the the thing that is then very surprising
2002080	2008000	Is that and and this is you know, we probably have to go a few more steps before we can really really dig into this properly
2008400	2010880	Is the idea that actually you can think of the universe
2011760	2013760	as running all possible rules
2014320	2020800	And we as observers of the universe are essentially exist in a particular in a sense reference frame
2021360	2024640	In a particular position in rural space as we call it
2025280	2031440	That essentially gives us a particular sampling of this sort of universal possible universities
2031920	2039440	And that particular sampling has is is given our way of parsing what happens in the universe
2040320	2044160	That is something that we could attribute to a particular underlying rule
2044560	2047120	But actually we can also think of it as just a slice
2047840	2050240	Of this kind of universal or possible universities
2050640	2054800	So it's a it a little bit more but but I think you know, operationally
2055280	2057920	I would hope that we will be able to
2058560	2063520	Produce a rule that will have the property that if we work out all its consequences
2063920	2070080	And we cannot because remember one of the very tricky things is we as observers of the universe are embedded in this universe
2070960	2075520	And so as you change that underlying rule, you not only change the rule for the universe
2075840	2077840	You also change the rule for us
2078240	2080960	And so that those two effects
2081520	2087680	In some very very vague sense cancel each other out so that there is a large class of
2088240	2090240	rules for the universe and rules for us
2090720	2092720	Which all seem the same
2092720	2095680	And which which all have the same laws of physics effectively
2096160	2099680	So to give an analogy to make this a little bit less less bizarre
2100160	2103920	The you know, so let's go back to fluid dynamics, for example
2104400	2109120	And you know, we have the laws of fluid dynamics there the navier stokes equations all these kinds of things
2109760	2111760	And you might say, how do we derive these?
2111920	2113920	Underneath there are a bunch of molecules bouncing around
2114320	2118720	Well, there can be water molecules which have their particular, you know, h2o form
2118960	2122480	There can be you know air molecules there, you know, n2 or whatever it is
2123040	2125840	These different kinds of molecules bouncing around
2126320	2131040	All of their physics is quite different all the details of what happens when those molecules collide is quite different
2131280	2136000	Yet on a large scale the laws of fluid dynamics are the same for air and for water
2136000	2138640	They have some different parameters, but they're basically the same laws
2139040	2144720	And it's the same kind of thing that I think happens in the derivation of laws of physics
2145120	2148880	That is certain aspects of the laws of physics are quite generic
2149280	2152400	I think general relativity and quantum mechanics are quite generic
2152880	2157680	And they are things which if you are an observer even vaguely like us
2158320	2160320	They are inevitable that you will observe
2160480	2165600	And if you want to home in on well, do we have the fine structure constant where the particular value it has
2166080	2169920	You probably have to home in on more features of us as observers
2170320	2176560	Right. I mean, do you think that do you anticipate that at some step in understanding the relationship between these rules and our universe
2176960	2181680	There will be an anthropic move of some sort where you say there's a lot of things going on
2181760	2184880	But intelligent observers will only observe this subset of things
2185840	2187840	Intelligent observers, no
2188400	2192880	Observers with so the question is what is the right idealization of the human observer, right?
2193280	2195280	So I'll give you a couple that
2196320	2201520	That seem to be enough. Okay. So one important one is we're computationally bounded
2202160	2206720	We don't get to observe. So let's take the gas molecule example again
2207360	2210960	If if you are, you know, you have this gas has got a bunch of molecules bouncing around
2211200	2216720	If you're a sophisticated enough observer, you can see every single molecule you can work out all the collisions
2217360	2223200	And in particular that will allow you. So, you know, a big principle of statistical mechanics is second law of thermodynamics
2223600	2230000	Which says, you know, typically the the sort of typically things get more random as the molecules bounce around in a gas
2230480	2234080	But if we are not computationally bounded observers and we can
2234560	2237520	You know, we can figure out what all these trajectories of all these molecules are
2237760	2242160	We don't get the second law of thermodynamics as non computationally bounded observers
2242320	2244320	The second law of thermodynamics simply isn't true
2244800	2250400	And so the first and that same idea of a computationally bounded observer is necessary
2250480	2256320	I think for us to believe that space has a continuous structure and various other things about the universe
2256560	2259120	So that's kind of step one. So we're not Laplace's demon
2260160	2262160	What's that? Sorry. We're not Laplace's demon
2263040	2268000	That is correct. We're not we're not Laplace. We're not Maxwell's demon. We're we're um
2268720	2272160	We are we are we are thoroughly non-demonic in that sense
2272480	2277840	And finite and bound we only have this sort of bounded ability to understand to look at the details of the universe
2278160	2282960	That's step one step two. I've understood more recently actually and step two is
2283440	2287840	Something which I think is sort of the the physics essence of consciousness
2288560	2295280	Which is that we have this idea that there is a single thread of experience that we that we have
2295840	2297280	It might not be that way
2297280	2300400	That is in the universe and we didn't talk about this in detail yet
2300400	2303760	But in the universe all these little updates are happening all over the universe
2304480	2309840	But we think that and in a sense there's sort of microscopic pieces of time
2310480	2316800	Happening all over the universe, but we believe we have a single identity through time
2317280	2320880	And that there is a single thread of experience that we have through time
2321600	2326240	Now it's it's by no means self-evident that that would be the way it is because in our model of physics
2326880	2331680	Everything about the universe is being rewritten, you know, 10 to the 100 times or something or something like this
2332320	2338000	And so the fact that we have the idea that we are still the same us
2338720	2340880	A second later is non-trivial
2341360	2347120	And so I think that an observer who has that idea that there's a single thread of time
2347840	2354000	Has that is that is the one of the things that you need in order to get the laws of physics that we humans observe
2354560	2358800	And I think that's a so there's this idea of we maintain our identity through time
2359040	2360720	Yeah, which we might not
2360720	2364560	Um and the thing I realized actually even more recently, although I should have realized this earlier
2364960	2370560	Is there's a similar idea for space? It is not self-evident that there is a notion of pure motion
2371200	2374240	So in other words, you take an object you move it somewhere else
2374960	2377920	In our models, you know, I take an object. I move it somewhere else
2378240	2382320	It's made of different atoms of space by the time it gets to its destination probably
2382800	2386720	And so then the question is how come there's an idea of pure motion
2387120	2390240	How come a thing can just be moved without changing now?
2390320	2396160	Obviously we know in general activity, you know, you're close to a black hole funky thing can happen to you if you move
2396560	2398560	Because the structure of space is changing
2398640	2404080	But this is a very basic fact that most of the time, you know, something moves
2404560	2406560	And it is still the same thing
2406800	2411760	And so this idea of this sort of this this single thread of experience in time
2412160	2414720	This idea that it is possible to have pure motion
2415120	2418640	And it's possible to maintain your identity as you move around in space
2419200	2424000	Those two attributes seem to be what you need to derive generic log of physics
2424160	2428160	That is that that's what you seem to need to derive general activity and quantum mechanics
2428640	2430640	Now if you start asking
2430640	2433840	Why does the electron mass come out to be the actual value it has
2434320	2439120	For us humans, we probably need a little bit more information about us humans to be able to figure that out
2439440	2442960	I think I'm not sure. I mean, for example, one of the things that's a current
2443520	2447600	Challenge is the the local symmetry groups local gauge groups
2447920	2455120	It is looking very likely that it is an inevitable feature of our models that there will be local gauge invariance
2455680	2458880	And the thing that looks conceivable. I don't know yet
2459520	2461520	Is that the actual
2461520	2463520	Gauge group will be determined
2463600	2467440	So in other words, even though we don't yet know why the universe has three dimensions
2467760	2472400	We might actually know why the internal symmetry group is maybe a subgroup of v8 or whatever it is
2473040	2475040	Before we even know this thing about
2475200	2477600	About about space and so that would be an example
2477600	2481360	But we don't know, you know, if you ask what's the electron mu on mass ratio
2481760	2486400	You know, we're we're still a fair distance away from figuring that out the classic my expectation would be
2486880	2489760	That there'll be a particular rule that we'll find
2490160	2493120	Which will have where a whole bunch of those things will come out
2493520	2498480	And one of the features if you believe that the rule is simple is if you move from one simple rule
2498960	2504080	To another nearby simple rule everything's going to change because there just aren't very many rules
2504400	2508560	That are that simple and so instead of having, you know, electron mu on mass ratio
2508560	2509440	It'll be well
2509440	2513520	There actually are an infinite number of generations of particles and there are
2513840	2518400	You know a bizarre number of dimensions of space and all this kind of thing. It'll just be completely different
2519360	2521360	But that's that's the current expectation
2521520	2526640	I think you you raised the anthropic principle and to me the anthropic principle is sort of a story of
2527360	2529360	Of lack of imagination so to speak
2529760	2531760	Because it's saying, you know
2532080	2535680	The only way that we can have life intelligence consciousness, whatever
2536320	2538320	Is the particular way we've seen it
2538720	2540720	and you know, I
2541120	2545760	My one of the consequences of this principle of computational equivalence is that actually
2546320	2548720	Something like intelligence is ubiquitous
2549440	2555680	That is you might have thought to get something as computationally sophisticated as us humans with our brains and all this kind of thing
2555920	2558640	You need the whole process that's led to us humans
2559040	2562080	But what the principle of computational equivalence says is that's not true
2562560	2566000	Even these very simple the system with various simple rules can do it
2566560	2572160	And that has well has lots of consequences, you know, if you're if you're worrying about extraterrestrial intelligence, for example
2572160	2577120	That tells you it's everywhere. It's a question of whether we are sufficiently aligned
2577600	2579600	with that intelligence
2580160	2586560	To be able to recognize it as something that for example has purposes that we can understand as sort of human like purposes
2587200	2593600	So, you know, it's a and I think this idea intelligence requires liquid water is almost laughable
2594480	2599520	I'm on your side when it comes to that but but intelligence might require space time in some sense
2599600	2601840	So let's let's at least try to get that I mean
2602400	2607520	Do I is this naive picture that I have in mind where you have the hypergraph you update
2608080	2615840	It's a discrete updating should I can I think of the graph at any one update as space and the update itself as time?
2615920	2617920	Or is that too simple minded?
2618080	2620400	Okay, so it gets a little complicated and in fact
2621040	2624400	The complexity of the rises is quantum mechanics, I think
2625040	2628880	and so it's in a sense you try and make it that simple
2629440	2630560	and
2630560	2635920	You okay, so so the basic point is the sort of the rule says if you have a lump of
2636320	2638720	of atoms of space that are connected in this way
2639280	2641680	Transform it into a lump that's connected in this other way
2642240	2646240	And it basically the rule just says that's what you do. It doesn't say where you do it
2646640	2648160	Doesn't say when you do it
2648160	2651040	It's just any time there's a lump that looks like this
2651520	2657520	You can transform it into a lump that looks like that and so those transformations can be happening all over this hypergraph
2658080	2663120	And so it is not at all obvious that that is the only thing that's defined that these can happen
2663520	2668240	The question of when they happen what counts as the sort of simultaneity surface?
2668720	2673360	What counts as that moment in time is something that's really in the eye of the observer
2674000	2680240	Okay, but the updated graph is supposed to represent spacetime and the things within it or is it a more subtle map there?
2680720	2683200	No, no, so so so at any given
2684160	2689280	What's happening is this graph is getting updated and there are lots of little places where it can get updated
2689680	2695040	And you can say okay, I'm going to consider the graph with this collection of updates having been done
2695440	2698720	I am going to consider that as time t equals zero let's say
2699520	2701520	And then another situation
2701760	2707200	You're saying I'm going to say now I'm going to say this collection of updates is time t equals one for example
2707840	2715040	And each one of those time slices at each one of those sort of well in the language of physics space like hypersurfaces
2716000	2717040	the
2717120	2719120	You know that represents
2719200	2721280	An instantaneous structure of space
2721920	2727360	But it is somewhat arbitrary what you consider to be this instantaneous sort of structure of space
2727840	2731760	Just as it is in general activity. Well, sure right and that's that's very familiar from general relativity
2731760	2734160	But I'm just saying is the collection of the whole shebang
2734720	2736400	spacetime
2736400	2742320	And the things within it. It's just space a single hypergraph a single the collection of all the updated hypergraphs
2742320	2745760	That's what I'm asking. Oh, yeah. Yeah, right the sequence of updates
2746080	2750080	The hypergraph together with all its updates is supposed to be spacetime
2750480	2755120	Okay, and and one of the things that is is interesting and non-trivial here is
2755440	2761040	You know a lot of most traditional views of physics have thought of space and time as being the same kind of thing
2761440	2765680	In this model, they're really not sure spaced as the extent of the spatial hypergraph
2766240	2770000	Time is the computational process of updating this hypergraph
2770480	2774160	So time is a time is the is the progression of a computation
2774720	2780320	Space is just oh, you follow these these connections in the hypergraph. Okay, and so
2781120	2784560	That makes it not at all obvious that you're going to get things like relativity
2784960	2787360	Out of the model because it's some
2787920	2791360	You know because one is breaking apart the sort of traditional
2792160	2793760	Connection between space and time
2793760	2798000	But it does sound you say that the whole the whole shebang is spacetime
2798320	2801120	one of the reasons I hesitate a little bit about that is
2801680	2805040	The shebang is made by a computationally irreducible process
2805440	2811520	So we don't get to it is a you know to say let's just unroll the whole structure of the universe forever
2812080	2814080	Well, we don't get to do that in the universe
2814400	2819920	I mean the universe will do that as the universe does it but we can't just say this is what's going to happen
2820400	2823040	Because there is this phenomenon of computational irreducibility
2823440	2829760	But I do want to just distinguish between this idea and something that someone like myself would be very fond of which is
2830080	2834000	Some combination of quantum gravity and ever ready in many worlds
2834320	2840320	Where there are different branches of the wave function where the geometry of spacetime is just different perhaps radically different
2840320	2845280	It sounds like that is not something that is coming out of your hypergraphs. Oh, no, no that that will come out
2846960	2852240	Okay, I was simplifying a bit. Okay. Okay, so what's happening is at every
2854000	2858960	You know these updates they get they you're just saying whenever you see a piece of hypergraph
2858960	2861680	That looks like this you can do an update. Okay
2862720	2866880	There are many possible sequences of updates that there are many possible
2867360	2871200	Sequencings of these updates that could occur each one of those sequence things
2871840	2875440	Defines a different path of history effectively
2876960	2882400	Now the nontrivial fact another additional piece is this thing we call causal invariance
2882960	2887280	and so what's happening is if you look at this um, uh, this
2888960	2892560	Okay, so if you if you look at this this hypergraph and you imagine
2892800	2894800	You roll up the whole universe
2894800	2901520	Into a single lump that you can kind of hold in your hand and then you say that single lump is going to evolve to another whole universe
2902320	2904320	That process of evolution
2904320	2909920	Is not a single thread that that process can branch because the whole universe
2910320	2915520	If you did two updates in different orders, for example, you would get different outcomes
2915600	2919840	You would get different whole universes and that's very similar to the many worlds story
2920320	2922960	And one difference is that in our models
2923200	2927280	We're really, you know taking seriously this idea that there's that there's
2927840	2931120	branching as a result of these different possible orders of updating and so on
2931600	2934720	And that there's this thing we called in a multi-way graph
2935120	2940000	Which is just this this description of all these different possible paths of history
2940320	2945360	But for us, it's very important that the paths of history can branch and they can also merge
2945920	2947920	and they merge when
2948000	2949200	two
2949200	2953600	Two outcomes for the universe end up you apply two different rules
2954080	2956640	And it so happens that they end up with an identical universe
2957120	2962560	They end up with a hypergraph that is isomorphic that you can rearrange to be exactly the same hypergraph
2963120	2968000	And so that branching and merging process is really important because one feature
2968480	2972080	Of many of our models and in fact it seems to be in the end
2972160	2975840	It's a ubiquitous feature of all of them, but that's not how it initially looks
2976320	2980080	Initially, it looks like you have to pick it specially but in the end you don't is this thing
2980080	2985840	We call causal invariance and so essentially what causal invariance says is every time there's a branch
2986320	2988320	There will be a subsequent merge
2988560	2993600	So in other words, even though you thought you were going to go in two different branches of history
2994080	2996080	Even though for a while
2996640	2999760	You've got two completely incompatible structures of spacetime
3000480	3002480	In the end they will merge
3002800	3006640	In the end there'll be and that's some and so that's why
3007360	3011600	In our models, that's in the end. Why you get objectivity and quantum mechanics
3012240	3015920	Well, let me see. So what happens if I'm just a conventional many worlds person
3016320	3019840	Um, there's perfectly deterministic evolution of the entire wave function
3019920	3023680	it will branch and part of the reason why it branches and
3024400	3029280	Operationally they never merge is because there's some environment
3029440	3035520	Which is huge numbers of degrees of freedom and the different states in the environment will never exactly line up
3035680	3041920	So eventually you might imagine them emerging back together 10 to the 100 years from now
3042080	3044640	Is that the kind of thing you have going on or is you're
3045200	3049520	Remerging much more rapid. No, the the remerging is faster than that
3049920	3051920	But again, it's a little complicated
3052160	3056800	But the the fact that there is divergence and merging is basically
3057360	3063840	So what what in the end happens is that the uncertainty principle is a story of essentially curvature in this
3064320	3067200	Uh, in this basically multi-way graph space
3067840	3074560	And it's just like in in spacetime one of the sort of you know, the classic feature is you go around a square
3074960	3078560	Does it does it, you know, you you go around a square with all the right angles and distances
3078560	3084080	Does it close up if space is curved it doesn't close up and what's happening in our models is
3084400	3088720	It's the exact same thing. Although the space is more complicated and more like a Hilbert space
3089760	3090960	that
3090960	3096720	What's happening is the same exact kind of thing is what leads to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics
3097040	3104160	It's that same failure to close up and now what ends up being the case and we don't understand this
3104800	3106800	As completely as I would like yet
3107280	3113360	So so just to give some sense of the sort of the situation with respect to you know, what we know and what we don't know
3113840	3115840	So these multi-way graphs
3116400	3123920	Okay, so first thing to say about multi-way graphs is they represent the sort of branching and merging of paths of history for the universe
3124720	3127680	So what you one thing you can do is you can say at any given time
3128400	3131680	What is the structure of all of those possible branches of history?
3132000	3137280	So just like in in spacetime, we're going to say let's pick a space like hypersurface
3137280	3138480	Let's pick a
3138480	3141280	A simultaneous moment for all these different parts of space
3141680	3145760	What does space look like or we can do the same kind of thing for this multi-way graph
3146240	3151280	If we do that we get this thing which has all these different all these different sort of possible
3151680	3154480	States of the universe and how are they connected?
3154880	3157280	Well, they're connected in what we call a branchial graph
3157760	3161200	A graph that represents these different branches and so one
3161840	3166720	Convenient way to construct a branchial graph is to look at the common ancestry of those states
3167120	3173040	So if two of those states just branched one step before they're close together in the branchial graph
3173440	3176880	If they branched many many many steps before they're further apart
3177360	3181120	And so you can you can construct just like from this sort of
3181840	3185440	Structure of spacetime you can construct a sort of instantaneous structure of space
3185920	3190160	So from this multi-way graph you can construct what we call branchial space
3190640	3195760	This is the instantaneous representation of the possible branches of quantum history
3196160	3200480	And in a sense, it's a map of entanglements because every one of these branchings
3200880	3206000	That the fact that they had a common ancestor and that they will is is a story of entanglement
3206240	3209760	That's saying that these two branches of history are not independent
3210160	3213360	They are connected by the fact that they are entangled
3213600	3217040	So in a sense this branchial space is a map of quantum entanglements
3217520	3222480	And so it's really I think incredibly cool because branchial space
3223040	3225920	Has many of the same attributes the physical space has
3226400	3231120	It's more like a Hilbert space. It's a little bit complicated and we don't fully understand it yet
3231440	3235760	It's something like a a what is the analog in spacetime?
3235760	3242240	We have this idea of minkowski space which has both sort of the the usual euclidean type space for space
3242640	3244720	And then this notion of time being a separate thing
3245200	3251040	And exactly how that works for a Hilbert space the analog of minkowski space for the Hilbert space of states
3251360	3255840	We don't understand it. Maybe something related to twister space. That's a special case of it
3256240	3258240	But it's something we don't yet understand
3258240	3260240	But one thing we do know is
3260960	3263840	You know in terms of what we understand what we don't understand
3264400	3266880	We do know that our multi-way graphs
3267600	3272400	Reproduce a an approach to quantum mechanics called categorical quantum mechanics
3273040	3280080	And we can just show that they are equivalent basically and it's known that categorical quantum mechanics is equivalent to standard
3280640	3283840	standard quantum mechanics that people studied from the 1920s and so on
3284400	3286480	And not only can we show that they're equivalent
3286800	3293520	One of the recent things in the last month or two has been we can actually use our models to model quantum circuits
3294080	3298880	And we can essentially compile a standard quantum circuit into a multi-way graph
3299600	3304000	And the big excitement of the last few weeks has been and we can do better
3304720	3309600	Circuit optimization in multi-way graphs than you've been able to do in standard quantum circuit formalism
3309760	3313200	So in other words, we can we can if you want to simulate a quantum circuit
3313840	3318560	It's better to do it through our model than it is to do it through the standard mechanisms of quantum mechanics
3318960	3320960	But we know the answers have to be the same
3321120	3324080	So that's that's what we know for quantum mechanics. We don't yet know
3324800	3329680	Fully how that works for quantum field theory quantum mechanics just for other people's benefit
3329680	3335600	I know you know this very well, but but you know quantum mechanics is a story of you know, what do individual particles do
3336000	3340480	Quantum field theory is a story of even if you can make particles and the particles are
3341040	3344720	A sort of spread out through space. How does that work quantum mechanic play?
3344880	3348080	And that's a more difficult thing which we're just starting to understand
3348480	3352160	I do want to dig in I want to dig in more specifically to the different to
3352800	3358720	Mapping your approach onto the different interpretations of quantum mechanics, but but let me let's just give
3360000	3363680	Back up a little bit and keep it simple for the folks who are who are trying to stay with us here
3365040	3369760	If I look at the pictures of the graphs of the hypergraphs that are following the rules
3371520	3376640	Very naively it looks super duper classical. There's a graph something is happening at every point
3376720	3382960	So could you just explain why you know, you even get something like the double slit experiment where you can get interference?
3383680	3387920	But then if you look at it, you don't get interference. Is that something that pops out of your model? Yes
3388480	3395200	Yes, um, I mean by pop out there's a little bit of there's a little bit of effort to make that pop. Sure, of course
3396640	3400160	The okay, so when you see pictures of these hypergraphs
3400880	3407200	They are pictures drawn for a particular branch of history particular branch of quantum mechanical history
3407440	3410800	That's what we're easily able to visualize now. It's been a big project
3411360	3414640	To make what we call local multiway systems, which mix
3415360	3416960	spatial extent
3416960	3419840	With branch ill extent that is mix
3420320	3424880	Things which are moving around in space with things which are going to different branches of history
3425200	3429680	And we've been this has been a big challenge because it's pretty hard for us humans to visualize that stuff
3430080	3432320	And we've been we've been working on it for the last year actually
3432400	3436000	We're getting fairly close to having pretty good visualizations of that
3436080	3438800	But those are those are significantly more difficult to understand
3439280	3441840	But the the typical pictures you'll see
3443040	3445040	Our our project is full of graphs
3445040	3450160	So there are many different kinds of graphs that show up and they're they're kind of in all the one of the things
3450160	3453760	That's been a big kind of practical win is that we at some moment
3453760	3458480	We kind of did the colors for our model and you know picked this graph is going to be this color
3458720	3464000	This kind of this other color and so as soon as you see one of these things you can tell that's a causal graph
3464000	3468560	That's a branch ill graph or whatever. Um, that's just a uh, and and um, you know
3468640	3472560	Because all the all the code for our models is all openly available
3472720	3477840	People have been just using that code and so people have been following kind of the the color standards
3477840	3480080	Which really help but so there are there are
3481200	3487680	Probably six different kinds of graphs that show up the ones that are the most common and colored bullish are
3488480	3492640	The ones that are the the hypergraphs that represent the instantaneous structure of space
3493520	3502880	So there are then these multi-way graphs that represent the um, the kind of the the um, the branching and merging of quantum histories
3503760	3508000	Then there are branch ill graphs, which are traditionally pink in our world
3508640	3510640	That represent these slices
3511120	3513360	through the multi-way system they represent so
3514320	3515360	in
3515360	3516800	In space time
3516800	3522320	We are taking a slice through space time and finding this is what space instantaneously looks like
3523040	3530000	In the multi-way graph you take a slice and you're saying this is what the instantaneous map of quantum states looks like
3530480	3533760	And in fact what happens is in in relativity
3534240	3540320	We're used to having this idea of reference frames of how do we label what space and time are how does an observer
3540720	3545120	Decide what counts of space what counts as time and so on if the observer is going at different speeds
3545120	3547440	You know you're tipping the reference frame all those kinds of things
3548080	3552880	We have exactly the same kind of thing in quantum mechanics. We have what we call quantum observation frames
3553200	3556800	Which are basically the the the thing that represents
3557280	3562080	This corresponds to a a particular state of the quantum world
3562640	3565760	And you can think of these in branch ill space
3565840	3569280	You can think of these points in branch ill space, which are histories of the universe
3569840	3571360	as being
3571360	3573360	different quantum eigen states
3573760	3576000	So you you can think of them as being different
3576880	3578240	basis elements
3578240	3581120	So different different things from which you would make up a quantum state
3581680	3588000	And so then what happens is when you have one of these quantum observation frames you've you've sliced the this multi-way graph
3588320	3590480	You've got this whole collection of quantum states
3591040	3592480	And now you ask
3592480	3595360	In for example, so so now okay, this is a
3596320	3598320	One other thing I have to explain
3598480	3601680	In quantum mechanics the sort of the big idea
3602320	3608320	You know is this notion of quantum amplitudes. That is you just get to know there's this this
3609200	3610160	object
3610160	3617120	Which is that you know has complex numbers, you know associated with and all this kind of thing that is the quantum amplitude
3617520	3619520	and so the question is
3619680	3624960	That that quantum amplitude the the the complex numbers that are associated with it
3625440	3631920	That you know one of the things that we've realized is the idea that you can think of a quantum amplitude in some of the complex numbers
3632000	3637440	Is confusing in fact the right way to think about it is it has a magnitude and it has a phase
3638000	3640960	And in our models the magnitude of the quantum amplitude
3641360	3644160	Is the result of path counting in the multi-way graph?
3644240	3649040	So in other words if there are many ways to get to that state in the multi-way graph
3649600	3655680	The magnitude of the quantum amplitude is determined by the number of ways to get to that that point in the multi-way graph
3656480	3661760	The phase of the quantum amplitude is determined by the position in branch shield space
3662400	3666400	So in other words the idea is as you move around in branch shield space
3667120	3674800	You are changing the the the phase that coordinates a branch shield space are essentially phase coordinates in quantum mechanics
3674880	3677680	Sorry, you might need to tell me what branch shield space is again
3678320	3682000	Okay, so so okay, so that then we've got this
3682640	3687440	All possible histories of the universe which correspond to this multi-way graph. They branch they merge
3687920	3694800	It's a complicated thing now. We're saying let's let's and and and that graph is being formed through time
3695360	3701120	So every every and so now we say let's take an instantaneous time slice across that graph
3701760	3704800	It is the quantum analog of a reference frame in relativity
3705520	3709920	Okay, and that and by the way those reference frames can get quite wild in quantum mechanics
3710160	3715280	They're somewhat wilder than the ones you would typically use in general activity at least that's that's our
3715840	3720640	View of how this works. So so those reference frames are sort of the choice of the observer
3720960	3724000	They're not they're not something that is intrinsic to the physics
3724560	3729840	They're just oh, we've got this multi-way graph now. We're going to say for our purposes
3729840	3732640	We're going to say this is what the time slices of that will be like
3733040	3733760	Okay
3733760	3740960	So that what this branch shield graph is the structure you get by slicing through this multi-way graph
3740960	3744560	So you're asking the various points in this multi-way graph. How are they arranged?
3745040	3751040	Well, we can say they're arranged nearby if they correspond to something which just had a common ancestor
3751360	3755120	Just one step back. We had a common ancestor and other ones, you know
3755120	3761040	You have to so basically what happens is the the simplest way to make these branchial graphs is you simply join by an edge
3761600	3765920	every pair of nodes that have a common ancestor
3766320	3772000	Okay, and then so what that means is if there are if there are things are far apart on the branchial graph
3772160	3775520	It means their common ancestor was probably many steps in the past
3776160	3779760	And and the idea then is that that okay
3779840	3781040	so the claim
3781040	3787040	Which is again mathematically quite non-travel is that the coordination of branchial space
3787440	3790720	That is if you try and assign coordinates just like in in physical space
3790800	3794000	You'd say there are all these atoms of space and they're just connected in certain ways
3794240	3796800	But now we say based on those connections
3797200	3800640	It is we can say this one has coordinate position blah blah blah
3801040	3804240	And it's next to this other one which has a very similar coordinate position
3804640	3808080	Okay, so the same you can do the same kind of thing in branchial space
3808080	3810240	You can try and coordinate to i's branchial space
3810880	3815440	And the claim is the coordinates of branchial space are the phase of the quantum amplitude
3816160	3821680	So in other words what that means so so just to sort of perhaps for for people's benefit
3821840	3825360	Maybe we can explain something about so, you know
3826320	3832480	I don't know how how to we can try doing let's see you probably can do this better than I can but but explain the quantum phase
3832720	3836800	But you know the idea the way that I just say it is that you know the
3837360	3844080	The wave function for a single particle is like a wave sometimes. It's positive sometimes. It's negative or plus or minus i so
3844480	3846480	different contributions can
3846640	3849280	destructively interfere as well as constructively interfere
3850400	3854960	Right but the critical idea in a sense is as you have that wave that's going up and down
3855360	3858880	The phase of the wave is at a particular moment in time
3859280	3865760	Are you up or are you down right and the phase is kind of the shifting of that wave relative to a particular moment in time
3866240	3869520	so what we're saying is the these the the um
3870560	3875040	This branchial space represents kind of where the
3876160	3882960	Where that thing is shifted that a position in branchial space corresponds to a certain shift of that of that thing
3882960	3888720	So so here's the place where where it's actually my favorite result so far in our physics project, okay
3889200	3893840	So um, which is worth explaining because then we can talk about double-slot experiment a little bit more easily
3894320	3896880	Okay, so let's talk about physical space
3897600	3903440	One of the questions is if you are if you have an object a particle for example in physical space
3904160	3908800	How will it move in physical space and the standard idea of general relativity?
3909360	3912960	Is an and of actually Newtonian physics is it moves?
3913120	3917200	You know according to a shortest path from one from one point to another
3917520	3920960	So it's like whatever the shortest path is in space. It'll go
3921760	3926240	Along that shortest path if space is flat the shortest path will be a straight line
3926720	3931520	If space is curved the shortest path might be deformed and the big idea of you know
3931520	3935840	In einstein's equations and so on is the deformation of space the curvature of space
3936320	3940880	Is produced by the presence of energy momentum by the presence of mass in space
3941200	3948080	So essentially what we're saying is gd6 in space are deflected by the presence of energy gd6 shortest paths in space
3948480	3953520	Are deflected by the presence of energy. That's kind of a version of what's happening in general relativity, okay
3953600	3956080	So now let's look at these multi-way graphs
3956800	3961280	so the the derivation of the einstein equations and the
3962240	3968400	Deflection of gd6 by the presence of energy is something we can do on in terms of our
3969680	3973440	You know rewriting of hypergraphs and a bunch of mathematics associated with that
3973840	3975840	So it's sort of a mathematical result from that
3976560	3981600	Now something very analogous to that mathematical result is also true for the multi-way graph
3982160	3985360	and what then happens is the gd6
3986000	3989840	Essentially in branchial space the shortest paths in this branchial space
3990400	3993040	Are also deflected by the presence of energy momentum
3993840	3999040	Okay, so this is where it gets that's really fun because the the the sort of the
3999680	4004080	You know the sort of a good core formulation of quantum mechanics is the Feynman path integral
4004640	4009200	And the Feynman path integral says you look at all these possible paths of history
4009520	4014320	And you say the phase the quantum phase associated with the path of history
4014880	4020720	Is you know e to the is over h bar where s is this quantity the so called the action
4021200	4025200	Which is a an integral of Lagrangian density
4025520	4032160	Which is essentially the aversion of the amount of energy momentum in a particular region of something
4032880	4036560	Now in our world that that's a particular region of branchial space
4037040	4040800	effectively the density of energy momentum in branchial space
4041520	4044240	Leads to the deflection of gd6 in branchial space
4044720	4050320	And so what does that mean if the if the position in branchial space is the phase of the quantum amplitude
4050800	4054560	That means the deflection of a gd6 is a change of phase
4055440	4061120	And the Feynman path integral is precisely telling you that the presence of energy momentum
4061440	4063680	Leads to a change of phase in a quantum amplitude
4063920	4070160	So what it's saying is the sort of the the bigger picture here is that the the same mathematics
4070640	4074480	That leads to the Einstein equations in space time
4075040	4080720	Leads to the Feynman path integral in in multi-way graphs and branchial space and so on so in a sense
4081200	4085280	these two sort of fundamental principles of 20th century physics
4085840	4092320	General relativity and quantum mechanics and our models are basically the same thing except that the
4093040	4096560	General relativity is a story of what happens in space time and
4097680	4098960	the
4098960	4102960	In quantum mechanics the story of what happens in what we sometimes call branch time
4103360	4106560	The thing you get which is the sort of class of branchial space
4107280	4108560	together with time
4108560	4110880	So this might be this might be a very unfair question
4110880	4117440	But I think there's something super simple that I am missing here, which is I just don't see where the negative numbers come in
4117520	4119520	I hear you saying that
4120320	4125920	There's this position in branchial space as a phase and I get that if that is true you get the result you want to have
4126240	4128240	But why are there a little bit more complicated?
4128480	4130480	I just the simplest possible
4131120	4134960	Explanation for the negative numbers would make me happy in other words the reason why you can
4135680	4142960	Interfer as well as add your probabilities. Let me explain. Yeah, I explain so so let's say you're doing a double-slut experiment
4143360	4146800	Okay, the photon can go through one slit. It can go through the other slit
4147760	4149760	Those two possibilities
4150160	4151600	The question is
4151600	4157280	Where do those different possible paths for the photon? Where are they in branchial space and physical space?
4157280	4160800	They're going through two slits the question is where are they in branchial space?
4161600	4164320	If those two possibilities wind up
4164960	4167680	At essentially the same point in branchial space
4168480	4170800	That is that they end up with the same phase
4171600	4175040	If those two things wind up at opposite ends of branchial space
4175760	4181920	Those two possible paths of the photon end up in two radically different pieces of branchial space
4182160	4185840	Okay, so what so the issue is how does an observer?
4186400	4191280	Observe what's going on. So this is again. I'm afraid there's another level of concept. We have to have here
4191680	4193680	Which is how an observer
4193840	4198640	Makes sense of what's going on in the quantum universe. Sure. So the one of the issues is
4199360	4201920	When you are an observer embedded within the universe
4202640	4203520	you
4203520	4206320	Well, we can talk about spacetime and causal and the
4206800	4213280	Let's forget spacetime for a second in this in this world of multi-way graphs and branching and merging and so on
4213840	4217280	One of the things that's a little bit brain twisting is you as an observer
4217840	4220960	Are also branching you're part of this multi-way graph
4221520	4227520	So the question of quantum mechanics is how does a branching brain perceive a branching universe?
4228240	4231680	So in other words, your brain is branching just like the universe is branching
4232080	4234880	Okay, and so now what you have to do and this is where for example
4235200	4238880	The idea of a single thread of experience a single thread of time is important
4239360	4245840	Because the whole notion of us as observers is we have at least the fiction that our brain doesn't branch
4246320	4248960	We have the fiction that definite things happen
4249440	4252640	And so the question is how do we implement that fiction?
4253120	4258640	And then is the is our implementation of the fiction consistent with what we actually observe in the world
4259200	4266000	Okay, so the way that we a convenient way and this is an idea of jonathan gorod who's one of the people who's been working on this project is
4267360	4271280	The the what he calls the completion interpretation of quantum mechanics
4271840	4274960	Okay, and what it has to do with is
4275840	4277840	Imagine we've got a branch
4278400	4285680	But then say but the observer has to corral those branches together in order to believe that something definite happens
4286320	4288320	So how is the observer going to do that?
4288720	4294560	What the observer does is to just say i'm going to imagine that these two branches are equivalent
4294560	4297120	I'm just going to make a mathematical equivalence between them
4297600	4301520	And then i'm going to see what consequence does that have for my view of the universe
4302240	4304880	Okay, and and so that's the thing
4305040	4311600	So it might be the case that the view of the universe knitting together these branches would rapidly become incredibly inconsistent
4312480	4317920	But this causal invariance property implies that eventually these branches will merge
4318320	4320320	So eventually it's going to be okay
4320560	4323680	But the question of whether the observer can kind of speed that up
4324240	4327120	And say no i'm going to insist it's okay right now
4327600	4332400	Even though it might take a century for these branches from different parts of the universe to merge
4332880	4335280	It's okay to think of them as merging right now
4335760	4340480	So that's a that's a consequence mathematically of this causal invariance idea that it's possible to do that
4340800	4345440	But so in that interpretation what you're doing is you're essentially making completions
4345920	4350240	That try and corral back together these different branches of history
4350480	4355040	Okay, so what happens if the two photons wind up at opposite ends of branchial space
4355680	4360720	Basically, what happens is you and as an observer have to construct completions
4361120	4363120	That basically complete the whole universe
4363520	4367600	Because you're trying to get from one end of branchial space to another you're trying to knit everything together
4368000	4372640	And that means basically that photon as far as your concern isn't there
4373040	4375840	Because and so that's so essentially the reason that you're getting
4376480	4384240	You know destructive interference is that you as an observer simply can't knit it together to say there really is a photon here
4384480	4387040	It's like the photon has been just smashed
4387520	4392400	Into into pieces that are scattered over all over branchial space. You know what I could say
4392960	4394960	I actually did understand that
4395680	4397680	Even though I wasn't necessarily expecting to but
4397760	4402720	Uh, it seems and maybe this is again an unfair comment, but I'll let you riff on it
4403120	4410400	It seems like just like we thought we needed interpretations of quantum mechanics in the 1930s that somehow we need interpretations of
4410960	4413360	hypergraphs or growing hypergraphs. I mean it
4414160	4420160	The the story you just told which I'm perfectly willing to grant gets you the double slidics, etc
4420560	4423360	Does seem to involve some metaphysical
4424160	4426160	Interpretational steps along the way
4426320	4428320	Fair point. I mean this is this is why
4429120	4432080	This is a fundamental point in in our models
4433040	4435040	If we were not
4435120	4439760	Roughly the way we are we would not conclude that the laws of physics are the way they are
4440480	4443440	So consider the case of the gas molecules again
4443920	4449920	If we were one of these little demons that's able to compute everything about the gas molecules and do all those things
4450240	4452240	We wouldn't conclude that
4452720	4456720	Thermodynamics and hydrodynamics work the way they do. That's right. We would say
4457200	4461920	Oh, actually we noticed that these little correlations of of of molecules here and more on the other
4462400	4464400	And we'd get a completely different conclusion
4464480	4472240	So the fact that we derive quantum mechanics is a consequence of the fact that we are roughly the way we are
4472560	4475280	Not in detail with two eyes and you know all this kind of thing
4475360	4481040	But but in you know, so and in particular the fact that the branching brain
4481840	4486480	Perceiving the branching universe has the idea that definite things happen
4486880	4489360	That's critical if we didn't have that notion
4490080	4493040	And you can think about it in terms of how our brains work, you know
4493040	4495440	We got all these neurons firing all over our brains
4495840	4502720	And in a sense there wouldn't be any real reason to think that there will be a definite threat of experience that we have
4503040	4507120	It could just be you know, there's all these different things happening all throughout our brain
4507680	4512240	And it's you know, this is a this is a fundamental feature of our experience of the world
4512560	4516560	Is that we believe there's a definite threat of time and so yes, that is necessary
4516960	4520880	And you know, I think without that and it's interesting to think about it
4521120	4524640	You know, what do the aliens so to speak think physics is like?
4525200	4527200	Because you know, for example
4527600	4534880	It it matters probably that we are roughly the size we are it mattered that we have this notion of single threat of time
4535360	4541920	Um, you know, I I don't think we would recognize the aliens so to speak if they didn't have something like a single threat of time
4542000	4545280	It doesn't just doesn't you know, I'm fond of making the comment, you know
4545600	4547760	The weather has a mind of its own, you know
4547760	4552400	It's got all this complicated hydrodynamic processes happening in the atmosphere and so on but yet
4552800	4557280	We don't have the idea that it has some sort of, you know, human-like consciousness
4557680	4562240	Usually at least depending on our animism our level of animism and psychism. Yeah
4562880	4568400	But so but would I be then correct to conclude from that that you think that from this kind of
4568800	4571120	fundamental setup with the hypergraphs and the updates and so forth
4571600	4577360	We could not get a universe that was fundamentally classical and had you know observers like ourselves in it
4578000	4586080	I think our models are very fundamentally quantum mechanical. I think that you can't really get, you know, what you can okay, so
4587360	4593520	What you would have to do is say there is only one okay, here's a way you can get something that's like a classical universe
4594160	4600000	And at first it sounds completely crazy, but let's say the universe was built using a Turing machine
4600320	4603360	So a Turing machine is this model of computation that has
4604080	4609760	You know, it's tape that has all this data on it and has this head that moves up and down
4610320	4614080	Along the tape and at any moment it's only doing one thing
4614480	4617200	It's only at the position of the head that anything changes
4617680	4620400	And so you could say imagine a universe
4621040	4626160	Where the where the Turing machine does a definite thing. Let me think about this for a second
4626720	4628720	Um
4629120	4631120	Yeah, I I let me think about this
4631840	4638160	Is that right? Well, okay, so you can certainly imagine setting it up so that there is only one possible thread of time
4638960	4645920	Because the Turing machine is an ordinary Turing machine and for every state it gets into it has only one possible successful state
4646560	4652160	Um, and so you might say and so that would be a kind of degenerate form of model like ours
4653120	4655520	That is classical. Yeah, okay. That's fair
4656480	4660720	But but usually what's happening is there are many different places where things can happen
4660720	4662720	So there are many choices of what can happen
4663200	4665200	What what what you do
4665280	4667680	Now what you do next et cetera, et cetera, et cetera
4668240	4674640	And you know, I keep on I'm sort of dancing around one issue which we haven't talked about which is the notion of causal relationships
4674960	4678800	Between updating events. So we've got two different updating events
4679360	4682240	And we could say which one happens before which other one
4683040	4685040	Well, if one of them
4685520	4689600	Specifically if the output from one of them is used as the input to another one
4690000	4696480	Then it better be the case the one whose output is being used occurs before the one that needs that output as input
4696880	4702400	Right. So that defines a certain ordering on certain events have a definite ordering
4702560	4705680	I mean in physics terms, those are the time like separated events
4706240	4710800	Um the uh, and those those are events that are necessarily time like separated
4711120	4713840	so then then there are other events that
4714560	4721920	Could happen you could decide that you're going to say these two events happen simultaneously the the spacecraft landed on mars
4722480	4728800	Right as I was eating lunch so to speak and you know, that was those were considered in the simultaneous events
4729280	4732240	So one of the issues is given this
4733280	4735280	Set of events that are happening
4735280	4742160	There are certain causal relationships that is one event must occur before another event and you can make another kind of graph
4742640	4746800	A so-called causal graph that represents that net of relationships
4747760	4751920	And just to make things more complicated in the multi-way graph
4752000	4754000	There is a multi-way causal graph
4754240	4758240	Which says there are these events happening and events can be separated
4758560	4762640	They can either be time like that is one event must occur before another event
4762960	4767280	They can be space like in the sense that they can be at different positions in physical space
4767760	4772800	Or they can also be branch like in the sense that they occur on different branches of quantum history
4773360	4777440	And so all three of those things are possible time like space like branch like separation
4778000	4780000	and that's uh
4780160	4784480	And in fact the interplay between those things gets pretty interesting when you start talking about
4784880	4788480	You know things in black holes and adf cft and all this kind of stuff
4788880	4793840	That that's that's that's how though those kinds of things seem to come out is the relationship between
4794240	4796640	Time like space like branch like separated events
4797200	4802640	I mean you hinted at this a little bit, but uh, maybe to concisely say how you would characterize
4803280	4807600	The solution to the measurement problem of quantum mechanics in your view
4807680	4813200	I mean, there's a standard list of options with many worlds and hidden variables and dynamical collapses
4814000	4816000	Are you different than all of those?
4816400	4817600	probably
4817600	4821840	I mean, you know, I'm not sure because I I think that um
4823840	4828000	Let's see. We have a much more microscopic view of what happens in measurement
4828720	4832160	Because we're trying to describe the whole universe. We don't get to say
4832560	4837200	Here's my quantum system and then outside of my quantum system is my measurement system
4837680	4840880	Everything has to be part of the description that we're giving of the universe
4841680	4846000	And so that's that's the first big big difference now. I think
4847040	4848080	um
4848080	4851280	If it depends what you mean by what the quantum measurement problem is
4851280	4855920	So one one thing that I think is a a significant piece of the quantum measurement story
4856480	4859280	Is why do people think that definite things happen?
4860160	4866320	And um, so what essentially is going on is different quantum measurement different quantum frames
4867440	4871840	cause people to believe at some moment that different things have happened
4872480	4877200	But there's some sense in which there is a global consistency to what must happen
4878000	4883040	So again in other words, so so the fact that there are two different outcomes from this measurement
4883680	4886560	Is a consequence of the fact that the observer
4887040	4889840	Can have defined two different quantum observation frames
4890560	4894320	And that is what causes those different possible outcomes from the experiment
4894560	4898880	It sounds like you're in some sense your closest in spirit to many worlds in the sense that
4899680	4906880	Someone who believed in hidden variables or dynamical collapses would say that there just is one outcome for every measurement
4906880	4908880	You don't need to think very hard about it
4908960	4915280	Right. No, that's correct. I mean this this does not have that idea this this has the idea that the outcome
4915760	4920800	Is in a sense based on the the frame in which with which the observer observes it
4920800	4924720	So in a sense, it's kind of like a many worlds thing where you know, which branch did you go on?
4925200	4931840	But the the difference is in a sense that in our situation those branches always eventually merge
4932240	4938640	So in other words, even though you've picked a particular this observer at this moment has got this outcome
4939200	4943360	That there will be eventual consistency in how the universe behaves
4943920	4947040	Now, you know, have we figured all of this out? Not completely
4947200	4951360	Let me give you an example of where sort of the frontier of what we understand and don't understand
4951680	4954560	So an obvious question is what does it mean for quantum computing?
4955280	4959280	So in quantum computing, there's kind of this notion that has been around since
4959680	4964880	Since I first studied this stuff around 1981 or so that gosh in quantum mechanics
4965360	4968880	There's this, you know, all these different possible paths of history
4969280	4971440	And I happened to study this with dick Feynman
4971520	4977360	So he was very into the multiple paths of history idea because that had been his his idea for a way of setting up quantum
4977360	4978320	It does make sense
4978320	4983600	It's like just think, you know, if you could get this this computation to not just go in one
4984000	4986000	Not just do one computation at a time
4986320	4989200	But follow all these different possible paths of computation
4989600	4995200	You could in parallel work out all these different different results and you'd be able to, you know, factor in just fast
4995280	4998640	We didn't know about that at that time, but those kinds of things
4999360	5002160	The so so the idea of quantum computing, you know
5002320	5007760	The big hope is just use all those paths of history to do a different computation on each path
5008480	5012080	But the you know, the next question is in the end
5012560	5014560	We have to observe what the answer was
5015120	5018560	And so in a sense, we've got all these threads of history that have all split apart
5018800	5020400	They're all doing their different things
5020400	5026640	We've got to corral all those threads of history back together again to make a definite measurement and say what happened
5027120	5034800	And so in our models, we can actually ask what is microscopically involved in corraling those those threads of history back together
5035200	5039040	And so in jonathan's setup of this completion interpretation
5039440	5041280	We have at least a model of that
5041280	5046640	Which is it involves these these completions these places where you assume that two branches are connected
5047120	5055280	And by the way, the mathematical underpinning of that somewhat interesting the the mathematical underpinning comes from the theory of automated theorem proving
5056080	5058080	Which is might seem irrelevant
5058080	5062560	But it isn't and so the point is when you have in mathematics
5063120	5068080	You say there's some axiom system you say, you know x plus y is always equal to y plus x
5068640	5073120	You know x plus zero is equal to zero it's equal to x and so on and then you say
5073680	5075680	Given those rules
5075840	5076800	uh
5076800	5078960	Is it, you know, can you prove that?
5080080	5081200	x
5081200	5082560	I don't know x
5082560	5084560	You know some some some results in algebra
5084560	5092160	Can you can you prove that results by by just and you say can I one way to think about that is can I get from one algebraic expression?
5092480	5099040	To another algebraic expression just by making this series of moves that correspond to applying particular axioms
5099760	5102560	So then if you say well, i'm starting off from one expression
5102880	5108880	Now, let me apply those axioms in all possible ways and build up this whole graph of possible outcomes
5109520	5113040	Well, what you build is precisely one of these multi-way graphs
5113760	5118720	And that the the space of possible results that you can get starting from one expression
5118720	5123760	What can you get as a multi-way graph and so automated theorem proving is the question of
5124720	5128960	The proof of a theorem is a path that goes from one expression to another expression
5129200	5131600	So automated theorem proving is about finding that path
5132160	5135680	And so completions become the formation of lemmas
5136000	5142640	So in mathematics you would say let's make a lemma that where we assume where we where we prove that this particular thing is equal to
5142640	5145600	This thing and that's a piece that we'll use in our big proof
5145840	5148240	And so these completions are essentially lemmas
5148720	5151440	They are their assumptions about how the universe works
5152000	5157520	That we are that we as observers are making and so one thing we can then ask for the quantum computing case
5158080	5161280	Is how many such lemmas do we have to produce?
5161600	5165840	Do we how much effort of knitting together the structure of branchial space?
5166000	5171360	Do we observers have to do in order to conclude the result of the quantum computation?
5172000	5175280	And it seems we're still nailing this down
5175360	5180320	It's still a little bit messy, but it seems that you can never win with quantum computing
5180560	5183520	That is that when you branch out in all these different ways
5183920	5190880	The effort to corral things back together is at least as great as the gain that you get from things branching apart
5191360	5193840	Now, you know to really nail that down
5194240	5200560	We have to get ever better models of the observer and that's just not something that traditional models of quantum mechanics
5200560	5204800	Traditional interpretations of quantum mechanics. They are out of that business because they just say
5205360	5207360	And the observer works like this
5207920	5211920	External to the quantum system, but we have to be more microscopic
5212560	5215440	And say no, we're actually going to describe how the observer is working
5215760	5220320	And so our best model so far is Jonathan's completion interpretation that
5221360	5224960	That involves these potential lemmas being produced. I'm sorry
5225440	5233440	There's a traditional understanding in well, there's an understanding in traditional quantum computing that there are some problems for which quantum mechanics
5233440	5236800	Certainly gives you a speed up. Are you saying that's not true in your model?
5237760	5240320	Yeah, I think I think it's not going to be true. That's my guess
5240560	5244400	I think what's going to happen is, you know, if you take like Shaw's algorithm for factoring
5244640	5247120	Yeah, which is primarily a quantum Fourier transform
5247680	5253760	The you know that Fourier transform is done beautifully quickly because there are all these threads that are running in parallel
5254080	5260160	The problem is every thread is somewhere in a different place in branchial space that thread
5260400	5266960	But us observers, we have to corral all those things back together again in order to tell what actually happened
5267440	5272480	And that's you know, so there's a you know, usually in quantum computing one just says and then there's a measurement
5272800	5276160	Now in in actuality when you have an actual device
5276640	5282400	You have all kinds of issues in making that measurement all kinds of how quickly does it deco here all these kinds of things
5282640	5284640	There are all these kinds of very practical experimental
5285360	5290720	You know features and I think people have generally said given the formalism of quantum mechanics
5291280	5295200	It you know, it's like well all this quantum stuff happens and then boom
5295200	5300480	We do a measurement and the boom we do a measurement is actually pretty difficult in practice with actual experiments
5300800	5303760	But people have said but you know if we do these experiments well enough
5304000	5309680	It'll become the mathematical idealization that you know von Neumann and others made about how measurement works
5310000	5312960	And I don't think that's going to be true. I mean we're not sure yet
5313120	5319280	But it seems likely that there will be no way to do to sort of that
5319840	5323680	If you're honest about how the measurement works the measurement takes effort
5324080	5328560	But are you saying that that's going to be a generic result about even conventional quantum mechanics?
5328640	5330800	Or is this specific to your approach?
5332880	5337200	Um, if you could if you could study how measurement works well enough in quantum mechanics
5337600	5340640	Yes, the problem is in in traditional quantum mechanics
5341040	5345280	It's like this is all the quantum. These are all the quantum amplitudes and the hammer comes down
5345680	5348640	And it's you know the born rule or whatever and that's the end of it
5349040	5353120	Um, and and so you don't you don't get to look inside that measurement process
5353440	5356320	And when people you know, I'm I'm probably not you know
5356320	5359040	one of the strange things that's happened to me in this physics project is that
5359280	5362000	You know, I I knew about everything that was going on in physics
5362240	5365120	Not everything perhaps but a lot of things 40 years ago
5365520	5368720	And then I kind of went to sleep for 40 years and woke up again
5369200	5374640	And it's remarkable. It's it's really cool actually to see you know a lot of stuff really didn't change
5375200	5380560	And some stuff advanced and it's like, you know, I used to know the masses of all these elementary particles
5380640	5389040	You know the mass of the lander is 1115 mev and now I look it up again. It's you know 1114.962 or something
5389440	5395280	It's like that's um, uh, so, you know, there are things like that and they're also also mathematical ideas and so on
5395280	5397280	But I'm not sure that I would know
5397520	5399520	everything that people have done and kind of
5400560	5406080	Sort of models of quantum measurement, but certainly back when I last knew about it in in great detail
5406880	5411760	People were sort of starting to say and then we take the small number of quantum degrees of freedom
5411840	5417200	That we're looking at as the quantum system and we let that sort of spread out in a larger number of quantum degrees of freedom
5417520	5420800	Where eventually it will become unambiguous what happened
5421360	5425680	For essentially thermodynamic reasons. Yeah, because it's it's more or less like, you know
5425680	5431760	What happens in the gas getting randomized and in fact, this was a thing dick feinman and I worked on back when we were
5431920	5435120	We were both consultants for a computer company in boston and we were
5435680	5440160	I was insisting that we try to do something useful and we try to invent a quantum randomness chip
5440720	5442880	And so we tried to think about how would you make?
5443360	5447600	You know and those days one gigahertz seemed like an impossibly fast
5448160	5453200	Cockrate for this chip, you know, how would you make quantum randomness that one gigahertz?
5453840	5456960	And what we realized is, you know, you have this little quantum effect
5457360	5463280	But then when you measure that effect you have to amplify it into a sort of classical number of degrees of freedom
5463840	5468800	And that process in order for you to have an unambiguous result in in order for successive
5469200	5471200	Bits that you measure to be uncorrelated
5471760	5475920	You have to essentially have essentially sort of a thermodynamic phenomenon going on
5476160	5481200	You have to be you know, it has to randomize then that that randomization has to not be correlated with the next thing
5481280	5484960	It happens and that was that that was to me the first sort of sign
5485440	5488160	That there was going to be a cost to measurement so to speak
5488560	5493680	Well, if you if you start a podcast of your own you can have me on and we can talk about interpretations of quantum mechanics
5493840	5496320	And that would be fun, but okay, you can teach me all about
5496880	5503920	But I mean, I think that that that does help me understand a little bit because what you're what you're saying is that it's possible that your approach
5504640	5509360	Um has a different attitude toward let's just say the measurement problem of quantum mechanics
5509440	5515360	So the next obvious question is do you have a different attitude toward the schrodinger equation towards the unitary evolution?
5515440	5520400	I mean the conventional schrodinger equation is continuous in time and you're not continuous in time
5520640	5525920	Are you getting the schrodinger equation as an approximation or is there some sense of which it's exact?
5527040	5531600	Yeah, right. So so it's very similar and we don't know all the details of this yet
5532560	5534960	But let's talk about the spacetime case
5535760	5536880	In the spacetime case
5536880	5539760	We've got these atoms of space and we've connections and so on
5540320	5542320	And we're looking at things on a large scale
5542880	5548560	And what should happen is that just like in a fluid where the molecules are bouncing around but on a large scale
5548560	5554080	We get the fluid equations on a large scale. We should get the Einstein equations and that's what theoretically
5555040	5561600	Theoretically we should get now when I say theoretically this is, you know, when physicists do mathematics
5561760	5566640	They're really sloppy and you know, there are many limits that have to be taken
5567120	5572320	Of um, uh, you know, it's the these these there's a certain amount of computational
5572400	5576640	Reducibility which leads to a certain amount of randomness which leads to certain statistical averages
5576960	5579600	working out in a certain way when you look at the
5579920	5585200	You know the distances have to be large compared to the elementary distance between atoms of space
5585680	5590160	And small compared to the size of the universe and the curvature has to be small blah blah blah blah blah
5590400	5591920	A whole bunch of conditions
5591920	5597680	But with all of those conditions in physicists level mathematics, we can derive Einstein's equations
5598080	5603600	Now it's worth pointing out that the effort to derive the fluid equations from molecular dynamics
5604080	5606080	Has been unsuccessful for a hundred years
5606480	5608800	That is with with a level of you know
5608800	5614880	We can derive Einstein's equations with the same level of kind of mathematical rigor that you can derive the fluid equations
5615120	5618000	Which is to say it isn't really mathematically rigorous
5618000	5623280	But if you take all kinds of limits that that and one advantage that we have actually one big advantage
5623360	5626320	That I always forget is that we've done endless simulations
5626560	5632480	But we actually know what limits work and what don't right so it's not like it's just let's hope this works based on
5632560	5634080	You know some mathematical
5634400	5638800	Sort of hope it's it's like we we ran an experiment with a billion cases
5638960	5642080	And this is what happened so we can kind of check those assumptions
5642160	5647520	But but okay, so so what then happens is what we are saying is that
5648080	5651040	The from this kind of microscopic atoms of space thing
5651520	5656160	When we do that when we look at that on a large scale we reproduce steinstein's equations
5656640	5659360	So one of the things that we've been doing recently
5659520	5665680	Jonathan has been much involved in this has been saying well, what about practical numerical relativity?
5665920	5670000	So people study, you know black hole mergers and they do that by taking
5670400	5674800	You know the the the structure of the black holes and they say we have steinstein's equations
5674880	5676880	which are partial differential equations and
5677680	5680960	Then we will but in order to make those work on a computer
5681360	5685360	We have to discretize them because a computer deals digitally with with
5686240	5688240	sort of digital elements
5688640	5690000	and
5690000	5693200	So then you make numerical relativity where you've made some kind of mesh
5693760	5697920	That represents some approximation to spacetime as
5698400	5703120	You know approximating the spacetime of steinstein's equations. So that's kind of the traditional approach
5703600	5707440	Now what we're doing instead is to work upwards from the atoms so to speak
5707760	5711040	So we're saying instead of going down from the steinstein equations
5711280	5715440	Just come up from this kind of structure of this this hypergraph
5716000	5717440	and and
5717440	5721280	Look at you know, what is the aggregate behavior of all these atoms of space?
5721840	5726880	The neat thing is that it actually works and it's a practical method for doing numerical relativity
5727440	5730800	So and in fact, it's looking really promising to
5731760	5737520	As a and what's interesting. So this is now a general relativity just a side comment for general relativity
5738000	5742560	So one thing you can ask is so obviously in our simulations
5743360	5744240	The
5744240	5747120	We have these atoms of space and we simulate on a computer
5747520	5753520	I think the extreme kind of amusing version is jonathan has been doing all these simulations on his laptop
5753600	5755600	Just to prove that that's possible
5755600	5761680	Which I think is totally crazy. Yeah, but so he has these simulations of black hole mergers and things done on his laptop
5762640	5768400	Using our models you could do a lot better if you weren't just using a laptop. But anyway the the um, uh, the thing
5768960	5775280	That is a so it's not obvious that we would be able to get enough approximation to continuum space
5776000	5780160	Just kind of on a laptop from our atoms of space rather than having to go
5780320	5784880	You know many many many orders of magnitude, but it seems that that works
5785360	5787680	So the next question is in physical space
5788480	5791360	Where might we see evidence of discreteness in spacetime?
5791840	5797840	So in other words the in other words, is there a way of making essentially a gravitational microscope that will
5798480	5803200	see into the structure of spacetime and so one of the things we've looked at
5803680	5808880	Is rapidly rotating back holes right close to the critical, you know close to j equals m
5810080	5815280	What happens and it's pretty neat because in these in these simulations that jonathan has
5815840	5822160	What you see is the thing eventually as you go above the critical angular momentum critical spin rate for the black hole
5823040	5825040	A piece of space simply separates
5826000	5830080	So okay another thing to explain is in our models of physics
5830960	5833920	This network doesn't have a built-in notion of dimension
5834000	5837840	So, you know our experience is space is three-dimensional, but this network
5838480	5841600	Doesn't have any particular number of dimensions that are built into it
5841920	5846080	It can be the case that on a large scale it approximates three-dimensional space
5846640	5851040	But because it doesn't have a fixed number of dimensions because it isn't
5851520	5858800	Microscopically a manifold so to speak it can do things like it can change its topology things can there can be tears that form in it
5859040	5864960	There can be holes that form in it and so on and or more extremely there can be pieces of the universe that just break off
5865600	5871920	And so what we see happening at for critical supercritical black holes is a piece of the universe just breaks off
5872560	5874000	and as
5874000	5876000	as it at the critical
5876240	5880160	Angular momentum what you see is that a piece of the universe is hanging by a thread
5880720	5885920	And so there are these small number of causal edges that essentially connect one part of the universe to others
5886160	5889360	And so it's conceivable that we may get some kind of
5890240	5892240	signature maybe in gravitational radiation
5892560	5897120	Of that discreteness, you know in physics terms probably shot noise
5897760	5905120	Associated with the fact that there is a that there are a small number of causal edges that are associated with that with that situation
5905440	5908560	So anyway, that's but that's just the general relativity case
5909120	5912400	In the quantum mechanics case, you're asking about the schrodinger equation
5912720	5914720	So the schrodinger equation has to emerge
5915360	5917360	As a pile of limits
5917760	5923920	From the things that we're doing because the schrodinger equation is a non-rotivistic limit of a et cetera, et cetera, et cetera
5924240	5928480	So the answer is I I think I mean, I'm sorry just to be just to be super clear
5928560	5931360	I'm using the generalized version of the schrodinger equation
5931360	5936400	That would be just as true for quantum field theory and relativity and everything just h psi equals i d by dt
5936880	5939680	Psi unitary evolution of the wave function, right?
5940080	5941760	So so we are
5941760	5948320	From the setup of these multi-way graphs and the interpretation of quantum amplitudes. We are guaranteed unitary unitary evolution
5948880	5950880	100 not as an approximation
5951360	5952480	that that
5952480	5954480	You think about that for a second
5954880	5959040	It's a little tricky because you have to define what the initial and final states are
5959600	5963840	And if you if you say I have the whole multi-way graph of everything
5964160	5965680	I think you're guaranteed it
5965680	5971360	But if you say if you say i'm going to make an i'm going to look at a particular region of spacetime
5971760	5978640	I think it's not so obvious. I think there. Oh sure. Yeah, that's that's that's just true and even in the regular schrodinger equation
5978640	5983520	So that I'm yeah, yeah, I think that I think let me think about that for a second. I think
5984800	5986400	that
5986480	5989120	Let me see. I mean quantum measurement is non unitary
5989120	5993040	That's a that's a thing that we that we have to deal with but a many worlds person says
5993040	5996480	That's just because you're only seeing part of the wave function in exactly the same way that you are
5997200	6002000	Right, right, but I'm a little concerned about the statement that the um, uh
6003360	6004480	See the
6004480	6008080	That the statement about the the way the hamiltonian appears there
6008560	6012400	In the in the non relativistic schrodinger equation is certainly not what we're seeing
6012800	6017280	So because we have a you know, our thing is sort of relativistic from the get-go
6017760	6022960	Um, and so what I think let me think about this for a second. Well, you could define it in terms of the path integral
6022960	6029440	I mean, is any unitary evolution from one one wave function to another one quantum state to another between an initial
6029920	6034640	Hypersurface and a final hypersurface. I think you inevitably get unitary evolution
6035200	6038880	But you have to define what those hypersurfaces are as you do and you know
6039440	6045360	As as you do when you merge your relativity and quantum general relativity and quantum mechanics. So I think it's um, I'm
6046320	6047680	uh
6047680	6050720	I think that's right. I I I would have to um
6051520	6053920	I mean the the part of this
6055520	6057520	Yeah, I think that that has to be that way
6057520	6060000	Okay, I mean the part that we've been interested in recently
6060640	6067520	Is can we make a practical scheme for doing quantum field theory in the same way that we can make a practical scheme scheme for dealing with
6067520	6069120	Einstein's equations
6069120	6075280	And so in a sense, you know, one of the things that all it encourages me in this project is
6075760	6077760	What I might call proof by compilation
6078000	6081520	That is the fact, you know, you say do you really get Einstein's equations?
6082000	6087440	Well, we can do numerical relativity and it actually works and we can do you know black hole mergers and things
6087760	6091520	So if Einstein's equations, I'll write them, you know, what we're doing is the same
6092160	6093360	and
6093360	6097200	In quantum mechanics, we've been able to do this compilation of quantum circuits
6097840	6101280	The next big challenge is to do quantum field theory and to do
6102480	6105840	And to be able to do things like few particle quantum mechanics
6106400	6108400	And you know those kinds of things
6109040	6112320	You know, for example, let me give you an example of how things got a little bit complicated
6112560	6116960	So in in quantum mechanics, you know, a very traditional thing is the harmonic oscillator
6117280	6120880	Just kind of the analog of you know, things bouncing on a spring back and forth
6121840	6125520	In order to get that in our models you have to have closed time like curves
6126480	6129840	So in other words to get a perfect harmonic oscillator
6130240	6134320	It's very easy to have a perfect harmonic oscillator if you have closed time like curves
6134640	6140480	In other words, if the if the history of the universe recapitulate if the history of the universe repeats itself
6141120	6146480	That's kind of how you get something like a harmonic oscillator. That's how you get the idealization of a harmonic oscillator
6146800	6152800	Now in the real situation in physics, we probably don't believe that there are perfect harmonic oscillators
6153120	6156400	We can decompose quantum fields into you know, as
6157280	6162960	Let's think of it as a sum of harmonic oscillators, but we're not imagining there's a perfect harmonic oscillator here
6163280	6168880	But if you say you might say and this is relates to the kind of reverse engineering versus building from the ground up
6168960	6173520	So to speak you might say gosh, how can you think you have a model of quantum mechanics?
6173600	6176400	If you can't even have the harmonic oscillator
6176880	6178800	But well, we can have a harmonic oscillator
6178880	6184720	But it's a weird idealization, which in our models shows up with with closed time like curves
6185680	6189120	And so that's you know, that's an example of how things get a little you know
6189200	6191200	If you insist on these idealizations
6191600	6193920	You end up sort of stressing
6194560	6199840	As I think you should you kind of stress the model. So it's similar to you know, if you said
6200560	6207200	I'm you say I'm studying molecular dynamics. Okay, so then somebody says well, why can't you get rigid body mechanics?
6207200	6211920	Why can't you get you know, this thing with a solid object that just moves around and doesn't distort?
6212480	6216560	Well, that's a complicated limit of molecular dynamics that involves, you know
6216640	6221680	Input atomic forces are large compared to the you know forces on the whole object blah, blah, blah
6222160	6224000	You know, it's it's um
6224000	6225680	That's a complicated story
6225680	6229200	And I think we're seeing some one of the things that's difficult about our model
6229520	6233200	Is that it attempts to be a model for everything so you don't get to say
6233680	6236960	We're going to have them of this piece. We're going to make a model for that piece
6236960	6238480	We're going to idealize away
6238480	6244800	You have to kind of everything has to come together and that means that seeing things like how does the harmonic oscillator work
6245200	6248640	It's a weird idealization. Yeah, that that does make sense
6249120	6253920	If you get exactly unitary evolution that is to say you get something like the Schrodinger equation
6254400	6259920	Um, I mean a many worlds person will say all there is is the Schrodinger equation. You just need to pick the Hamiltonian
6260400	6263360	Um and someone like me if I can indulge myself, you know
6263440	6270320	Our project is to start from a nothing but a Hamiltonian expressed as a list of energy eigenvalues and show how there's an emergent
6270720	6274480	Geometric structure that looks like a graph you get Einstein's equation and the whole thing
6274640	6277760	It's it's similar in spirit. Uh in that sense to what you're doing
6278240	6280240	But so then the question is
6280320	6282880	If you exactly get unitary evolution
6283680	6288560	What is the benefit to not just starting with quantum mechanics in the Schrodinger equation versus starting with hypergraphs?
6290720	6295760	Well, because you have a whole structure that you're building. So I mean for example when you say, what's the Hamiltonian?
6296320	6297440	You know
6297440	6302320	That better come out of our model. So for example, you could ask which we haven't discussed. What is energy in our model?
6302800	6305280	Okay, this is one of the things that surprised me
6305360	6308320	I thought energy was going to be a very difficult to derive idea
6308720	6312240	That was going to require notions of what particles are and so on and so on and so on
6312720	6314880	It seems that energy is very simple
6315280	6318800	it's basically the amount of activity in the hypergraph
6319200	6321200	And a little bit more formally
6321360	6326720	It's the flux of causal edges through space like hypersurfaces and it's concerned and it needs to be said
6327280	6329280	I mean that so a causal edge is
6329360	6332560	Is a is a causal connection between two updating events?
6333040	6336160	And so the question is if you have a
6336800	6340320	You have to say it a little bit more carefully because if you say it's the density of activity
6340640	6343760	It's what the heck does density mean when we don't have a notion of space yet
6344240	6349040	So the more formal thing is energy is the flux of causal edges through space like hypersurfaces
6349440	6352640	momentum is the flux of causal edges through time like hypersurfaces
6353360	6354720	and
6354720	6355840	the
6355840	6357040	um
6357040	6361280	Actually, you you now make me wonder and I don't think I know the answer to this
6362480	6366160	What is the flux of edges through branch like hypersurfaces?
6366240	6370080	I should know the answer to that and I don't immediately know and that's that's um
6370640	6372640	That that's related to okay
6372640	6378640	So so the point here is there's a I think see one of the things that's interesting in our models
6378960	6382320	Is the relationship between quantum energy and classical energy?
6382880	6387840	Because in our models, it's the this notion of in classical energy
6388400	6392080	It's the you know, you've got this single thread of history
6392080	6397120	You've got this causal graph associated with that thread of history and you're asking this flux of causal edges
6397600	6400320	But now you can also have this multi-way causal graph
6400720	6406000	Which not only has space like separation of events, but also branch like separation events
6406480	6411680	So events can be separated in in in in branch of space and in and in physical space
6412240	6415360	and then the idea is that quantum energy
6416000	6418240	is that activity in
6418960	6419920	uh
6419920	6421360	in
6421360	6422560	This whole multi-way graph
6422560	6425040	So it's the amount of activity in the multi-way causal graph
6425600	6429920	And so then like the Lagrangian is this relatively invariant
6430480	6434080	That this is the you know the Lagrangian density is that
6434880	6436480	that kind of
6436480	6441440	You know relatively invariant notion of the amount of activity in this multi-way causal graph
6441920	6444720	And so for example one one little mystery that this
6445360	6448800	Seems to clear up is the thing if you look at the Planck length
6449360	6452480	You know the characteristic length people often talk about for where
6452880	6455600	Sort of quantum mechanics and gravity have to kind of come together
6456240	6459600	In our models the elementary length is much smaller than the Planck length
6460240	6463680	And in the a typical thing is the Planck energy
6464080	6469440	Well, whereas the Planck length is you know 10 to the minus 34 meters or whatever it is the the Planck come
6470320	6472320	The Planck energy
6472320	6475840	Is 10 to the 19 electron volts if I remember correctly gv
6476080	6477200	And um
6477200	6481680	What's that 10 to the 19 g e v g e v. Okay. Thank you
6482720	6487280	But it's about the you know, it's about the energy in a thunderbolt or something and a lightning strike
6487600	6490160	It's huge not a very small quantum thing
6490800	6492800	um in our models
6493040	6495600	The elementary energy is also small
6496160	6498160	because the elementary energy is
6498880	6502560	an individual causal edge in the multi-way causal graph
6503280	6505600	And the fact that what you observe
6506400	6511120	Is is this thing that the the analog of the Planck energy is something that has been average
6511200	6516160	That has been sort of summed over all possible branches in this multi-way causal graph
6516560	6519200	I mean, this is maybe this is a footnote. Don't forget this
6519760	6522800	This is just a there's just a part of the the story
6523120	6525120	But but so you're you're saying
6525520	6529840	Why do we care about this whole structure that we're building? Why not just put a hamiltonian in there?
6530160	6532160	and what i'm saying is the um
6532800	6539200	For for listeners who don't know this hamiltonians and lagrangians are closely related. Sure. They're they're sorry
6539280	6543440	We did that I think for you and me. That's pretty obvious, right? Yeah, that may not be um
6543920	6545280	That may not be obvious
6545280	6551760	But but in some sense you're like we said there's a simple set of rules that you start with and I mean maybe maybe I can just jump
6552320	6557360	I'm going to try to guess what you're uh thinking here and then you can tell me whether I'm right or wrong
6558160	6560320	There's an infinite number of hamiltonians I can write down
6560560	6565040	But at least for simple ones there's a finite set of little rules that we can write down for our hypergraphs
6565200	6568720	So maybe there's a map from the set of rules to hamiltonians
6568800	6576000	But it's a very very, you know one, you know few to few rather than covering the whole space of possible hamiltonians
6576640	6578640	Right. Well, so this is a good question
6579440	6580880	As you look at
6580880	6582080	simple
6582080	6583920	You know rewrite rules for hypergraphs
6584000	6590640	You get some set of hamiltonians if you say oh, I'm gonna have a million line program to represent my rules for the hypergraph
6590960	6594000	Then you're going to get some other, you know, you can kind of custom engineer
6594320	6599360	Whatever hamiltonian you want probably got it. Okay, so it is not self-evident, you know
6599760	6602480	What kind of hamiltonians you get?
6603200	6607600	From simple update rules. We don't entirely know so for example
6607840	6611200	It looks like we get ones that show local gauge invariance
6612000	6617760	And then we have to ask, you know, and that's a that's a, you know, if you just pick your average hamiltonian
6618000	6620480	There's no particular reason for it to have local gauge invariance
6621520	6623520	But in our models it probably does
6624000	6627280	And so that's a good sign now, you know, will we get
6627920	6631760	You know, what other attributes will we like our hamiltonians for the universe to have?
6632480	6637440	Well, I mean, you know my approach here is to just say let's see what we get
6637840	6640800	And for example, okay, so here's one of the complicated things
6641280	6647040	So the hamiltonians that you will typically write down in in in quantum field theory. They are
6648080	6655040	The things that are in those hamiltonians, Lagrangians, whatever are quantum fields their quantum fields that represent
6656720	6658640	You know
6658640	6661840	Field operators that correspond to particular particles
6662480	6666880	Right, so there'll be an electron quantum field. There'll be a photon quantum field and so on
6667440	6670640	Now in our models, we're not yet talking about particles
6671200	6672640	So those
6672640	6674640	Hamiltonians have to be
6675200	6678960	What we have is a description of things at a much lower level
6679440	6683280	Than a place where you've got actual field operators for particles
6683920	6688880	So for us that what are the particles the particles are locally stable
6689520	6691040	kind of
6691040	6695680	Defirmations in this in this hypergraph. So for example an analogy in fluid mechanics
6696160	6699360	If you say what's like a particle in fluid mechanics, well a vortex
6699840	6705760	You know a kind of whirlpool like thing in a fluid that is locally stable and it can move through the fluid and it can
6705760	6710160	Trap with other vortices. It's something vaguely similar to that in our hypergraphs
6710960	6712960	More a kind of topological structure
6713760	6716640	That is some kind of not yet very well understood
6717520	6720640	feature that is locally stable under the rules
6721440	6726240	And so when you talk about field operators that would occur in, you know, your average
6726720	6728720	communal garden particle physics Lagrangian
6729440	6730240	those
6730240	6732640	field operators are effective
6733680	6734880	descriptions of
6734880	6736880	These deformations these topological
6737840	6743120	These topologically stable objects in this hypergraph the hypergraph is a lower level description
6743520	6745840	And so it takes, you know, it's not obvious
6746400	6749280	And it's a very good question and we don't know
6749840	6751840	You know, how does
6752160	6756160	How does the thing that looks like it operates in terms of particles?
6756560	6758000	How does that emerge?
6758000	6764480	You know, what kind of things that look like they're in terms of particles emerge from this lower level structure because because in our models
6765120	6766240	You know
6766240	6768560	All we have at the beginning is the structure of space
6769120	6772080	Particles are just features of the structure of space
6772800	6776160	And they are, you know, so there's an underlying dynamic
6776240	6782080	I mean one of the things that sort of a little shocking in our models is that most of the activity of the universe
6782640	6789040	Is is associated with the maintenance of the structure of space and has nothing to do with all the particles that we observe in space
6789600	6792160	So that that's a and so what what?
6792880	6793680	I mean
6793680	6796000	So it's a it's a it's a very reasonable question
6796400	6803840	How the Hamiltonians that we're used to in particle physics emerge as effective Hamiltonians from this underlying dynamics
6804400	6808240	And we don't yet know the answer. Well, you know, I mean you mentioned the particles
6809200	6812320	As something that does come out as these persistent structures. So
6813200	6815200	But but as you certainly know
6816720	6823520	Quantum field theory the the usual modern physics way of saying things is that fields are somehow more fundamental when you perturb them and excite them
6823760	6826000	You get particle like things. There are
6826640	6831440	Circumstances, you know, like the condensation of the Higgs field where the particle language is not appropriate
6831520	6836480	Is there is there a view toward a more field like ontology coming out of this?
6837760	6842640	Well, I think that okay, so again, this this is if we say
6845360	6848000	When we talk about particles in particle physics
6848800	6854800	They are as you say sort of, you know, what we imagine is oh, there's a particle. It's not interacting with anything
6854880	6858800	It's you know, it's separated from everything else. It has a definite momentum
6859120	6863440	It is a definite mode of the quantum field and when it comes close to other particles
6863760	6868080	Then, you know, it gets more complicated and there are other modes of the quantum field that get excited
6868080	6873200	And eventually some other particle goes out and you observe it in a particle detector, but the the
6874400	6879280	So for us we have to think about what do those scattering experiments look like?
6879440	6883120	What is an experiment where you have that separated particle?
6883760	6888720	And this is one of the cases where, you know, the we are building everything from the ground up
6888720	6893520	So we don't get to say. Oh, it's just a separated particle in the vacuum. So to speak
6894080	6896880	It's a an excitation of some kind
6897520	6904080	Embedded in the space that is that has a lot of activity in it. So so for example when we talk about
6904640	6910880	You know, so one of the things that I'm wondering is will there be bizarrely different kinds of stable structures
6911440	6914960	In our hypergraph that aren't like the particles we're used to
6915520	6920640	So in other words, you know, you mentioned the Higgs field the Higgs field is a case where we have this condensate
6920720	6924400	Where we have a sort of uniform value of the Higgs field throughout space
6924960	6931280	And that's you know, that's a simple case. There are, you know, people know about, you know, soliton type solutions to field equations
6932080	6937680	And you know, there are other kinds of things like that and one of the possibilities is that in our models
6938240	6944160	Particularly because we have this dimension variation that there might be bizarrely different stable structures
6944560	6950960	That could exist in the context of our models that don't seem like particles of the ordinary kind but that wouldn't mentor
6951120	6955920	And things like that might be something bizarrely different. Maybe it's even related to something, you know
6956000	6958160	Maybe it's related to dark matter for all we know
6958480	6960800	I mean, it's just something that could exist
6961360	6966480	As a as a sort of stable feature of our universe that goes beyond just the structure of space
6967040	6972000	But it has a form that we don't yet don't yet understand and I think I mean in in
6972800	6975760	The the other thing to realize so in standard particle physics
6976080	6980880	We talk about virtual particles, you know, you can they're always part these particle antiparticle pairs that
6981280	6985200	That are sort of popping into existence in the vacuum for a very short time and then annihilating
6985680	6991280	So in and and one of the features of that it's always been somewhat mysterious in quantum field theory
6991520	6997760	Because quantum field theory says there's an infinite number of these virtual particles that are occurring all over the universe
6998240	7004000	And that corresponds to effectively a very high energy density of stuff in the universe
7004480	7005360	How can that be?
7005360	7009440	How can it not in einstein's equations say, you know, whenever you have energy
7009680	7013040	You're going to curl up the universe with, you know, gravitational attraction
7013360	7020000	Associate without energy. How can the universe not curl up into a tiny ball because of these vacuum fluctuations of virtual particles?
7020720	7026560	Well in our models the those the sort of limiting case of those virtual particles
7027200	7029200	Is these actual?
7029840	7031840	rewrite rules in our
7032080	7033440	In our hypergraph
7033440	7038000	So in other words the this sort of the ultimate version of all of those virtual particles
7038320	7040720	It's just all these little rewrite rules in the hypergraph
7041040	7044000	Which in our models are exactly what create the structure of space
7044720	7048000	So in a sense that makes it a little less mysterious
7048480	7053360	That, you know, all of this virtual particle stuff doesn't have this terrible effect
7053680	7056320	This terrible gravitational effect on the universe
7056880	7062960	Now you can ask things like, you know, can you imagine how the Higgs mechanism works and all these kinds of things?
7063280	7066880	And yes, I've thought about that and there's a there's a certain amount you can say
7066880	7068880	I don't think we we we can't um
7069680	7072240	I mean, I was very disappointed when the Higgs particle was discovered
7072560	7074400	I kind of knew it was going to happen
7074400	7080240	but it was it was um, uh, it was kind of like like it's kind of a hack and it's disappointing that
7080720	7082720	You know, it it looks
7082720	7084880	So far the Higgs mechanism looks like a hack
7085280	7089360	And the question is can we make it look less like a hack and that will be really neat
7089840	7095440	So one little footnote is that uh, you might be interested in work by tom banks and willy fishler who have
7095920	7100240	Emphasized within the context of more or less conventional quantum gravity
7100320	7106400	The point you just made about the cosmological constant that we should not think about it as the sum of all these virtual fluctuations
7106480	7109120	We should think of it as an input a boundary condition
7109120	7113680	They call it that uh, just sets the size of space in some sense. So that's more in line
7113840	7119920	I think with the philosophy that you're thinking of. I knew tom banks, but when we were both at the institute for advanced study in the
7120240	7125360	In probably 1980 or something. I haven't I'm great. I'm glad he's I'm glad he's doing interesting things
7126000	7128480	and then the and the other point was I mean
7129600	7132640	I don't want to dwell on all of these, but I presume that
7133680	7137440	If your program pans out we will want to find
7138320	7142480	Solutions to the classic puzzles of particle physics
7142480	7148560	So not just the cosmological constant problem, but the hierarchy problem, you know, the strong cp problem barrio genesis
7149440	7153600	Are these the kinds of things I'm guessing that I would have heard already if you would solve them
7153600	7156480	But maybe are they solvable you think within the program?
7157360	7163760	Uh, you know eventually they should be I mean we can we can start sort of teasing apart what each of them involves
7163840	7169120	I mean, you know the oh, there are three generations of particles and um, you know
7171040	7178240	The question is what's generic and what's not so the surprise for me is that general relativity and quantum mechanics seem to be generic
7178720	7180720	Just as thermodynamics is generic
7181280	7183760	And the question is how far does the generosity go?
7184240	7186240	Because I wouldn't have expected
7186800	7192720	Well, for example, I wouldn't have expected the the detailed form of Einstein's equations to be as generic as they seem to be
7193280	7196080	so, um, and you know, it could be
7197040	7200240	I I'm I have this vague suspicion that
7201040	7206880	The structure of the gay local gauge group might be generic. I might be completely wrong about that. Yeah
7207120	7212560	Well, that that you can hope um, I I I don't think the three dimensions of space are generic
7212560	7215520	I don't think the three for the three dimensions of space is generic
7216000	7222800	Um, whether the you know, there are bizarre possibilities like, you know, maybe the two threes are related
7223120	7226000	You know the three generations and the three dimensions of space may be
7226560	7229600	Uh, you know, and I don't know. I mean that that's uh
7230320	7234960	These things are all certainly possible. I think that when it comes to things like, um
7235920	7237920	Well, one example is cpt invariance
7238640	7243280	So that's a the question of why is there cpt invariance and I can explain a little bit about that
7243360	7245200	We don't know completely
7245200	7248560	I mean, so in sort of in the stack of things you need in particle physics
7249120	7252160	A big feature of particle physics is fermion versus bosons
7252560	7259760	You know particles like electrons put a fermion and have the exclusion principle don't want to be together versus photons which are bosons
7260000	7262000	and are very happy to be together and
7262480	7266960	Those are distinguished by the, you know, the spin statistics theorem says if you are an
7267440	7270800	You know, if you're a half integer spin particle, then you will be a fermion
7270800	7272960	And if you're an integer spin particle, you'll be a boson
7273360	7278880	So one question is what are fermions and bosons in our models and can we derive the spin statistics theorem?
7279360	7281360	And that's an example of a sort of
7282320	7286240	You know one of the achievements of quantum field theory is the derivation of the spin statistics theorem
7287360	7289360	and so for us
7290320	7295360	Fermions versus bosons. We have a guess. We're not sure the the guess has to do with
7296160	7298160	In these multi-way graphs
7298160	7302240	We suspect that bosons are associated with in a sense
7303520	7309360	Branches that merge very quickly and fermions are associated with branchings that do not merge quickly
7309840	7315040	And so that's what leads you in a sense the the branchings that don't merge quickly
7315520	7321280	Wind up with opposite sides of branchial space things that can't happen effectively or things that are not observed to happen
7321840	7325440	and and in fact at a mathematical level it is the the
7326240	7330720	You actually will then sort of see the fermions are kind of the square root of the bosons
7330960	7336000	Because the fermions are it just branches. It doesn't do the it doesn't merge as well
7336320	7338800	Whereas the bosons are both the branches and it merges
7339360	7342880	and so now the question is can we relate that to
7343440	7350240	Rotational symmetries that are associated with with the spins and so on and looking promising not done yet
7350320	7351680	but looking promising
7351680	7356720	so then then if we can do that then we can derive the spin statistics theorem and
7357440	7363040	uh, then the next question is well cpt invariance just to explain for people the the um
7363360	7367520	This is a a fundamental symmetry that's believed to exist in quantum field theory
7367920	7372080	Is if you turn particles to anti particles you reflect space
7373040	7375840	and and you uh reverse time
7376400	7381040	Then you'll always get something where the laws of physics work the same way
7381600	7383120	So for us
7383120	7385920	Again, it's kind of neat because it seems like
7387280	7390240	C charge conjugation, which is particle to anti particle
7390880	7391920	is
7391920	7393920	effectively like
7394000	7400000	It is an it is an inversion in branchial space. It seems to be in other words. It's a reflection in branchial space
7400080	7402080	Uh
7402080	7405600	Uh parity is a is a reflection in physical space
7406080	7408240	And time reversal is a reflection in time
7408720	7414480	And so what this is saying is in the end that our multi-way causal graph is invariant under
7415120	7417920	Uh a reflection in all three of those
7418800	7426640	In all three of those uh those directions so to speak now we we so it's at least a very clean formulation
7426960	7428960	Of what it means to be cpt invariant
7429520	7434240	Whether we have not yet shown that we necessarily get cpt invariance
7434240	7437120	But at least we know what it corresponds to but that gives some sense
7437200	7440000	So so when you ask about cp violation, for example
7440560	7444640	That's still a little ways away because we don't yet understand cpt invariance
7445200	7446400	um
7446400	7448560	In in regular quantum field theory cpt
7449200	7454240	Invariance is tightly connected to lorenz invariance the invariance under boosts and and so forth
7454800	7456800	I'm guessing that
7456960	7461360	In a discreet graph model lorenz invariance must be once again
7462000	7465120	Approximate right and and they'll be at some point even if it's very very
7465760	7467760	Experimentally inaccessible where it will break down
7468400	7477440	Absolutely. There is a maximum boost you you can't get you know, there's a in other words as eventually you start seeing the granularity of spacetime
7477680	7479680	Yeah, so you can you can do um
7480320	7482160	and so
7482160	7485360	Yes, the the um the relationship between
7485840	7490960	That is that is in fact the derivation path that we're aiming for is causal invariance
7491680	7493840	in the ordinary causal graph
7494480	7496960	Leads to ordinary lorenz invariance
7497760	7502960	And the guess is that some kind of that causal invariance in the multi-way causal graph
7503440	7508480	Is associated with the essentially extension of lorenz invariance that is cpt invariance
7509120	7511200	So that's that that's the guess about how it works
7511440	7517120	Right. That's yeah, we don't we don't know if that's really and you know, obviously cpt invariance is a complicated story
7517600	7519920	in general activity and in non
7520400	7521760	You know non
7521760	7527360	Non, you know non flat spacetime and so on and and no doubt we will run into those issues
7527680	7536480	There are very good experimental limits on lorenz violation from different propagation speeds of photons of different wavelengths from gamma ray bursts
7537280	7543360	They can put limits up to the Planck scale, but as you said your scale is much tinier. So it might not be anywhere close
7544080	7548160	Right. I mean, I think the thing that I'm most interested in with respect to those propagation experiments
7548720	7550720	is finding
7550800	7553200	Kind of dimension fluctuations in the universe
7553840	7558400	Because in our models the you know, there's no reason for the dimension to always be three
7558720	7564880	In fact, one of the things that's a possibility is so one of the more bizarre possibilities again not properly explored
7565200	7569680	Is that the Einstein equations are usually formulated in terms of change of in terms of the
7570320	7572240	Change in curvature of space
7572240	7575680	One possibility is you might be able to say that curvature is always zero
7576000	7582400	But the dimension changes and that's and it might be that those are there is some mathematical equivalence between those for small
7582480	7584480	Curvatures small dimension changes
7584640	7590800	But but but you know one of the things that we suspect in our models is that the universe started infinite dimensional
7591360	7594880	And only gradually sort of cooled down to be three dimensional
7595280	7598320	And so that then a lot of the problems about you know
7598400	7604000	These horizon problems in the early universe and so on disappear because when it's infinite dimensional
7604320	7608480	Everything is closely connected. The the graph distance between things is small
7609040	7614160	Now the suspicion from this is that as it cools down to be three dimensional
7614400	7619200	There may be dimension fluctuations left over and so obviously, you know
7619360	7622560	The question is would those be visible at the time of recombination?
7622880	7625760	Can we see that in the microwave and the cosmic microwave background?
7626080	7632720	Of course, we don't know but the the the first question is what would a dimension fluctuation do to the cosmic microwave background?
7633040	7635360	And then if there was a dimension fluctuation that exists
7636000	7642080	In the current universe, what would it do to the propagation of a photon through that dimension that region of dimension fluctuation?
7642560	7645760	And I this is this is a piece of in a sense classical physics
7646080	7649520	That I keep on meaning to work out and I keep on hoping somebody else is going to work it out
7649840	7656320	Because it's kind of like that. I've been I've been collecting this inventory of of laws of physics in d dimensions
7656880	7660560	Well, I think I mean, I'm just guessing here because I haven't thought of it myself, but um
7661200	7664480	If the effective dimensionality space is not exactly three
7665200	7670240	Coulomb's law would not be exactly true. And wouldn't that have dramatic effects on qed scattering rates?
7670240	7672240	Um
7673600	7678800	Well the question is something like the thompson cross section, for example does how does that depend on so
7679520	7681360	uh, I am
7681360	7683360	well, you you're
7683840	7685680	You're correct that in d dimensional space
7685760	7688400	So so the way to think about I think proton propagation
7688960	7694320	Is using huygens principle where you're saying that every on this wave front of a propagating
7694800	7697680	Propagating, uh, you know light wave or whatever
7698240	7702480	Every every point on that wave front is a source of a spherical wave
7702880	7705520	That is going to build up the next piece of the wave front
7706000	7708560	And if you are in d dimensional space where d isn't three
7709120	7716080	Those little spherical waves have a different, you know, there there's a different density on those spherical waves
7716240	7718240	So to speak when you project them into three dimensions
7718480	7720480	That's at least my thinking about how to do this now
7721040	7722480	question is
7722480	7724960	So the question is so so in particle physics
7725760	7731040	Back when I used to do particle physics a long time ago. I was a big enthusiast of this method called dimensional regularization
7731600	7733600	Which is the idea that you know
7733680	7740000	Well, you're doing an integral and if it's if the dimensionality of space time is four the integral diverges horribly
7740160	7742560	But if we can only say it's four minus epsilon
7742880	7746320	We can do the integral and then we take the limit epsilon goes to zero at the end
7746720	7753520	So I'm sure I've worked out back in the day what the low-energy electron photon scattering cross-section is indeed dimensions
7754000	7756000	And that's uh, that would be a good
7756800	7763440	Uh, that that'd be a good case to look at. I mean, I think that that that I will not be surprised if there is some
7764080	7770480	Thing that one can some fairly sensitive test of the dimensionality of space. For example, I don't know and I've been meaning to look it up
7771040	7772080	what
7772080	7775600	uh, the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron or the muon
7776400	7782160	You know, it's it's one minus alpha over two pi. But that certainly depends on the dimension of space. I just don't know how
7782400	7784400	Yeah, there's probably some sensitive particle high
7784880	7789600	High precision particle physics experiment that that is uh sensitive to that so, okay
7789920	7794400	I think I only have two questions, but they're both huge questions. So I suspect they're going to take more than two minutes each
7794480	7796880	but uh, one of them is you you
7798160	7802400	Referred to this idea that in the early universe, uh, maybe we have some
7802880	7808480	Bundle of dimensionality or dimensionality is not well defined and that sort of comes out in the wash as the evolution happens
7808960	7810720	um
7810720	7813280	So I've thought very much about the arrow of time problem
7813360	7817200	But I've thought about it in the context of fundamentally reversible
7817920	7824960	Directionless laws of physics, which is a little bit different from where you're coming from. So for me the huge question is, you know, we're
7825840	7827840	Evolving toward an equilibrium
7828240	7832880	Empty space situation where all the galaxies are all dissolved around and we have nothing around us
7832880	7836400	But the cosmological horizon and that's the highest entropy state
7836800	7843360	Uh, but we came from 14 billion years ago a very very very low entropy state and in conventional cosmology
7843440	7849040	There's just no good explanation for that except the papers I've written and even those are not universally accepted yet
7849120	7853280	But it sounds like you have a possible completely different point of view where
7853840	7858400	It's just natural that you start with what we would expose fact or label low entropy
7859600	7862880	So I think the the discussion about entropy is kind of confusing
7863360	7865360	Okay, that's my first statement
7865360	7871920	I I remember actually I remember having these vigorous arguments with Dick Hyman about this very topic of whether the universe was
7872320	7875120	You know, he made this claim the universe is a fluctuation
7875600	7880000	You know the fact that we are in in the state where we're not kind of you know
7880000	7886800	Where we aren't at sort of the maximally disordered state and I kept on saying that's just a completely crazy claim
7886880	7889520	Because it's like everything we know is a fluctuation
7889840	7893840	So, you know, I think I I would be more eloquent these days than I was back
7894400	7896400	I'm on your side. Yeah, and um
7896960	7899040	And explaining why that was such a such a
7900320	7904800	A wrong idea, but anyway, no the first the first thing to understand is that
7905680	7911120	People say oh, you know, eventually the universe will kind of unwind and there'll be nothing interesting in it
7911120	7914240	There'll be no structure in it. It will all just be in a high entropy state
7914880	7919920	Okay, my claim is the reason you say that is because you're not an adequate demon
7920800	7922800	That is in fact
7922880	7927920	In the future of the universe if it turns out that it's all just seems like a gas and equilibrium and so on
7928400	7932720	That you might say that's completely boring. That's all just random. It's the high entropy state
7933280	7938160	But to another kind of observer they might say but look at all those little details about what's happening
7938480	7942400	This is the most amazing complex structure that you can imagine
7942800	7945360	I mean, I I happen to think if we if we ask
7945760	7951040	What will we look back on this time in scientific history and say how could those guys have missed this point?
7951920	7957200	My guess is one of the bigger things will be when people describe something like a gas and thermal equilibrium
7957520	7959520	They just say it has a certain pressure and temperature
7960080	7963680	They don't consider any other features of the gas. They don't say
7964160	7966400	Oh, it's got the little microscopic, you know
7966880	7968880	Things that we can measure in this way and that way
7969120	7975200	But my guess is that there are a lot of other features now this question of are they computationally boundedly observable?
7975520	7981120	Are they are they measurable by a computationally bounded observer? I don't know the answer to that really
7981600	7988160	Um, but the the the point the the claim I'm making is that when you say it's going to a high entropy state
7988800	7996160	You're saying oh that all you're saying is so I as a as an observer of the kind of observer
7996240	7997280	I am
7997280	8001040	Can't make anything out of it other than to say it's uniform and random
8001520	8003760	I think I'm actually saying more than that. I think in this case
8003760	8008880	I'm going to disagree with you because I think that it actually goes to the vacuum quantum state the
8009280	8012160	the bunch Davis vacuum of decider space it's it's
8013040	8015040	It's a dissipative system because there are
8015600	8019920	There's a horizon around us and within our horizon all the excitations above the vacuum
8020400	8025040	Go away and and there is no structure there to be seen by any observer
8026080	8028640	Computationally bounded or otherwise. What do you think is in the vacuum?
8029600	8033360	Well, it's a single quantum state thinking in quantum mechanical terms. It's a unique
8033840	8035840	The lowest energy state that's
8035840	8039280	So I would claim that's the mistake and it's it may be interesting to try and take that apart
8039920	8041920	so in our models
8042000	8044000	The very fact that there's space there
8044480	8048960	Space is a thing in our models. You have to make space. You don't just get to say
8049520	8051520	Oh, there's this big area of space
8051600	8057840	Space is made of something and in our models space is made of this sort of teaming collection of atoms of space doing all these
8058240	8059440	complicated things
8059440	8064320	So our vacuum cannot be just the boring. There's nothing there vacuum
8064640	8069520	Our vacuum has to have a lot of structure in it. Now if you ask the question if you say
8070480	8074880	Every particle excitation has gone over the horizon. That's what you're basically saying
8075360	8079200	So let's think about that for a second. What does that mean in in our models?
8079680	8084160	So horizons in our models are visible in essentially
8085040	8092880	Breaks in the causal graph. So the causal graph says this is the you know causal effects can propagate between these
8093120	8096320	Between these at this event can affect this event can affect this event
8096640	8104000	And you make these light cones where one event is having an effect on a whole sort of increasing size cone of other events
8104240	8107600	Right. So what is a what is an event horizon an event horizon?
8108000	8111840	Is and you literally see this in our models when you run them and like these black holes
8111840	8115520	You can literally see the event horizon and it's a place where the causal edges
8116000	8118480	For example in a black hole the causal edges go one way
8118960	8121120	The causal edges go in and they can't come out
8121680	8123680	And that's it's very concrete
8124160	8128320	And so a cosmological event horizon is something where you're separating in the causal graph
8128320	8130880	You have two different regions of the causal graph
8131360	8135280	And they are you simply have no causal edges that go from one side to the other
8135840	8142000	So what you would be saying is what what you're claiming is every particle excitation has
8142640	8147840	Somehow is is in a region of space that is causally disconnected
8148320	8151520	From the region of space that that we care about so to speak
8152240	8154240	So I think my my statement would be
8155040	8157040	I mean your claim is an interesting one because
8157200	8164400	Basically what you're saying is that all the big particle excitations all these sort of identifiable topological excitations
8165040	8168960	Will be gone and outside the you know outside of this event horizon
8169440	8175680	Now what I would be saying is that in order for there to be space inside there there still has to be stuff going on
8176320	8180640	Now what so what this turns into is an argument about
8181200	8183200	Is is there
8183360	8188720	Stuff that is there useful stuff in that region of the universe and by useful stuff
8188800	8193200	You might say it's this complicated topological structure that represents a photon
8194080	8199040	But that depends on you know, and so you say the observer an observer
8199440	8205440	That you know about right now is observing things like photons is observing these big complicated topological structure
8206160	8210480	But you know in terms of the pure underlying structure of the universe
8210880	8215360	You could still have all these little atoms of space doing their thing. It's just maybe
8215920	8217920	Maybe it's smoothed out enough
8218400	8224240	Conceivably that there aren't any of these sort of identifiable topologically stable structures that still exist there
8224240	8230720	That's a possible that's a possible kind of and then the observer would have to be at the demon level
8230720	8234240	So to speak in order to observe that there's anything interesting happening there
8234640	8239120	And not at a level if the observer is made of particles for example is made of photons
8239520	8243680	That might be the case that you you couldn't get with an observer made of photons
8243840	8248240	You simply couldn't get information about that more microscopic structure
8249200	8255520	So, yeah, I think we should postpone this to either an in-person conversation or me appearing on your podcast because
8256160	8259440	It does get kind of technical at some point, but I don't want to
8260320	8264320	Not give you an opportunity to talk about the beginning of the universe. You talked about the end there
8265040	8267040	But is there is I
8267680	8272000	I'm going to guess that you're going to say that there is a principled reason within this approach to
8272640	8276240	Start in what looks something like very roughly the big bang
8278000	8282320	Well, okay, so the question is what you know in these models
8282880	8284880	Okay, this gets us into another
8285360	8290560	This is a deep rabbit hole that we're about to enter but but let me let me say a few things about it because it's something
8290560	8293600	I've recently been thinking a lot about the the um
8294800	8296800	so
8298000	8299600	The
8299600	8301600	Okay, so in these models
8303040	8306400	You might imagine that the universe starts as a fairly small
8307040	8309040	Hypergraph and gradually expands
8309360	8311760	And so one of the mistakes I've been trying to not make
8312320	8319280	Is kind of a repeat of the einstein mistake so to speak because in our models the most natural thing is that this hypergraph
8319360	8325280	Just expands dramatically with time. Okay, and you know, I'm I'm not
8325840	8330400	I I have a great tendency and this is kind of a reverse engineering type tendency to say no
8330400	8336560	No, there's got to be these other rules that reduce the size of the hypergraph so that it doesn't expand insanely
8337040	8342480	You know just like einstein was saying well, you know, even though the einstein equations predict the universe should expand
8342480	8346880	Of course, we know it doesn't expand except it turns out actually we discovered it does expand
8347040	8353040	So i'm trying to not repeat that mistake, but um, uh, you know, I think that the current
8354160	8357600	Expectation would be that just as there's a simple rule
8358000	8362240	So also there's a simple initial condition and that is a small hypergraph
8362800	8369280	And which is something that doesn't really even define a dimension because it's just a tiny little hypergraph and it starts expanding
8369680	8375440	And at the beginning that expansion is like, you know is is uh, uh, is something which effect
8375760	8377360	It has high dimension then it goes down
8377360	8382240	So one of the things we've been trying to do which is probably more in your in your day job wheelhouse
8382320	8387120	So to speak is we'd really like to know what the analog of the Friedman Robertson walker
8387840	8389680	Model of the universe is
8389680	8391040	For dimension change
8391040	8396400	So we were pretty sure that there is a an analog for a homogeneous isotropic universe
8396960	8402960	That there's something just like the usual model just as it's homogeneous and the universe is homogeneous and isotropic
8403280	8405840	So what does the scale factor of the universe? What does the you know?
8405840	8407840	How does that how does that work with time?
8408160	8413040	We're pretty sure there's a directly analogous thing that describes dimension change in the universe
8413600	8419040	And that will be the effective equations that describe in our models the very early universe
8419760	8421360	Yeah, I think
8421360	8426800	There it's actually i'll just sort of mention a couple of things for your benefit as well for the audiences
8427680	8433360	If you want to imagine you have a bunch of dimensions that start small and some of them start expanding
8433840	8437760	There's a very set of cute models from brandenburger and wafa
8439040	8442240	Based on string theory, but they have a way why only three
8443200	8447440	Dimensions of space would start expanding and it's basically because you can tie your shoes in three dimensions
8447440	8452480	But not in four dimensions, right strings will generically intersect in three dimensions
8452640	8457280	But not higher numbers of dimensions. So that was there. I wrote that down. I'm gonna look that up. That's yeah, that's a fun one
8457760	8460560	The dual of that the converse was actually
8461200	8465360	By me and lisa randall and matt johnson where we showed how if you start with
8466080	8470960	Higher dimensional decider space you could actually create a sub universe with fewer
8471440	8478640	Microscopic dimensions by spontaneously compactifying some dimensions. So I think dynamically given curve space time
8478640	8484000	You're allowed to go either way you can have them all small and let some grow or you can have them all big and let some shrink
8484960	8489360	Oh, that's interesting. I mean, you know in the question is if it's homogeneous and isotopic
8489440	8492080	Whatever the generalization of that for dimension changes
8492640	8499120	What I expect is that there's going to be some equation that eventually will have the dimension and the scale factor in it
8499520	8504240	And it will be a only those things. So you don't in the things you were just describing
8504640	8508880	There's presumably non homogeneity because you're saying that there are some, you know
8509440	8515440	Pieces some dimensions that grows some that shrink and so on this will be kind of the the homogeneous isotropic analog of that
8515680	8517680	I mean, I think this is a in a sense
8517680	8521440	This is a quintessential not particularly easy mathematical physics problem
8521760	8525840	But it is in a sense. It's it's the reason one reason it's not easy
8525920	8528800	And it's perhaps of perhaps interesting to say is that
8529520	8536400	Calculus which is what all of this stuff is based on is a story of changes with respect to a variable like time
8537120	8540640	But in our models and you know when people do multivariate calculus
8540960	8544800	They're doing calculus with you know with two variables or three variables
8545200	8548240	But they never get to do calculus with two and a half variables
8548720	8551840	That's not a thing and nobody knows how that works
8552400	8559600	And so in our models what we effectively have to do is go below the level of where we talk about variables
8560080	8562080	And we're actually in our hypergraphs
8562320	8566000	You can think about a direction in the hypergraph as being like a variable
8566320	8570400	So as you move through the hypergraph in a certain direction, that's like a variable
8570640	8574640	But if the hypergraph is a big mess, it's not obvious what you mean by a direction
8574960	8580320	If the hypergraph was a nice orderly like crystal like thing, then you'd have a well-defined notion of direction
8580640	8585440	But in the actual hypergraph you don't right and that's some and that's kind of where you begin
8585520	8588880	I mean that there needs to be a generalization of calculus made
8589200	8595840	That works in fractional dimensional space on these hypergraphs and so on and that's kind of the that's the technical difficulty of this
8595920	8600080	But but that's I mean it's interesting. I'm I'm I'm gonna look up that that that reference
8600400	8605760	That's that's very useful. Well good and and I think this leads actually very naturally into the final big issue
8605760	8607760	I wanted to address
8607840	8610880	Which is locality and you know you talked a lot
8610880	8613760	I think even though I never got to sort of specifically ask
8613760	8619680	I think you've done a good job of explaining how spacetime arises and einstein's equation and general relativity and as you said
8620320	8622480	Three dimensions doesn't seem to magically come out
8622480	8627840	But maybe we can figure that we get it with the right rules so that that's future work good
8629360	8633440	But locality is an interesting thing by locality. I just mean the fact that in space
8634320	8640480	The laws of physics for the most part have the property that if you poke the system in one location of space
8640880	8645840	The effects ripple out locally right only to nearest neighbors as you go forward in time
8646160	8652000	So that's one thing you might want to get out of an approach like yours is that you have this notion of locality
8652240	8654240	Quantum field theory is based on locality
8654640	8659680	But in the real world, there's at least two interesting places where we think locality breaks down
8659760	8663360	One is in quantum measurement with bells inequality, right?
8663920	8670320	And the other is potentially in quantum gravity with the holographic principle complementarity adscft
8671200	8678720	So what is your feeling about how you can thread that needle of getting enough locality out of your rules but also
8679680	8682000	slight deviations from locality when you need them
8682560	8687600	Okay, my current guess is the following in space and physical what in these hypergraphs
8688160	8691360	We are saying there's a a certain
8692000	8693120	clump of
8693120	8697840	Of nodes in the hypergraph that have this structure. They get transformed into one of that structure
8698320	8703440	That's an essential local in space in the sense that it involves this local region of nodes in the hypergraph
8704160	8705040	Okay
8705040	8710720	Now there's two kinds of locality one is spatial locality and the other is bronchial locality
8711040	8717520	In other words is it and so my guess is and the way that things like bells inequality that the violation of bells inequality
8717600	8719600	come out is through
8719760	8720720	non
8720720	8722160	That that
8722160	8724160	bronchial space
8724240	8727280	Is differently laid out than physical space physical space
8727360	8733200	We we know in this hypergraph that it's you know, we are we are choosing to a rule
8733600	8735600	That is local with respect to the hypergraph
8736000	8740880	But the question of what counts as local in this in in bronchial space
8741360	8743360	Locality is a different story
8743360	8749440	Locality is a story there of well, it's it's just a different kind of thing because it involves these the ancestry
8750560	8755760	Ancestry in the multi-way graph and so on so I think that the the story there
8757040	8758240	is
8758240	8764800	Locality in bronchial space is a different issue and for example, you can ask what's the analog of a light cone in bronchial space
8765200	8770160	So in physical space, you know, you make a perturbation somewhere it expands at the speed of light
8770720	8776000	What happens in bronchial space? Well, it also expands at finite speed in our models
8776640	8780080	And that means there is a maximum entanglement speed in quantum mechanics
8780800	8782000	and
8782000	8786480	That the the value of that we only need we only have one parameter we really need
8786720	8788720	So if we knew the elementary length
8788800	8794160	Or if we knew the elementary time or the elementary energy right or if we knew the maximum entanglement speed
8794560	8799840	Any, you know, any one of those parameters is enough to determine the length scale for our models
8800880	8806000	But the this maximum entanglement speed is saying in bronchial space
8806720	8808720	you have a
8809120	8811840	One vague estimate that we have is the the
8812800	8816000	Maximum entanglement speed is 10 to the 5 solar masses per second
8816560	8819520	I don't know if that's correct. That's based on a very hokey
8820000	8822960	Calculation that I did which makes a bunch of assumptions
8823920	8828240	But it gives you some sense of scale if if that was the right value we would observe
8828720	8830240	We would observe
8830240	8832240	limitations on black hole mergers
8832880	8838960	Of big black holes or very rapid mergers that are associated with maximum entanglement speed rather than speed of light
8839840	8844320	So in a sense, it's a limit of the rate of quantum measurement or the rate of quantum
8844960	8847440	Effects and so one question is
8848240	8850640	Which which we were just thinking about recently
8851120	8858160	Is can we actually bound in other words in in these violation of bells inequality experiments where you're looking at?
8858640	8863600	Propagation of physical space and you're saying it seems to happen instantaneously in physical space
8864320	8868480	Well, the reason that's happening is because that propagation
8868480	8871600	So to speak is actually happening in our models in bronchial space
8872000	8874160	Which is a different story than physical space
8874720	8879360	But if we knew the maximum entanglement speed we might be able to make bounds
8879920	8884160	On that speed in physical space, which would mean that even though
8884640	8890080	You know these these various bells inequality, you know entanglement experiments and so on are
8891360	8896640	Are much, you know, they seem instantaneous so to speak that actually there might be a finite bound
8896640	8898320	We're not sure about that yet
8898320	8900800	I think it's probably not exactly the same, but this is certainly
8901360	8906320	Spiritually a similar answer to what an ever-ready and would give to the whole bells inequality
8906960	8908960	Question there's there's not a unique
8909040	8911040	measurement outcome in in space
8911120	8915360	So the the rules that bell was assuming do not necessarily apply
8916480	8918480	right, I mean, I think that so
8918800	8925360	In so by the way, this maximum entanglement speed has all kinds of consequences. So for example, you can have entanglement horizons
8925920	8927760	so you can have a a
8927760	8929760	Essentially a horizon in bronchial space
8930160	8935920	And so one of the things we suspect but we don't yet know is that there's an entanglement horizon outside of the
8937280	8939760	physical event horizon in black holes
8940400	8946640	And so what that means is so so far we can get black holes in our single thread of history
8947840	8950640	You know not dealing with multiway causal graphs
8951040	8954160	It's just a technically difficult thing to do the analogous
8954640	8958640	Calculation for a multiway graph, but we think we'll be able to do that and at that point
8958640	8963440	We will see black holes that have an event horizon in physical space
8964000	8966000	And an event horizon in bronchial space
8966640	8970560	And so the question is and that is an interesting thing because you know
8970560	8973760	If you think about the propagation of information in the history of a black hole
8974160	8980800	There's a question of can information be trapped between the entanglement horizon and the physical event horizon
8981360	8986080	And that and so one of the questions is if you're an observer falling into a black hole
8986560	8992080	And you're you know, when you when you're an observer falling into a black hole to the outside world
8992400	8998480	You know time has stopped for you know your and so the question is what's the analogous thing that happens in the entanglement horizon?
8998960	9000960	And I think what happens is kind of cute
9001360	9007440	I think what happens is that the observer at the entanglement horizon cannot form a classical thought
9009520	9014480	So sorry from the from the observers point of view, they just fall right through though in classical gr
9014960	9017360	Yes, yes, right, but to a person correct
9017760	9021600	So that is to a person far away from the entanglement horizon
9022080	9027760	They would conclude that the observer at the entanglement horizon could not form a classical thought
9028080	9032880	So that means they could never in the in the sort of traditional quantum mechanics world
9032880	9038000	They could never collapse the wave function. They could never and so what would happen is for them
9038320	9042720	You know that they're observing, you know some virtual particle pair, you know
9043360	9047040	You know did that did that electron go into the black hole or not?
9047840	9051520	Well, they don't know because they can't form the classical thought
9051920	9054320	To determine whether it went into the black hole or not
9054880	9059680	And so that's how that's our kind of at least qualitative thinking about
9060480	9061040	uh
9061040	9064160	That's sort of black hole information paradox kinds of things in our models
9064560	9069360	I I would suspect that that that um, I know I haven't worked on this
9069360	9072640	but Jonathan Gorat has worked a bunch on the er equals epr
9073120	9075120	story in our models and
9075840	9080000	Claims that he is about to produce an actual sort of explicit
9080720	9083840	Simulation of an er equals epr thing
9084400	9090080	So that that um, uh, which has been I mean, it's an imminent claim. So it will have to arrive in the next
9090160	9091120	That's fine low
9091120	9096720	I mean maybe by the time the episode comes out, but it does remind me of a potential and I promise is the last thing a potential
9097440	9099440	quantitative question
9100720	9108240	The entropy of a black hole is its horizon area divided by four measured in plank units according to Hawking and Beckenstein
9109280	9116320	Someone like me would interpret that as saying that the black hole is described by a factor of Hilbert space
9117040	9120720	With a dimensionality approximately e to that number
9121440	9124240	But the plank length is not fundamental for you
9124320	9129360	Is there any chance that you would be able to calculate the Beckenstein Hawking entropy and get the right answer?
9130160	9133040	Yeah, that's an interesting question. So I mean in
9135360	9137360	Uh
9137920	9142160	You know the notion of what black hole entropy is what is entropy
9142640	9148640	Entropy is basically a measure of the number of states the number of microscopic states of a system
9149120	9154480	Consistent with the macroscopic thing that you identify as being the system so to speak
9154880	9158800	So this is basically saying given this thing that we say is a black hole
9159280	9165040	How many possible microscopic states are consistent with this macroscopic observation that it is a black hole?
9165600	9166800	so
9166800	9168800	I would think
9168960	9171360	That we should be able to compute that
9172160	9173440	um
9173440	9175440	And let me think how would we
9175680	9177280	uh
9177280	9183280	Yeah, I mean I can imagine how we would compute that. Um, and I think it will you know what we have to do
9184640	9186640	Okay, so in spacetime
9187280	9191360	We can see these event horizons in the causal graph you can explicitly
9191360	9196560	I've even studied them a bunch and you can see all kinds of exotic black holes inside black holes and all kinds of
9196880	9204240	Interesting and wild things that can happen. Um, but uh, the I just I started looking at the multi-way version of that
9204640	9206640	It's just computationally hard
9206640	9214240	Because that what's happening is you you you get these, you know, it's for the exact reason you've got this big exponential in there
9214480	9218880	Yeah, you've got this, you know all these different threads of history that you have to account for
9219440	9224960	And as I say, there is an optimization of this that another person working on this project max piscinoff has been working on
9225520	9232400	For most of the last year actually, um, which is the theory of local multi-way systems, which are systems. So
9233120	9235120	So, um
9236320	9240640	The idea is okay, so so roughly the idea is the following so you have
9242000	9247440	In when you're looking at this causal graph that represents all these different events and they're happening through time
9247600	9251280	And you say i'm going to take a slice of this causal graph at a particular
9251440	9253360	What I consider to be a particular moment in time
9253600	9258640	Then I've got a structure of space associated with those causal connections and so on
9259200	9261360	That is that is getting us a version of space
9262160	9264160	When we also have this multi-way graph
9265520	9266640	There are
9266640	9268960	There are many different configurations for space
9269440	9272160	But so there's this notion that I was calling multi space
9272720	9275120	Which is this thing where every place in space
9275520	9279200	There's also the essentially this stack of multi-way possibilities
9279920	9287040	And what's difficult is to understand we can say, okay, there's this multi-way graph and the whole universe is one node in this multi-way graph
9287600	9292320	Or we can say we've got one path in the multi-way graph and now we're going to look at what happens in space
9292720	9299280	But the the the thing we're trying to do is to see how do we get a representation that knits those two things together
9299760	9301760	Where we are looking at
9301840	9303280	locality in space
9303280	9305600	And essentially locality in branch real space
9306160	9311040	And being able to sort of have those two things combined if we can successfully do this
9311440	9316880	I'm pretty sure we can do essentially numerical quantum field theory and we can do it in
9317040	9320720	You know in the traditional way this is done. It's either Feynman diagrams or it's lattice gauge theory
9320960	9322960	Lattice gauge theory is an imaginary time
9323360	9325840	Which is kind of a you know, not great
9326400	9329280	And in in this in this setup
9329280	9331120	We will be able to do it in actual time
9331600	9335040	And and we'll be able to do it and then you know the question of whether we see
9335440	9339440	Sort of perturbation theory and Feynman diagram is a story of what happens with our
9339840	9344640	You know with our topological excitations and so on that might be a more complicated story. But anyway, that's a
9345520	9348800	Uh, yeah, I mean the the thing that's really
9350000	9352000	To me
9352560	9358320	You know just tremendously exciting about this whole thing is you know, there's this underlying structure
9358720	9363120	And we keep on being able to figure out more and more stuff. It's not easy to figure out these things
9363520	9368560	But it's like nothing is we're not ending up running into something where we say, oh my gosh
9369040	9373200	That's you know, we just can't explain that that's just a thing which just is you know
9373520	9375680	Totally orthogonal to what our models are saying
9376240	9378400	And that's some and the other thing that's happening
9378880	9384160	Which I think is that we keep on running into things which say, oh, that's just like causal set theory
9384480	9389520	Oh, that's just like, you know, constructor theory or whatever. Oh, that's just like one of these other
9389920	9394400	theories that's been developed and what's you know, to me both
9395120	9397120	intellectually and sociologically
9397120	9402240	A terrific thing is that you know the results that people have developed in these theories
9402640	9404640	Like take causal set theory for example
9404880	9408400	There's been kind of a mystery, you know, you're just throwing down events in spacetime
9408720	9412640	And you're saying just look at the relationship between those events in a causal graph
9413040	9418400	But there's been kind of a mystery. Why are the event thrown down in just such a way that you get Lorentz invariance?
9418640	9423440	Yeah, well in our models we have an algorithmic procedure for generating those events
9423840	9425920	Which immediately gives you Lorentz invariance
9426400	9430560	But yet the all the mathematics that people have done in causal set theory
9431040	9436640	Which works on arbitrary collections of events in spacetime can be applied to our models
9437040	9442720	And so that's a that's a really neat thing and I'm you know, it's looking and the same thing
9443200	9445200	I mean, we've been
9445200	9450560	In higher category theory is another, you know, very elaborate area of mathematics
9451280	9456560	Which is I mean our stuff is a concretization is a concrete instance
9456960	9463440	Of higher category theory and all kinds of rewards that exist in higher category theory that have been extremely abstract
9463920	9467040	Basically, my test is I can now understand a bunch of these results
9467360	9469360	Which I've never been able to do before
9469520	9475920	So because they have a concrete instantiation and you know, one of the things which we which we are not going to have a chance to talk about here
9475920	9481920	But the question of of um, which we sort of started to talk about is why this universe and not another one
9482320	9484320	You know, why does this universe exist at all?
9485280	9488160	That we seem to be able to have some things to say about
9488640	9493760	And it turns out that it's all to do with this limit of higher category theory
9494000	9499760	Which turns out to also be this limit of running all possible rules in a multi-way graph
9500320	9502480	And these are things related to this thing
9503600	9505600	called the infinity groupoid, which was
9506240	9507600	you know
9507600	9509920	introduced by this chap growth and deke who was a very
9510880	9512880	Abstract, abstruse mathematician
9513280	9516480	And I never thought I would have any reason to care about the infinity groupoid
9516960	9520240	Except that it seems that it is the limit of a bunch of our models
9520640	9524720	And it seems that it's it's deeply related to a lot of things about sort of
9525600	9528960	Why this universe and and why does the universe exist anyway?
9529520	9536720	And you know just as a teaser of something we're not going to have a chance to talk about but but one of the things that I've been excited about recently
9537280	9538160	is
9538160	9540160	Just as we are making this sort of
9540240	9544560	foundational model for physics. I would like to make a foundational model of mathematics
9545280	9549200	And we're talking about the set of all possible rules for a physical universe
9549600	9552480	You can also talk about the set of all possible rules in mathematics
9553040	9561280	And one of my recent conclusions is if we believe that the universe exists, which presumably we do because that's a notion of existence that we
9561680	9566640	Are pretty familiar with then it necessarily follows that mathematics exists
9566800	9569840	In the same way and that our doing of mathematics
9570480	9574880	Is kind of carving out pieces of this kind of structure that is all of mathematics
9575280	9578800	In much the same way that we're kind of carving out pieces of the universe to observe
9578880	9582960	But anyway, that's a that's a that's a a coming attraction as yet
9583840	9587280	I mean what I want to do is to find a bulk theory of mathematics
9587680	9592240	In the same way that we have bulk theories like relativity and quantum mechanics and and physics
9593120	9598800	Well, I can I can tell you that uh, it was just a couple months ago that we had a podcast episode with emily real
9599200	9604240	A mathematician from johns hopkins a category theorist and we talked about the infinity groupoid
9604880	9610480	Oh, good. Very good. We talked about the infinity groupoid, which tells me both that there's a unity to all of knowledge
9610800	9613680	But also there's a plenty of room to go, which I think that everyone
9614080	9619440	Listening to this episode will definitely get that impression. So steven wolffron. Thanks very much for being on the mindscape podcast
9619440	9622320	That was fun. Good stuff
