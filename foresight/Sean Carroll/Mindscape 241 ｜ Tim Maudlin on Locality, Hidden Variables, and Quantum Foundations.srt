00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,720
Today's podcast is one of those long-awaited episodes. People have been

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,600
asking for this one for a long time. You know, it's funny. Sometimes there are

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,640
some possible guests who are just so obviously Mindscape guests, and I haven't

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,120
had them on yet, and people are like, well, what's wrong? Why doesn't he have them on

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,560
yet? They must be feuding. There must be beef or something like that. That's not

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,160
usually the correct answer. It's usually just that I'd like to space them out.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,760
As I've said many times, I like to have a variety, and that includes both people

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,360
who I know very well and I'm familiar with their work and the people I've never

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,720
heard of before. I got to looking for podcast guests. So Tim Maldon is someone

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,160
I've known for a long time. He's a leader in the philosophy of physics or what we

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,920
sometimes call the foundations of physics. So studying not physics as a

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,440
philosopher, but studying nature as a philosopher, but doing so in such a way

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,920
that you're looking at the foundational questions of nature. You're asking the

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,720
why questions, the deep questions. You're trying to be very careful. And Tim has

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,120
done very important work in thinking about space time and the geometry of

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,520
space time, the nature of time and the arrow of time. I will point to, I'll try

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,920
to link in the show notes to a wonderful mock debate that was done at the

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,800
Foundational Questions Institute between Tim and Julian Barber. Julian Barber

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,040
famously has advocated that time does not exist. Tim has famously advocated that

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,400
not only does time exist, but the arrow of time is fundamental, not just an

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,760
emergent approximation because of statistical mechanics. And what FUXI

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,080
does is it has the debaters flip sides. So Julian was arguing in favor of the

24
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,400
existence of time. Tim was arguing against it. And they were both really,

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,000
really good. I got to say, they were both quite persuasive. For the points of

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,600
view, they didn't actually agree with as well as being quite amusing along the

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,480
way. But today, we're actually going to be talking about quantum mechanics. In

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,760
some sense, this can be thought of as a sequel to the podcast they did a while

29
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,720
back with David Albert talking about quantum mechanics. David and Tim are

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,120
very good friends and have worked together for a long time. They don't agree

31
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,880
on everything because no two philosophers agree on everything. But they are

32
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,080
united in their skepticism about the Everett interpretation of quantum

33
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,320
mechanics. And so with David on the podcast, even though I'm pro Everett, I

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,280
want to give the voice to sensible voices on the other side, sensible points

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,760
of view. And so David explained why he doesn't like the Everett interpretation.

36
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,880
What we didn't get to right at a time was what he does like. So today with Tim,

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,600
we're going to be talking mostly about Bohmian or de Broglie-Bohm versions of

38
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,040
quantum mechanics, sometimes called hidden variable versions of quantum

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,240
mechanics. I keep calling them hidden variable theories as most people do,

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,400
even though as advocates like to point out, the variables are not hidden. The

41
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,120
extra variables that you add to quantum mechanics to make a hidden variable

42
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,080
theory are the ones that you observe when you actually make a measurement. And

43
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,640
physicists have not really caught on to hidden variable theories. They're not

44
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,920
very popular. But certain sets of people, some physicists, some mathematicians,

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,800
some philosophers have kept the flame alive. And interestingly, as we talk

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,720
about in the podcast, the Nobel Prize last year was given to tests of John

47
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,680
Bell's famous theorems, his famous inequalities, which were very much

48
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,120
prompted. Bell's exploration of these theorems and his proof of them was

49
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,240
prompted by David Bohm's hidden variable theory, which Bell thought was the

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,240
best formulated known version of quantum mechanics. Bell thought we should be

51
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,000
teaching it in textbooks. So it's a little weird that the people who really

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,320
take these theories seriously get good results that later lead to Nobel

53
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,360
Prizes, yet the theories themselves are not very popular within physics. Again,

54
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,360
I could give my reasons for not being a fan of hidden variable theories, but

55
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,120
they are, as Tim says about Everett, they are absolutely a serious attempt.

56
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,840
You know, it's something that you should think about if you care about these

57
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,000
things. And so we'll give the sales pitch for why you should take these

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,200
seriously. We'll talk a little bit about foundations of physics more generally

59
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,720
and even a little bit about the arrow of time. And the other thing that I want

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,400
to mention, because Tim reminded me of it at the very end of the podcast is

61
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,240
Tim is a the director and I think his title is director. But anyway, he's

62
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,000
the founder of something called the John Bell Institute for the foundations of

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,160
physics. Tim has been very active, not only in doing foundations of physics, but

64
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,760
in advocating for the status of this subdiscipline within philosophy and

65
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,400
physics. And the Bell Institute, which is located in Croatia and serves as a

66
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,720
place to meet and talk about foundations of physics is trying to raise funds to

67
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,960
get a permanent home. So they literally have a GoFundMe and you can visit the

68
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,240
John Bell Institute home page at johnbellinstitute.org that will link you

69
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,080
to a donate button. You can donate to the permanent home for the John Bell

70
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,280
Institute, where we're not there yet. We need a bunch more donations, but I

71
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,960
think they just started. So it's early days. Maybe mind scape listeners will

72
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,480
kick in a little bit. And with that, let's go.

73
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,400
Tim Maldon, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. Thank you. Good to be here.

74
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,400
So you've been a champion for a little while of something called the

75
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,160
foundations of physics. So I want to ask you two questions. One is, what is that

76
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,560
for the listeners out there? But also, what's your sales pitch like? Hypothetically,

77
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,000
if you're talking to your colleagues in a physics department or philosophy

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,560
department, how do you explain to them why foundations of physics is so important?

79
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,880
Okay. Oddly enough, I don't have to sell it to the to the philosophers. It's a

80
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,480
weird situation. You have to sell it to the physicists. But it's very simple.

81
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,240
Really, foundations of physics, as the name suggests, is a branch of physics,

82
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,080
namely the one that asks, what are the most fundamental items? How do we

83
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,280
understand the most fundamental physical structures and things that there are?

84
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,480
And that's only part of physics, because you could do condensed matter

85
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,200
physics, where you say, I'm just worried about other states or the physics of

86
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,840
stars, and you take for granted a lot of the micro stuff, or at least how to

87
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,560
handle it. And then you're building up from there. But if you just dig and dig

88
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,440
and dig and say, at the very bottom, what's the stuff that doesn't get

89
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,120
explained in terms of other stuff? That's the foundations. And so if you do that

90
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,600
in physics, that's the foundations of physics. In philosophy, it's easy. I

91
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,280
actually just gave a talk about this to the undergraduates at Rutgers, because

92
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,400
that is part of what philosophers call metaphysics or ontology, which is again

93
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:18,720
just the question of what exists asked at the most generic level. And if you're

94
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,080
a physicalist, you think everything that exists is somehow physical. If you're

95
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,240
not, you might think there are other things that aren't physical, but

96
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,880
everybody pretty much agrees. There's some physical stuff.

97
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,960
Not everybody's happy, but not everybody. Of course, every time you say

98
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,840
something, you can think of a counter example, unfortunately. Now, the curious

99
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,400
thing, if I describe it that way, is you say, but why should you have to sell

100
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,120
this to the physicists? Why isn't this just part of the physics curriculum? And

101
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,520
that has a very strange and disturbing sociological answer that really goes

102
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,920
back to quantum mechanics, because they didn't really understand when the

103
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,680
quantum mechanical formalism was first developed in a way that was very

104
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,440
predictively successful. They really didn't understand what they were talking

105
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,680
about. They, the physicists? They, the physicists, the physicists who came up

106
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,440
with the math. And you can come up with math and understand how to manipulate it

107
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,800
to get predictions, but still not look at that math and be quite sure what the

108
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,120
physics underlying it is. And those were very good questions, and they were asked

109
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,160
very rigorously and vociferously early on by people like Einstein, people like

110
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,560
Schrodinger, people who were very deeply involved, even in the development of the

111
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:42,440
theory. But at a certain point, another crew, led by Bohr, and to some extent

112
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,440
Heisenberg, kind of said, well, don't ask those questions, either because for

113
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,080
some deep philosophical reason, they're not good questions, although they sound

114
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,720
pretty good, or eventually, this morphed into what people call shut up and

115
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,840
calculate, where you don't even explain. You just say, don't ask those questions.

116
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,120
I mean, my impression would have been that Bohr and Heisenberg were more like,

117
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,320
we filled you the answer to those questions. And then when the Americans got

118
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,160
hold of it, it was like, just don't even ask those questions.

119
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,560
That's my take on it, was that it was, I mean, Bohr, Bohr's background was in

120
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Neoconti and philosophy. He actually said very, very, very mysterious things.

121
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,440
And I would say early on, the idea of the Copenhagen School was, say, some

122
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,760
incomprehensible stuff and then calculate. And then when it came to America,

123
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,200
they cut out the first step.

124
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,560
Good. And so, but he said sociological reasons. I mean, I can imagine why,

125
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,520
well, don't let me imagine. What is in your opinion, the sociological reason

126
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,840
why physicists would stop asking what is going on at the fundamental nature of reality?

127
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,160
So, and I'm speculating here, when they first started, everybody's

128
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,000
familiar with this picture of the atom as a kind of planetary system with a

129
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,880
nucleus and then these electrons whizzing about it. We still kind of picture it that way.

130
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,880
And that was sort of what was called the old quantum theory said that.

131
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,720
And it said, by the way, these electron orbits are restricted. They can't just

132
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,360
orbit anywhere where a planet can. They're restricted to these particular little

133
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,000
orbits. And then all they can do is jump between them. And when they jump between

134
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,280
them, they'll either give off or or absorb some light. And there was a bunch of

135
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,480
explanation that you could get out of that basic picture. But if you pursue that

136
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,640
picture, the natural question is what, but how do they jump? I mean, what, you

137
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,000
know, how does it get from here to there? And how does it orbit when it's in one of

138
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,560
these orbits and questions like that? And they kind of work beavered away at that

139
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,120
and couldn't make much progress on it. And I think they eventually got to the point

140
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,040
where they, they didn't want to say, yes, those are good questions, which we can't

141
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:00,400
answer. And they were satisfied that they were calculating correctly. And in order

142
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,800
not to say, there's really deep questions, we don't know the answer to, they

143
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,760
said, no, no, no, we've got it. We just have the mathematical formalism. The only

144
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,240
reason you're puzzled is that you're trying to push some classical picture on

145
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,480
the microscopic realm and it doesn't belong there. And your confusion is

146
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,760
arising from you having unjustified desires for comprehension.

147
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,120
I have, I don't know if I've ever mentioned this to you, I have talked to

148
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,880
fellow physicists and I've opined that despite everything I personally care

149
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,840
about more than just correctly predicting the outcomes of experiments. I

150
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,720
actually care about talking about reality. And many of them are very open and

151
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,880
explicit that all they want to do is predict the outcomes of experiments.

152
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,240
Yeah. And I think it would if somebody had a lot of funding and a lot of time, it

153
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,400
would be interesting to figure out at what point these people started saying

154
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:04,600
that because my experience is that young people going into physics care a lot

155
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,480
about trying to understand and they get very upset. And I know this because I

156
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,000
teach foundations of physics in the philosophy department and I get physics

157
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,840
students who say, this is why I went into the field. You're talking about the

158
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:23,440
stuff I was interested in. And I think in most cases, I can't imagine an 18

159
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,280
year old saying, I just want to calculate. So I think that basic curiosity

160
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,880
about the world gets beaten out of them. Yeah. And I really think it's part of a

161
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,560
physics education, unfortunately, to beat it out of you. So we talked about

162
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Einstein and Boris that are but it's still more or less true, he said. I that

163
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,080
that's my impression. I certainly can testify that lots of physics students

164
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,080
will come to me and say, I get very frustrated. I raise questions to my

165
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:00,640
physics professors of the form. What's really going on here? And I'm not told

166
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,600
these are good questions, right? I really am told, don't ask them. Don't don't

167
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,160
spend your time thinking about this. And slight generalization, but the

168
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,000
philosophers to their credit have kept the flame alive. They've been thinking

169
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,640
about these things. Yeah, yeah. It's sort of, you know, it's the same way that

170
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,240
Aristotle kind of had to be squirreled away in the Islamic world for a while and

171
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:27,600
then eventually found his way back. Yes, I do think that that really philosophy

172
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,080
has been a refuge. And in some cases, as you know, like David Albert got his

173
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,320
degree in theoretical physics at Rockefeller, his background was not in

174
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,200
philosophy, but he's in a philosophy department because these questions were

175
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,880
welcomed in philosophy departments and not welcomed in physics departments. Now,

176
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,720
my feeling, I've got a people around us and I have some concrete reason to

177
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,240
believe things are getting better. I actually got an email kind of out of the

178
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,880
blue from a chair of the physics department who said, we're thinking of

179
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,280
trying to introduce foundations of physics into our program. Can you give me

180
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,240
advice about, you know, what we might teach and how it might be done? This was

181
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,160
great. And this was somebody I'd never met. Just, you know,

182
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,600
I was literally just yesterday talking to an undergraduate thinking about

183
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,640
grad school, and she wasn't sure she likes the foundations of physics, but

184
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,640
she's a physics undergrad, so she thought it'd be better to go to a physics

185
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,000
department for grad school. I was asking for advice on where to go, and it was

186
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,600
hard for me to even come up with departments who would let you do that,

187
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,160
right? Right. But maybe it's changed. Yeah. And, you know, and at a certain time,

188
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,560
I guess, that you could say, well, you could go here because, yes, it's a normal

189
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,400
physics department, but at least one or two people on the weekends and a little

190
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,640
bit hiding from their colleagues are interested in these subjects, and we'll

191
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,320
talk to you about them if you catch them, you know, off their clock.

192
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,000
All right. So there's our sociology, but you already opened up the doors to what

193
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,520
we want to talk about, which is these mysteries of quantum mechanics. And

194
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,520
David Albert was on the show. David Wallace was on the show. We were mostly

195
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,200
talking about entropy in the era of time. Adam Becker gave us his wonderful

196
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,360
historical introduction. But when we were talking to David Albert, mostly we

197
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,840
criticized the Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics. I say read, we being

198
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,160
the boy, I was defending it, but I always let the guest talk. So David gave his

199
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:29,040
spiel. So what we didn't get time to get into is, OK, then what instead? So if

200
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,800
put it, let's not talk about Everett today, unless it unless it comes up, I

201
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,720
want to be like substantive and proactive and constructive. What do we do if

202
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,000
we're thinking about what are the what are the mysteries we're trying to solve

203
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,800
about quantum mechanics that got us into this trouble? And what are the avenues

204
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,600
open to solving? Good. So that's a really good question. And there are there

205
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,160
are several different dimensions to it. But let me start with a dimension. And I

206
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:03,640
am going to briefly bring in Everett, but then let it go. Everybody knows there's

207
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,800
this experiment. They say a thought experiment, although you could do it, it

208
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,960
would be cool to do it. That Schrodinger talked about with this cat that

209
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,840
penned up in a cage with a with a bit of radioactive material in a Geiger counter

210
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:25,200
and this diabolical device. Actually, that turns out that Schrodinger was

211
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,560
really just reconfiguring the same thought experiment that Einstein had

212
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,440
written to him just before, which had to do with a keg of gunpowder that either

213
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,560
would or would not explode in the next half hour. And you could calculate a

214
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,160
quantum mechanical probability for it to explode and not explode. And what

215
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,720
Schrodinger was pointing out and what what Einstein was pointing out is that

216
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:57,160
you hold two views, which are very natural views you would like to hold. You

217
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,200
got into what seemed to them to be hopeless difficulties. And the two views

218
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,800
were first of all, when we do quantum mechanics, we describe a system with a

219
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,560
thing called a wave function mathematically. One of the questions is,

220
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:17,080
okay, that wave function, does it provide us a complete description of the

221
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,960
system? Meaning every physical fact about that system one way or another could

222
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,880
be extracted if you gave me the wave function. And this was when Einstein

223
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,960
Podolsky and Rosen wrote in 1935. And this is the same year as the cat paper. And

224
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,400
the cat paper was really a response or a reaction is better to say to the EPR

225
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,280
paper. The title of that paper is quantum mechanical description of reality

226
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,600
complete. This is what they were looking at. And they were arguing in that

227
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,920
paper. No, there's more, there's more to the world than wave functions. If that

228
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,880
were true, of course, then as a physicist, again, not as a philosopher, but as a

229
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,200
physicist, the question is, okay, what else is there? Tell me about the other

230
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,640
stuff. So there's one question is the wave function complete. And then there's

231
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,360
a question about how the wave function evolves through time, what its dynamics

232
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,480
is. And there's a Schrodinger wrote down this wonderful equation that has his

233
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:20,800
name, that has some nice mathematical properties, particularly linearity. And

234
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,400
people certainly wanted to say at least part of the dynamics is this Schrodinger

235
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,200
evolution. And you might say, well, why not just go whole hog and say all of it

236
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,440
is Schrodinger evolution? That's all it ever does. Okay. I like that idea. That

237
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,760
sounds promising. Yeah. So if you put those two together and you say, A, the

238
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,520
wave function is complete and B, it always evolves by Schrodinger evolution. Then

239
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,440
you get into this problem that Schrodinger was pointing out and that Einstein

240
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,280
was pointing out, which is that for the cat or for the gunpowder after an hour,

241
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,960
the wave function doesn't tell you either yes, it has exploded or no, it is not

242
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,480
exploded. Yes, the cat is dead or no, the cat isn't dead. The wave function goes

243
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,040
into this, we call superposition of different states, which normally you

244
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,600
dissociate one state with the exploded gunpowder and another with the unexploded,

245
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,160
but what the wave function gives you is not one or the other, but a kind of

246
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,880
combination of both. And if you say, well, that's a complete description, there

247
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,400
isn't no further fact that's left out. Then you say, but then the cat's neither

248
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,720
alive nor dead or the gunpowder is somehow, you know, weird, suspended state

249
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,640
between exploded and not exploded. And, you know, Schrodinger's view of that was

250
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,400
that that was ridiculous. And John Bell, when he writes about this, I mean, the

251
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,480
way he sums this up is he says, either the wave function as given by the

252
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:56,880
Schrodinger equation is not everything or it's not correct. And Everett, now I'm

253
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,120
just going to say the one thing about Everett is an attempt to say no, it is

254
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,960
both everything and correct. Hiking up with a way to make it both everything

255
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,200
correct. Right. So I would say that's the route that leads you to the many

256
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,280
worlds theory and you understand the motivation. It's to keep both of those

257
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,680
nice things, but it has this price to pay in terms of saying, you know, the idea

258
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,400
that that one cat you put into the cage and either ended up alive or dead. No,

259
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,800
that's not right. They're now, you know, and not just two cats, actually

260
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,400
infinitely many cats. People don't point this out that the there might be only

261
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,360
one live cat, but they're going to be a whole lot of dead cats because the thing

262
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,440
could have decayed at all these different times. Now, if you don't want to go

263
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,880
that way and so we won't spend our time talking about the price you have to pay

264
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,640
and what you have to do. I suppose let's just get our cards in the table for the

265
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,920
audience purposes. You're not a fan. I'm not, but it's a serious attempt. I mean,

266
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,240
you have to be very clear here. There are things I'm not a fan of, but I

267
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,320
appreciate the honesty of people who are fans. If they see the what they have to

268
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,800
confront and they, you know, straightforwardly say, yes, I by making

269
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,680
these commitments, I inherit these problems and I'm going to work on those,

270
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:16,360
right? And nobody should just turn their back in my view on a serious proposal. I

271
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,720
take it to be a serious proposal. I think there are other proposals out there,

272
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,880
which I will not name right now, which I do not think are serious. I don't think

273
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,920
that they have any chance. I would not put many worlds in that basket.

274
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,440
Gotcha. Okay. But if we take off the table, having the wave function be both

275
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,360
complete and always schrodinger, then your options are, all right, if it's not

276
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,240
complete, then there's something else in the world beside the wave function. And

277
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,200
then immediately you ask, okay, what is it? And what does it do? And why am I

278
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,960
talking about wave functions anyway? And things like that. Those are the natural

279
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:00,280
questions you ought to have answers at your fingertips. Or if you say, well, I

280
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,360
think something went wrong with the schrodinger evolution, then you can say,

281
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,280
well, I think the wave function doesn't always evolve in this way. It does this

282
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,800
other thing that people call collapsing, right, or reducing that looks very, very,

283
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,840
very unschrodinger like. This was the way that when John von Neumann wrote down

284
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,120
his understanding of the mathematical foundations of the theory had two processes

285
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,240
for the wave function, the schrodinger process and a collapse process. And that's

286
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,200
also kind of okay at a very high level. But as soon as you say that, you also now

287
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,480
inherit an obligation to tell me, all right, well, when and how does it deviate

288
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,080
from schrodinger evolution? And there are lots of details that can be put in in

289
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:52,920
different ways and different suggestions. Some people think early on that the

290
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:58,120
collapses had to be triggered by something. So things would go nice schrodinger wise

291
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,320
until X. What's the X? Oh, until a measurement is made or till an observation is made.

292
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,480
And then that, of course, astonished. This is something Einstein was very upset about.

293
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,440
Other people are upset about because they say, look, it's what do you mean an

294
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,760
observation? I mean, who can do the observing? Can a mouse observe? Can an amoeba observe?

295
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,320
Can they trigger a collapse of the wave function? If you go that direction in a certain way,

296
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,920
you end up with Wigner who says, oh, we have to talk about consciousness and now you're in the

297
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:34,040
mind body problem and you're in a mess. Other people have said, well, no, there's a kind of

298
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,920
trigger or something that affects collapse, but it's not measurement or observation.

299
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:44,920
It's like, say, gravity. I mean, this is something that Roger Penrose has been advocating

300
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:51,000
for a long time, not with as much precision as a theory as some other things, but that somehow

301
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,640
gravity, which is the one thing that is not well understood quantum mechanically, may come in here

302
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:04,920
as triggering this non schrodinger evolution. And then there's another idea, which is that,

303
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,520
no, it collapses and nothing triggers it. It just happens. It happens randomly from time to time

304
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,800
at a certain rate in a certain way. This is called the spontaneous collapse theories.

305
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,360
And there's a famous theory by a Gerardi-Rominian Weber, the GRW theory,

306
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,600
and they just put numbers to it. I mean, this was the great thing they did. They didn't just

307
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,640
wave their hands. They said, okay, yeah, it collapses every now and then. How often? Well,

308
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:37,240
once every 10 to the 15 seconds per particle, and how does it collapse? Well, you multiply

309
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:45,080
by a Gaussian of this width and put some math to it. This is what John Bell was so impressed by.

310
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,480
I know when I talked to him about that theory, was that, okay, for many years,

311
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,960
people have had this kind of general thought, but they took the step of turning it into clean

312
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,760
mathematics. Yeah. And also clean mathematics, but a real theory, physically, right? Yeah. Not

313
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,880
just an idea, not just a general suggestion. That's right. And it can be, in fact, experimentally

314
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,800
tested. Yes, it does. It makes, because the wave function evolution is different, and because

315
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:17,880
the predictions really depend on what the wave function does, it will make, it's easy to see,

316
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,840
in principle, it makes different predictions. It's harder to come up with the experimental

317
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,640
situations where you can see those differences, although people have been working at it for

318
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,760
some decades and making progress. The progress is mostly ruling out the theory. I mean, so far,

319
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,920
we have not seen a signature that the theory is correct, okay? We haven't ruled it out,

320
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,760
but you could have ruled it in. If you'd seen certain things, you could have really ruled

321
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,360
it in. It has not been ruled in. And ruling it in, these spontaneous collapse theories would count

322
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,960
as falsifying these other theories. That's right. If that were to happen, then the other

323
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,280
things on the table that we might talk about, including Everett, would, you know,

324
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,960
a lot of the motivation for Everett would go away, because one of the motivations is,

325
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:05,320
but gee, this Schrodinger evolution is so nice, right? So that is a motivation. I guess to a

326
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:12,920
physicist, there's a sort of, I don't want to say intuitive, but emotional objection to these

327
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,960
spontaneous collapse theories, like it just looks so ad hoc that the wave function just does this.

328
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:24,840
And I guess you could say, yeah, but we're fitting the data. Yeah. And ad hoc, it's not that I don't

329
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:32,120
have some sympathy, but when you realize how difficult these questions are and the weird extremes

330
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:38,280
that people have gone to say, oh, but I don't like this one because it's ad hoc, that is such weak

331
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:47,240
key, right? I mean, get over it. The physical world might look a little more ad hoc than you

332
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,960
prefer. You really shouldn't rule things out in a strong way for that reason.

333
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,920
I guess maybe following what you said about Einstein and EPR, the one thing that you can

334
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,160
say about quantum mechanics is that someone's going to have to give up on something that they

335
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:13,400
really want to be true. Yes, I think that's correct. I'm not sure. I would say, and now I'm

336
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:19,080
going to tip the hand, which you'd understand already, if you already know I'm not that sympathetic

337
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,920
to the many worlds because of the problems I see there. And I also have this feeling that I can only

338
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,240
say by saying the collapses don't smell right to me, right? I don't want to put too much weight on

339
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,800
that. But that's just the way I feel. I mean, when you're in this, you kind of make a judgment

340
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,440
about what looks more plausible to you. Then we have the last possibility where, okay, yeah,

341
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,080
there are no collapses. I agree. I like the Schrodinger evolution. It looks, it's clean. It's

342
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:49,960
pretty. It's linear. I want to keep that, but I want my cats to just, one cat goes in and one cat

343
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:56,680
comes out. That means I have to have something in addition to the wave function. And now the

344
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:02,760
question is what? And the amazing thing, and I think anybody, whatever you think about the theory

345
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,520
is at least just for the non-relativistic theory, there's some complications further on. For the

346
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,600
non-relativistic theory, this thought occurred immediately in 1926 already by Louis de Broglie.

347
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,680
And you say, what is this magical thing you're going to add to your physics? Answer

348
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:24,760
particles, point particles. Just the sort of thing you were already familiar with, the sort of thing

349
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,760
even democratists, well, his were a little thick, right? They had their shapes. These can be point

350
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,800
particles. So they're even slimmed down and more minimalistic than democratian particles.

351
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,920
But the idea, okay, there are some particles and they move around and they constitute cats and tables

352
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,000
and chairs. And if you want to know whether your cats alive or dead, tell me where it's,

353
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,120
what its particles are doing, and I'll give you a good idea, right? You might say that's such a

354
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:56,840
simple idea. It couldn't possibly be the case that you just add some particles and write down a

355
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:03,080
pretty simple looking equation for how they move and everything comes out right. But amazingly,

356
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:09,560
in the non-relativistic theory, it does. I don't really see that as giving up on anything. I mean,

357
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,600
because what you have to give up on is the completeness of the wave function, but it's not

358
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:20,280
clear what the motivation for believing that ever was, except Bohr and so on saying, look,

359
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:26,360
we know what to do with the wave function. If it's complete, then we're done. And we want to be done.

360
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,720
So don't tell us there's something else, right? So in other words, the basic idea is when we

361
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:38,120
invented quantum mechanics, we started saying, oh, electrons are like waves, right? They have

362
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,400
interference patterns under the right circumstances. They spread out in the atom. They are also like

363
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:48,600
particles in certain ways. We measure little dots on screens. And the brilliant breakthrough

364
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:55,160
from De Broglie is that's because they're both at the same time. Yeah. Or to put it as Bell,

365
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,520
again, I'm always quoting John Bell, he says, people were breaking their heads all the time,

366
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,000
wave or particle, wave or particle, you'd hear wave a coal, right? It's a new concept you don't

367
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,200
have. And he said, why didn't it occur to them the simple answer, wave and particle? There is a

368
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:17,080
wave that is a thing that obeys a wave equation, which is why you get interference. That's the

369
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,960
wave function or the quantum state, the thing described by the wave function. And in addition,

370
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,000
there is a particle which always has a location. So if you ask, but why do these little individual

371
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,480
spots form on my screen? It's because that's where the particle hit. No reason why you can't

372
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,960
explain the wave like behavior because there is a wave and the particle like behavior because

373
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:44,120
there is a particle and that and their dynamics is coupled in a way that the particles are guided

374
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,400
by a wave like thing. And so the interference in the wave will affect where the particles go.

375
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:56,040
So this table in front of us is in some legitimate sense made of particles. Yep. And the positions

376
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:01,240
of those particles are among other things being guided by the wave functions. Yes. Are they

377
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,280
separately interacting with each other, the particles? Well, of course, the word interaction

378
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:12,760
here is one of those words that different physical theories will give you different

379
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:19,880
accounts of what even counts as an interaction. Certainly, the particles can be in a situation

380
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:26,200
where what happens to one will make a difference to what happens to others, right? So the theory

381
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:33,560
will just tell you, gee, you turn on a magnetic field over here and now this particle gets deflected

382
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:40,520
down. And by the way, that particle, you know, will get deflected up. I mean, the example I

383
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:45,960
just gave you is a little bit misleading. But now, is that an interaction between the particles?

384
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,520
Well, it's certainly mediated by the wave function, right? The particles can't do anything to each

385
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:56,440
other. But in a way, already you have that in Newton, you say, well, how does one particle

386
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,800
affect another gravitationally? Well, not sort of directly, but you need a gravitational field

387
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,080
or something like that. There's a mediator, there's a physical mediator

388
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:14,280
that accounts for these relations between what they do. Is that interaction? It is,

389
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:21,640
but it's not quite like classical Newtonian interaction. One way to talk about this, people

390
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:27,800
get a little bit, maybe this will help or maybe not. But let me say it briefly. If you've studied

391
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,920
any physics, if you did any Newtonian physics, you'll remember that the fundamental equation

392
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:40,760
is f equals ma, where a is the acceleration. And the acceleration is the change in the velocity and

393
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,200
the velocity is already the change in the position. So it's a second time derivative. And what that

394
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,960
means for Newton is that to give you the initial conditions of a system, I both have to tell you

395
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,240
where everything is and what its momentum is, right? So I need both position and momentum.

396
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,440
And then the fundamental kind of physical interaction through f equals ma is changing the

397
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:10,280
momentum. But in this theory, it's not like that. It's a first order theory. Everything

398
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:16,280
is just done with one time derivative. So the initial condition only has to be the positions.

399
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,200
And then what the wave function does is guide the particles. It doesn't push them around

400
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:29,640
by producing Newtonian forces on them. It guides them as it were determines where they go.

401
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:37,480
More in the way, this is a kind of analogy that David Bohm used to use, as if you were piloting

402
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:44,280
by radio control a little boat out on the lake. And you say, yeah, as you turn the dial,

403
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,640
as it were sending information or telling the boat where to go, but you're not pushing the boat

404
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,880
around, right? And in fact, if the boat goes twice as far away, so your radio signal is half

405
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,880
as strong, still, as long as it's getting the signal, it's going to guide it the same way,

406
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,200
right? Whereas a Newtonian force, you'd sort of think, well, the further away you get,

407
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,840
the weaker the force has to become. So it's a different fundamental picture of physical interaction.

408
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:18,520
And I think many physicists object to it or have this intuitive emotional response to it because

409
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,880
the wave function is guiding the particles, but the particles don't influence the wave function

410
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,520
at all, right? Maybe part of that negative feeling is that they're still thinking of

411
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,000
the wave function as a Newtonian force field. They might be thinking that this is an objection

412
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,880
people have raised quite explicitly that this theory violates they call the generalized Newton's

413
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:45,560
third law of action and reaction, right? So they say, oh, well, in general, I think if A

414
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:51,240
has an influence on B, B should have a back influence or a reciprocal influence back on A.

415
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:58,040
And that, I have to say, strikes me as just silly. I mean, in a certain way, if you say to Newton,

416
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,600
look, doesn't the law of gravity somehow affect what particles do? He'd say, yeah, yeah, yeah,

417
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,360
and say, but what are the particles? Do they affect the law of gravity? He'd say, no, of course not,

418
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,800
right? The law of gravity doesn't change because of what the particles do, what the way the particles

419
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:19,160
behave is accounted for, as it were, by the law. So we don't usually think that if A affects B,

420
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:25,320
B has to have a reciprocal back effect on A. Lots of cases where even in physics,

421
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,480
we wouldn't say that at all. So this seems to me to be a bit special pleading of trying to

422
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,000
find something to complain about. I mean, certainly, it sounds like a very made up

423
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,360
metaphysical principle that they just made up. Okay, you mentioned David Bohm. Tell us his role

424
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,080
in this story. So it's an interesting, I mean, the history of this is very interesting because,

425
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:49,320
again, people were very concerned. There was the early quantum theory by Bohr, which had this very

426
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:55,480
classical looking idea of this planetary atom, and then these jumping kind of jumps, which were

427
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,760
unusual, and they didn't quite understand. And then the new quantum theory was developed in the

428
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:07,560
20s, mid 20s, and the mathematics of it came out first matrix mechanics by Heisenberg,

429
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,400
and then wave mechanics by Schrodinger. I'm just throwing some names out, but people have heard

430
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,360
these names. But they had the math in a way, they kind of knew how to manipulate the math to make

431
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:23,560
some predictions. But it wasn't at all clear what the physical picture was, right? What's the physical

432
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:29,640
theory here? And de Broglie early on looks at this and says, well, I can just, I can just put these

433
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,440
particles in these point particles and have them guided around by this quite simple equation,

434
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,240
you need a second equation because we needed an equation to tell us what the wave function does,

435
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,640
and we're just going to keep Schrodinger's equation for that. So we got that. No real dispute about

436
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,960
that. Then we need a second one, which tells me what the particles do, and that's going to be a

437
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:55,560
thing called the guidance equation. And just from mathematical simplicity and other very basic

438
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:03,000
physical considerations, I think I've seen claim 10 different ways that would lead you in the

439
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:09,560
non-relativistic theory to a very simple obvious equation, guidance equation for this. So lots

440
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:16,600
of ways to motivate it, you know, intuitively. And so de Broglie discovers this and he presents it,

441
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:23,880
he was very young at the time, and some rather bad objections were made to the theory, but de Broglie

442
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:29,080
on his feet couldn't answer them. And the story seems to be that he was just a bit traumatized

443
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,520
by the whole thing, because these were the big shots of physics. I mean, he's a young guy,

444
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,000
he's at the Solvay conference with the biggest names, Einstein is there, Boris there, and so on.

445
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,760
And, you know, they're Pauli, whoever they're beating up on him, and he just kind of

446
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:47,960
seems to have abandoned the theory a bit. As far as I can tell, and I've heard people tell me this

447
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,960
more recently who looked into it, it kind of lays fallow. Now, Einstein, who we know didn't like

448
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,520
the Copenhagen understanding of quantum theory, we know played around with this theory or very

449
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:06,200
similar theories in the intervening years. He didn't like it, but he didn't like it because it had

450
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:12,040
what he called in a very manifest, easy to see way, spooky action at a distance, this non-locality.

451
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:17,080
So we know why he didn't like the theory. And he could never come up with a satisfactory version

452
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:22,920
to him. But it's very possible that he came up with the version that other people think is

453
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,880
satisfactory. Exactly. He could have very well had it. And it sort of stayed that way. And then

454
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:33,240
the really interesting situation, if we get into this, is David Bohm is now a young physicist,

455
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:40,440
very well regarded at Princeton. He writes a book explaining quantum theory from the kind of

456
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:47,480
Copenhagen-Borian point of view. And he's in Princeton, Einstein's over at the Institute

457
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,880
for Advanced Study. And he's kind of saying, gosh, I would like to get my nerve to go ask

458
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,440
Einstein what he thinks of my book. And he's actually trying to get other people to approach

459
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,000
Einstein. And as this is going on, he gets a message from Einstein. And Einstein says,

460
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,920
I read your book. Would you like to come talk about it? And the story is he goes to talk to

461
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:17,080
Einstein. So it's like 1950, 51. Yeah, 51, I think. Einstein has read the book. And Einstein says,

462
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,920
I think this is the best, the clearest exposition of the Copenhagen approach that I've ever seen.

463
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:29,960
I mean, he was really trying hard. But Einstein raised some objections. And the story is, and I

464
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,080
think it was a young man who tells this story, it was Bohm's roommate at the time that Bohm goes,

465
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,400
meets Einstein, comes back, and he reports when he comes back, I'm back to square one.

466
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,600
He was convinced by Einstein's objections. He just, he couldn't answer Einstein's objections.

467
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:49,800
He realized that he really didn't understand what he himself had written. And within a year,

468
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,800
he discovers this other thing, which was the same thing that Boyd had done. And apparently

469
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,720
independently, as far as I can tell, I mean, I was told recently, I haven't done the research

470
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,520
myself. But again, it's not hard to find that theory if you're looking in a certain direction.

471
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,280
And then he publishes these papers, this two part paper in 1952,

472
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,960
a theory that introduces so-called hidden variables into quantum mechanics and gives

473
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,640
you all the right predictions. And this was something that people had believed had been proven

474
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:26,440
mathematically impossible by John von Neumann when von Neumann wrote his book. So this is,

475
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,000
of course, a shock. It's like, you're not supposed to be able to do that. And then

476
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,960
you look at the paper and you say, wait, it does look like you can do that. And we now understand

477
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,840
that von Neumann had made not a mathematical mistake, but a kind of conceptual mistake,

478
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:46,040
which was caught at the time by Greta Hermann. Greta Hermann, yeah.

479
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,480
And people pointed it out, but who's listening to Greta Hermann?

480
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,600
When Bohr and Heisenberg are saying the opposite.

481
00:40:52,600 --> 00:41:01,320
So in 1952, the theory sort of gets reborn under Bohm's name and Bohm worked on expanding it to

482
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,000
cover spin and some other, I mean, it's a kind of very basic theory at the beginning. And then

483
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,680
you start adding bells and whistles to cover more and more phenomena.

484
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,120
And it might still have disappeared, but John Bell became a fan of it, right?

485
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:21,080
Well, Bell, it's not that Bell started out as a fan of it. Bell was a fan of this.

486
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:26,840
He was a fan of saying, I understand what this theory is claiming, right? There's no mystery

487
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,400
about it. There are these particles. There's this wave function. Here's what the wave function

488
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,040
does. Here's what the particles do, okay? This is a picture of the world, like it or lump it.

489
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,240
When I first learned about this theory, and I was very skeptical about it from Shelly Goldstein,

490
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,480
Shelly helped me a lot at one point in our discussions because I was being very obstreperous.

491
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,960
And he said, look, surely you'll admit this is a theory of something.

492
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,360
Okay. It says there are these particles. There's this other thing. Here's what they do.

493
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:02,360
Now, just in your mind, imagine a world as this theory describes. Wouldn't it be interesting if

494
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:07,800
that world looked very much like the world we live in? Which turns out to be true.

495
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,160
This is always good advice when people have trouble thinking about new theories because

496
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,400
they always want to fit it into their own boxes, right? And if you just ask what it would be like

497
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:25,400
if it were true, you'd make progress. And it addressed the problem that Einstein had raised

498
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:32,200
about locality by saying, yeah. Yes. So this is what I was going to say. And Bell tells a wonderful

499
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,840
story, right? Bell says when he first learned quantum mechanics, he was very puzzled by it.

500
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:44,760
He didn't understand what was going on. And he thought you need to add something to it. You

501
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,800
need these additional variables, the way functions, not the whole story. And he said he was told by

502
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:55,720
his physics professors, no, no, no. Von Neumann has proven it can't be done. Mathematically proven,

503
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:01,080
you can't add any additional variables and keep the same predictions. And Bell says at the time,

504
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,400
he didn't know any German and the book had not been translated. And so that's where it sat.

505
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,240
He just didn't know why he didn't understand. He couldn't read Von Neumann's proof, but he was

506
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:18,040
told there was a proof. And then Bell says he just gets up in 1952 and reads this paper that's been

507
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:24,520
published and says, wait, Bohm has just done what everybody's telling me Von Neumann proved

508
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:31,720
couldn't be done. Something's gone wrong here. He quickly convinces himself that the mistake

509
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:38,520
in that case was on Von Neumann's side. But he sees that the theory has this manifest nonlocality.

510
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:45,160
And he asks himself surely what Einstein must have been asking himself, can you get rid of it?

511
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:52,840
Can I have a kind of theory like this? But without the nonlocality in it, that still makes the right

512
00:43:52,840 --> 00:44:00,440
predictions, the quantum mechanical predictions, that's the very precise thought that Bell had.

513
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,040
And when he finally got some time off on sabbatical to sit down.

514
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,640
Because he couldn't do it during his regular work.

515
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,880
But the amazing thing is, of course, when you see Bell's proof, it's a few lines of algebra.

516
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:17,160
It's not like proving Fermat's last theorem. It's not hard mathematically.

517
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,640
When I first read about this stuff, which was in the Scientific American in an article by Bernard

518
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:31,080
d'Espagnia back in 79, I guess, it's not looking back on it. It's not the greatest article in the

519
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:36,360
world. But it was enough was there that just with a little math, you could see, wait, wait,

520
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:44,680
I see the problem. I really, this just stands out at you. So what happens with Bell is Bell,

521
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:49,960
what Bell realizes is, wait a minute. No, you can't get rid of the nonlocality out of this

522
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,920
theory. You can't get rid of the nonlocality out of any theory. I mean, throw away quantum

523
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:01,000
mechanics and start from scratch from entirely different principles. Bell's proof is not about

524
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,840
quantum mechanics. It's just about certain experiments and the correlations that you see

525
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:13,880
in the outcomes. You can't have a theory that is local in a well-defined sense that won't predict

526
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:19,400
that. Quantum mechanics does predict it. And more importantly than quantum mechanics predicting it,

527
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:27,480
the world does it. That's why the Nobel Prize went to Clouser and Aspe and Zeilander recently

528
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,600
for doing the experiments that showed that the violation of Bell's inequality actually occurs.

529
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:37,800
And as you and I both complained about in separate occasions, the Nobel committee blew it in their

530
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:43,720
press release. Yes, they did. They said that what they had done was what proved that von Neumann

531
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:49,000
was right and you can't have hidden variables, which is just the irony there is so delicious.

532
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:56,680
Because Bell then became probably the strongest advocate of this

533
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,560
Bohm's theory or De Broglie's theory, which is a theory with additional variables.

534
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,920
Why? Because he could say, well, what's the objection? You can't object as Einstein did. I don't

535
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,400
like it because it's not local because now I understand, okay, the nonlocality is just in the

536
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:17,240
world. Suck it up. And it's a clear theory and so on. I mean, at one point, Bell says he's going

537
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,160
through all these different ways of approaching quantum mechanics and he says, well, the pilot

538
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:28,280
wave approach shows the best craftsmanship. But then he says, but is that he says then wonderfully,

539
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,320
I mean, he always made these cutting little remarks, is that is that a virtue in our time?

540
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,520
Right? Do people appreciate good craftsmanship anymore? Do they like just things that sound

541
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:46,040
amazing and blow your mind? Because at some level, it's a much more pedestrian kind of theory.

542
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,800
You say, yeah, there's some particles, they move around. Yeah, there's this wave function. That's

543
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,120
kind of funny thing. But I'll explain how it plays into the architecture here.

544
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,880
It was a rough time for the philosophy of quantum mechanics in certain ways.

545
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,200
But okay, so I think that there are any physicists out there who are not

546
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,400
into the foundations of quantum mechanics and they're listening. They're very confused because

547
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,720
one uses the word locality in different senses sometimes. I mean, if you asked a quantum field

548
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:18,600
theorist, is their field theory local? They would say, yes, it's very, very local. So what exactly

549
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:24,600
do you mean by this word? Good. So and there's even a technical mathematical condition that's

550
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:30,920
imposed in quantum field theory that they will call locality has to do with commuting operators.

551
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:39,960
Okay, so what's going on? Well, one thing to say is that there is there's bell prove there has to

552
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:47,720
be some kind of influence or effect. If Alice and Bob if I set up a pair of particles in a special

553
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:51,720
state called an entangled state and anybody who's heard about this at least have heard the word

554
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,440
entangled, but send the particles off way in different directions. So they're, you know,

555
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,520
hundreds of light years apart, one into Alice's lab and one into Bob's lab.

556
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:07,800
The intuition of causal locality basically says nothing that Alice does

557
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:16,040
can have any actual influence or effect on what Bob sees. Right? That doesn't mean there can't be

558
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:21,000
correlations between what they see. I mean, everybody knows people give this example, you

559
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,480
tear a dollar bill in half and send it to sides off in different directions. Of course,

560
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:30,120
Alice seeing one half immediately informs you that Bob will see the other half,

561
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:36,360
but that's not Alice doing anything that affects Bob at all. That's just true. Everybody understood

562
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,680
that. Everybody understands there could be correlations like that, but those correlations

563
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:46,200
are already explained by what happened at the source. And so nothing non local is going on in

564
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:51,880
that case. Bell showed no, you can't get the kinds of correlations you see in quantum mechanics by

565
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:59,160
that kind of local story. There has to be a sense in which what Alice does actually makes a difference

566
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:06,200
to what Bob sees or the other way around. That's causal non locality. Now the next question that

567
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:14,920
arises is, oh, could you implement that in some way to allow Alice to send a message to Bob,

568
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:20,600
signal Bob, right? Tell Bob whether they're going to meet for lunch today or not. And the really

569
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:25,720
interesting, I mean, a very interesting thing is that at least under certain pretty clear

570
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:30,760
idealizations, you can kind of look at the way quantum mechanics work and say, well, no,

571
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,960
actually, even though you can't get rid of this connection, you also can't use it to signal.

572
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:41,240
And the person who proved that first was also Bell. People like to call it the no bell telephone

573
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:46,040
theorem. So he was perfectly aware of it, right? You can't use the non locality to signal.

574
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:54,120
Sorry, that's a feature in Copenhagen, Everett, Bohm, whatever you want. You can never use it.

575
00:49:54,120 --> 00:50:00,440
Well, okay, now I'm going to tread off into treacherous territory.

576
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:09,640
Okay. If you say, and I think it's just a bad thing to say, that the fundamental postulate

577
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:15,480
of, say, relativity has to do with signaling, that you can't signal faster than light. And you

578
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:20,520
say, oh, well, then this is still a local theory. But that just, I think, first of all, signaling

579
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,920
isn't even the right kind of concept that should be in the foundations of any theory, just as

580
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:30,120
measurement shouldn't and just as observation shouldn't. And, you know, Bell proved there is

581
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:37,000
this kind of non local causation. And maybe I can't use it to signal, but so what? But then

582
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,560
the next thought is, gosh, if there really is this real physical, non local connection somehow,

583
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:49,560
why can't I use it to signal? And you'd sort of offhand think there must be some clever way to

584
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:56,840
do it. Now I'm going to report something. To ask that question, of course, you really need a well

585
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:02,920
defined theory on the table in front of you, right? Because you have to ask, well, what can I do with

586
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:10,280
this physics? Quantum mechanics tends to use these things called Hermitian operators or,

587
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:15,880
or as they call them observables, and they sort of you, the mathematics of that is what they look

588
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,120
into to ask certain questions. But if you have an actual theory in front of you, you're not restricted

589
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,960
in that way, you know, you can just say, well, can I do something? Can I twiddle this and, you

590
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:32,520
know, see something? It looks like in the Bohmian theory with spin, there are reasons to believe

591
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:38,280
you could signal faster than light. Oh, this could be the most popular podcast ever.

592
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:45,400
You weren't expecting that, were you? I was not. It is, it is, I am, personally, I suspected there

593
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:54,200
should be a way. Sid Hunt Das, who's a young researcher, has been looking at something which

594
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:01,000
amazingly people had not looked carefully at, which is in this pilot wave theory, when you add spin,

595
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,600
okay, that's an additional physical degree of freedom, people usually just don't fiddle with it.

596
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,920
They kind of deal with spinless particles, you know, at this level to understand things. When

597
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:18,440
you add spin, and when you look at, there's a very specific thing you can look at that standard

598
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:25,240
quantum mechanics doesn't have an obvious way to even treat, right? This is the key to understanding

599
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:35,000
this. That is arrival times. So if I, if I... This is a well-known issue. Yes, it is a well-known

600
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,720
issue, although people just kind of put it out of their mind. So if I have an electron as it were

601
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:45,160
confined in a little box, which we kind of know how to do, and at some moment I open the box,

602
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:50,440
and then I've got a screen, and at some time a flash appears on the screen, one thing you can

603
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,600
ask is, well, what was the, what was the transit time? How long, what was the time gap between when

604
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:00,440
I opened the box and when the flash occurred? And it turns out, if you ask quantum mechanically,

605
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,280
and in quantum mechanics, you of course have to do experiments many, many times, and you get kind of

606
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:11,560
statistical results, you get a distribution of results. It's, nobody agrees how even to make

607
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:16,280
that prediction using standard quantum mechanics, because there is no Hermitian operator that

608
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:23,080
corresponds to arrival times. Okay? In the, in this pilot wave picture, because you have these

609
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:28,120
particles and they just move, it's kind of easy at least to ask the question, according to the

610
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:33,080
theory, how long did it, would it take a particle here to get there? So you can actually do these

611
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:38,360
calculations. And when you do them with spin, you start to see that there's a spin dependence

612
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:47,000
of the arrival times, which you really weren't expecting, but it shows up. And if that's right,

613
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,360
it's already a question of whether you'll see that. This is something you could check in the

614
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,520
lab. We're trying to find people who'll do it, but you need specialized equipment and you need the

615
00:53:54,520 --> 00:54:00,280
motivation to do it. If, if there is that spin dependence of the arrival times, then there's a

616
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:05,560
very quick argument. Oh, you could signal. Now the signaling would be very subtle. I mean,

617
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,360
it's not like you could flip a switch and a light would go on there. But it would essentially say,

618
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:17,480
if Alice orients a magnet in her lab in a certain way, Bob will suddenly start seeing

619
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,360
a slightly different distribution of arrival times than if it's oriented another way.

620
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,720
And that would be any kind of information, right? It doesn't have to be a clean,

621
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:34,840
100% strong signal, any signal, right? Any Shannon information. Sure. And this suggests

622
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,680
that, yeah, you actually should be able to do that. Now there are lots of still,

623
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,600
there's lots of arguments within the community about whether this is right. How far do you have

624
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:49,400
to carry the analysis into the observing equipment? I mean, lots of stuff. Maybe in a couple years,

625
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,280
people will say, no, this argument breaks down for some reasons we don't quite understand yet.

626
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:59,400
So I don't want to say this is nailed down, but it's there and it's a really hot, interesting,

627
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:05,080
interesting topic and one that could be tested in a lab. Some of it you could do today.

628
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:09,160
I'm not completely surprised because both you and I have written papers about energy

629
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:13,560
conservation and its failure in quantum mechanics, which anyone could have done in the 1950s.

630
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,920
Yeah. I just didn't ask the question. But is this a fact that you're talking about now,

631
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,760
would it be a difference between well-meaning mechanics and other formulations of quantum?

632
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:27,960
Or is it just that you can't ask the question? Yeah, it's a little hard to say because, and again,

633
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,800
I'm now just reporting what Siddhant tells me and he's done all the research. He says,

634
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,840
if you go into the standard physics literature about arrival times, you'll find 20 different

635
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:41,880
suggestions about how to do it. They tend to agree with each other in the far field. That is,

636
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,960
if there's a long time between when you release it and when you detect it, all of these different

637
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:51,800
approaches converge on the same answers. But in the midfield, there are places where they

638
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:59,800
will not converge. What can you say? It's not clear what predictions the quote standard approach

639
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:05,880
even makes. Got it. You could say if the pilot wave approach makes a clean prediction, it's

640
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,280
clearly a different theory because, look, it's doing something precise where the arrival doesn't

641
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:17,000
even have anything precise to say. The other obvious question is you've been simultaneously

642
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,480
talking about whether you can send a signal faster than the speed of light, but also working

643
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,440
in the context of non-relativistic quantum mechanics where there is no speed of light.

644
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,560
So do we have to talk about relativistic quantum field theory to have this conversation?

645
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:34,520
Well, we certainly don't have to talk about it to have the conversation we've had up until now

646
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:40,760
because even before relativity, if you said, look, Alice is in a lab 100 billion billion miles away

647
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:47,320
from Bob, can Alice do anything in her lab that would make a difference to what shows up in Bob's

648
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:55,160
lab? The natural thought would be no. Even if there were some effect, even if there were a

649
00:56:55,160 --> 00:57:01,480
fast effect, it would drop off with the square of the distance. It would tail off. So you can have

650
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:06,840
the discussion about non-locality even in a non-relativistic. Now, it becomes sharper in a

651
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:13,800
relativistic context because then you mean faster than light where there is a light cone

652
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:19,000
structure. There's kind of an objective thing you mean there that's very sharp. So you can sharpen

653
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,600
it up in the relativistic context, but I think you can still reasonably have it. It's not like

654
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:29,160
all of your discussion of the non-relativistic case just falls to the floor when you notice

655
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:37,720
there's relativity. My halfway informed feeling is that Bohmian mechanics looks quite natural

656
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:43,240
in the non-relativistic regime, and it's a little bit more of a challenge to see how we should just

657
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:50,120
do quantum field theory in that picture. Yeah, there is no doubt there are both conceptual

658
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:56,120
and technical challenges when you go from standard quantum mechanics and one of the

659
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:02,280
signals here for people who don't know is that in quantum mechanics, you talk about a system

660
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:08,280
having n particles, and that's it. Unless you add some or take some away, it's going to be n

661
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:16,040
particles forever. But that's not the world. That's not the world. We now know that there is some

662
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:20,200
phenomenon that we call particle creation annihilation, that particle numbers can change,

663
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:27,000
and so you need to account for that. I mean, there are lots of subtleties here. One subtlety is

664
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
the thing we call particle creation annihilation. Is it really? And what I mean by that is when

665
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Dirac, and he's just a standard guy, was talking about this, he didn't have particles really come

666
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,840
into existence. He said, well, there are always infinitely many particles filling up negative

667
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:50,680
energy states. And what we call the creation of a new electron and a new anti-electron, a new

668
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:56,440
positron, is really just lifting an electron that was there all along in a negative energy state

669
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:02,840
up into a positive energy state and leaving a hole behind. So it looks like

670
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:07,800
there's a new electron and the hole is the thing we call the positron. Now that's a story that would

671
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:12,600
account for the phenomenon without really creating any new particles. It's just moving them around

672
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,160
in energy space as it were. So there's certainly you have to account for the phenomenon, right? You

673
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:23,160
have to account for the phenomenon. Yeah, I can take a really high energy photon and, gee, there

674
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:31,400
just appears now an electron and a positron or some things that satisfy certain conservation was.

675
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:38,120
We need to account for that phenomenon, whether it really deeply requires new particles or do you

676
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,840
want to give up the particle. The other thing to say is the pilot wave picture is not tied to

677
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:50,360
particles. It just says there's something that the wave function is guiding. It could be particles,

678
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:55,240
it could be a more field-like thing, right? There's a kind of way of doing Bohmian field theory

679
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:59,800
where you replace the particles with fields but the same kind of architecture.

680
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:04,520
And the other point to make, which at least needs to be made, is that people can say, gosh,

681
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:09,800
but there's no good Bohmian quantum field theory. Standard quantum field theory has been plagued

682
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:17,240
by mathematical problems and runaway singularities, numbers you try to calculate and they all come

683
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:25,000
out infinity. It's not as if it's all conceptual lightness and clarity in the so-called standard

684
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:31,800
picture. So you don't want to hold this picture to a higher standard of mathematical precision and

685
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:36,920
so on, then you're allowing for the theory that you happen to use. Okay, that's perfectly fair,

686
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:42,360
but I'm just trying to get straight for the listeners out there. If I'm a particle physicist

687
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:47,800
and I just calculated the rate of Higgs bosons decaying in the two photons and something like that,

688
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:54,600
is that stuff I can do just as well in the current Bohmian framework or is that work in progress?

689
01:00:54,680 --> 01:01:01,400
Okay, so one of the things that people have looked at is suppose I remain, again, there are

690
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,520
different moves you could make. You could say, I'm going to give up the particles all together and

691
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:09,880
put something else more field like in or you can say, no, I'm going to stick with the particles,

692
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:14,040
but I am going to allow literally the number to change. I'm going to allow particle creation

693
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:21,000
and annihilation. You can do that. How you would work that out in a kind of pilot wave picture

694
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:28,600
was done, has been done for 30 years ago, I guess. And what you do is you say in the original

695
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,960
picture, you have a fixed number of particles and all they do is move around and change their

696
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:39,720
configuration. But now I say, no, no, the real space of possible states is there's a zero particle

697
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,560
state and a one particle state and then two particle states and then three. So this whole

698
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:49,480
thing called Fox space, which is familiar to any of the physicists you're talking about.

699
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:53,800
And you say, no, that's that's what I'm now going to say. The thing is always in a particular

700
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:59,320
location with a particular number of particles. Sometimes it just moves around in one of these

701
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,080
sectors and the number doesn't change. And sometimes it can jump up or jump down,

702
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:09,320
which corresponds to particle creation and annihilation. I now need a dynamics for that.

703
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:13,880
It turns out that dynamics tends instead of being deterministic to be indeterministic,

704
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,240
the easiest way to do it is say that at any given time, there's a certain chance

705
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:22,440
you'll jump up and create a new particle or jump down and lose particles. Okay, you can do that.

706
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:28,440
And what falls out of doing that is the mathematics of standard quantum field theory.

707
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:35,000
Okay. But so just just so I didn't lose it. Among people who are fans of Bohmian mechanics right

708
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:41,880
now, it's there's a camp that thinks maybe the hidden variables are field like and there's another

709
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,800
camp that thinks maybe there's just collection of particles that can change their number. So we're

710
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:50,440
not sure that's not a leading and there's a lot of things that are debated within it. So here's

711
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:56,680
another question. People when you start out, you're always treating electrons and gluons as

712
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:03,560
particles, but then they're all fermions, right? They're all half half. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

713
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:10,360
I meant quarks. Then people ask, well, what about the photon? Is that a particle? Are there photon

714
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:16,120
trajectories? And it turns out you can try and develop a theory in which there are and a theory

715
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:22,200
in which there aren't. Okay. And people work on both sides and there's no agreement in the community.

716
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:28,120
And you ask, well, what would be the advantages of doing it this way? What would be the advantage

717
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:36,600
of doing it this way? So it's a general architecture of how to develop a theory that can be implemented,

718
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:42,680
of course, in many different ways. And so even within the big house, right, there's rooms in

719
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:48,440
the big mansion of people who are working in different directions. With regard to the idea of

720
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:52,760
sort of stepping back from the fields and going particles as your ontology,

721
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:58,040
two things come to mind, one of which is against that idea, one of which is for it. So which one

722
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:06,200
you want me to tell you first, then you can respond. The worry I have is something like

723
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:12,920
the Higgs mechanism, where it seems that the Higgs boson lurking as a field with an expectation

724
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:17,800
value throughout all of space is playing a crucially important role in explaining phenomenologically

725
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:23,160
observable properties. Is that something you could use? I mean, I think I just answered that,

726
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:28,760
which is it sounds like you're the kind of person who would say, I'd rather, yeah, I'll treat my

727
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:34,040
fermions as particles and I'll treat my bosons as fields, essentially, which is, yeah, I won't

728
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:41,240
introduce particles associated with the integer spin objects. That I think would make you happy,

729
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:46,760
right? I don't have to say there's a Higgs particle to work it into the theory. And there is a

730
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:52,200
reason to think that you're going to work bosons and fermions can enter into the theory in different

731
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:56,680
roles. Okay, this is going to undo the good news that I had. So I don't know if you know this,

732
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:01,480
because I only recently learned it, but Richard Feynman, when he was inventing Feynman diagrams,

733
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,760
part of his motivation was to get rid of quantum field theory and replace it with another theory

734
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:11,800
particles again. And we now think of Feynman diagrams as a tool for understanding quantum

735
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:18,120
field theory. So he changed his mind. But his motivation, I'm told, was the cosmological

736
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:23,640
constant problem. Really? Yeah. No, I did not know that. Yeah, I mean, I was told that I need to

737
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:28,520
find the reference for it. But the idea is if you have fields, they all have these zero point

738
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:32,280
energies, and they add up to infinity, or you cut it off, and it gives you a big vacuum energy.

739
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:38,040
But if you have particles, you don't have that problem. So if I were a Bohmian particle ontology

740
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:42,760
guy, I'd be claiming a solution to the cosmological constant. That'd be more nice.

741
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:49,400
Look, that's a connection I was unaware of. My understanding, and again, this is not based in

742
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:55,000
anything other than what I somehow picked up on the street, was that one way, anyway,

743
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,360
let me put it this way, how Feynman thought about it, I'm not sure, one way to think about

744
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:05,560
Feynman diagrams, which is runs contrary to way people often talk about them, is that they were

745
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:12,040
just a mnemonic device, right? I have a mathematical equation that has an infinite number of terms

746
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:16,680
that I need to sum up. And of course, the issue gets bad when that sum goes to infinity. But

747
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:23,640
anyway, I have this, all these terms I need to add up. And that the diagrams were just easy ways

748
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:29,720
to kind of remember what the different terms looked like, right? To figure out what integral

749
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:35,480
you had to do. Exactly. And now, the way I say people don't do that is they often point at those

750
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:40,760
things as if they are literal pictures of stuff going on. Oh, this is doing this and this is

751
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:44,280
doing this and all the stuff is going on. It's a blooming, buzzing confusion of virtual particles

752
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:50,200
that are running around. That talk, I don't think makes any sense on any view. I'm on your side.

753
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,640
So, if it's just a mnemonic technique, then you're really, it's as if I like to say,

754
01:06:55,640 --> 01:07:01,640
suppose you wanted to calculate the volume of a sphere. And you just love cubes. And you say,

755
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:06,280
okay, look, I'm going to first of all, figure out the biggest cube I can sit inside a sphere and

756
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:11,880
calculate its volume. And now I've got these other little, you know, six round pieces sticking out.

757
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,960
Now I'm going to find the biggest cube I can get out of each of those and then add those and then

758
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,480
more cubes and more cubes and more cubes. And you can see, okay, there's going to be an infinite

759
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:25,720
sequence of these volumes that you now need to add up to get the total volume of the sphere.

760
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:30,280
But you'd say, but you shouldn't think that the sphere is this really complicated thing, right?

761
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:34,680
It's actually quite simple. And in fact, here's another way to do this calculation that is,

762
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,280
you know, is straightforward and you don't do an infinite sum and G. It's just, you know,

763
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:43,720
fourth or third pi r cube. No, I think that's actually an important point because

764
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:51,640
lots of modern physics is motivated beyond the standard model particle physics searches for our

765
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:56,680
next best theory is motivated by questions of naturalness, right? And fine tuning and so forth.

766
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:00,360
And I think I don't know what the right way to think about those problems is, but I think that

767
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:04,920
not only do people talk as if there really are virtual particles popping out of existence,

768
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:11,560
which there aren't. But they also think that somehow nature starts with a classical theory

769
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:16,520
and then adds quantum corrections on top of it. And nature doesn't do that. And that might change

770
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:20,840
our perspective here. Right. And I think there's a, I think you're exactly right. And I think there's

771
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:28,360
a methodological point here, which is that because we start out learning classical physics and it

772
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:33,880
feels familiar to us and we familiar with the math of it, there's this great temptation of someone

773
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:38,760
says, oh, the way to come up with a good quantum theory is to start with a classical theory and

774
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:43,240
then do this thing we call quantizing it, right? We put the hats on, we turn certain variables

775
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,880
into operators. And well, most of the time it's clear how to do that. Sometimes it's not quite

776
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:52,760
clear how to do that. But you think, but this doesn't make any sense, right? The world, yes,

777
01:08:52,760 --> 01:09:01,000
the world behaves pretty well the way classical theory predicts at a certain scale. But that's

778
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:06,520
because something emerging out of a very non-classical physics. And there's no reason to think that the

779
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:12,920
right way into that physics is to start with the approximation and then twiddle with it, right?

780
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:17,880
It's got to go the other way around, right? You need the fundamental physics and then hopefully

781
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:25,160
you can understand why the classical approximations work as well as they do. But I think people are

782
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:31,880
tempted because you have this kind of algorithmic thing of, oh, just take a variable and put a hat

783
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:37,160
on it and turn it into an operator. But conceptually, that's just not the right way to think about it.

784
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:42,440
Yeah, that's right. So good. I'm glad we can find all of our points of agreement against the

785
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:48,360
consensus, despite the fact that we have some disagreements. But this question of the speed

786
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:53,880
of light, I'm going to go back to the experiment, the possible signaling, because I do not know about

787
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,800
that work. I don't know whether it's right. So that's okay. We're putting it on. Yeah, right there.

788
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:04,520
But the idea of looking hard for possible experiments to do, I think, is a crucially

789
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:10,360
important one. I mean, my impression is that your typical Bohmian on the street thinks there's no

790
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:16,200
experiment to do to test Bohm versus conventional quantum mechanics, whatever that is. Do you have

791
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:23,320
a feeling about that? I do. And this is a discussion I am in right now arising out of this work.

792
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:30,280
That is, a lot of people in the Bohmian camp will kind of say, oh, but we know that it won't make

793
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:37,640
different predictions than, quote, standard quantum mechanics. Now, I think that's just wrong. I think

794
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:43,480
there are kind of toy cases that make it obviously wrong, but leave those aside. I just tried to

795
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:51,240
understand what the argument was. And I can't get it, right? And so I think some of this is

796
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:57,720
defensive, right? Because there's this, and you stop back a second and you see this is so unfair.

797
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:02,440
You have standard quantum mechanics, whatever it is. Anyway, you can make lots of good predictions

798
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:07,560
with it. Then somebody comes up with a new theory, and then they say, oh, does your theory make any

799
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,400
new predictions? If not, why should I pay any attention to it? Now, the first thing you notice

800
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:16,120
is, but wait, if these two theories had been discovered in the opposite order, right, you

801
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:21,240
would be going the other way around. So this can't be, from a logical point of view, a good

802
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:26,680
objection. Why should I take your theory seriously? Because it makes all the same predictions as my

803
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:34,760
theory, because that doesn't make any sense. But I think that is an objection that physicists often

804
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:40,120
made. And so there were certain kinds of defensive procedures that were put up to say, oh, no, we're

805
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:49,560
not saying they're new predictions, right? And then you'd have to go on. My view is a sharp theory,

806
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:56,360
again, standard quantum mechanics has certain vaguenesses in it. If you have to talk about

807
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:02,520
measurement, if you have to talk about observation, because those are vague terms, these are the

808
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:07,480
objections that we had. And so you'd expect a sharp theory will certainly ought to differ

809
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:12,760
in some ways. And you should be looking hard at where those differences might be.

810
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:19,640
Is so the unfair question, what fraction of the Bohmians out there agree with you about that?

811
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:26,760
It's not an unfair question, but it's a sociological question, which I just can't answer. I

812
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:33,800
don't know. I don't know. And even as it were, the Bohmian camp is divided into sub-camps and

813
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:38,440
probably the statistics and the different ones are different. And probably my guess is

814
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:45,400
weirdly enough, it probably correlates with age. I think younger people are more open to certain

815
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:51,240
things than people who've been through a lot of battles. But I really don't know.

816
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,760
Where are these Bohmians of which you speak? Are they in philosophy departments or physics

817
01:12:54,760 --> 01:13:02,120
departments or Europe? Well, a lot of them, yeah. So there were a lot of students

818
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:09,000
in Europe. And I'm sorry, this is going to be just a little hard for me.

819
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:20,120
Det Lefder, who was at the LMU in Munich, had always a dozen graduate students. Unbelievable

820
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:26,040
what he did that nobody else I know has ever done to promote young people and bring them into this.

821
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:32,360
And he was in a physics department. He was in the math department.

822
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:41,400
And he was just the most wonderful, caring Dr. Vater and looked after these students.

823
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:47,880
He could not get many of them jobs in academia. A lot of them have gone into other industry,

824
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:54,280
whatever. They did their work. But there are a lot of young people who came through that program

825
01:13:54,280 --> 01:14:02,280
who know the theory and work on it. Siddhant Das, who I mentioned, was one of Det Lef's last students.

826
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:08,840
And some of his students, a couple of them are in Tubigan. So there are more of them

827
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:15,320
in Europe who have come through LMU and through his influence. Then the other thing that's happened

828
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:23,160
is a lot of physicists who realize they're interested in foundations notice that if you have

829
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:30,120
credentials as a philosopher, you can more literally more easily have an academic career

830
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:34,040
in a philosophy department as a philosopher of physics than you can in the physics department.

831
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:40,760
Still true, yes. So some of them have switched over. Also Det Lef's student, Dustin Lazarevich,

832
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:47,560
who's now in the Technion in Israel. There are people who are around. And it's more than there

833
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:53,320
used to be. I mean, the total number is up. What the effect of losing Det Lef because Det Lef died

834
01:14:54,120 --> 01:15:01,320
during COVID? I don't know. I mean, nobody right now is doing what he was able to do. And we have

835
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:10,680
to hope that some dedicated person with the right psychology and so on can

836
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:15,880
kind of take his place and help people along. Do you think we started by talking about

837
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:21,080
why you don't need to make a sales pitch to philosophers? They get it. Yeah.

838
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:29,560
How deeply do they get it? How much has quantum mechanics changed what philosophers think about

839
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:39,000
metaphysics? So this is an interesting question. In philosophy, I would say there are three camps

840
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:44,520
of people who do what goes under the name metaphysics. I just gave this talk at Rutgers,

841
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:49,000
the undergraduates, about metaphysics and science. Are metaphysics and science enemies or friends or

842
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,160
what? Or the same thing? Yeah, exactly. That was my conclusion at the end. So you jumped right

843
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:58,920
to the end. Sorry. But no, there's an interesting history because really there's a certain point

844
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:07,800
where they're clearly considered to be enemies. I mean, Carnap. I would say that in metaphysicians,

845
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:12,440
people would self-identify as metaphysicians in philosophy now fall into kind of three camps.

846
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:17,880
There's a camp that's sometimes called analytic metaphysics, which tends to be doing things

847
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:27,000
which don't seem to care much about science. They're asking questions that don't... It's not

848
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:33,080
obvious that any scientific theory would bear one way or the other on the question.

849
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:39,400
Oh, are there... I mean, these are not just going to be words. Are there universals or tropes?

850
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:43,560
Okay, so this is the kind of thing that a philosopher of a certain kind will understand

851
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,120
and they'll be fighting with each other forever about universals and tropes. And it's very hard if

852
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:52,440
you say, well, did Newton believe in universal tropes? You'd say, well, the Newton didn't care.

853
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:57,960
It's just not an issue that is built into the guts of that theory in any obvious way.

854
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:05,800
Okay. Then there's another camp that goes by the name scientific metaphysics for the reason of

855
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:11,080
saying that what I think is obviously correct, metaphysics is about describing what exists

856
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,920
at the most general scales. And if you're interested in what exists in the physical world,

857
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:20,440
you better pay attention to science. Not to say that the scientists can just answer those questions,

858
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:29,080
but they do have relevant things to say to offer. But then that group kind of subdivides into two.

859
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:35,320
The ones who then specialize say to do philosophy of physics. Now that really requires learning

860
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:43,000
some math and some physics and at a reasonably good scale, some people have full PhDs in physics.

861
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:49,960
But you certainly have to devote some time to just studying math and physics to do this in a

862
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:55,320
specialized way. And then there's another group of people who clearly acknowledge the relevance

863
01:17:55,320 --> 01:18:00,120
of the physics, but they're not experts. And so they like to listen to the experts and try

864
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:05,400
and figure what they can draw out of it without themselves delving so deeply into it. I would

865
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:10,920
say that's how the landscape goes. But do they talk to each other, these people? Or do they go

866
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:20,200
to the same conferences? Yeah, I mean, they're certainly, they do talk while they're in each

867
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:26,840
other's presence. I mean, there are a lot of specialized conferences, but there are conferences.

868
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:31,480
I mean, I was just invited to be on a panel at the Metaphysics Society of America. And I'll tell

869
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:37,400
you, the people in that society are not people you'll ever run into. And they were doing a very

870
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,480
different kind of metaphysics, but they were happy. I talked about what I do and the way I

871
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:45,720
think about it and they didn't throw bricks at me. It wasn't the way they thought about it. They

872
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:49,720
were interested. They were interested. Yeah, they were interested and they appreciated having the

873
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:57,320
conversation. And I mean, philosophers tend to be pretty open to talking about weird stuff,

874
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:01,240
because that's more of us comes with the territory. Whatever strikes them as weird,

875
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:06,920
you still don't just reject it, right? I guess what I'm getting at, and I'm not trying to presume

876
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:12,680
the right answer, because I honestly don't know. But to what extent can we imagine smoothing over

877
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:17,080
the conceptual differences between thinking about physics and thinking about metaphysics?

878
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:21,400
Like, it really should be thinking about reality is what we're doing, right?

879
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:28,600
Yeah. I mean, we do, you know, I do need to mention here that, again, you can be interested in

880
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:34,040
metaphysics and not be a physicalist. So you'd say, part of what I do really is not going to

881
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:38,360
be informed by physics. If I'm a mathematical Platonist and I'm worried about mathematical

882
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:42,360
reality and I say that's just not part of physical reality, so I don't care how your physics comes

883
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:46,520
out. That's a fair, you know, that's a fair thing. So not all of metaphysics has to be

884
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:52,440
hostage or all that. Interested depends on where you're focusing your attention.

885
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:59,400
Okay. We actually, Barry Lower was another person we had on recently and Barry, he said

886
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:05,160
something not on the podcast, sadly, but in informal conversation that was even stronger

887
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:10,120
than something I would say. I think he was being humorous about it, but he said he remembers very

888
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:16,600
vividly being struck the day he realized that most problems of philosophy could be cured or solved

889
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:24,840
by statistical mechanics. And I think that he has a different view about you than that. So we're

890
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:29,320
running out of time a little bit, but I wanted you to have a chance to give a little bit of

891
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:36,040
your view of the arrow of time and things like that, which is the other giant thing that people

892
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:41,320
who care about foundations of physics spend their time worrying about. Right. So let me actually

893
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:48,600
start with the last thing first and just get it out in the open so people at least be aware of it.

894
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:55,800
I would say it is kind of everybody has this idea of their space and it's kind of three-dimensional,

895
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:03,880
at least at large scales. And if I talked about, say, the north-south direction at a certain point,

896
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:08,600
if I went on to say, by the way, space goes north to south, it doesn't go south to north,

897
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:12,200
you'd look at me funny and say, what in the world are you talking about? Right?

898
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:20,120
The spatial thing, there are two directions and they're oppositely directed, but space itself

899
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:24,440
doesn't go more one way than the other. I don't even know what you mean. On the other hand, the

900
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:29,320
person in the street, you say time goes from past to future, doesn't go from future to past,

901
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:34,920
they will again nod at you and say, yeah, tell me something new. Now, I happen to agree with that,

902
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:39,400
that as I think time is fundamentally different from space, temporal structure is fundamentally

903
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:43,240
different from spatial structure in that temporal structure does have a fundamental

904
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:48,840
directionality to it and spatial structure doesn't. This turns out to be a very contentious view

905
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:54,520
among philosophers and physicists for funny reasons, I would say, I don't know that we have

906
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:58,920
the time to go into, but it surely is the minority view. And it's a little bit viewed,

907
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:03,800
just to clarify, it's a little bit different than there are physicists out there and philosophers

908
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:09,080
who will question whether or not time exists or whether it's fundamental, but here we're talking

909
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:15,960
about the direction of time, not time. Yes, that's right, that's right. It would be even harder to

910
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:22,760
deny the existence of time altogether, but certainly the directionality is hotly contested.

911
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:29,160
I think time itself has a direction. Now, it is clearly the case that there are temporal, manifest

912
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:36,520
temporal asymmetries on any view. If you give me two pictures of somebody 10 years apart,

913
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:41,640
usually I can look at them and figure, oh, this was the younger and this is the older,

914
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:48,840
because people tend to wrinkle up. Now, that's not, maybe they had cosmetic surgery. I could get

915
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:55,560
that wrong, but there are certainly lots of very reliable temporal asymmetries,

916
01:22:56,360 --> 01:23:02,680
and those need an explanation, simply saying time has a direction would not explain all by itself

917
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:08,680
any of those observable temporal asymmetries or what people sometimes call arrows of time.

918
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:15,720
I think all of that is a perfectly good object of study, even if you believe as I do, that one of

919
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:22,200
the things that you can invoke is that time is itself directed. That doesn't give me these

920
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:27,640
observable asymmetries like that, but it might be part of the explanation. How does it help?

921
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:34,360
Since people like David Albert and Barry and myself think that you don't need an intrinsic

922
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:37,720
arrow if you just have an initial condition that is doing all the work?

923
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:43,560
Because a lot of the explanation, I mean, we can do this in different levels, but let me do the

924
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:48,600
first level. What do I mean by explaining something? Well, often I think it's a kind of causal

925
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,600
explanation. I talk about cause and effect, and now you say, okay, but what distinguishes cause

926
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:58,280
and effect? Offhand, in many cases, causes precede the effects. I mean, if people often

927
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:03,400
talk about running a movie backward or imagining that, which of course, you can literally run a

928
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:09,400
movie backward, but then the end sequence comes before the title sequence. You still have a direction

929
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:15,960
of time. If you took that seriously as a movie of something in the normal direction, also all the

930
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:20,360
causal structure would be reversed. What were causes would become effects, and therefore the

931
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:29,720
structure of causal explanation would be different. You have to get a bit deep, and statistical

932
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:36,040
mechanics does come into this here in a way that we couldn't get on the table clearly in a short

933
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:43,160
period of time, where you not only have causal explanations where you say this particular

934
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:50,280
precise physical state gives rise to this later one, but other kinds of statistical explanations

935
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:57,080
where you say this kind of physical state. I haven't precisely, but I'm going to constrain it in

936
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:01,640
certain ways. There's a class of various that gives rise to this kind of state. I mean, this is the

937
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:07,000
sort of thing that you take a box of gas, and you say, if you wait a while, it'll eventually relax to

938
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:13,960
an equilibrium. That of course shows a directionality to it, because from this initial state, you can

939
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:20,200
say in five minutes, it'll be equilibrium. If you look at the equilibrium state at a generic level,

940
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:25,560
kind of fuzzed out level, you couldn't say, oh, five minutes ago, it was in this non-equilibrium

941
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:31,960
state. There's a kind of asymmetry there, and that's connected to certain asymmetries in statistical

942
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:38,920
explanation, probabilistic explanation. It's a very interesting and deep, hard topic. A bit

943
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:43,480
different than worrying about, say, relativity, which you might say is about space-time structure,

944
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:48,760
quantum mechanics is about material structure. Statistical explanation is about a kind of

945
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:55,720
explanatory project, and what goes into it, and what succeeds as giving statistical explanations

946
01:25:55,720 --> 01:26:02,360
of things. But I do think that reversing the direction of time, you might have a very good,

947
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:07,400
what you consider to be a very good statistical explanation of something as seen as it were

948
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:11,640
in one direction of time. If you look at the other direction, you say, wait, there's no explanation

949
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:19,400
at all. The explanatory part went away. All I can say is a massive coincidence, or else,

950
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:26,760
to be teleological and say the future is somehow affecting the present. But I take it to be one

951
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:31,560
of the great discoveries of the scientific revolution to get rid of that kind of teleology.

952
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:38,360
Does your view that time has an intrinsic direction affect what we would call microphysics,

953
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,840
the standard model of particle physics, for example, or could it?

954
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:48,440
Sure, it could. I mean, I think that it plays into your fundamental picture of space-time

955
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:54,360
structure. And of course, one needs an account of space-time structure to even begin to write down

956
01:26:54,360 --> 01:27:01,080
what you think of as laws of physics. And I think there are very specific ways in which

957
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:06,680
having a direction, well, certainly having a direction, let me just give you a very

958
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:13,000
concrete thing one could say. Suppose I have a kind of grid, like a street grid, and I have

959
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:18,200
two points on it, and you ask me, okay, how many continuous paths are there that will

960
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:22,760
take me from A to B? And typically, the answer, if the grid goes on forever, it's infinitely many,

961
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:28,120
because it can kind of go short way or around or far around, go way out and come back. Now,

962
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:34,040
suppose I put some arrows on that grid, right? So they're one-way streets. Now it's not at all

963
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:40,040
clear that this number will always be infinite. Now it might be quite tightly constrained. The

964
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:47,800
directionality gives me a resource there that a lack of directionality doesn't have. And I think

965
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:52,360
that's actually quite important and plays out in trying to understand the laws of physics, but

966
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,840
it's much more complicated. It's much more complicated, but that's what you're thinking

967
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:58,600
about these days. That's one of the things I'm thinking about very hard. I mean, I've been working

968
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:04,120
on thinking about what space at time could be like if they were actually not continuous,

969
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:10,360
but discrete at fundamental scale. I worked a long time and did six chapters just on space,

970
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:14,920
and now I have to bring in time. And the time part really has to have a direction. Just for

971
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,360
it to work, it has to have a direction. You have to understand how the directionality comes

972
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:24,040
into it. Sorry, what do you say for it to work? For this scheme I have, to be a kind of thing

973
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:27,880
where you could do a plausible looking sort of physics with. Do you have a catchy name for your

974
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:32,920
scheme? Yeah, full discrete geometry. Full discrete geometry. Okay, good. And the time

975
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:37,560
directedness has to be part of the story. Yeah, it's fundamental in it. Yeah. Okay,

976
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:41,400
all right, good. Well, we're looking forward to that. We'll get some point. Yeah, I know.

977
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:47,960
I got really stuck. Yeah, I mean, well, I'm up on chapter eight now. I mean, the spatial part went

978
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:53,240
real well. And then it was like, okay, part two, let's bring in time. And then you realize it's a

979
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:58,200
tricky business. Is it quantum we're talking or classical? This is all this is all classical

980
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:03,320
geometry. But quantum field theory, there is a connection to quantum field theory, which I'll

981
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:08,440
just state briefly, we talked about problems just in doing quantum field theory, just mathematical

982
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:13,880
problems. One way that this kind of Bohmian or pilot wave approach for quantum field theory was

983
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:18,920
done was done by Bell, it's called Bell type quantum field theory. And one thing he does is he puts

984
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:23,800
it on a lattice, that is, he doesn't do it in continuous space, he does it on a kind of discrete

985
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:28,920
lattice. And you have these jumps from lattice points to lattice points. That turns out to be

986
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:34,760
very important to have a structure where you can do the math in a clean way. Okay, looking forward

987
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:39,480
to the book coming out, we will pre advertise it here. So here's the last, I'm not going to call

988
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:45,320
it a question thing to respond to. When we talk about quantum mechanics, and as we say, you have

989
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:51,320
to give up something maybe that was hopeful or intuitive or whatever. And even in relativity,

990
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:55,560
it seems like maybe the world is a little bit different. Is there hope for

991
01:29:56,360 --> 01:30:01,320
fundamentally understanding why the world is this way? Like in retrospect, can you say, oh,

992
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:04,200
yes, it had to be quantum mechanics, or are we just stuck with it?

993
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:09,800
Yeah, I think people like to say that why the quantum, you know, you'll get this thing. I think,

994
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:15,960
oh, come on, just, you know, grow up. No, I mean, there's going to be foundations. It's going to be

995
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:24,520
one of the really hard questions in this whole topic is the question, where do I stop digging?

996
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:30,120
Right? Where is my spade turned? Where do I say, okay, I've hit a foundation here.

997
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:37,320
It looks like this is a plausible place to stop. And all you can say is, yeah, this is the way it

998
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:41,320
is. Could it have been some other way? Yeah, it could have been some other way. It isn't.

999
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:45,480
This looks like a plausible place to stop. If you think if you're never going to be satisfied,

1000
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:49,560
okay, then you're never going to be satisfied. And the problem is, there are dangers in both

1001
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:55,400
directions, right? If you're too easily satisfied, you'll stop digging when in fact you could

1002
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:59,480
discover a lot of interesting structure lying underneath where you've stopped. But if you're

1003
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:03,640
too pigheaded, you're going to get to the bottom and still be banging your head against it forever,

1004
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:10,280
because there is nothing underneath it, right? So there's a kind of connoisseur's feel for where's

1005
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:16,840
a reasonable place to stop. But I don't think you're going to be stopped by some master principle

1006
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:23,400
that says it could only have been this way. How could you expect that? The world is kind of contingent.

1007
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:27,960
Well, that seems like a reasonable place to stop. So Tim Wilden, thanks very much for being on the

1008
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:34,680
Can I actually, before you do that, because I'm here and I have many voices, many years

1009
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:40,200
that I ever kind of normally will have, and I'm going to just take advantage of you and say,

1010
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:45,960
one of the things I'm doing is trying to promote foundations of physics in the way I'm doing it

1011
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:50,360
is I've founded this thing called the John Bell Institute for the Foundations of Physics.

1012
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:55,720
And we are at the very moment, a kind of critical moment where we're trying to buy a physical place

1013
01:31:55,720 --> 01:32:02,360
for us to live. And if anybody out there likes people who talk about this stuff and thinks

1014
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:07,320
they should have a place to go where they can meet and talk to each other, we have a GoFundMe

1015
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:17,080
or you could go to www.JohnBellInstitute.org. If anybody would like to help us out in any way,

1016
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:20,840
it's our moment of need and we would appreciate it greatly.

1017
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:25,400
Good to be reminded of that. I will also mention that in the intro and put links on

1018
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:30,360
the web page. I can mention it because it's an audio podcast. Tim is wearing a very fetching

1019
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:35,000
John Bell Institute polo shirt right now. So that could be swag. I don't know. Is that a GoFundMe?

1020
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:42,920
This, to get the shirt, you got to come to the place. The only exception to that are my parents

1021
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:47,960
who are 95. And I said, you can have shirts without actually going. But this is, you can only wear

1022
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:53,320
the shirt if you've been there and you've seen this beautiful island in Croatia and enjoyed it

1023
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:57,160
and then you get a shirt. But it is actually an important thing. I'm glad you mentioned it

1024
01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:03,080
because it's a reminder that ideas are great and conversations about them are great, but

1025
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:09,080
institutions also matter for getting these ideas out. And this is the problem. This field is an

1026
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:15,800
academic orphan. Foundations of physics doesn't fit. It kind of doesn't fit in physics departments

1027
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:21,480
and it doesn't really fit in philosophy departments. And so if it's going to live,

1028
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:25,880
a place has to be made for it. All right. Let's look it up on the internet. So in that case,

1029
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:31,720
Tim Walson, thanks very much for being on the Mindscape Podcast. Thank you.
