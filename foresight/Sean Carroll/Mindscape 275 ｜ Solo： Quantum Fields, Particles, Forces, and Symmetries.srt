00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast, I'm your host Sean Carroll.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,200
And we're very excited these days here at Mindscape World International Headquarters

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,720
for Book Publication Week.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,240
As some of you know, on Tuesday, I guess May 14th, here in the United States anyway, we're

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,040
going to have the publication of Quanta and Fields.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,000
This is Volume 2 in the Biggest Ideas in the Universe series.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,440
The series will be a three-part series that aims to explain modern physics, the part of

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,080
modern physics that we know.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,120
Not the speculative stuff, we're not going to be talking about the multiverse or quantum

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,960
gravity or anything like that.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,560
The kinds that ideas in modern physics that we think will last for a very, very long time.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,720
And the gimmick is, we're explaining them in a way that involves the equations.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,080
So we're going to show you the equations.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,800
And that means it's not for everybody, but it's very much for some people.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,360
If you've ever read descriptions of physics where you thought that there was something

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,080
going on, but there's a bunch of metaphors and stories and analogies and you weren't

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,240
quite sure why things were working out the way they were working out, these are the books

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
for you.

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,280
In the Biggest Ideas, you'll really get to see why, for example, the Higgs mechanism

20
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,120
gives mass to particles and things like that.

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,120
You don't need to just wave your hands in any way.

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,800
And the general theme of the book is quanta and fields.

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,120
That's the name of the book, as opposed to the first volume called space, time and motion,

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,360
which was really classical physics.

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,040
This book is about quantum physics.

26
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,200
The third book on complexity and emergence, both is a collection of the things that didn't

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,360
fit into the first two books, but also is about larger scale things, right?

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,800
Biggest dynamics, complex systems, stuff like that.

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,920
And it's kind of a appetizer, main course dessert kind of thing.

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:03,240
This book, volume two, quanta and fields is a book I've been wanting to write for decades.

31
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,200
This is a book that I really have thought for a very long time would be super duper

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,840
useful for a lot of people, because quantum field theory in particular is a part of modern

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,880
physics that is absolutely central and gets very, very little air time in popular discussions.

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,400
We talk about quantum mechanics a lot.

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,080
We talk about entanglement and the measurement problem and all these weird things, bell inequalities

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,480
and so forth.

37
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,080
And then we skip to speculative stuff about string theory or quantum gravity or the multiverse

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,760
or inflation.

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,280
But the actual physicists doing their jobs are thinking about quantum field theory all

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
the time.

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,080
And you rarely get a very full discussion of that in popular media.

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,840
We recently did talk to Matt Strassler, who wrote a wonderful book Waves in an Impossible

43
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,240
Sea that talks about quantum field theory, but it is the opposite level of mathematical

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
explicitness.

45
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,680
It's all about trying to explain in words as carefully as you can how quantum fields

46
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,920
work, whereas quanta and fields, the book that I've written, is a short action packed

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,000
introduction to both quantum mechanics and to its specific implementation in the context

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,040
of field theory, which is where modern physics lives.

49
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,600
That's what we're really thinking about.

50
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:28,080
So we need to understand why in the world you could take a field, quantize it and have

51
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,760
it look like particles.

52
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,840
That's the big mystery of quantum field theory, but that one, you know, historically was figured

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,760
out relatively early on and it opens the floodgates.

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,880
Once you understand that, once you understand that you can quantize fields and get particles

55
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,200
out of them without putting particles in explicitly, there's a whole bunch of things that can

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,480
happen, ways that fields can interact with each other and influence each other that leads

57
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,840
to interactions that we measure with Feynman diagrams.

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,360
I should say that we predict using Feynman diagrams, that we measure in experiments,

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,200
of course, all sorts of conceptual questions with infinities and renormalization, but also

60
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,440
new phenomena that can happen like gauge symmetries giving rise to forces, breaking those symmetries

61
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:19,640
with the Higgs mechanism, confining things inside nucleons and violating parody conservation

62
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
and things like that.

63
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,120
So it's a whole wonderful zoo of things that we've spent the whole 20th century and beyond

64
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,280
trying to understand.

65
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,440
So there's a lot to discuss in a short solo podcast.

66
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,680
I'm not going to cover it all.

67
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,200
Sorry about that.

68
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
You can read the book.

69
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,880
I did do the audio book version of the book.

70
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,400
It's about 10 hours of me talking.

71
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,440
If you don't get enough from the podcast, you can download that and I just read the

72
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,600
book and I try to explain what's in the pictures and the equations and everything like that.

73
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,160
So here I'm just going to hit some highlights.

74
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,720
I really do want to focus on that idea of why quantum fields, how you get particles out

75
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,520
of that and the door that it opens to other things.

76
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,200
So we'll be very explicit about where the particles come from, be a little bit more

77
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,080
hand wavy and gestural about where all these other symmetries and how they get involved.

78
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
But it's important stuff.

79
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,400
It'll give you, I think, a feeling for the kind of thing that we're going to be talking

80
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,880
about in the book if you are so inclined to go more deeply.

81
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,080
So with that, let's go.

82
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,600
I think it's useful to get one thing straight right away.

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,720
Sometimes you will hear quantum mechanics came first and then we invented quantum field

84
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,120
theory.

85
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,960
It's fine to say that because these are words that we make up definitions of, right?

86
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,760
You know, you're always allowed to define the words however you want.

87
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,680
It's not the best way of thinking about things.

88
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,160
Quantum mechanics is a broad framework that includes quantum field theory as part of it.

89
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,800
It is literally the quantum theory of fields, quantum mechanics applied to fields.

90
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
That's what it is.

91
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,520
And it's a very simple statement, obviously, but I remember literally taking quantum field

92
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,360
theory in graduate school and it took me a while to figure out, you know, oh, it's just

93
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
quantum mechanics.

94
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,200
It's the same quantum mechanics we had before just applied to a different system.

95
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,080
It's a subset of quantum mechanics.

96
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,840
The thing that we usually call quantum mechanics is the quantum mechanics of particles and

97
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,560
quantum field theory is the quantum mechanics of fields.

98
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,280
So the very first thing we need to understand to wrap our brains around the idea of quantum

99
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,480
field theory is the word of.

100
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,000
Now this is in some sort of Bill Clinton-esque parsing of language at a very deep level.

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,800
We're really trying to understand, you know, what do you mean when you say you have a quantum

102
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:05,040
theory of some thing like particles or fields or for that matter, strings or loops or whatever.

103
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,040
What does it mean to have a quantum theory theory of some thing?

104
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,480
And the answer to that is that when we do quantum mechanics, whether it's particles or fields

105
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:23,400
or whatever, the usual way we start, not always, but usually we start with a classical theory

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,240
and then we have a cookbook.

107
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,760
We have a set of procedures for converting a classical theory into a quantum theory.

108
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:38,200
We call this quantization, surprisingly enough, and there's a lot hidden in that word quantization

109
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,320
or to quantize.

110
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,240
We don't really have a well-defined map from the space of all classical theories to quantum

111
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
theories.

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,280
So think of it as a way to find quantum mechanical theories starting from a classical theory.

113
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,480
And usually we start from particles.

114
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,840
That's what we do when we first learn quantum mechanics, and it makes sense when we developed

115
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,960
quantum mechanics in the early 1900s, people were more focused on the particles.

116
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,000
The fields were always there, they were thinking about them, but they wanted to get the particles

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,600
right first.

118
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,400
So when you say you have a classical theory of something, you know the vague idea of classical

119
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,120
physics, a la Isaac Newton, you have some particles and they have positions and they

120
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,480
have velocities.

121
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,280
Or equally well, if the mass of the particle is a fixed number, you can talk about the

122
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,560
momentum of the particle.

123
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,600
Momentum is just mass times velocity.

124
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:40,800
For technical reasons that Professor Hamilton figured out, it's actually better to think

125
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,520
about momentum than velocity, but it really doesn't matter.

126
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,680
They're completely convertible back and forth.

127
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,080
And the point is that for any one particle, once you know those two things, position and

128
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,560
momentum, you can figure out what's going to happen to it, right?

129
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,360
You can plug into Newton's laws of motion or Hamilton's equations or Lagrange's equations.

130
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,000
There's many different mathematically equivalent ways to do classical physics.

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,680
These are all explained in volume one of the biggest ideas, space, time and motion.

132
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,680
And the thing that is the same in all of these different ways of thinking about classical

133
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,560
physics is the amount of information you need to say what's going to happen next.

134
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,480
If you were Laplace's demon, if you were able to predict exactly what was implied by

135
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,800
the laws of physics, the data you'd need to be given is the position and momentum of

136
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,480
all the particles.

137
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,960
And then it's deterministic, right?

138
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,560
The wonderful thing about classical mechanics is it says what's going to happen.

139
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,480
It's not ambiguous about it.

140
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,440
So quantum mechanics says, okay, think about this one particle just to start.

141
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,200
We have position and momentum.

142
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Throw away the momentum.

143
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,320
Forget about the momentum just for a minute, okay?

144
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:56,480
And quantum mechanics says instead of having a position, we now describe the particle by

145
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,400
having a wave function psi of x.

146
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,480
If x were the position, psi, the Greek letter psi is the wave function which assigns a number

147
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,520
to every possible position.

148
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
That's the wave function.

149
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,280
Usually that number will be zero or very, very close to zero, almost everywhere.

150
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,080
And then in some little blob-like region of space, that number will not be zero.

151
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
That's the wave function.

152
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,000
For any possible place you might see the particle were you to look for it, there's going to

153
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,760
be a number, a complex number in particular.

154
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,520
And what the wave function tells you is the probability of observing the particle to have

155
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,800
that position.

156
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,120
So in particular, you calculate the probability by squaring the wave function.

157
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,560
Or since it's a complex number, you take the modulus squared of the wave function.

158
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,640
And in the new book, Quantum and Fields, we go through quantum mechanics really quickly.

159
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,520
First three chapters, we do it.

160
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,640
Wave functions, measurement, entanglement, and then we're moving on and devoting most

161
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,320
of the book to quantum field theory because that's a very rich and very complicated set

162
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,080
of ideas.

163
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,840
So where did momentum go is one obvious question.

164
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:14,320
And the answer is, you know, when I said that the wave function varies with space, how fast

165
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
is varying?

166
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,800
How fast the wave function is wiggling up and down basically tells you the momentum.

167
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:26,080
Or more accurately, you can turn it into a prediction for measuring the momentum to

168
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,760
have any particular value in exactly the same way wave function squared kind of procedure.

169
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,800
So the point is, the thing I don't want to get lost, the thing you need to understand

170
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,960
for the rest of the discussion is, when you go from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics,

171
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,280
you start with some object with a definite state, position and momentum, and you switch

172
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,280
to a wave function that will tell you the probability of getting different observational

173
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,480
outcomes.

174
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,480
That's the evolution or the transformation from a classical theory to a quantum theory.

175
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,360
And in that case, we were talking about particles, and it's natural to talk about particles because

176
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,280
if you think about the development of quantum mechanics, what were they thinking about?

177
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:15,840
We often attribute the birth of quantum mechanics to Planck and Einstein in 1900, Planck understood

178
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,800
black body radiation in terms of chunks of energy being given off by vibrating electrons

179
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
and atoms.

180
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,200
In 1905, Einstein really said, you know, all electromagnetic radiation can be thought of

181
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,480
as coming out in these particle-like quanta, which we now call photons.

182
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,280
But subsequent to that, the work by people like Niels Bohr and Louis de Broglie and Werner

183
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:46,200
Heisenberg, etc., was more focused on particles, in particular on the electrons orbiting atoms.

184
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,400
So they were trying to understand the structure of atoms, how atoms would give off radiation,

185
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
things like that.

186
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,880
So it was the particles that were really front and center.

187
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,720
And then therefore, it makes sense, when you're an undergraduate physics student, you learn

188
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,720
about the quantum mechanics of particles.

189
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:11,080
I should say, vis-a-vis the book that is coming out, the reason why I can pack a whole discussion

190
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,720
of both quantum mechanics and quantum field theory into a relatively short book, even

191
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,600
though I do include all the equations, is because you're not trying to solve the equations.

192
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,840
You're not going to come out of reading this book, being able to calculate the scattering

193
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,520
probability of two particles or the decay rate of the Higgs boson or anything like that.

194
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,560
You will understand what those words mean, and you will have an idea what the equations

195
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,080
are behind them, but I'm not training you to be a practicing physicist.

196
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,120
And that philosophy is remarkably liberating.

197
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:51,440
So just to be super clear here, a very small percentage of people who get bachelor's degrees

198
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,000
in physics ever learn quantum field theory.

199
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,520
In fact, plenty of people get PhDs in physics without ever learning quantum field theory.

200
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,880
Just like in volume one, we did Einstein's equation for general relativity, that's still

201
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,400
a classical theory, Einstein's theory of gravity, many, many people get a physics education

202
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,160
and do not learn general relativity.

203
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,200
So part of the reason why I'm writing these books is because I want more people to be

204
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,640
able to grasp these ideas, even physics majors, plenty of physics majors don't get to learn

205
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,520
about these things.

206
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,560
And they're not that inaccessible, honestly.

207
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,040
You can learn them, I promise.

208
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,680
You'll get a feeling for here in the podcast.

209
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,480
So I'm going to keep referring back to what we study as physics students, even though

210
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,280
I don't expect you to grow up to be necessarily a physics student or a working physicist.

211
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
That's the idea.

212
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,040
Okay, so the first thing we would learn if we were an undergraduate sometime in your

213
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,480
sophomore year or your junior year maybe, sometimes the universities will split it up.

214
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,600
So you'll sort of get like a little hint even in your very first year about quantum mechanics

215
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,440
and you'll do it seriously later on in your junior or sophomore years.

216
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,400
And you'll be mostly taught the quantum theory of particles.

217
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,120
So you're imagining that the system you're studying is an electron or something like

218
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,400
that, okay, orbiting in an atom.

219
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,320
And you have this wave function and you have an equation that tells you how the wave function

220
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
behaves and that's the short of your equation.

221
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,520
There's different, again, mathematically equivalent ways of thinking about it, but that's the

222
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,960
basic idea.

223
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,200
And from that you can predict things like the spectrum of radiation being absorbed or

224
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,960
emitted from the atoms.

225
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,640
So the general idea is, as we said, start with particles, make wave functions, and then

226
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,760
give you a set of rules for how the wave functions behave.

227
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,440
They evolve according to the Schrodinger equation when you're not measuring them.

228
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,920
When you are measuring them, they collapse and you get a probability of observing something.

229
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,800
Then you discovered that there's this thing called entanglement.

230
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:08,000
To be very honest, you could possibly take an entire one semester intro to quantum course

231
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,800
as an undergraduate and never hear about entanglement.

232
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,760
I know that's weird because if you hear the popular level discussions, they'll talk about

233
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,560
entanglement all the time.

234
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,120
But you can easily spend a semester just solving the Schrodinger equation for different kinds

235
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,560
of potential energies that the electron could be moving in.

236
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,280
So let me tell you, taking that undergraduate course is not necessarily as sexy as you might

237
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,000
imagine that it is if you just heard popular level discussions of quantum mechanics.

238
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,560
In all this stuff you learn about the particles, about the wave functions, about the Schrodinger

239
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:45,960
equation, it gives you a wonderfully precise, quantitative, and experimentally testable

240
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:51,320
understanding of what happens in atoms, of the ways that there are different energy levels,

241
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,000
different orbitals, and so forth, and how they show up experimentally.

242
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,240
And let me emphasize that bit about different energy levels, because this is absolutely

243
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:05,240
crucial to the essence of quantum mechanics in a way that I think is misunderstood by

244
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,960
a lot of people who don't study it professionally.

245
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:15,400
Which is the word quantum is a little bit misleading, I would say.

246
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,760
What does quantum mean?

247
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,320
Before you knew about quantum mechanics, the word quantum was still around.

248
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,320
It meant a discrete amount of something, one chunk of something, right?

249
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:32,560
The idea of a quantum, or many quanta, would be the plural, is rather than having a smooth

250
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,080
distribution of things, you have individual pieces, discrete elements, those are the quanta.

251
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,320
So particulate, particle-like, pixelated, or whatever you want to call it, that's the

252
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,720
sort of philosophy behind the word, quanta, or quantum.

253
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:54,800
And calling this theory that we're discussing, quantum mechanics, or quantum field theory,

254
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:03,040
makes you think, informally, that maybe the world is divided up into chunks, right?

255
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,160
Into pieces, into discrete bits, that the world is not fundamentally smooth, but rather

256
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,920
fundamentally discrete.

257
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,560
Maybe this inspires you to think that once you include gravity in the game, space, and

258
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:22,880
maybe space-time will be divided up into chunks, into a little lattice, little pixels, or something

259
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
like that.

260
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,680
This is a fundamental, deep, terrible, awful, no-good understanding of what quantum mechanics

261
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,800
actually says.

262
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,480
Because if you think about what I just said, if we take the idea of a particle, replace

263
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,200
it by the idea of a wave function, and that wave function obeys the Schrodinger equation,

264
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,800
nowhere there is the idea of chunks of anything.

265
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,920
Nowhere there is the idea that the world is broken up into discrete bits of matter or

266
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
energy.

267
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,680
It's as smooth as it could possibly be.

268
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,000
Everything is continuous and smooth.

269
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,400
The wave function is a function that spreads out all over the place.

270
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,400
The Schrodinger equation smoothly evolves that wave function, right?

271
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Where does this idea of quanta come from?

272
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:16,400
And the answer is that, well, it's exactly analogous to the very well-known analogy that

273
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,440
we use of plucking a guitar string.

274
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,760
So if you have a guitar string that is tied down at two ends and you pluck it, there's

275
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:31,440
a fundamental wavelength at which it vibrates, which leads to a fundamental frequency of sound

276
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,800
being given off.

277
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,640
But there are also harmonics, right?

278
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,440
If you imagine, if you can visualize in your head, I know this is an audio podcast, but

279
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,800
visualize in your head a string being held down at both ends and vibrating sort of uniformly

280
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,680
smoothly up and down, except at the ends.

281
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,840
So in the middle, it's vibrating up and down, tied down at the ends, so the amplitude of

282
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,880
the vibration kind of goes down to zero at both ends where it's tied down.

283
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,480
That is the fundamental frequency at which it's vibrating.

284
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,960
And then the first harmonic frequency is, it looks kind of like an up and down wave-like

285
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
shape.

286
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,520
So it starts at one tied down end, goes up halfway through the string, it comes back

287
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,800
down to zero again, and in the other half of the string, it's going down on the right

288
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,520
hand side where, as it was going up on the left hand side.

289
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,360
And so the wavelength is half of what it was.

290
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,360
And therefore, the frequency is twice what it was.

291
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,480
And these are two different things that can happen to the same string.

292
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,040
And then, of course, you have even higher harmonics, where the wave goes up, down, up

293
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:46,040
again, and all the way up for higher and higher frequencies, shorter and shorter wavelengths.

294
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,040
The reason why I'm talking about this guitar string analogy, and if you're a talented

295
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,600
guitar player, you can actually play the harmonics, get them to come out of your guitar, even

296
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,580
without getting the fundamental note to come out of your guitar.

297
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,640
But that's a different podcast discussion entirely.

298
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:08,480
The point is, the string that you're plucking has nothing discreet about it.

299
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,280
It's not that the string is only allowed to do certain things.

300
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,360
The string could have any shape that it wants to, as long as it's tied down at both ends.

301
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:25,160
But it naturally has a set of ways of vibrating that are sort of easiest to make it vibrate

302
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,880
at, that are very natural and direct.

303
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,880
In fact, at the technical level, we would say these are the ones that have a definite

304
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,040
energy in their vibrations.

305
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:42,240
And so the discreteness comes not because the string itself is discreet, but because

306
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,160
its behavior falls into a discrete set of possibilities.

307
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,800
The fundamental frequency, the first harmonic, second harmonic, et cetera.

308
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,000
And you can calculate exactly what the frequencies are and so forth.

309
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,280
So there's kind of an emergent nature to the discreteness.

310
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,120
The discreteness is not built into the system.

311
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,960
It is a feature of the solutions to the equations that govern the system in some high level

312
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
way.

313
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
But you can just see it pictorially.

314
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,320
You can tell why.

315
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,800
You can understand that it makes sense that there is, you know, the lowest note, a little

316
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,000
bit higher note, a little bit higher note than that and so forth.

317
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,120
That phenomenon is exactly why, in quantum mechanics, we see discrete behavior for things

318
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,740
like the energy of radiation being given off by one of these atoms.

319
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:39,840
So instead of thinking of the guitar string being tied down at both ends, think of the

320
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,920
wave function of an electron in an atom.

321
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Let's make our lives easier.

322
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,400
Let's make it a hydrogen atom.

323
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,800
So there's only one electron and there's only one particle in the nucleus, a single

324
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
proton.

325
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Okay.

326
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,360
Well, the electron wave function is not tied down.

327
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,560
It can extend very gradually out to infinity, right?

328
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,720
But the wave function has to go to zero at infinity as it gets very, very, very far away

329
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,040
from the proton.

330
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,240
It's going to go to zero because there's only, you can only have a finite amount of

331
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
wave function.

332
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,400
The wave function can't spread uniformly over all of space.

333
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,040
It has to be sort of concentrated somewhere and we're imagining that it's concentrated

334
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,360
near the proton in the atom.

335
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,360
So even though the electrons wave function is not literally tied down, effectively it

336
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
is.

337
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:32,360
It goes to zero as you get far away from the atom and you can play exactly the same game

338
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,200
with the electron wave function that you play with the plucked guitar string.

339
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,500
There are technical differences because the energy is a little bit different and also

340
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,720
because it's a three-dimensional thing, the electron wave function rather than the single

341
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,900
one-dimensional guitar string.

342
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,100
But the essence of the issue is the same.

343
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:56,500
There will be a lowest energy state of the electron, which is analogous to the fundamental

344
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,500
frequency of the guitar string and that's the lowest energy the electron can have in

345
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,000
a hydrogen atom.

346
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,840
And then there is a next highest energy level state that has some discrete extra amount

347
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,420
of energy.

348
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:16,500
It is not the case that the electron's wave function can't do anything at once.

349
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,920
It can vibrate in whatever way it wants.

350
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,980
But there's a natural set of ways that it can vibrate or ways that it can sort of arrange

351
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,260
itself around the proton and these are the ways that have definite energies and these

352
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:35,500
are the natural places for the electron to settle down into and what we actually observe.

353
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:41,340
So the discreteness of the energy levels of an electron, which by the way you learn

354
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,220
about in chemistry class, we learn about the orbitals of an electron around an atom, that's

355
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,340
exactly what's going on.

356
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:54,060
These are not because you've put in any fundamental discreteness into the nature of the reality

357
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,500
that you're talking about.

358
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,620
The reality is a smooth function obeying a smooth equation.

359
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:04,220
It's the behavior of the solutions to that equation that has a discrete character and

360
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:08,140
I'm really sort of dwelling on this and emphasizing it because it's going to become super-duper

361
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,260
important when we get to quantum field theory.

362
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:18,380
So the lesson here is you start with a completely smooth, continuous, arbitrarily varying thing,

363
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:23,940
the wave function of the electron and then you examine its behavior under very certain

364
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:31,180
special circumstances, namely it's sitting there glued to a proton in a hydrogen atom

365
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,100
and you find that the possible places you could find, the possible states you could find the

366
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,980
electron wave function in, come in a discrete set.

367
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,660
So again that discreteness is emergent because it's a property of the different solutions

368
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:51,020
to the equation, in this case the Schrodinger equation rather than the equation for a string

369
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,060
in a guitar.

370
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,620
So that's where quanta come from.

371
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:02,060
It's not because you pixelated the universe, it's because you solved an equation and the

372
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,420
solutions come in a discrete set.

373
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:11,220
And historically this was all done in the 1910s and 20s and we figured this out, quantum

374
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,300
mechanics was a great success, great.

375
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:20,420
But we always knew, even back in the 20s, that the world was not simply made of particles.

376
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:26,100
As we said, the very first glimmers of quantum mechanics came from thinking about fields,

377
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,860
thought about particles.

378
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:34,900
In the 19th century we had figured out that electricity and magnetism were two sets of

379
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:40,500
phenomena that were unified in a description that involved two different fields, the electric

380
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,860
field and the magnetic field.

381
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:48,460
And in fact, once Einstein and Minkowski came along with special relativity, we realized

382
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:53,300
that the electric field, the magnetic field were literally two different aspects of the

383
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,860
same underlying field.

384
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,980
So at some point we just call it the electromagnetic field.

385
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,980
And a field is a very different thing than a particle.

386
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,500
A particle, classically, let's just think classically now, we haven't quantized anything

387
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,220
yet, a particle has a location.

388
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:12,380
As we said, it has a position, it has a velocity, that's what a particle is basically.

389
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:18,620
Whereas a field is everywhere, okay, and I need to be very, very careful here, as careful

390
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:25,740
as I can be, to distinguish the different conceptual things that sound very, very similar

391
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,740
to each other.

392
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:34,740
In this case, a classical field is very, very different from a quantum wave function, okay.

393
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,020
They seem similar because a classical field has a value at every point in space.

394
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,620
The electric field has a value at every point in space.

395
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,140
It's a little vector because the electric field is not just a number, it's a little

396
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,420
arrow with a direction and a magnitude at every point in space.

397
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,700
You can't see it, it's invisible, it's all around you.

398
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,660
The magnetic field, likewise, you know, you can detect it, if you put iron filings on

399
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:04,380
a piece of paper near a magnet, they will line up with the magnetic field, showing the

400
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,780
influence of the magnetic field around you, a compass that you can carry around will point

401
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,340
toward the north pole for exactly that same reason.

402
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,620
And you can detect the electric field likewise, but they're there, they're around you at every

403
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,260
point in space around you right now, including inside you for that matter, and also, you

404
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,380
know, out in interstellar space.

405
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,940
Every point in space has a value for the electric field and the magnetic field.

406
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,540
That's what a field is.

407
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:34,940
A field is an entity that takes a value at every point in space.

408
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,860
You're very tempted to say, well, what are the fields made of?

409
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,220
That would be a bad question to ask.

410
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,700
I mean, you're welcome to ask it, but the answer is there isn't anything that the fields

411
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,900
are made of.

412
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,260
The world is going to be made of the fields, okay.

413
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,740
The fields are the bottom layer of reality, according to quantum field theory.

414
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,580
Now quantum field theory might not be the final answer.

415
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:57,420
I'll leave it in gesture at the very end toward the idea that it's not the final answer.

416
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:01,780
But according to quantum field theory, the rules are that we start with fields and we

417
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,740
build everything else out of them.

418
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:10,300
Now that idea that there is a number, a quantity, something like that at every point in spacetime

419
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,980
sounds very similar to the wave function of an electron, right?

420
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,300
And I told you that the wave function of an electron assigns a complex number to every

421
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,060
point in space.

422
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,660
And that number squared will give you the probability of observing the electron there.

423
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,740
But what if you had two electrons, right?

424
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,900
You do know that there is this thing that we talk about in chapter three of the new book

425
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,740
called Entanglement.

426
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,820
And Entanglement says that when you have two electrons, and let's say if you were actually

427
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,140
even better, let's make it more clear because electrons are identical particles and that's

428
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,180
going to get in the way of being correct sometimes here.

429
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,220
Let's say we have an electron and a proton.

430
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,900
So two particles, but very distinguishable.

431
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,420
You know which is the electron, which is the proton.

432
00:29:53,420 --> 00:30:00,300
And call the position that you might observe the electron at x1 and the position you might

433
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,660
observe the proton at x2.

434
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,940
You know if you looked for these particles, whether you found the electron or proton, they're

435
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,380
very different looking particles.

436
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:14,860
When the phenomenon of entanglement tells you that the combined state of both particles

437
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:21,700
is not a wave function for the electron and a wave function for the proton, it is a single

438
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:28,500
wave function for the system that is made of the electron and the proton.

439
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,060
In other words, there is only one wave function.

440
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,500
Ultimately, it will be called the wave function of the universe because it actually includes

441
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,340
the whole universe, not just these two particles.

442
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:41,260
But for right now, it is a wave function of these two particles and it is a function

443
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,940
of x1 and x2.

444
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:49,020
For every possible position you could find the electron at and position you can find

445
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,700
the proton at, there will be a complex number.

446
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,140
And you ask the question, where are these two particles simultaneously?

447
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,780
And the wave function tells you a complex number that you square to get the probability

448
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,980
of seeing those two particles at that place.

449
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:12,100
So this seems like a little detail that might not be very important, but it's actually super

450
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:18,740
duper crucial here, namely that the wave function doesn't depend on space.

451
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,900
In this case, in the case of the electron and the proton, the wave function depends on two

452
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,100
copies of space.

453
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,460
One copy saying where is the electron, one copy saying where is the proton.

454
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,860
So in a very real sense, even though it sounds like a technicality, the wave function is

455
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,580
not a field.

456
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,740
The wave function of the universe, the wave function of the real world, the wave function

457
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,860
that we care about when we do quantum mechanics is not a field in the same sense that the

458
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,700
electric field or the magnetic field is.

459
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,980
The magnetic field doesn't care how many particles you have, it still has a value at

460
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,880
every point in space.

461
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,220
The wave function of a two particle system doesn't have a unique value at some point

462
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,220
in space.

463
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,580
The thing it depends on is the configuration space of all the particles, and for that matter

464
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,060
as we will see all the fields in the universe.

465
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,780
So it's a different kind of thing.

466
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:17,780
There is sort of an accidental coincidental resemblance of the wave function of one particle

467
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:24,020
to a field, but the idea, the conceptual notion of a wave function is a very different kind

468
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,140
of thing than a classical field, okay?

469
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:31,980
Classical fields really literally honestly are things that have values at each point

470
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,100
in space.

471
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:38,180
The electric field, the magnetic field, also the gravitational potential field and other

472
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,620
such kinds of fields.

473
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,180
Gravity was always thought to be a little bit trickier even before general relativity

474
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:49,820
came along, so most of the attention in the early 20th century was being focused on the

475
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,780
electromagnetic field.

476
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:59,500
So there was this vague idea near the turn of that century that matter was made of particles,

477
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:05,020
electrons, protons, and we eventually discovered neutrons and other things like that, whereas

478
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,580
forces were being carried by fields because we knew about gravity, we knew about electromagnetism,

479
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,580
etc.

480
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:17,620
So we thought, roughly speaking, even though it was not completely laid down explicitly,

481
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:22,380
that the world was going to consist of these two kinds of things, particles and fields,

482
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,900
matter and forces, right?

483
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,860
Matter from the particles, forces from the fields.

484
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:34,300
And so once quantum mechanics came along in its more robust form in the 1920s, and you

485
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:40,340
understood the quantum mechanics of particles, it was very, very natural to say, okay, now

486
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,140
we will turn to the quantum mechanics of fields.

487
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,860
And that's what the word of means, this is where we started this digression, understanding

488
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,100
the word of.

489
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:55,500
The word of means we're starting with a classical theory of something, particles to start, now

490
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,620
fields, and we're going to construct a quantum theory of it.

491
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,740
What does that mean?

492
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:06,060
It means take the classical theory, take the thing that plays the role of a position for

493
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,340
a particle, right?

494
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,540
For a field, fields don't have a position.

495
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
Fields are everywhere.

496
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,180
You can't just say what the position of a field is, but the role of position is basically

497
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:20,540
played by the value of the field at every point in space.

498
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,900
And then you're saying, well, okay, what's the, what's the role of the momentum or the

499
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
velocity?

500
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,060
Well, it is the rate of change.

501
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,700
It's the time derivative of the field at every point in space.

502
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,540
But again, happily, we don't need to think about that too deeply because what happens

503
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,900
when you quantize a particle is you temporarily forget about the momentum and just focus on

504
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,900
position.

505
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:46,900
When we quantize a field, we're going to start by thinking hard about the space of all possible

506
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,020
profiles of the field.

507
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:57,160
That is to say at every point in space, we imagine the field has a value and conceptually

508
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,540
we can ask, you know, so what is the space, what is the set of all possible values that

509
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,580
can have it all at once?

510
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,860
So I'm not asking, you know, what is the value at this point X and this point Y and this

511
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,420
point Z, et cetera, et cetera.

512
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,620
I'm saying all throughout space, all at once, the field sort of has a shape, right?

513
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:21,980
The field has an individual value at every point, so an infinite number of values, one

514
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,720
value at every point.

515
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,800
That is a profile of the field, okay?

516
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,140
That is a possible answer to the question.

517
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:37,380
If I could imagine measuring the field instantaneously all throughout the universe, what would it

518
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,460
look like?

519
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,820
That is a profile of the field.

520
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:47,060
That is the idea that plays the analogous role to the position of a single particle.

521
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:53,500
So you can see that, you know, mathematically, conceptually, this is a little bit more intimidating

522
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,660
than particles.

523
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,860
For a particle, you just had a position, you set a location, here it is, I can give you

524
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,980
three numbers, X, Y, Z, that's where it is.

525
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,980
For the field, you have to tell me what it's doing at every point throughout an infinitely

526
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,980
big universe.

527
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,900
That seems much harder to do.

528
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,060
But fields existed.

529
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,820
So we have to try to deal with them.

530
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:19,140
In fact, I should also mention that beyond the existence of the electromagnetic field,

531
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,420
there is also the phenomenon of radioactivity, okay?

532
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:30,140
There was the experimental discovery that particles could turn into other kinds of particles.

533
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,300
Particles could decay and give off particles.

534
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,860
Particles could be created and destroyed, right?

535
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,700
Even at the level of particles.

536
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:42,300
And the reason why I'm mentioning this is because if you take the Schrodinger equation

537
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:49,020
for a system of one electron or two electrons or three electrons or whatever, the number

538
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,780
of electrons never changes according to the Schrodinger equation.

539
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:58,100
If you just do particle quantum mechanics, you're going to be stuck with the same number

540
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,820
of particles that you always had.

541
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,900
You need to sort of generalize it a little bit, give it, you can do this.

542
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,060
You can sort of say, all right, I'm going to imagine ways that the number of particles

543
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,300
can change.

544
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:15,860
But as we'll see, or as we'll become natural at some point, basically what you're doing

545
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,220
is inventing field theory when you do that.

546
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:24,060
Field theory is a very natural way of accounting for the fact that the number of particles in

547
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,300
a system can change over time.

548
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,300
Okay, that was just an aside.

549
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,900
I want to get back to the electromagnetic field just for a second.

550
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,220
So we knew about the electromagnetic field.

551
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,100
We knew that we would have to incorporate it into quantum mechanics at some point.

552
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,980
And people tried to do it very early on in the development of quantum mechanics.

553
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:47,580
People like Paul Dirac, Heisenberg, and others tried to quantize the electromagnetic field.

554
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,860
People like Enrico Fermi wrote down theories where numbers of particles could change using

555
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,420
the idea of fields.

556
00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:00,180
So the question became, what does it mean to take something that is already a field

557
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:06,900
like the electromagnetic field and to quantize it, to give it a wave function of some sort?

558
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,420
So I can tell you the answer, and it's the correct answer, it's just sort of presented

559
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,420
in a way that doesn't seem very helpful.

560
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:19,620
To every possible profile of the field, that is to say to every possible configuration

561
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:24,980
of the field all throughout space, we will attach a number, a complex number.

562
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,500
That is the wave function of the field.

563
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,460
And were we to imagine observing the field everywhere throughout space simultaneously

564
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,900
all at once, we would take that wave function and square it to get the probability we would

565
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,020
observe the field to be in that configuration.

566
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,340
So I hope that that made a little bit of sense, but I also hope that it's a little intimidating

567
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,820
and a little baffling as to how we would actually make any progress at a practical level with

568
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,820
that.

569
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:56,740
It was relatively easy to handle the idea of a wave function of a particle, but the wave

570
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:03,700
function of a field just seems like a completely, you know, impossible to wrestle mathematical

571
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,460
beast, right?

572
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,860
To every possible field configuration, we assign a number that just seems impractical

573
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,180
to write it down.

574
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,420
What would that wave function really ever look like?

575
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:19,380
And indeed, were you to take a quantum field theory class at a university somewhere or

576
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:24,500
pick up a real quantum field theory textbook, they almost never do this thing that I just

577
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,740
told you, assigning a complex number to every possible field configuration.

578
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:34,340
That is a perfectly valid way of thinking about quantum field theory, but it's not really

579
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,260
the practical way.

580
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:40,340
And so that's the reason why I could take a quantum field theory course as a graduate

581
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,860
student and have it remain hidden to me for a long time that really what we were doing

582
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:49,620
was just quantum mechanics because it's presented in a very different way using very different

583
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,380
mathematical tools.

584
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,940
But I think that it's conceptually easier if we try to stick as close as possible to

585
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:01,780
the same notion of quantization and converting a classical theory into a quantum theory in

586
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:06,220
the field context that we usually use in the particle context.

587
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:12,340
So the continuity of the ideas remains as explicit as it can be.

588
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:19,140
So what are we supposed to do with the fact that we're imagining profiles of fields stretching

589
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,460
all throughout space and attaching complex numbers to every possible profile, squaring

590
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,700
those complex numbers to get the probability that we would observe the field to look like

591
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,860
that?

592
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,220
The answer is Fourier transforms.

593
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,620
That's honestly the answer.

594
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:39,140
If you look online, if you look at the web page that I have for quantum fields, you look

595
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:45,540
at the table of contents that I published there, you will see an appendix.

596
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:52,420
There's like 12 chapters plus an appendix and the chapters all have punchy titles like

597
00:40:52,420 --> 00:41:00,820
atoms and interactions and effective field theory and matter or whatever.

598
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:08,060
So there's a lot of basic ideas that are pretty obviously big important ideas.

599
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:13,460
And then the appendix is Fourier transforms, which seems like a little bit of an ugly duckling

600
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,460
in the collection.

601
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,740
It's like some specific mathy-sounding idea that hopefully I didn't have anything to

602
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,740
do with.

603
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:24,380
Indeed, I tell the story that when I was an undergraduate myself and I first learned

604
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:29,660
Fourier transforms, I literally was thinking like this is a quintessential example of a

605
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,540
mathematical technique I will never actually use in real life.

606
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,580
And then you discover once you take quantum field theory as well as other parts of physics

607
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:42,660
that Fourier transforms are the single most important thing in lots of areas of theoretical

608
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,660
physics.

609
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,060
So that is a Fourier transform.

610
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:50,380
It's just another way of thinking about the value of a field.

611
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,420
We said the value of field, the profile, the configuration of a field, whatever you want

612
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:00,060
to call it, is basically a function of space or a function of space time.

613
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,060
Let's just think space.

614
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,540
We don't need to worry about evolution right now, although we will evolve through time

615
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,980
at some point.

616
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,540
So at every point in space, there's a value of the field, that's the field profile.

617
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:18,420
So to give you the information about what the field profile is, requires in principle

618
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,860
an infinite amount of data, right?

619
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:25,500
I have to list every point in space, that's an infinite number of points, and at each

620
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,340
point I tell you what the field is doing.

621
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:34,460
Now realistically for fields that we might care about, maybe there's some simple ways

622
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:39,100
of compressing all that information into a compact notation or whatever, but in principle

623
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,180
that's what I have to give you.

624
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:47,300
The idea of a Fourier transform is, I can represent that information in a much more

625
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:52,820
convenient way, the information about what is the field doing at every point in space.

626
00:42:52,820 --> 00:43:01,380
Think of a simple kind of field configuration, namely a pure wave, a pure sine function

627
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:07,100
or cosine function, a sinusoidal wave, that is just a fancy wave saying a wave that literally

628
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:12,460
just goes up and down with an absolutely fixed wavelength and an absolutely fixed amplitude,

629
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,460
okay?

630
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:18,580
The typical idea of a wave, a plane wave that stretches all throughout space that you might

631
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:23,340
see in a picture, you know, a very wave-like thing, not complicated ripples and going in

632
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:29,060
different directions, just a very smooth regular wave stretching all throughout space.

633
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:35,780
That's an example of a simple wave, a wave that a configuration of the field, waves are

634
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,780
just configurations of fields, by the way, there's almost no difference between the word

635
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:46,460
wave and the word field, except sadly we have attached the word wave to wave functions which

636
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,460
are different kinds of things, I know, that's very annoying, sorry about that, I wasn't

637
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,100
to blame for that.

638
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:58,140
Anyway, this particular kind of simple wave, a sinusoidal wave, a wave with a definite wave

639
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:05,140
length that remains absolutely constant all throughout infinitely big space, that is a

640
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:10,380
plane wave, it is something we can represent mathematically using sines and cosines, okay,

641
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,200
if you know a little bit about your trigonometry functions.

642
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:22,220
And we call a wave of a definite wavelength a mode of the field, and of course, most field

643
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:27,660
configurations aren't going to be that simple, right, they are going to be more unpredictable

644
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,420
as you go from place to place, but we're choosing just for a moment to focus on very,

645
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:37,720
very simple, very, very regular configurations of the fields, ones that look like absolutely

646
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,520
uniform sine waves all throughout space.

647
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:49,080
So back in, I don't know, but I think it was the 1800s, Professor Fourier noticed that

648
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:56,420
if I took different waves, that is to say waves of different wavelengths, right, so waves

649
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:01,980
of each wave has a definite wavelength, I'm imagining a mode is what we call it, a mode

650
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:07,540
is a wave of definite wavelength, so I'm imagining different modes, and he says if I add them

651
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:12,780
together, I can get something that is not a mode, right, because if I add two waves

652
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,420
together with different wavelengths, I will not get a simple sine wave, I'll get something

653
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,340
that looks more complicated than that.

654
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:24,540
And if I add three or a hundred billion waves together, then I can get things that look

655
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,940
more complicated than just a simple sine wave.

656
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:31,060
And I don't know what his actual thought process was, it was probably a little bit more systematic

657
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:38,860
than that, but Fourier asked himself, is it possible that if I add an infinite number

658
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:44,780
of waves together, I can get any shape of the field I want?

659
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,260
And the answer is yes, otherwise we wouldn't be going through this, right?

660
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:55,900
The answer is I can express any field I want, any configuration of the field, any increase

661
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:00,860
and decrease and change in direction of a field all throughout space, you give that

662
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:09,300
to me, I'm going to express it as a sum of these nice simple modes, modes with a definite

663
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,900
wavelength, I add up different wavelengths together, I get something that doesn't look

664
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,220
like it has a wavelength at all, it's an arbitrary mess, literally any profile of the field,

665
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,940
can be written as a sum of modes.

666
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:27,700
And the point is, that's the Fourier transform, rather than giving you the information about

667
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:34,380
what the field value is at every point in space, I give you how much of each mode contributes

668
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,380
to the field.

669
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:42,140
I guess I should be super-duper careful here, say not only can you take any profile, any

670
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:47,660
configuration of the field you want and express it as a sum of modes of fixed wavelength,

671
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:52,820
but that expression is unique, that is to say given a profile, there is one and only

672
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:58,380
one way of expressing it as a sum of modes of fixed wavelength, that's what the Fourier

673
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:05,220
transform does, it tells you what that way is, that way of expressing some wildly varying

674
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:11,100
function as a sum of nice sine waves and cosines, okay?

675
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:17,020
And the information is now been transformed, the information that used to be at every point

676
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:22,700
in space, I tell you the value of the field, now the information is, I tell you how much

677
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:29,540
of a contribution the field gets from each mode, from each sine wave with a definite

678
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,540
wavelength.

679
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:35,540
You know, some of them, some wavelengths might be very important, so there's a big contribution,

680
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:39,660
so there's a big number times the sine wave in the sum of all this infinite number of

681
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,300
them, some might not be that important.

682
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,620
And this fact is kind of amazing, you know, this fact is not at all intuitive, right?

683
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:51,460
You take a bunch of perfectly regular up and down waves, and in principle you can add them

684
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:56,260
together to get any behavior you want, you might not have guessed that you could do that,

685
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,980
but you can mathematically show that it's true.

686
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,980
So in some sense that's nice, it's cute, right?

687
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:08,140
It's a mathematical fact, but have we really learned anything useful by doing this?

688
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:12,540
The Fourier transform is a way of saying I can start with whatever field profile I want,

689
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:19,060
I can turn it into an infinite sum over waves of different definite wavelengths.

690
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:26,500
Well, yes, it turns out to be super duper important for the following reasons.

691
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:33,100
If I think about the energy of a field, okay, the very first thing we're going to think

692
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:38,580
about when we quantize our fields is think about what energy the field has, and we're

693
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,900
going to look at solutions of definite energy, right?

694
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,860
So what is the essence of the energy of a field?

695
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:48,660
A particle has two kinds of energy.

696
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:53,340
It has kinetic energy, so a particle has an energy that depends on its velocity squared,

697
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:58,140
one half mv squared in terms of the mass and the velocity of the particle, and it might

698
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,900
also have a potential energy.

699
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:04,500
So if the particle is moving in an electric field or something like that, the value of

700
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,860
the electric field in charge of the particle will contribute to the potential energy of

701
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:09,860
the field.

702
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,340
Sorry, the potential energy of the particle will get a contribution from the electric

703
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,840
field.

704
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,700
The field itself has three kinds of energy.

705
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:24,320
It has a kinetic energy, just like a particle does, but it means something different.

706
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:29,380
We call it a kinetic energy, but it's not the field is moving, it's that at each point

707
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,420
the field is changing its value, okay?

708
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,820
The field has a value at each point.

709
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:38,740
If that field is just constant, then the kinetic constant with time, then the kinetic

710
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,380
energy of the field is zero at that point, but if it's sort of vibrating up and down,

711
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,660
for example, then it has a non-zero kinetic energy.

712
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:50,900
A field can also have a potential energy, but it means a slightly different thing, because

713
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:56,620
for the particle, the potential energy means how it's sort of moving through space and

714
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:01,580
feeling different values of the electric field or the gravitational field or whatever.

715
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:05,380
For a field, what we call the potential energy, I know it's very annoying.

716
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:09,620
We use exactly the same words to mean different things, but mathematically they look the same.

717
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:12,180
That's why it's useful to look at the equations.

718
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:17,580
For the field, we think about the field interacting with itself.

719
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:21,820
So an electron gets a potential energy from interacting with the gravitational field or

720
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,340
the electric field or the magnetic field.

721
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,740
The fields get potential energy from interacting with themselves, and different fields will

722
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:33,260
interact with themselves in different ways, but all that matters for that is the value

723
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,260
of the field.

724
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:39,620
The kinetic energy depends on the derivative, the time rate of change of the field, whereas

725
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,060
the potential energy only matters, only depends on the value of the field.

726
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:47,060
It does not matter how fast things are changing.

727
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,140
And you might guess what the third kind of energy is.

728
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:53,180
First kind was kinetic, second time was potential.

729
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:57,220
There's something that is new for fields that doesn't exist for particles, which is the

730
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,740
gradient energy.

731
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:05,060
The idea is that not only can the value at each point in space of the field change with

732
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:11,700
time, but as you go to a nearby point in space, there can be differences in the values of

733
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,700
the fields.

734
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,460
The fields can be stretched a little bit or distorted a little bit from point to point.

735
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:21,900
If the field was exactly constant through space, then there wouldn't be any stretching

736
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:27,060
or distortion energy, what we call the gradient energy, but usually the field is changing from

737
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,780
place to place that will contribute to the energy of the field.

738
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:35,420
Indeed, those of you who have read volume one, space, time and motion, know about relativity

739
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:40,140
and you know that the difference between space and time will change depending on your point

740
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:45,940
of view and therefore you will not be surprised to learn that for fields, which I didn't say

741
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:52,820
this explicitly yet, but these fields are deeply embedded in the context of relativity.

742
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:57,220
There's a relationship between the kinetic energy, the rate of change with respect to

743
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:01,860
time, and the gradient energy, the rate of change with respect to space, because space

744
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,140
and time are related to each other.

745
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:11,580
We have three kinds of energy, kinetic energy, gradient energy, potential energy.

746
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:16,740
To solve the equations for what the field does, you need to know all of these.

747
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,660
You need to know what the field is doing at every point in space because what it's doing

748
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:26,220
at a nearby point in space will affect what the field does at one point in space.

749
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:31,940
So at just a simple, very basic, dirty technical level, it's kind of annoying to have these

750
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,940
different kinds of energy floating around.

751
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:39,700
Now remember the question we're trying to answer here, why do we bother thinking about

752
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,860
Fourier transforms?

753
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:47,060
Why do we bother thinking about the profile of the field as a sum of plane wave modes

754
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:51,180
rather than as just values at each individual point in space?

755
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,140
Well think about those energies.

756
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:57,660
Think about the kinetic energy, the potential energy, the gradient energy.

757
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:03,300
If you write the field as modes, if you take the Fourier transform, it still has a kinetic

758
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,300
energy.

759
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,300
It's the same kind of thing.

760
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:10,700
It still has a potential energy, the same kind of thing, but the gradient energy is

761
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:16,980
a different kind of thing now because by telling you that we're focusing in on one

762
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:23,820
particular mode, one particular wave with fixed wavelength stretching throughout all

763
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:29,620
of space, I've told you how the wave changes from place to place because it has a fixed

764
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,220
wavelength, right?

765
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,860
I've given you that information.

766
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,660
I don't need to separately give you that information at every point.

767
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:44,260
If I'm just looking at one mode of the field, then I have the gradient energy sussed.

768
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,500
I know what it is.

769
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,740
I don't need to give you that extra information over and over again, okay?

770
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:56,540
So it turns out that when we're solving the equations for the behavior of a field, it's

771
00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:02,460
much easier to write down the solutions if we look at a mode of the field or if we look

772
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:09,460
at modes of the field one at a time rather than looking at positions in space and values

773
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:13,340
of the fields at positions in space, okay?

774
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:16,500
So that may or may not have been a convincing explanation.

775
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,580
In this audio podcast, I cannot show you the equations, but the equations make it super

776
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,580
duper clear.

777
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,580
I promise you.

778
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,860
And it is possible to follow them.

779
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,940
Do not get intimidated by the equations.

780
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,340
It's just an alien language.

781
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:31,260
You can learn it, and once you learn it, you have a good warm feeling of accomplishment,

782
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,220
so it's worth doing.

783
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:41,820
So the lesson, the upshot of all this digression is take a particular kind of field configuration,

784
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,260
even with a absolutely fixed wavelength.

785
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:51,980
I happen to know that I can write any field configuration as a sum of many such things,

786
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:55,500
but let's keep that in the back of your mind and focus on one of them.

787
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,780
Pick a mode, pick a wave that has a wavelength, a definite, very, very specific frequency

788
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:04,260
it's vibrating at, ask what it is doing.

789
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:11,380
So in other words, when I quantize this, instead of assigning a complex number, complex

790
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:17,500
valued wave function to every field configuration, let me focus in on this one mode of the field

791
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:23,180
and assign a complex number to every possible value of the mode.

792
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,620
What does it mean value of the mode?

793
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:28,020
The wavelength is fixed, but the amplitude is not.

794
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:32,660
So it might be a wave of a certain wavelength that is very gently vibrating, just very slightly

795
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,420
up and down, or it could be vibrating by a lot.

796
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:41,740
Those are different ways that this mode could be vibrating, and to each different amplitude,

797
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:46,300
to each different height of the wave that it goes up and down, I will assign a complex

798
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,380
number.

799
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:52,460
That is the wave function of this particular mode.

800
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:58,300
And you can kind of see how this would be easier to make sense of.

801
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,100
Modes that are vibrating by a lot, right?

802
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,140
Modes that are, again, the wavelength is fixed.

803
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:08,220
So through space, we imagine, you know, from point A to point B, it goes up and down with

804
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:13,380
a certain wavelength, but the amount by which it goes up and down in between where it's

805
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:19,300
zero, one wavelength away, the amount by which it goes up and down is arbitrary.

806
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:23,460
And there's more energy when it goes up by a lot than when it goes up by just a little

807
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,100
bit.

808
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,140
And here's where the miracle occurs, okay?

809
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,820
You might have thought this was a little bit dry and technical, and why are we bothering

810
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:30,820
with this?

811
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:35,380
But a miracle is about to occur, I promise you.

812
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:42,820
We're thinking of the wave function of a single mode of a vibrating quantum field.

813
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:49,180
And the mode itself, that we're assigning a wave function to, is now that we've told

814
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:55,140
you its wavelength is just characterized by a single number, the height, call it H, okay?

815
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,420
The height of the wave that is vibrating up and down.

816
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:04,340
So instead of psi of X for a particle being a wave function, we're going to have psi of

817
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:09,660
H, the wave function of the height of the vibrating mode.

818
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:15,460
And the exact thing that happened to the electron in the hydrogen atom, where we said the wave

819
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:18,740
function's going to have to taper off at zero, and you're going to get a set of discrete

820
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:23,380
solutions on the inside that look like orbitals and explain the different energy levels of

821
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:29,940
atoms, that exact same thing is going to happen to our mode of the quantum field.

822
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:36,420
At very, very large height functions, very, very large amplitudes of the wave, shaking

823
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:41,340
up and down, the wave function is going to have to go to zero, because it can only be

824
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,060
sort of localized in some particular set of values.

825
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:51,980
And therefore, when we solve the equation, we will get a discrete set of solutions.

826
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:59,620
A discrete set of possible wave functions for this one mode of this one field.

827
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:05,460
There will be a lowest energy wave function, and there will be a simple separate next highest

828
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:09,620
energy wave function, and there will be one higher than that, and there'll be a discrete

829
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:18,860
tower of wave functions for this one particular wave with one particular wavelength.

830
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:19,860
Why do you care about that?

831
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,860
Okay.

832
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:26,700
Maybe you're with me this far, and you say, okay, I've taken my wave, I've decided to

833
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:32,860
think about my wave as a sum of modes of fixed wavelength, I've focused in on one particular

834
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:37,700
mode, I have assigned a wave function to it, and I've found that the wave function of that

835
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,220
mode has a discrete set of solutions.

836
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,900
Well, we're going to poke around, and this is something that's going to be hard to,

837
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,980
I can't explain it really over words, but you can check out the book.

838
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:52,180
But I'm going to tell you some facts, and you can choose to believe me or not.

839
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:55,900
So look at that lowest energy wave function.

840
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,900
It's lowest energy.

841
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,140
We're going to say it's the vacuum, as we call it, okay?

842
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,740
There's sort of nothing there.

843
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:06,220
And then there's the next highest energy wave function.

844
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,320
It has an energy.

845
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:13,300
Let's call it M, the letter M, and it turns out that it's not unique.

846
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,260
The vacuum, the lowest energy mode, the lowest energy wave function is unique.

847
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,140
There's only one such thing.

848
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:24,340
But there's an infinite collection of next highest energy modes, which basically correspond

849
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:29,660
to looking at the same kind of behavior, but in different reference frames, with different

850
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,500
velocities, if you like.

851
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:36,580
And you can calculate the energy of all of these different modes, basically the same,

852
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:41,300
sorry, of all of these different wave functions, basically the same kind of wave function just

853
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,340
looked at from different reference frames.

854
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:49,380
And they get more and more energy, the more velocity you have with respect to the rest

855
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,860
frame, okay?

856
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:57,220
And then you look at the next highest energy wave functions, and if the first one had the

857
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:03,980
lowest energy of 2M, so you have a vacuum state with energy 0, a next highest one with

858
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:09,540
energy M, or higher, depending on if you have velocity with respect to it, and the one after

859
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:14,220
that has an energy 2 times M.

860
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:15,100
So what's going on?

861
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:20,820
It's going to be one with 3 times M, 4 times M, etc., absolutely uniform growth of energies

862
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,140
of these different particular wave functions.

863
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:26,620
Well, I'm not going to keep you in suspense much longer.

864
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:33,700
The vacuum state is what we interpret as a quantum state with no particles.

865
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,460
It's empty space.

866
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:43,420
That first excited state, as we call it, with energy M, I should say, yeah, I'm sorry,

867
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:46,300
this is back in my mind, and it certainly will be in your mind if you're reading the

868
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,620
book, but I didn't say it out loud.

869
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:54,620
We always, in particle physics, use units where the speed of light is set equal to 1.

870
01:00:54,620 --> 01:01:00,820
So C, the speed of light equals 1 to me, and so when I say it has energy M, what I really

871
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:04,620
mean is it has energy MC squared.

872
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:05,620
What is that?

873
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,940
Where have we ever heard that before?

874
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:09,140
The energy of something is MC squared.

875
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:16,980
Yeah, that is the energy of a single particle with mass M in its rest frame.

876
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:20,500
If you move to another rest frame, the energy will go up, because it will also have a little

877
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:24,860
bit of kinetic energy, as well as the rest energy.

878
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:28,700
What about this wave function that has an energy of 2 times M?

879
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,900
Well, that's really 2 times MC squared.

880
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,580
What is that the energy of?

881
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:40,580
It's the energy of 2 particles with mass M, and then you have a set of other related

882
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:44,500
wave functions where the particles are moving with respect to each other, and then you have

883
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:51,820
a vibrational wave function with energy 3 times MC squared, etc.

884
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:57,140
And they are all related to each other by exactly the ways that you would expect a set

885
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:03,540
of particles and their energies to be related to each other.

886
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:04,740
That was a lot.

887
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:09,860
In the book, I go through this super explicitly, and I know that the actual manipulations are

888
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:16,140
kind of boring and tedious, but the result is so important.

889
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:20,460
It's one of the most important things, literally, in all of human knowledge, this particular

890
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:27,220
result, because the result that we got here through talking about Fourier transforms and

891
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:32,820
thinking about quantum fields in terms of modes, with different wavelengths, and then

892
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:36,660
the different ways that you could get a wave function for that mode.

893
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:43,180
The result we got here is saying that when you take a field, which by itself is continuous

894
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:49,180
and smooth and nothing discreet about it, and you assign a wave function to the field,

895
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:54,900
which is also by itself continuous and smooth and nothing discreet about it, the solutions

896
01:02:54,900 --> 01:03:02,220
to the equations, the different kinds of behavior that that wave function of the field can exhibit

897
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:05,060
come in a discreet set.

898
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:11,740
They look like particles, and you can go much further than this in explicating the fact that

899
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:14,660
they behave like particles.

900
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:19,420
These are what particles are according to quantum field theory.

901
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:23,140
According to quantum field theory, the world is not made of particles.

902
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:25,420
The world is not made of discrete lumps of energy.

903
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:28,940
The world is made of fields that have wave functions.

904
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:33,060
If you want to, you can just say the world is made of the wave function of the fields.

905
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:36,860
That's a that's a foundations of physics question that we're not going to get into right now.

906
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:41,300
But the point is, there's nothing discreet or lumpy about what the world is made of.

907
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:47,300
The discreteness comes in how the world behaves, and it comes because we have quantized our

908
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,220
fields.

909
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:54,180
This is a slightly more mathematically careful and sophisticated way of saying something you

910
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:57,620
may have heard me say before in other contexts.

911
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,980
Particles are vibrations in quantum fields.

912
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,660
That's what particles are.

913
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:08,020
When you apply the rules of quantum mechanics to fields, you get a set of solutions that

914
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:14,100
look like particles in exactly the same way that when you solve the Schrodinger equation

915
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:20,060
for an electron in an atom, you get a set of discrete orbitals with discrete energies.

916
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:24,860
Or for that matter, when you pluck a guitar string, you get a set of discrete frequencies

917
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,900
at which it vibrates.

918
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,260
All the discreteness is emergent.

919
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:33,620
That's where particles come from out of quantum field theory.

920
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,420
And you get literally everything that you expect from particles.

921
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:41,460
Many different particles will have different energies going in exactly the same way, etc.

922
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,820
Good.

923
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,620
So I hope that was convincing.

924
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:47,940
I hope that you see a little bit now.

925
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:51,620
When you start with fields, they can look like particles.

926
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:54,780
This means two things.

927
01:04:54,780 --> 01:05:00,580
It means that putting yourself in the mindset of a physicist in the 1920s when quantum mechanics

928
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:02,460
was being invented.

929
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:08,220
One is I can take the electromagnetic field, which I know and love since the time of Maxwell

930
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:11,620
in the 1800s, and I can quantize it.

931
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,020
I can do all this.

932
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:17,340
I can treat it in terms of modes, and I can assign wave functions, and I can get lumps

933
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:23,740
of energy, which I interpret as particles, which we will call photons.

934
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,900
That's what photons are.

935
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:30,780
The other thing is that these other things we had lying around, the electrons, the protons,

936
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:38,100
etc., the things we thought of as particles, we can now say, well, maybe those are vibrations

937
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,140
in quantum fields.

938
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:45,940
So secretly, without even trying very hard, we have stumbled on an enormously powerful

939
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:50,500
unification of different kinds of physics.

940
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:58,620
In the late 1800s, we might have thought that the universe is made of fields and particles,

941
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:03,020
particles being the matter in the universe and fields being the forces.

942
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:07,700
But now we're getting a glimpse of the idea, thanks to quantum mechanics, that it's actually

943
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,540
all just fields.

944
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:16,780
And the fields show up, both as big classical fields under the right circumstances and also

945
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:21,620
as discrete individual particles under other circumstances.

946
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:27,980
And so one challenge that we're faced with right away is why do electrons and photons

947
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:31,740
seem to behave so differently from each other?

948
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:35,660
And the answer basically comes down to symmetry.

949
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:41,300
The idea of symmetry, as I say in the book, it's very helpful in classical physics, super

950
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:49,100
helpful in particle-based quantum mechanics, but it becomes absolutely central in quantum

951
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,100
field theory.

952
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:54,540
So much so, there's a whole chapter in the book devoted to symmetry where I teach you

953
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:55,940
group theory.

954
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:59,660
You will learn what SU2 and SU3 and all those things are.

955
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:03,540
This is one of the chapters that I actually wrote a lot more than appears in the book.

956
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:08,740
I wrote a lot, and then I'm trying to, even though we're doing the equations, I don't

957
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:10,700
want it to be overwhelming.

958
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,700
So I pared it down.

959
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:15,060
There was a lot that I had put in the original version of the chapter that was a little bit

960
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:18,660
more than you need to just do quantum field theory.

961
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:24,940
But the specific symmetries we're talking about right now are spacetime symmetries.

962
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:28,660
So there's two different kinds of symmetries you can get in quantum field theory.

963
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:32,980
There are symmetries of spacetime itself.

964
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,500
There is translation invariance.

965
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,860
It doesn't matter where you do the experiment.

966
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,260
There's time translation invariance.

967
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,460
It doesn't matter when you do the experiment.

968
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:43,460
Rotational invariance.

969
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:44,460
Boost invariance.

970
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,020
It doesn't matter how fast you're moving in space.

971
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:52,100
But then there's also what we call internal symmetries, where you don't change where

972
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,980
you are or how you're oriented in spacetime.

973
01:07:54,980 --> 01:08:00,220
You just rotate fields into each other, and both of those are going to be very important.

974
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:06,100
So for the question at hand right now, the difference between photons and electrons,

975
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:12,580
one of the differences, comes down to how these fields change when you do a rotation

976
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,580
in space.

977
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:16,580
We're dealing here with relativistic quantum field theory.

978
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:19,380
That's sort of implicit when we say quantum field theory.

979
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:24,460
But it's not necessarily that you need to be relativistic, that you need to be thinking

980
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:27,740
about relativity when you do field theory.

981
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:33,220
Relativity in this case, in this sense, means that everything is relative, including the

982
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:37,140
velocity of two different objects with respect to each other.

983
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:40,580
There's no such thing as the velocity of an object.

984
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:44,100
There's just the relative velocity of two different kinds of objects.

985
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:50,380
Now you can have circumstances where it's appropriate to do non-relativistic field theory.

986
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:53,700
So if you're a condensed matter physicist, so you're not a particle physicist thinking

987
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:58,300
about smashing two particles together in otherwise empty space, but you have a chunk

988
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:04,420
of material here, and maybe there's some vibrational modes of the material, right?

989
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:09,700
We were talking about modes before, ways that a field can vibrate with a definite wavelength.

990
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:15,420
Well when you have a crystal or a metal or something like that, there are ways that the

991
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:20,580
material can vibrate, and you can separate that into modes, and you can quantize them.

992
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:26,100
And you're basically dealing with a non-relativistic quantum field theory, because there is a rest

993
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:30,660
frame that is well defined in that case, the rest frame of the material that you're looking

994
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:31,660
at.

995
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:32,980
But anyway, we're not doing that.

996
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:36,180
We are doing relativistic quantum field theory.

997
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:39,740
But for this question, we really care about rotations in space.

998
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:45,180
How do fields change as you rotate in space?

999
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:50,140
And really we're dealing with the wave function of a field, as we said, and that makes things

1000
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:54,580
a wee bit more complicated, but I'm going to, again, try to distill it down to the basic

1001
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:56,380
essences.

1002
01:09:56,380 --> 01:10:00,420
Imagine you have some wave function for some field.

1003
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:06,140
In fact, imagine that the state of the field is such that it looks like there's one particle

1004
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,140
there.

1005
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:14,020
Remember, we said that there are quantum states of the field, and an arbitrary quantum state

1006
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:19,300
of a field is basically a superposition of different kinds of particles, different numbers

1007
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,580
of particles.

1008
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:25,820
There is a particular wave function in the field that could have representing zero particles,

1009
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:28,740
and different other ones representing one or two or more.

1010
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:32,140
In general, you could be a superposition of all sorts of different kinds.

1011
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:35,380
That's quantum mechanics for you, right?

1012
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:42,860
That is what let's quantum field theory describe changes between the number of particles, because

1013
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:48,780
a single wave function for a single field implicitly includes zero particle states,

1014
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:53,220
one particle states, two particle states, and so on upward.

1015
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:57,780
Let's zoom in on a wave function representing a single particle.

1016
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,460
I want to emphasize this.

1017
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:05,200
Even though what is really going on is a quantum field, there are certain circumstances in

1018
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,460
which it's perfectly sensible to think of a single particle.

1019
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:12,820
That is a kind of excitation of a single quantum field.

1020
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:13,820
It's not incompatible.

1021
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:18,060
We're not cheating when we say let's think of one particle within the context of quantum

1022
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,180
field theory.

1023
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:23,220
You can talk about what an electron is doing in the context of quantum field theory.

1024
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:24,220
Let's do that.

1025
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:28,780
Let's talk about a single electron, and let's ask what happens when you rotate your frame

1026
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:33,420
of reference for that wave function of a single electron.

1027
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:36,820
In fact, let's not rotate by like 90 degrees.

1028
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:43,700
Let's rotate all the way around 360 degrees, two pi radians we scientists would say.

1029
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:50,180
Well, your naive expectation is that if you just do a whole rotation by 360 degrees, the

1030
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,620
wave function is going to come back to where it started, right?

1031
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:56,380
That's a reflection of the symmetry of rotations.

1032
01:11:56,380 --> 01:12:01,580
But if you think about it a little bit more carefully, there's another possibility.

1033
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:09,220
What if the wave function gets multiplied by minus one when you rotate by 360 degrees?

1034
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:14,260
That's interesting because it leaves all of the predictions unchanged because the predictions

1035
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:20,060
in quantum mechanics, quantum field theory included, come from squaring the wave function.

1036
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,820
Now there's a philosophical question that arises here.

1037
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:26,500
Is it true that all we care about are the observational outcomes or should we care about

1038
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,500
other things?

1039
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,500
Good.

1040
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,060
Go ahead and contemplate those things.

1041
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:35,300
But for these books, for this book series, we're not dwelling on those philosophical

1042
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:36,300
questions.

1043
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,300
We're thinking like hard-nosed physicists.

1044
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:41,220
And the physicists will just say, look, I care about the observations.

1045
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:47,100
It's just as good if a wave function picks up a minus sign when I rotate by 360 degrees

1046
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:51,380
as it is if it remains completely unchanged.

1047
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:54,980
And this, in fact, there's more subtle things you can say.

1048
01:12:54,980 --> 01:13:00,180
What happens when you do rotate by 180 degrees or by 90 degrees, et cetera?

1049
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:04,620
And long story short, you get all different possible kinds of fields.

1050
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:11,980
Every individual kind of field will give rise to a single kind of particle that has a definite

1051
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:15,380
property when it's rotated in space.

1052
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:19,940
And the properties might be that the wave function remains the same under 360 degrees

1053
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:22,460
or that it picks up a minus one.

1054
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:28,540
And that corresponds to what we call the spin of the particle.

1055
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:36,780
This fact that the transformation properties of wave functions under rotations is related

1056
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:42,660
to the spin of the particle is the quantum mechanical version of a statement that we

1057
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:45,980
know in classical physics from Neurter's theorem.

1058
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:53,620
Neurter's theorem says that conserved quantities arise from symmetries of the theory.

1059
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:57,900
And one such symmetry is rotations in classical mechanics and the conserved quantity that

1060
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:02,260
arises from that is angular momentum, of which spin is one kind.

1061
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:06,780
So the quantum version of this is that the transformation of the wave functions under

1062
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:10,060
rotations tells us the spin of the particle.

1063
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:16,780
And basically, again, very long stories being made very short here, the kinds of particles

1064
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:22,580
that arise from fields in such a way that their wave function is unchanged under a rotation

1065
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:30,100
by 360 degrees have spins that are an integer value, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.

1066
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:34,940
Secretly, just like we said the speed of light equal to 1 before, now we're setting Planck's

1067
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:38,060
constant equal to 1.

1068
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:44,100
Planck's constant h bar is the fundamental unit of quantum mechanics and it turns out

1069
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,700
to have the same units as angular momentum.

1070
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:51,260
So the spin of a particle is actually measured in units of h bar.

1071
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:57,300
So we set h bar equal to 1, so rather than saying spin 0, spin h bar, spin 2 h bar, we

1072
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,940
just say spin 0, spin 1, spin 2.

1073
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:03,820
Those are all different kinds of particles that come back, their wave function comes

1074
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:07,420
back to the same value when you do a 360 degree rotation.

1075
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:13,060
If it picks up a minus 1, then it turns out that the spin is a half integer value.

1076
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:18,500
So it's spin 1 half, spin 3 halves, spin 5 halves, etc.

1077
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:24,660
There's a long mathematically intricate conversation to have about representations of the symmetry

1078
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:27,420
groups of spacetime on quantum fields.

1079
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:34,100
And the mathematical object that tells us, that lets us describe these spin 1 half, 3

1080
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:44,460
half particles are called spinners, S-P-I-N-O-R-S, it's a coinage that comes from tensors which

1081
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,460
are other kinds of objects.

1082
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:50,900
So spinners are these spin 1 half, spin 3 half fields.

1083
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:53,500
So keep that in mind, okay?

1084
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:57,660
There are kinds of particles like electrons, like neutrinos, like quarks, lots of different

1085
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:04,740
particles that have a wave function that picks up a minus sign when we rotate by 360 degrees.

1086
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:09,980
Now think about something that is highly analogous to that but different.

1087
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:16,100
Instead of thinking of one particle and what happens when we rotate it by 360 degrees, think

1088
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:21,380
about two particles, in fact think about two identical particles.

1089
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:26,580
As a footnote here, I will mention, you might have heard of this story that John Wheeler

1090
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:31,860
and Richard Feynman were talking about, why do all electrons have the same mass and the

1091
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:33,020
same charge?

1092
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:35,340
Maybe because they're all the same electron.

1093
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:39,420
Because an electron going backward in time is kind of like a positron and maybe there's

1094
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:43,540
only one electron that just bounces forever and ever backward and forward in time.

1095
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:49,820
That is false, it did not work, it was a nice idea and it led Feynman to think about Feynman

1096
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:53,620
diagrams and things like that but it's just a pretty story.

1097
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:58,940
The actual reason why all electrons have the same mass and charge is because they are all

1098
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:03,500
vibrations in the same underlying electron field.

1099
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:08,740
So what that means is that two electrons are absolutely identical to each other and this

1100
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:13,940
is a technical term in quantum field theory, they are identical particles.

1101
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:19,460
So if I have a state of two electrons and there is a position of one particle of one

1102
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:25,780
electron x1 and the position of the other electron x2, not again, they don't have definite

1103
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:29,060
positions, they have positions we could observe them to be at.

1104
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:33,740
But there's no difference between x1 and x2, there's a symmetry there, there's no way

1105
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:39,780
you can say oh it's this electron who I named Alice who was at position x1 and electron

1106
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,140
Bob is at x2.

1107
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:45,860
All you know is that there's one electron at one position and one electron at the other.

1108
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:51,780
So we can ask what happens when we take two identical particles, that is to say the wave

1109
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:57,740
function corresponding to a quantum state representing two identical particles and we

1110
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,780
interchange them.

1111
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:04,540
So we're not rotating, we're not changing our physical coordinate system or anything

1112
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:08,460
like that, we're physically taking these two particles and exchanging one for the other

1113
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:11,480
by moving them through space.

1114
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,500
But again, they're identical particles, so you might think well if I exchange one for

1115
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:19,620
the other the wave function doesn't change, but by exactly the same argument the wave

1116
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:24,820
function could also pick up a minus sign overall and guess what, both possibilities

1117
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:27,740
are realized in the real world.

1118
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:32,540
There are particles who when they get interchanged, identical particles, when they get interchanged

1119
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:38,140
their wave function is unchanged and we call those bosons and there are other particles

1120
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:44,440
whose wave functions when we interchange them pick up a minus sign and we call those fermions.

1121
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:48,920
And the physical behavior of these kinds of particles is very different.

1122
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:52,100
Think about fermions because that's the really interesting case here.

1123
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:57,300
A fermion set of fermion particles have the property that when you take these two particles

1124
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:03,300
and you interchange them, then the overall wave function picks up a minus sign.

1125
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:09,460
So what happens if you try to take two fermions and put them in the same exact quantum state?

1126
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:14,420
You could imagine trying to do that, two electrons with exactly the same wave function just overlapping

1127
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:20,780
each other, but then interchanging them doesn't do anything.

1128
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:24,460
They're literally already in the same state, you didn't do anything to it when you interchange

1129
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:29,900
them, but we have a rule that says the wave function has to pick up a minus sign.

1130
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:33,620
How is it possible for a wave function to pick up a minus sign when you didn't change

1131
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:34,940
the wave function at all?

1132
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:36,580
And the answer is it's not.

1133
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:39,420
That wave function would have to be strictly zero.

1134
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:43,900
So these fermions, these particles that pick up a minus sign under interchange of identical

1135
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:50,300
particles have a property that they cannot be in the same quantum state.

1136
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:55,340
For any quantum state, there can only be one fermion in it at a time.

1137
01:19:55,340 --> 01:20:00,820
Or more informally, fermions take up space.

1138
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:01,820
Bosons are the opposite.

1139
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:05,900
Bosons, if you have two identical particles in the same quantum state, that's great because

1140
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,820
when you interchange them, nothing happens, and indeed, if they're already in the same

1141
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,900
quantum state, nothing would happen.

1142
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:14,700
So physically, this corresponds to very different behavior.

1143
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:19,900
The fact that fermions cannot be in the same quantum state is the Pauli exclusion principle,

1144
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:24,660
which Pauli actually meant before we really understood fermions and bosons.

1145
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:27,500
But it's why atoms are interesting.

1146
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:35,100
It's why matter has the shapes and configurations that it does because you can't put electrons

1147
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:39,620
over and over in the same quantum state orbiting an atom.

1148
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:40,620
Electrons have spins.

1149
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,020
They can be spin up and spin down.

1150
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:48,100
So in any one spatially definite wave function, you can put two different electrons in there

1151
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:50,900
because their spins can be absolutely aligned.

1152
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,660
But then that's all you can do.

1153
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:56,100
Then you got to go into more complicated looking spatial wave functions, and that is the origin

1154
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:57,740
of all of chemistry.

1155
01:20:57,740 --> 01:21:03,620
So the Pauli exclusion principle, which can be derived in quantum field theory from the

1156
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:10,180
properties of identical particles that get a minus sign under their interchange, is really,

1157
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,620
really super-duper important.

1158
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:16,380
Whereas for bosons, they like to pile up on top of each other.

1159
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:18,180
They actually prefer it.

1160
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:24,820
So bosons, like photons, for example, very naturally pile on top of each other, and that's

1161
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:28,740
what gives rise to classical-looking force fields.

1162
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:33,660
That's why the electric field, the magnetic field, the gravitational field, these are

1163
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:40,940
all fields that we absolutely come into contact with in the ordinary classical macroscopic

1164
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:41,940
world.

1165
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:42,940
Why?

1166
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:48,580
Because they are boson excitations that have piled on top of each other by a huge amount

1167
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:50,060
until they look classical.

1168
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:51,740
That's perfectly allowed.

1169
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,660
Whereas fermions take up space, that's why matter is solid.

1170
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:59,300
That's why the table in front of me right now doesn't collapse because the electrons

1171
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:03,620
have definite shapes, the wave functions of the electrons.

1172
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:08,460
I won't go into it right now, but one thing I've rant about at a brief period in the

1173
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:12,340
book is this idea that atoms are mostly empty space.

1174
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,780
No, they're not.

1175
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:17,580
Atoms are mostly wave function, and those wave functions take up space, and that fact

1176
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:19,260
is not merely philosophical.

1177
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,620
It's crucially important.

1178
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:22,580
It's why matter is solid.

1179
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:25,820
Don't listen to people who tell you that atoms are mostly empty space.

1180
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:30,300
Anyway, you might have noticed, if you hang around in the wrong street corners and know

1181
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:36,020
a little bit about particle physics and quantum field theory, that I defined the fermion-boson

1182
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:41,380
distinction as what happens under the interchange of two particles.

1183
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:48,740
I defined the spin distinction, the distinction between particles of spin 0, 1, 2, etc., versus

1184
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:55,380
particles with spin 1, 1, 3, halves, etc., as what happens under the rotation of a single

1185
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,180
particle.

1186
01:22:57,180 --> 01:23:01,740
You might be confused because you might be remembering that people told you that bosons

1187
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:07,580
are particles of spin 0, 1, 2, fermions are particles of spin 1, 1, 3, halves, 5, halves,

1188
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:08,580
etc.

1189
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:11,020
Why did that connection not get made?

1190
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:15,220
The answer is that connection exists, but it's not a definition.

1191
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:17,540
It's a theorem that you can prove.

1192
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:25,500
You can relate using techniques from relativistic quantum field theory, the transformation properties

1193
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:32,740
of a single particle wave function under rotation to the transformation properties of a two-particle

1194
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:38,860
wave function under interchange, and those minus signs that we talked about in both cases

1195
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:41,140
cancel each other out.

1196
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:47,460
So there's a theorem, the spin statistics theorem, that says that the particles that

1197
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:53,620
pick up a minus sign under a 360-degree rotation are exactly identical, are the same as the

1198
01:23:53,660 --> 01:24:00,220
particles who pick up a minus sign under the interchange of two particles in the wave function.

1199
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:05,740
So therefore you can prove that fermions, which are defined as particles that can't

1200
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:11,420
be in the same quantum state, particles that take up space, must have half integer spins,

1201
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:18,540
1, 1, 1, 3, halves, etc., electrons are fermions, neutrinos, quarks, etc., bosons, the particles

1202
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:24,300
whose wave function are unchanged under a rotation are exactly, nope, sorry, I said

1203
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:29,700
that exactly wrong, didn't I, bosons, the particles whose wave function are unchanged

1204
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:35,780
under the interchange of two identical particles coincide exactly with those particles who

1205
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:39,940
pick up whose wave functions are unchanged when you do a 360-degree rotation.

1206
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:41,580
That's the spin statistics theorem.

1207
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:43,460
We didn't just prove it right there.

1208
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:48,520
In fact, there's like controversy in the literature about who really has proven the spin statistics

1209
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:54,540
theorem, because there's a lot of hand-wavy arguments that kind of sound like a proof,

1210
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:58,340
but really don't rely on relativistic quantum field theory, and therefore they can't be

1211
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:03,440
right because the theorem itself actually does rely on relativistic quantum field theory.

1212
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:08,220
But what we're trying to do here is give you a feeling for why there is this relationship

1213
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:10,340
between spin and statistics.

1214
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:16,820
The statistics being the question about whether or not the field particle excitations act

1215
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,920
like fermions or bosons.

1216
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:19,920
Okay.

1217
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:26,800
So, that's an example of how you start from this single unified idea.

1218
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,800
Everything is fields subject to the rules of quantum mechanics, and you ask yourself,

1219
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,160
okay, so what kinds of fields could there be?

1220
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:38,680
And the answer are, you know, fields whose wave functions change in different ways under

1221
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:42,320
rotations, and you invent bosons and fermions.

1222
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:47,660
Naturally comes out of the combination of relativity with quantum field theory, which

1223
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:49,820
is really quite fun.

1224
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:56,620
Now of course, the real fun comes when you let these particles, or these fields, interact

1225
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,380
with each other, okay?

1226
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:03,340
And that's where you get into Feynman diagrams, and renormalization, and infinity, and effective

1227
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:05,380
field theory, and the whole bit.

1228
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:10,060
If you want to know what a virtual particle really is, read the book.

1229
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:14,120
It's a way of talking about the behavior of quantum fields.

1230
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:18,960
Virtual particles are not real particles, but they are useful ways of talking about the

1231
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,840
behavior of quantum fields when other particles scatter off of each other.

1232
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:30,240
Now, I will confess, when I was thinking about this solo podcast to advertise the book,

1233
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:34,640
I was overwhelmed with the number of things I could possibly talk about.

1234
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:39,160
And really, the thing that I think is the most important thing that I talk about in

1235
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:42,340
the book is the idea of effective field theory.

1236
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:47,780
An effective field theory comes from thinking about the fact that when you scatter particles

1237
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:53,300
off of each other, and you use Feynman diagrams to calculate the likelihood of that scattering

1238
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,980
event happening, very frequently the answer is infinity, right?

1239
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:59,740
The famous infinities of quantum field theory.

1240
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:04,180
And Feynman and Schwinger and Tomonaga and others figured out ways to subtract off the

1241
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:07,860
infinities and get finite answers, and it all works very, very well.

1242
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,080
But it was never very satisfying.

1243
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:15,000
So effective field theory is an idea that came along in the 60s and 70s, and is the

1244
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,640
way that modern physicists think, and you were never told this, and this is very frustrating

1245
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:25,280
to me that the popular discussions of quantum field theory never mentioned this central

1246
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:30,360
organizing principle of the field, the effective field theory paradigm.

1247
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:36,640
And basically Ken Wilson said, look, the reason why you get infinities when you scatter these

1248
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:41,820
particles off of each other is because you're summing up contributions from virtual particles

1249
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:44,820
with arbitrarily high energies.

1250
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:48,460
And in quantum field theory, high energy means short wavelength, okay?

1251
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:49,460
There's a relationship.

1252
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,460
Short of the wavelength, the higher the energy.

1253
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:54,020
Same thing is true in ordinary light, right?

1254
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:58,500
A photon with a short wavelength corresponds to a higher energy particle.

1255
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:02,940
And Wilson says, you don't know what's going on at these short distances and high energies.

1256
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:04,820
So you should just be honest.

1257
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:06,840
You should admit you don't know it.

1258
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:13,000
And he figured out a mathematical procedure for putting on a cutoff on your theory and

1259
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,680
saying, here is the energy below which I think I understand physics and above which I don't

1260
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,240
understand physics.

1261
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:26,640
So I can use my quantum field theory knowledge to write down a theory that only is supposed

1262
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:32,440
to apply in those regimes with energies below the cutoff.

1263
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,860
That is to say, only in the regime I understand.

1264
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:42,360
I'm ignoring things that go on at higher energies that I don't understand except for the effects

1265
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:47,820
that they have on lower energy, longer wavelength particles and fields.

1266
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,620
That's the effective field theory paradigm.

1267
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:50,620
It works super well.

1268
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:53,540
It's the most important thing, but I will confess.

1269
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:56,140
So I did a, you know, I want to give the people what they want.

1270
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:57,140
You know me.

1271
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:58,380
I'm here to serve.

1272
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:04,960
And so I went on to Patreon where I'm the Minescape podcast has a Patreon page with

01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:15,320
And I asked, I said, like, what are the things in quantum field theory you most want to hear

1276
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:19,720
about in the solo podcast effective field theory did not get a lot of votes.

1277
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:24,080
I got to say the votes were for, you know, where do particles come from symmetries, things

1278
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,080
like that.

1279
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,340
What are you talking about?

1280
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:31,460
If you want more on the beauty and elegance and power of effective field theory, read the

1281
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:32,460
book.

1282
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:33,620
I promise you that it is there.

1283
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:38,740
A lot is hiding at short distances and high energies, but we know how to deal with it.

1284
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:45,740
So giving the people what they want, let's instead turn to the completing this picture

1285
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:47,820
of what kinds of fields are there.

1286
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:49,220
I said there are bosons and fermions.

1287
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:51,500
These are two different kinds of fields.

1288
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:55,080
They're related to the spins of the particles that you get when you look at the quantum

1289
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:56,080
wave functions.

1290
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:00,520
Okay, but we know that there's more to it than that.

1291
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:07,280
We know that photons and other force carrying particles have special properties.

1292
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:08,280
They're bosons.

1293
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:12,040
They're spin one bosons, except for the graviton, which is spin two.

1294
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,840
But they're a little bit different.

1295
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,840
There's something going on there.

1296
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,240
What is going on there?

1297
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:20,160
And the answer is once again, a question of symmetry.

1298
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:25,300
And now it's an internal symmetry question rather than a spacetime symmetry question.

1299
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:30,700
So spacetime symmetry is, like I said, rotations, translations in space, boosts, changing the

1300
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,500
velocity and so forth.

1301
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:36,700
But we can also, in quantum field theory, there's a new thing that can happen.

1302
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:43,940
We have a set of fields, and rather than rotating in space, we simply rotate the fields into

1303
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:46,540
each other at each point in space.

1304
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,540
Okay?

1305
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:52,440
So if we have two fields, phi one and phi two, the Greek letter phi is the simplest thing

1306
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:58,440
that we use for a spin zero scalar bosonic field in quantum field theory.

1307
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:02,040
We always call it phi ever since, I don't know, ever since the day.

1308
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:07,240
And so if we have two fields with exactly the same masses and the same interactions,

1309
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:10,720
phi one and phi two, we could transform them into each other.

1310
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:15,160
We could exchange phi one for phi two, or we could even think of phi one and phi two

1311
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:20,940
as defining a little two-dimensional vector space and rotating them by some arbitrary

1312
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,300
angle into each other.

1313
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:27,840
And if they're truly identical, if they're truly the same kind of field, we would have

1314
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,180
no way of knowing that we had done that rotation.

1315
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:33,780
It would be a symmetry of the theory.

1316
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:35,340
That's really what a symmetry is.

1317
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:40,940
A symmetry is just a way of saying there's something we can do that doesn't matter, that

1318
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:42,440
has no physical effects.

1319
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:47,900
When we were talking about rotations or spatial translations, we said it doesn't matter how

1320
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:50,700
you rotate your experiment.

1321
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:54,380
Time translations say it doesn't matter when you do your experiment.

1322
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:58,220
Spatial translations say it doesn't matter where you do your experiment.

1323
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:02,600
Boosts say it doesn't matter how fast you're moving when you do your experiment, right?

1324
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:08,220
So these internal symmetries are saying it doesn't matter how we rotate these fields

1325
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:10,060
into each other.

1326
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:12,600
So naturally, this is something that could happen.

1327
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,920
It turns out it does happen.

1328
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:17,320
It's going to happen a lot in quantum field theory.

1329
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:22,360
And so we need to think carefully about the mathematics of these symmetry transformations.

1330
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:26,720
And so group theory is the mathematical structure for thinking about that.

1331
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:31,120
And we talk in the whole chapter on symmetries a lot about group theory.

1332
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,840
But let's simplify it here down to the bare bones.

1333
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:39,360
Let's imagine we have three fields, let's say, three fields that are more or less identical

1334
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:41,660
to each other, okay?

1335
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:43,940
But we can rotate them into each other.

1336
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:48,020
So what is the set of possible ways to rotate three fields into each other?

1337
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:49,620
It's just like space.

1338
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:51,340
Like space is three-dimensional.

1339
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:52,740
We have x, y, and z axes.

1340
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:54,740
We can rotate those together.

1341
01:32:54,740 --> 01:33:01,340
And the set of all possible transformations in a three-dimensional space, rotating things

1342
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:06,180
and not doing anything else and not stretching them, just rotating them into each other,

1343
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:08,740
is called SO3.

1344
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:12,680
It's a special orthogonal group in three dimensions.

1345
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:18,520
If you had eight fields that were identical to each other, but there were eight different

1346
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:24,000
ones, and you could rotate them into each other, you would say they had an SO8 symmetry

1347
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
and so forth.

1348
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,800
It's just a number of fields that matters.

1349
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:35,120
More often in quantum field theory, you will come across the group SU3 or SU2 or SU8 or

1350
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:41,900
whatever, and that change from SO to SU reflects the fact that very often our quantum fields

1351
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:45,180
are complex valued fields.

1352
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:50,120
So each field is not a number at each point in space, but a complex number at each point

1353
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:51,380
in space.

1354
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:54,580
So this is all to say, don't be intimidated.

1355
01:33:54,580 --> 01:34:01,280
When you hear people say, the standard model of particle physics has a gauge group SU2 cross

1356
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:02,720
U1.

1357
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:07,780
That's just a way of saying there are three fields that are complex valued that get rotated

1358
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:09,620
into each other.

1359
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:13,280
There's a separate set of two fields that are also complex valued that get rotated into

1360
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,280
each other.

1361
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:15,640
That's SU2.

1362
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:21,980
And then you could have a single complex valued field that can still in some sense rotate

1363
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:27,540
into itself because a complex valued field has a real part and an imaginary part.

1364
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:30,820
There is something called the complex plane where we have a complex number.

1365
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:36,160
We write the real value of the number on the horizontal axis, the imaginary value on the

1366
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,160
vertical axis.

1367
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:42,280
Well, you can rotate the complex plane, and that rotation is called U1.

1368
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:49,400
So these are all just fancy ways of talking about rotating fields into each other.

1369
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,560
And it doesn't matter.

1370
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:55,760
It doesn't matter what rotation you do, the same physical predictions will be made.

1371
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,560
That's what makes it asymmetry.

1372
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:03,140
Indeed, this idea of having three fields that we rotate into each other is a very simple

1373
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:04,140
example.

1374
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:05,140
They are called quarks.

1375
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:06,140
Okay.

1376
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:09,460
You may have heard that quarks come in three colors.

1377
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:13,580
There are red quarks, green quarks, and blue quarks.

1378
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:14,860
That's not quite right.

1379
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:18,180
Like so many things that you've been told.

1380
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:22,260
You've been told something that is not quite right, but good enough.

1381
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,100
And now you're ready for the real stuff.

1382
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:29,360
The real stuff is not that there are three different quarks, but there is a three-dimensional

1383
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,160
space of quarks.

1384
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:36,440
So the subtle difference I'm pointing to here is it's not that there are red quarks,

1385
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,280
green quarks, and blue quarks.

1386
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:43,920
There are quarks that every quark, I should say, should be thought of as a combination

1387
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:47,480
of a bit of red, a bit of green, and a bit of blue.

1388
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,640
And you can choose.

1389
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:50,320
You can rotate your axes.

1390
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,880
So you define what you mean by red, green, or blue.

1391
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:54,900
There's no actual reality to it.

1392
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:56,380
It has nothing to do with the real colors.

1393
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:57,380
Okay.

1394
01:35:57,380 --> 01:36:00,060
You're not looking at a blue quark and it looks blue or anything like that.

1395
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:01,860
This is just a label.

1396
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:05,300
R, G, and B are completely equivalent to each other.

1397
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:09,220
These three-dimensional vector space of quark colors.

1398
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:14,140
And the real statement is not there are three different colors of quarks, but that quarks,

1399
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:19,420
every quark field is an element at every point in space of this three-dimensional, three-complex

1400
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:22,260
dimensional, I should say, vector space.

1401
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:30,880
There is an SU3 symmetry rotating the red, green, and blue axes into each other.

1402
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:32,200
Three different kinds of quarks.

1403
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,040
We conventionally labeled them by color.

1404
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:37,280
There's a symmetry where we can rotate them into each other, SU3.

1405
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,280
Very, very nice.

1406
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:42,000
And then we'll talk about in the book what that means, SU3, et cetera, et cetera, how

1407
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
to implement it.

1408
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Great.

1409
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,640
So what?

1410
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:47,200
What difference does that make, really?

1411
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:52,020
Well, you instantly know there is a conserved quantity, because there is a symmetry.

1412
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:55,820
In Neurthus Theorem tells you there's always a conserved quantity when there's a symmetry.

1413
01:36:55,820 --> 01:37:00,700
So that's nice, but it isn't quite the punch line.

1414
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:02,420
The punch line comes from this.

1415
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:05,720
Let's imagine we have an even better symmetry.

1416
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:11,100
So we have these three fields we can rotate into each other, call that rotation SU3.

1417
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:12,260
That's nice.

1418
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:18,840
But what if I want to rotate the axes of my red, green, blue space in one way at some

1419
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:23,240
point and in a completely different way at some other point?

1420
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:25,040
I didn't say that I could do that.

1421
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:28,040
I'm just asking whether it would be possible.

1422
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:33,280
So there is something called a global symmetry transformation where we take what we've defined

1423
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:40,000
to be red, green, and blue, and we rotate them everywhere all at once in some particular

1424
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
way.

1425
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:45,020
It's a global transformation of what we mean by red, green, and blue.

1426
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:46,020
That's fine.

1427
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:48,900
No one really is bothered by that.

1428
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:55,060
But if you want, if you have the aspiration of saying, I would like to separately define

1429
01:37:55,060 --> 01:38:02,260
what I mean by red, green, and blue independently at every point in space, can I do that?

1430
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:07,740
That would be an enormously bigger symmetry, because I'm separately able to define what

1431
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:10,980
I mean by red, green, and blue all throughout space.

1432
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,760
That's a lot going on.

1433
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:18,880
And the answer is you can do that, but you have to sort of figure, you have to make sure

1434
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,120
that you're allowed to, that it's a well-defined thing.

1435
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:26,240
Because whether we call a quark at any one point in space a quark field, whether we call

1436
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:31,640
it red, green, or blue, or some combination thereof, that's completely arbitrary, right?

1437
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:33,520
That makes no physical difference.

1438
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:39,280
But if we have two different points in space, and we have the same quark field, remember

1439
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:43,460
the quark field will take values at every point in space.

1440
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:45,540
And let's ask the following question.

1441
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:50,380
At these two different points in space, does the quark field have the same color?

1442
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:51,900
Or does it have some different colors?

1443
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:54,340
Is it rotated by 90 degrees or whatever?

1444
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:56,300
That should be a well-defined question, right?

1445
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:58,780
Is it the same color or a different color?

1446
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:04,260
Well, if I'm allowed to rotate my axes separately at every point in space, it seems like I can't

1447
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:09,560
answer that question, because I could have some quark field that I am just simply defining

1448
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:15,760
to be red at one point in space by appropriately rotating my little red, green, blue axes.

1449
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:19,760
And again, these axes are completely imaginary, like not imaginary in the imaginary number

1450
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,280
sense, but conceptual.

1451
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:25,320
They're not axes of literal space, they're in quark space, okay?

1452
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:29,320
There's three different directions the quark field can be vibrating, the red direction,

1453
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:31,960
the green direction, the blue direction.

1454
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:36,340
And likewise, okay, so I have a red quark at one point in space, and I rotate my axes

1455
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:40,340
so that at some other point in space, it's also a red quark.

1456
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:41,340
But is that legit?

1457
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:45,540
I mean, I could have rotated it, so it was a blue quark, and there's a physical difference

1458
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:46,540
there.

1459
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:53,340
So what I'm getting at is, if you want to be able to have this mega-symmetry that lets

1460
01:39:53,340 --> 01:40:00,060
you rotate in red, green, blue space independently at every point in space, you also need some

1461
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:02,240
way to compare.

1462
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:06,720
You need some way to answer the question, what is the value, let's put it this way,

1463
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:13,360
how does the value of the color of the quark change as I travel along some path, okay?

1464
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:19,720
I can connect these two points in space with some path, and I can ask how the axes that

1465
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:24,080
define red, green, and blue are changing as I move down the path.

1466
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:28,440
So I need some information that lets me answer that question.

1467
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:31,220
How do these axes change as I go down the path?

1468
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:34,940
How does the definition of red, green, and blue change?

1469
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:39,500
It's not a rigid structure like it would have been if I just had that global symmetry.

1470
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:44,500
Now I'm able to change what I mean by red, green, and blue independently everywhere.

1471
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:48,540
Something needs to absorb the information of how I did that.

1472
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:49,540
What would do that?

1473
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:53,500
What would carry that information about how I defined red, green, and blue at every point

1474
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,700
in space?

1475
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:57,140
The answer is a field.

1476
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:58,560
I need another kind of field.

1477
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,880
I already have the quark field.

1478
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:03,720
In fact, I have this sort of three different kinds of quark field, the red, green, and

1479
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:06,680
blue, three different directions in which the quark can rotate.

1480
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:13,080
But now I need an entirely new kind of field to carry the information that tells me how

1481
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:18,680
to relate the red, green, and blue axes at different points in space.

1482
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:20,960
And the mathematicians know how to do this.

1483
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:26,360
This is called a connection field, and the mathematical subject that studies these things

1484
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:27,820
is called fiber bundles.

1485
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:31,900
It's a subject within differential geometry.

1486
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:32,820
You can read all about it.

1487
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:35,540
Again, we're not going to go into all those details.

1488
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:39,780
But the point, and this is a big point, and it's another one of those miraculous points

1489
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:46,340
that is very, very important, is that you can do these independent symmetry transformations

1490
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:51,700
at different points, but only if you introduce a new field that lets you keep track of the

1491
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:55,700
information relating what's going on at different points.

1492
01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:01,160
So these symmetries that can happen independently at every different point are called gauge

1493
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:06,520
symmetries, or simply local symmetries in contrast with the global symmetries that

1494
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:07,880
we were talking about.

1495
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:14,760
To start, gauge symmetries, unlike global symmetries, come along with the new field,

1496
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:17,400
the gauge field, aka the connection.

1497
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:21,400
Those are the same thing, the gauge field, the connection field, the field that keeps

1498
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:26,860
track of how your axes are changing from point to point in space, okay?

1499
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:32,740
It's much like in space time, if you go back to book one of the biggest ideas, in space

1500
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:37,780
time, just to compare the question, what direction is a vector pointing in?

1501
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:41,420
You need to be able to parallel transport vectors from one point to another, and you

1502
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:43,660
need a connection field to be able to do that.

1503
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:47,180
That connection depends on the metric, in general relativity.

1504
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:50,300
Here, in gauge theories of particle physics, there's no metric.

1505
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:52,400
There just is the connection.

1506
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:55,280
That's a field that shows up as the gauge field.

1507
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:58,080
And so, what does that field do?

1508
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,320
What are its dynamics?

1509
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:00,320
How does it behave?

1510
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,040
How does it interact with other fields?

1511
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:03,720
There's a whole bunch of questions.

1512
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:06,920
You're going to read the book, so you're going to know the answer to these questions.

1513
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:14,720
But the punchline is that field, that connection field, you need to implement the gauge symmetry

1514
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:16,640
is the force field.

1515
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:22,980
It is the electromagnetic field for electromagnetism, or the gravitational field for gravity.

1516
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:28,740
And it gives rise to particles, photons for electromagnetism, gravitons for gravity.

1517
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:33,020
And there's also the nuclear forces, the strong and weak nuclear forces.

1518
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:37,620
Mathematically, they are boson fields, and you can derive that.

1519
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:43,820
And there are interactions with other fields, the way that the force carrying fields interact

1520
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:49,160
with the non-force carrying fields, the electrons and neutrinos and quarks and so forth, is entirely

1521
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:53,440
determined by the demands of this symmetry, okay?

1522
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:58,120
Given the fact that you want this symmetry to exist, not only do you need this gauge

1523
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:02,440
field, but you know how the gauge field interacts with other fields.

1524
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:04,840
And you know more than that, the symmetry is super powerful.

1525
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:08,920
This is why physicists sort of start jumping up and down when they talk about symmetry.

1526
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:12,840
They get very excited, because it really is a very powerful concept.

1527
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:19,500
You can derive features of the dynamics of the gauge fields all by itself.

1528
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:23,980
So in particular, there's one very, very important feature that kind of puzzled people for a

1529
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:24,980
long time.

1530
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:27,100
Let me back up to just mention.

1531
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:31,580
The idea of a gauge field was kind of understood by Maxwell.

1532
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:35,540
He understood that his electric field and magnetic field could be derived from a more

1533
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:40,020
fundamental single thing that we would now call the gauge field.

1534
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:47,080
It wasn't until the 1950s that Yang and Mills suggested generalizing this idea of the electromagnetic

1535
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:51,040
gauge field to more complicated gauge fields, SU2, SU3, etc.

1536
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:55,760
And it took a while, it took until the 70s, really, for us to figure out how to make that

1537
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,720
happen, okay?

1538
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:02,800
But it turns out that that symmetry, this SU2 or SU3 symmetry or whatever it is, has

1539
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:08,120
a very direct implication for the particles that arise from these gauge fields.

1540
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:13,620
The implication is, the particles have to have zero mass.

1541
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:17,020
And again, this is something where you will be delighted when you read the book, because

1542
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:22,740
you will see why that's true, because it comes right out of the equations.

1543
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:28,780
Given what you mean by mass, mass is a particular kind of potential energy that the fields

1544
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:34,420
can have, and there's no way to have that kind of potential energy and respect the symmetry

1545
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:35,420
at the same time.

1546
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:39,800
So there's a direct line from saying, there's a gauge symmetry to saying, and there's a

1547
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,520
massless particle.

1548
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:45,920
And that's beautiful and lovely, because we have the photon, which is a massless particle.

1549
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:48,440
We have the graviton, which is a massless particle.

1550
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:52,520
I know we haven't detected gravitons yet, and people get fussy about it, but if you

1551
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:57,920
believe the basic features of general relativity and quantum mechanics, gravitons will exist.

1552
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:01,040
They're just too weakly interacting to ever be detected.

1553
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:04,800
I would not have any skepticism that they really exist.

1554
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:11,340
But the problem is that those are the only two massless gauge bosons that we know about,

1555
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:15,300
the photon and the graviton, right, at least that we knew about back in the day.

1556
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:20,060
So when we're thinking about this back in the 50s and 60s, people were like, wait a minute,

1557
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:22,260
this is a problem.

1558
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:27,140
We would love it if this beautiful mathematical structure of gauge symmetry and the associated

1559
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:33,460
fields could somehow help us understand not only electromagnetism and gravity, but also

1560
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,440
the nuclear forces.

1561
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:39,440
There are two nuclear forces, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force, not the

1562
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:42,160
most romantic names I know, but that's what we're stuck with, okay?

1563
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:44,640
The weak force and the strong force.

1564
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:47,360
Both of them are short-range forces.

1565
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:49,560
That's why you don't notice them in our everyday lives.

1566
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:55,000
In our everyday lives, we really only notice electricity, magnetism, or gravity, as far

1567
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,200
as bosonic force fields are concerned.

1568
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:04,700
So if Yang and Mills have this idea about gauge symmetries, but gauge symmetries imply

1569
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:10,180
that the force-carrying particles are massless, and there's this little mathematical trick

1570
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:15,340
you can do to show that massless particles always give rise to long-range forces, which

1571
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:18,980
it seems that you can, then we're stuck, right?

1572
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:22,540
Because the things that we want to explain experimentally are short-range forces and

1573
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:25,860
it seems like the idea doesn't work.

1574
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:33,880
Of course, physicists are not as easily dissuaded as that.

1575
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:37,080
They will keep trying, and they should keep trying.

1576
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:40,920
This is also true for modern theories where we're thinking about the multiverse or string

1577
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:43,000
theory or loop quantum gravity or whatever.

1578
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:48,000
You will very often say, okay, if my theory works in a certain way, I predict X, X is

1579
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,840
not true, right?

1580
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:51,080
But you don't give up.

1581
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:54,800
You say, well, maybe I didn't think hard enough about what my theory really predicts.

1582
01:47:54,820 --> 01:48:00,140
It's absolutely the situation they were in in the 50s and 60s, thinking about gauge symmetries.

1583
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:05,780
The idea was so incredibly attractive, they wanted to make it work, even though it predicted

1584
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:08,260
massless bosons that were not observed.

1585
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:09,820
So what is going on?

1586
01:48:09,820 --> 01:48:15,420
Well, it turns out there are several different ways to get rid of these massless bosons,

1587
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:16,820
and nature uses all of them.

1588
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:21,500
Well, there's two very, very straightforward ways, and nature uses both of them.

1589
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:22,940
Let's put it that way.

1590
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:27,680
So we can think about this in terms of phases of our gauge symmetry.

1591
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:34,600
Just like water can be in the liquid-solid or gas phase, a gauge field can appear in

1592
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:35,680
different phases.

1593
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:39,200
Not really depending on temperature, although that's also true, but it really depends on

1594
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:46,400
other fundamental variables, fundamental properties of the underlying physical equations of motion.

1595
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:49,800
So one phase is the so-called Coulomb phase.

1596
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:54,820
Coulomb's law is just the electromagnetic version of Newton's inverse square law for gravity.

1597
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:57,660
So you could call it the Newton phase, if you wanted to.

1598
01:48:57,660 --> 01:49:05,220
The Coulomb phase is the phase where the gauge bosons are massless and can easily travel

1599
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:06,980
throughout the universe.

1600
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:13,500
Photons and gravitons both qualify for that, and in that case, you have long-range forces

1601
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:18,060
with an inverse square law, and indeed, for both electricity, magnetism, and gravity,

1602
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:21,440
you have long-range forces with an inverse square law.

1603
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:27,720
It's fun and amusing to see the fact that Coulomb's law and Newton's law of gravity

1604
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:33,680
are both inverse square laws coming out of an underlying gauge symmetry for the forces

1605
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:36,200
that give rise to them.

1606
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:40,400
But there are other phases these gauge symmetries can be in.

1607
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:44,200
So one phase happens when you have the symmetry.

1608
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:52,820
You have this gauge symmetry that would and does give rise to gauge bosons, but the symmetry

1609
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:56,060
is broken spontaneously.

1610
01:49:56,060 --> 01:49:58,220
What does that mean?

1611
01:49:58,220 --> 01:50:02,660
Spontaneous breaking of a symmetry means when the symmetry is broken, not because the fundamental

1612
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:08,340
deep-down equations of motion violate the symmetry, but because the specific configuration

1613
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:11,140
of the world violates the symmetry.

1614
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:19,280
For example, rotations in three-dimensional space are a symmetry of the laws of physics,

1615
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:22,840
but here on Earth, there's a difference between up and down.

1616
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:28,840
There's an arrow of space in a very, very direct kind of way, and that is not surprising

1617
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:29,840
to us.

1618
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,760
No one thinks that's because of the fundamental laws of physics.

1619
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:34,200
Maybe Aristotle did, but now we know better.

1620
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:36,840
We know it's because we have the Earth underneath our feet.

1621
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:43,020
The actual configuration of matter is breaking the symmetry between up and down, even though

1622
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:45,460
the laws of physics do not.

1623
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:49,980
Now strictly speaking, that's not a great example of what we're calling spontaneous symmetry

1624
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:56,780
breaking because spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theory happens, again, because

1625
01:50:56,780 --> 01:51:02,180
the configuration of the world breaks the symmetry, but even in the vacuum, that's the

1626
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:03,340
new thing.

1627
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:05,020
So the Earth is not the vacuum.

1628
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:10,360
The Earth is a big pile of energy, pile of matter and particles and so forth, so that

1629
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:12,000
can break the symmetry.

1630
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,400
But what if empty space itself could break a symmetry?

1631
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:19,280
That would be a whole different kind of thing.

1632
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:24,240
And this was studied, I forget whether it was the 50s or 60s where they started studying

1633
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:29,520
it, but Yoshiro Nambu, my former colleague at the University of Chicago, and Jeffrey

1634
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:34,720
Goldstone and others, studied how you could break a symmetry.

1635
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:36,740
And the idea is actually quite simple.

1636
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:39,740
You have yet another field, right?

1637
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:40,740
And guess what?

1638
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:43,740
This is going to grow up into what we now call the Higgs field.

1639
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:47,780
So the Higgs field is an example of this kind of field, but we'll get there in a second.

1640
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:53,020
If you have another field, not a fermion, not like a quark or an electron or something

1641
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:59,700
like that, but a scalar field, a bosonic field that transforms under the symmetry, okay?

1642
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:04,100
So let's say you have an SU2 symmetry because you kind of do in the weak interactions, which

1643
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:05,960
is what we're going to get to.

1644
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:07,880
So you have an SU2 symmetry.

1645
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:14,760
So for this scalar field, you have two directions in which the scalar field can vibrate, and

1646
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:19,400
there's an SU2 rotation that rotates them into each other, okay?

1647
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:27,520
But if the value of the field in empty space were zero, then not only would the field's

1648
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:33,920
plural be invariant under the symmetry, but the configuration of these fields in the vacuum

1649
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:37,420
would be invariant under this symmetry because the configuration would be centered around

1650
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:43,260
zero, and if you rotate a plane around the origin, nothing seems to happen.

1651
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:48,180
But what if in empty space, the field was at a non-zero value?

1652
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:52,940
What if the energy of the field were lower when it had some non-zero value than when

1653
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:55,540
it were at zero, when it was at zero?

1654
01:52:55,540 --> 01:52:56,540
You could do that.

1655
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:58,780
You can easily write down equations that make that happen.

1656
01:52:58,780 --> 01:53:02,740
If you want to look up the details, it's the Mexican hat potential that you might have

1657
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:10,040
seen under discussions of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and when that happens, the specific

1658
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:17,280
value that the field takes in empty space is not invariant under the symmetry.

1659
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:22,680
So the equations are invariant, but the value the field has is not invariant.

1660
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:26,600
That is what is called spontaneous symmetry breaking because it kind of doesn't matter

1661
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,840
what direction the field is pointing in.

1662
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:35,700
It's pointing in some direction, even in empty space, and so now there's an answer to the

1663
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:40,620
question when some other thing, like a quark or an electron, vibrates, you can ask the

1664
01:53:40,620 --> 01:53:45,540
question, is it vibrating in the same direction as the scalar field that's breaking the symmetry

1665
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:47,820
or perpendicularly to it or whatever?

1666
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:52,780
The symmetry has been broken in a way that it wasn't before, okay?

1667
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:58,580
Sadly, this has not immediately solved the problems because Goldstone proved a theorem,

1668
01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:03,720
Goldstone's theorem, that says that when you have spontaneous symmetry breaking, you

1669
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:06,600
will have a new kind of massless particle.

1670
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:10,520
The scalar field will turn into a massless particle, and again, those particles were

1671
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:15,120
not observed, and so people were still a little flummoxed.

1672
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:20,640
But what they soon realized is that there's a big important difference between the global

1673
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:25,080
symmetries that we talked about originally, where the symmetry has to be done everywhere

1674
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:30,660
uniformly, versus the gauge symmetries where you have this connection field that keeps track

1675
01:54:30,660 --> 01:54:32,900
of what direction you're pointing in.

1676
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:38,980
The Goldstone's theorem analysis that predicted the existence of a new kind of massless particle

1677
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:41,020
was only for global symmetries.

1678
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:47,180
When you do the same thing for gauge symmetries, you do not get a massless particle.

1679
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:53,260
Not only is the scalar field not giving you an extra massless particle, but your gauge

1680
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:58,720
fields, like the photon or the equivalent of the photon, get heavy.

1681
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:03,560
They go from being massless to being massive, and in every single quantum field theory textbook

1682
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:09,840
in the world, what you're told is that the gauge bosons eat the scalar bosons, the Higgs

1683
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:13,920
bosons, and they become massive by doing that.

1684
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:19,160
So you go from a theory with a lot of massless particles to a theory with no massless particles

1685
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:23,240
through spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry.

1686
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:29,460
And that is the origin in the standard model of particle physics of the W and Z bosons.

1687
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:38,220
You have the Higgs boson, which is a spin-zero boson that is, as we say, charged under the

1688
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:40,420
SU2 symmetry.

1689
01:55:40,420 --> 01:55:43,300
It rotates under the SU2 symmetry.

1690
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:47,860
And so do all the other particles of the standard model, the electrons and the quarks, etc.

1691
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:54,320
But that Higgs boson gets an expectation value that is not zero in empty space, and that

1692
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:59,640
gives mass to the gauge bosons, which we observe at the end of the day as the W and

1693
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:02,120
Z bosons, and they are indeed massive.

1694
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:07,800
And it is because those particles are massive that the force they give rise to is a short-range

1695
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:10,720
force rather than a long-range force.

1696
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:16,920
So that is one way that we can have our cake needed to, that we can have massless particles

1697
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:21,660
because of the gauge symmetry, but they don't appear to us at the end of the day because

1698
01:56:21,660 --> 01:56:26,060
they have gained mass because of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

1699
01:56:26,060 --> 01:56:31,620
There turns out to be a whole other way to hide the massless particles from us, and nature

1700
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:37,100
takes advantage of that way in the SU3 part of the standard model.

1701
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:43,100
SU3 is the gauge group, the group of symmetries for the quarks, the red, green and blue quarks,

1702
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:48,680
the three dimensions of quark space that get rotated into each other by this SU3 symmetry.

1703
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:55,120
And because those are colors, we call this quantum chromodynamics, or QCD, in analogy

1704
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:58,600
with QED, coined from Murray-Gelman.

1705
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:05,480
So QCD is a theory of the gauge symmetry in the associated force that comes from invariance

1706
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:11,540
under rotations in red, green, blue internal space that the quarks live in.

1707
01:57:11,540 --> 01:57:13,920
And there, there's no spontaneous symmetry breaking.

1708
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:20,920
The SU3 symmetry is unbroken in empty space, so the gluons, which are the gauge bosons

1709
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:27,960
of that force, what we call the strong force, are massless.

1710
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:29,800
Gluons are still massless.

1711
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:35,640
Why then do they not give rise to a long range one over R squared force?

1712
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:39,840
The answer is because of the difference between SU3 and U1.

1713
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:42,980
And again, some details, we're gliding over.

1714
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:46,620
The buzzwords are abelian versus non-abelian.

1715
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:50,380
These are different kinds of symmetry groups that you can have.

1716
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:57,620
And the SU3 symmetry group is just more complicated than the U1 symmetry group.

1717
01:57:57,620 --> 01:58:00,700
Electromagnetism has a very simple symmetry group, U1.

1718
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:03,340
It's just rotations in a complex plane.

1719
01:58:03,340 --> 01:58:07,700
The SU3 symmetry group has more things going on.

1720
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:13,040
And at the level of the fields, that has a crucially important implication, namely the

1721
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:19,240
fields, the gluon fields, interact with each other directly in a way that photons don't

1722
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:20,800
interact with each other.

1723
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:24,640
Photons are the particles of the U1 gauge symmetry.

1724
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:27,880
Gluons are the particles of the SU3 gauge symmetry.

1725
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:32,240
But photons interact with charged particles like electrons and quarks.

1726
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:37,360
They don't directly interact with other photons, indirectly they can do because of electrons

1727
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:39,620
at center, but not directly.

1728
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:46,940
Whereas the gluons can interact directly with other gluons because gluons also carry color

1729
01:58:46,940 --> 01:58:51,020
in a way that photons do not carry electric charge.

1730
01:58:51,020 --> 01:58:56,980
And what that means is it opens up a possibility that nature, in fact, takes advantage of,

1731
01:58:56,980 --> 01:58:59,740
which is what we call confinement.

1732
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:05,340
You might think that since the gluons are massless, like electrical fields around an

1733
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:10,640
electron, they should spread out in an inverse square kind of potential.

1734
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:14,880
But in fact, the gluons keep interacting with each other.

1735
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:21,560
They acquire energy by their mutual interaction with other gluons, as well as with the quarks.

1736
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:28,080
And that energy dramatically changes the way that the gluon field arranges itself around

1737
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,320
individual quarks.

1738
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:31,960
It is not an inverse square law.

1739
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:39,420
The force between two gluons or between two quarks mediated by gluons grows with distance,

1740
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:43,300
rather than decreasing with distance as 1 over r squared.

1741
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:48,380
So if you take two quarks and they're pulled together by gluons, if you try to pull them

1742
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:53,700
apart, it takes more and more and more energy to get the quarks to pull apart.

1743
01:59:53,700 --> 02:00:00,420
And so much energy that at some point it makes more sense just to make more quarks or a quark-anti-quark

1744
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:03,160
pair to be a little bit more precise.

1745
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:08,400
So you just snap the string, if you like, that is connecting the flux tube, as we call

1746
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:11,640
it, that is connecting the two quarks to each other.

1747
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:15,440
Because of this, you can never see one quark all by itself.

1748
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:20,360
Every quark is connected to other quarks held together by these gluons.

1749
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:25,480
And that's why the particles we see are protons, neutrons, mesons, things like that, not the

1750
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:28,140
individual quarks.

1751
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:34,840
As I am recording this, and after I wrote my book, there has been an experimental claim

1752
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:40,640
that we have experimentally detected what are called gluballs, which are particle-like

1753
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:44,960
excitations made of nothing but gluons, no quarks at all.

1754
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:47,880
So that's very exciting, it's too bad for me because I said in the book that we haven't

1755
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:51,360
detected gluballs yet, but apparently we have.

1756
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:58,120
Anyway, this is why the strong force is short-ranged, not because of spontaneous symmetry breaking,

1757
02:00:58,120 --> 02:01:03,860
but because of confinement, because the gluons interact with each other so strongly that

1758
02:01:03,860 --> 02:01:08,780
you can't separate individual particles from each other, and they completely distort the

1759
02:01:08,780 --> 02:01:16,580
shape of the gluon field away from being a long-range 1 over r squared force.

1760
02:01:16,580 --> 02:01:18,380
So there's a lot going on.

1761
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:23,580
This is why when you take general relativity as a graduate student in physics, different

1762
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:25,500
people react differently to different courses.

1763
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:27,680
But general relativity is beautiful.

1764
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:33,040
When you take that one semester course, you start from simple geometric postulates, and

1765
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:38,040
you derive the equation of Einstein, and then you derive all these consequences, black holes

1766
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:41,680
and everything, and it's so pristine and logical and lovely.

1767
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:46,440
Then when you take your quantum field theory course, not only is it at least two semesters,

1768
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:52,640
often three or four semesters of quantum field theory, but it's not beautiful really, not

1769
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,640
in the same way.

1770
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:54,640
It's a mess.

1771
02:01:54,780 --> 02:01:59,220
There's a lot going on with all these different forces, all these different symmetries, and

1772
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:01,300
the field itself is just complicated.

1773
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:06,620
You can easily take quantum field theory courses again and again, hopefully from different

1774
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:09,720
instructors with different textbooks, and learn more and more every time.

1775
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:12,820
No one would ever take general relativity more than once if they learned it correctly

1776
02:02:12,820 --> 02:02:13,820
the first time.

1777
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:17,180
There's so much we didn't even get to talk about.

1778
02:02:17,180 --> 02:02:22,520
Parity violation is very, very important in the standard model of particle physics.

1779
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:26,460
There are families of particles.

1780
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:30,260
There are different ways that neutrinos and electrons hook up with each other versus how

1781
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:34,300
quarks hook up with each other.

1782
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:40,020
Let me hint at one kind of thing that I haven't been able to tell you about.

1783
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:49,020
This gauge group of the strong force, SU3, like I said, it's more complex.

1784
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:54,560
It's not super-duper complex, but it's a little bit more going on there, a little more structure

1785
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:59,400
than the U1 gauge symmetry of electromagnetism.

1786
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:01,520
The SU2 is much like SU3.

1787
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:06,800
They're very similar, but because SU2 is spontaneously broken, it's a different conversation

1788
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:07,800
that we have about it.

1789
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:12,640
SU3 is not spontaneously broken, but it's confined.

1790
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:17,120
One of the things that can happen because SU3 is a slightly different gauge group than

1791
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:24,900
U1 is that you can have different vacuum configurations of the gauge fields.

1792
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:25,900
What do I mean by that?

1793
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:31,340
A vacuum configuration of the fields is a configuration that has zero energy, right?

1794
02:03:31,340 --> 02:03:36,140
But when I say a field configuration, you now know, since you've listened to this podcast,

1795
02:03:36,140 --> 02:03:40,700
you now know that a field configuration is a specific arrangement of the field at every

1796
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:46,220
point in space, but you also know that there is a symmetry, the gauge symmetry.

1797
02:03:46,220 --> 02:03:52,960
I can rotate what I mean by red, green, and blue of SU3 separately at each point in space.

1798
02:03:52,960 --> 02:04:01,640
So really what I mean by the vacuum configuration of the field is one particular reference configuration

1799
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:06,240
of the field plus any gauge transformation I want to do on it.

1800
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:08,180
A gauge transformation is a symmetry.

1801
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:11,520
It doesn't really change the actual field, right?

1802
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:12,520
Okay.

1803
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:17,380
That's just a, it sounds like a mathematical detail that I don't need to think too hard.

1804
02:04:17,380 --> 02:04:21,980
I should just be careful when I say what I mean by a field configuration to say, really

1805
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:26,700
what I mean is a field configuration up to a possible symmetry transformation that you

1806
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:28,780
might want to do.

1807
02:04:28,780 --> 02:04:35,860
But it turns out that in SU3, in the strong interactions, there are what we call small

1808
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:40,180
gauge transformations and large gauge transformations.

1809
02:04:40,180 --> 02:04:41,180
And what does that mean?

1810
02:04:41,180 --> 02:04:42,500
What does small and large mean?

1811
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:48,880
It means that there is a topology to the possible gauge transformations we can do.

1812
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:55,800
It's exactly once again, this is an example of an underlying smooth thing, the gauge fields

1813
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:02,120
of SU3 quantum chromodynamics, but having a discrete set of possible arrangements of

1814
02:05:02,120 --> 02:05:03,520
those fields.

1815
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:07,680
So it's kind of like wrapping a circle around another circle.

1816
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:09,760
It's actually very analogous to that.

1817
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:16,060
If I have one circle, if I think like a topologist now, and I'm going to map a different circle

1818
02:05:16,060 --> 02:05:20,900
to my first circle, I can just take the first circle and I can map it the whole thing to

1819
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:26,780
a point, or I could wrap it once around the other circle, or I could wrap it once around

1820
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:30,660
the other way, or I could wrap it twice around, et cetera, right?

1821
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:35,980
Even though the circles themselves are smooth manifolds, there's a discrete set of ways

1822
02:05:35,980 --> 02:05:38,460
that I can wrap one circle around another one.

1823
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:42,280
These are called the winding numbers of these different maps.

1824
02:05:42,280 --> 02:05:45,480
Turns out, and again, you don't need to understand this because this is just like hinting at

1825
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:52,000
some fascinating work that happened in quantum field theory in the course of the 1970s, turns

1826
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:59,520
out that there are topologically non-trivial gauge transformations in SU3 that wrap the

1827
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:03,080
gauge field around itself and they're associated with a winding number.

1828
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:07,880
Okay, so once again, you say, all right, there's still all, it's all empty space, just empty

1829
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:12,820
space and increasingly complicated configurations because they're all equivalent to each other

1830
02:06:12,820 --> 02:06:20,460
under the symmetry transformation, but it turns out the field can dynamically flip from

1831
02:06:20,460 --> 02:06:27,420
one topological configuration to another, and that is not just the vacuum.

1832
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:32,100
That is, it can sort of pop out of the vacuum for a second as it winds around itself and

1833
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:35,260
then settle down into a different winding number.

1834
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:40,160
So you start with empty space, the vacuum, you end with empty space, the vacuum, but

1835
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:45,800
through some quantum fluctuation called an instanton, you change dynamically the winding

1836
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:47,640
number of the field.

1837
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:51,960
And this is all, you know, this is a whole conversation that could only be had because

1838
02:06:51,960 --> 02:06:53,920
we're doing quantum field theory, right?

1839
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:56,800
Because the fields are what the universe is made of.

1840
02:06:56,800 --> 02:07:00,880
They have these mathematical properties, things can happen.

1841
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:07,620
And the kicker is that these instantons that are quantum transitions that change the winding

1842
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:11,940
numbers of the gauge fields have a physical effect.

1843
02:07:11,940 --> 02:07:16,860
They give rise to masses for different mesons in different ways.

1844
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:22,740
And this is called the ADA problem in QCD that is solved by thinking carefully about the

1845
02:07:22,740 --> 02:07:28,840
structure of the vacuum and the existence of topologically non-trivial gauge transformations.

1846
02:07:28,840 --> 02:07:33,220
All of which, I hope that everything before the last five minutes was completely crystal

1847
02:07:33,220 --> 02:07:36,500
clear and you understood everything, the last five minutes was just to make you sort of

1848
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:37,500
intrigued.

1849
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:41,140
There's not enough detail to possibly be completely understandable.

1850
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:46,340
The point is, there's a lot going on in the standard model of particle physics.

1851
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:53,340
It is an amazing structure that I didn't even mention, but of course the real punchline

1852
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:55,500
is it fits the data.

1853
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:57,780
It fits so much data.

1854
02:07:58,040 --> 02:08:02,920
When we turned on the Large Hadron Collider, of course eventually, we turned it on like

1855
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:07,160
2006, blew up, fixed it, turned it on in 2008 again.

1856
02:08:07,160 --> 02:08:10,560
By 2012, we discovered the Higgs boson.

1857
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:14,800
But before we discovered the Higgs boson, we rediscovered the entire rest of the standard

1858
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:15,800
model.

1859
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:19,960
All the other particles that had been discovered before, all the different quarks and the W

1860
02:08:19,960 --> 02:08:26,200
and the Z bosons and so forth, the LHC sees them in exactly where they should be doing

1861
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:29,320
exactly the things they should do.

1862
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:35,420
There's no more rich and quantitatively accurate theory in the history of physics than the

1863
02:08:35,420 --> 02:08:37,820
standard model of particle physics.

1864
02:08:37,820 --> 02:08:39,660
So it's very messy.

1865
02:08:39,660 --> 02:08:42,620
It's very, it does a little bit of everything.

1866
02:08:42,620 --> 02:08:47,140
It's not like one beautiful principle just continues on as a line that gives you the

1867
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:48,580
entire theory.

1868
02:08:48,580 --> 02:08:54,020
Many, many ideas come in from seemingly different corners of physics and mathematics, etc.,

1869
02:08:54,020 --> 02:08:58,700
and combine to give us the standard model and it works beautifully.

1870
02:08:58,700 --> 02:09:01,500
It explains all the data that we have so far.

1871
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:05,340
Good news, bad news situation, of course, for reasons that we get into in other podcast

1872
02:09:05,340 --> 02:09:06,940
conversations.

1873
02:09:06,940 --> 02:09:12,140
And the final thing to say is, and it's probably not the final answer, right?

1874
02:09:12,140 --> 02:09:16,880
I mean, the standard model of particle physics, even if you include gravity, you can include

1875
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:21,300
gravity in the standard model as long as the gravitational fields are weak.

1876
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:26,220
And we call that the core theory dubbed by Frank Wilczek.

1877
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:28,740
But we don't understand a whole bunch of things.

1878
02:09:28,740 --> 02:09:31,020
We don't understand the Big Bang or black holes, right?

1879
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:35,400
We don't understand conditions where black, where gravity is strong.

1880
02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:37,060
We don't know what the dark matter is.

1881
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:42,180
That's some other kind of energy that is apparently not there in the standard model.

1882
02:09:42,180 --> 02:09:46,340
And there's things about the standard model that are just puzzling.

1883
02:09:46,340 --> 02:09:50,300
There's both sort of mildly puzzling things and deeply puzzling things.

1884
02:09:50,300 --> 02:09:53,780
There are numerical unnatural numbers, right?

1885
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:58,140
The cosmological constant, of course, is a famous unnatural number.

1886
02:09:58,140 --> 02:10:02,540
The mass of the Higgs boson, even though we can measure it, et cetera, it's very different

1887
02:10:02,540 --> 02:10:07,060
from what we would expect it to be, according to the logic of effective field theory that

1888
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:08,380
we mentioned earlier.

1889
02:10:08,380 --> 02:10:12,260
So these are apparent fine tunings in the standard model.

1890
02:10:12,260 --> 02:10:15,620
There's also the fact that that you won part of the standard model, right?

1891
02:10:15,620 --> 02:10:19,300
The standard model is SU3 cross U2 cross U1.

1892
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:22,580
The SU3 symmetry is quantum chromodynamics.

1893
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:28,820
The SU2 and U1 parts are the electroweak unified theory, the theory that gives us both electromagnetism

1894
02:10:28,820 --> 02:10:30,460
and the weak force.

1895
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:35,220
But the U1 part is really not well behaved at high energies.

1896
02:10:35,220 --> 02:10:39,060
There's something called a Landau pole that we're not going to get into here.

1897
02:10:39,060 --> 02:10:45,060
But the U1 part of the standard model apparently doesn't make sense at arbitrarily high energy

1898
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:46,060
scales.

1899
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:47,060
It shouldn't.

1900
02:10:47,060 --> 02:10:50,380
This doesn't bother people because gravity is going to be important at ultra-high energy

1901
02:10:50,380 --> 02:10:51,380
scales.

1902
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:55,580
At low energies where you and I live, gravity is a very weak force, but at high energies

1903
02:10:55,580 --> 02:10:57,580
it should become important.

1904
02:10:57,580 --> 02:10:59,580
So there are gaps.

1905
02:10:59,580 --> 02:11:03,420
There are things the standard model is not up to the task of accounting for, even if they're

1906
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:07,300
mostly kind of conceptual things rather than experimental things.

1907
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:13,820
So not only the standard model itself, but probably even quantum field theory as an overall

1908
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:21,460
picture is probably not up to the task of being the final complete theory of everything

1909
02:11:21,460 --> 02:11:22,820
in physics.

1910
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:27,260
So the reason why I've been wanting to write this book for 20 years, and I'm very excited

1911
02:11:27,260 --> 02:11:33,140
to finally have done it, is both to impress upon you how wonderful quantum field theory

1912
02:11:33,140 --> 02:11:38,340
is, how amazing it is that it fits all the data in so many intricate and weird and fun

1913
02:11:38,340 --> 02:11:44,340
ways, but also to prepare you for the fact that we might do better someday, whether it's

1914
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:48,460
emergent spacetime or string theory or whatever it happens to be.

1915
02:11:48,460 --> 02:11:49,700
Physics isn't done yet.

1916
02:11:49,700 --> 02:11:50,700
We're still moving on.

1917
02:11:50,700 --> 02:11:52,660
We understand a lot.

1918
02:11:52,660 --> 02:11:54,540
We don't understand everything.

1919
02:11:54,540 --> 02:11:59,940
We have to accept and celebrate both of those features of our knowledge and try to increase

1920
02:11:59,940 --> 02:12:01,780
the amount that we understand.

1921
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:03,300
Let's get back to work then.

1922
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:03,700
Thanks.
