00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Long time listeners will know that I've long been a fan of Las Vegas.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I like to go to Vegas, play poker, eat, shop, whatever, just relax and have a good time.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Haven't been able to do it quite as much. Now that we're on the East Coast, that's okay.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There's always pluses and minuses. Now we can go to New York. It's like the Las Vegas of the East.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But anyway, one of the reasons why I like Las Vegas is in addition to the stereotypes.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So the stereotypes are absolutely there, right? There are long rows of slot machines

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
with dull-eyed people mindlessly pressing buttons hoping to get rich someday.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's kind of depressing, that part. But there's a lot of weird stuff in Vegas if you look closely enough.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So by Vegas standards, one of the weird things that I really like is there's an outpost of Bowman Rare Books.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is a well-known rare book store with headquarters in New York.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But they have a Vegas store in the Palazzo Hotel Casino, where I used to stay sometimes.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And it's just weird. Among all the glitz and glamour, here's rare books.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And they actually have a lot of first editions of things, but also some weird sciency books.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
They have a signed Albert Einstein, for example.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And I was very amused to see in Bowman's Rare Books in Vegas a copy of Claude Shannon's Master's Thesis.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Claude Shannon, famous 20th century scientist for many reasons.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And his Master's thesis, I didn't actually know this before I saw it in the bookstore, is very famous.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's been called by Howard Gardner the most influential Master's thesis of all 20th century science.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is a Master's thesis that has its own Wikipedia page, okay?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And it's about basically using Boolean analysis to model and improve the efficiency of circuits and things like that.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Pretty awesome for a Master's thesis kind of thing.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But for my purposes today, I'm just using this as a somewhat strained segue into, of course, Claude Shannon's big contribution,

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
even bigger than the Master's thesis came 10 years after when he essentially invented information theory.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He wrote a paper called The Mathematical Theory of Communication.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And like many great scientific breakthroughs, theoretical breakthroughs, this was driven by a down-to-earth technological practical need.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Shannon was interested in sending signals across the Atlantic Ocean in wires.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And you want to send a signal in a way that is efficient, right?

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That is least likely to be garbled or to lose the information.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And to do that, to figure out how to do that, you need to have a mathematical way of characterizing what you mean by information.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And it turns out, as he discovered by doing the math, that it's very, very similar to the formula for entropy in statistical mechanics.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So there was clearly some interesting hidden relationship here between information and communication on the one side and statistical mechanics and thermodynamics on the other side.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And of course, so this is the middle of the century, 1948.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This idea has blossomed quite a bit.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You hear about information all the time.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You hear about it in the political arena, right?

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Misinformation, disinformation.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You hear about it in technology.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The information superhighway, that was a big thing.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And you must have heard that information as a concept is useful in biology, in neuroscience, quantum mechanics, quantum information, and so on.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So today, on the podcast, we have Christoph Adami, who is, like many mindscape guests, he started out his career as a relatively traditional physicist doing nuclear and particle physics.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And now he's a professor at Michigan State, not only in physics, but also in, I think, molecular biology department.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But he studies evolution and life, including artificial life.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And he has a new book out called The Evolution of Biological Information, How Evolution Creates Complexity from Viruses to Brains.

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So I'm going to use this as an excuse to really get clear on what is this information theory stuff.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I mean, by the way, the book is a little technical.

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm not going to advocate it for people who don't like equations.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There are some equations there, but the equations are quite mild.

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You know, if you're the kind of person who doesn't read equations every day, but doesn't blanch when you see one, it might be a good book to pick up.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And we're going to talk about what information theory is in general and specifically how biologists or people who care about biology, even if they're physicists, are going to use information theory to better understand things like evolution

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and even the origin of life.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I would say that 75 years later, the idea of information theory we got from Claude Shannon is still not settled in.

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You know, we're still working through the basic implications of this.

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So it's very exciting.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's fun.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a new lens with which to look at the world in a detailed way.

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And, you know, that's all we like to do here at the Mindscape Podcast.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So let's go.

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Chris Hadami, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Glad to be here.

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You know, let's start with this idea of information theory.

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's always going to be a challenge when you have an idea like information theory that uses a natural language word that people are familiar with, right?

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Information.

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
They think they know what information is, but now we have math behind it.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We've talked about information theory a lot on the podcast without ever just taking a breath and saying what it is.

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So do you have a best way, a favorite way of explaining information theory to the person on the street?

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I do.

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's actually strange that in this case, the mathematical understanding of the word information is actually very similar or very close to our understanding,

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
generally speaking, in our normal, you know, everyday usage.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So to really define information mathematically or even in words, we can just say that information is that which allows someone who has that information to make predictions with accuracy better than chance.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Right?

72
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So there's a system that I know something about it.

73
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And then that means I can actually predict some of its states.

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
For example, you know, where I can find coffee with accuracy better than chance.

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If I would be just randomly go somewhere, well, I would most likely not end up in a coffee place.

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But if I have information, that means I can actually say, hey, I have to go to this particular place.

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And that's how we understand it normally in our everyday language.

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And it is also exactly how it is defined mathematically.

79
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Mathematically, information is that which is used to make predictions, but it has to be better than chance to be information.

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Otherwise, it's just a guess, right?

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And so because making predictions with accuracy better than chance is really powerful, that means it's also powerful in biology.

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But of course, it's also powerful, let's say in the stock market.

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
If I have inside information, I can get rich using information because I can make predictions about, for example, the stock price was accuracy better than chance.

84
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And Shannon, when he defined this concept in 1948, he defined it precisely that way, even though he didn't use exactly those words.

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And as a consequence, there's a lot of misunderstanding about what information really is.

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's often confounded with entropy, which is in a sense the absolute opposite of information.

87
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Namely, it is about what we don't know.

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And so if you then confound information and entropy, then you're going to get a lot of misunderstandings.

89
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But didn't, I completely agree with you, by the way, but didn't Shannon himself do that?

90
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I mean, didn't he use the word information, like maximal information for him in a code or an alphabet is maximum entropy, right, when every symbol is equally likely?

91
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You are right. He has done that.

92
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I should say not so much in his original article, but you know, there was a book written or co-written, but I forgot it's Shannon and Macmillan or something, Shannon and Weaver.

93
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
In particular, in the book Shannon and Weaver, the words entropy and information get mixed up.

94
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And I have a suspicion that this was mostly Weaver doing that.

95
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I would have to actually look at the original article if Shannon himself does that, because in a sense, you know, he should know better.

96
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Just because I saw so much of the confounding between entropy and information, I felt compelled to just simply write an article called What is Information?

97
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah.

98
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Which this main purpose was to say, Hey guys, you know, you have to be careful. One is not the other.

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
No, that's great.

100
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But I do sometimes wonder, you know, I agree with everything you just said, and I wonder if it's just my physics training.

101
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Because to me, thinking like Boltzmann would have thought, a low entropy state, if you tell me that you're in a low entry macro state, all the molecules are in one corner of the room, you've given me a lot of information, right?

102
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Low entropy is a lot of information, and that makes perfect sense to me.

103
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's right. Low entropy is a lot of information. You can think of information as simply a difference between two entropies, namely the maximum entropy and the actual entropy.

104
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay, good.

105
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So that's why when your actual entropy is low, then your information is high, because it's this difference.

106
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And the fact that it's a difference, by the way, is a fundamentally important thing.

107
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Namely, entropy itself, in a sense, has no real meaning or existence, just like energy doesn't have in physics.

108
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Only differences of entropy have a meaning, just like in physics, only differences between energies have any real life effect.

109
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And so the fact that it's a difference is important, but it's important that the first term is a maximum entropy, like how much there is to know about the system.

110
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And if you forget about that, then your information is just minus entropy, or what a bunch of people have called negentropy, right?

111
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Which is nonsense. It's forgetting the first term, which is the maximum entropy, so that this thing, which is information, is always positive.

112
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So basically, in this way of talking, you would say, when I have some configuration, and I have some statistical knowledge about it,

113
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I can divide the state into sort of the entropy part, which I don't understand very well, and the information part, which specifies something.

114
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Right, or very simply speaking, for every system, write down or understand what is the maximum uncertainty that you have.

115
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's just really counting the number of degrees of freedom that there are, and then taking the log of that, right?

116
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And then you ask yourself, well, how much entropy do I actually have?

117
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
In other words, do I have a probability distribution that is different than the maximum entropy distribution?

118
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And if the answer is yes, then that means already you know something.

119
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That means that the actual distribution has a lower entropy, and then you have some information.

120
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
However, you may not know at that point exactly what this information is about.

121
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Okay.

122
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
In a gas, of course, very often you do.

123
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Just like you said, when you have a bunch of molecules in a corner, well, then you have information about where these molecules are.

124
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Of course, if you allow the molecules to disappear or to sort of like do their thing,

125
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
what happens is that your knowledge about the positions of the molecules starts decreasing.

126
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And at the same time, of course, the actual entropy starts increasing.

127
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That is what we call the second law of thermodynamics.

128
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's literally just the loss of information that you have.

129
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And of course, during that equilibration phase, the system is returning to its equilibrium, but it's actually at its equilibrium.

130
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So in other words, whenever you have information, it gives you a hint that the system is not at equilibrium.

131
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It is away from equilibrium, and the amount of information is in fact characterizing how far away from equilibrium you are.

132
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So when I'm speaking to you right now, you're actually in an ordered state, a very ordered state,

133
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
as far as the molecules are concerned.

134
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And I can tell you in a sense how much ordered state there is.

135
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's about half a million bits.

136
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Why?

137
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Because in fact, that is the amount of information that's actually stored in your genome.

138
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Ah, okay.

139
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
This is probably going to be leaping ahead, but what about like the particular configuration of my body?

140
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Certainly that is more than half a million bits.

141
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Um, that's a good question, but since in fact that organization is done by the half a million bits,

142
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
my suspicion is that in fact that must be the same, because how else would you achieve this ordered state?

143
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So this is actually an interesting question.

144
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If I just sit down and think a little bit, my intuition is that even though it seems that, you know,

145
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
that would be more than half a million bits, that in fact it is not.

146
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
However, it's such a good question that I cannot actually tell you right now why.

147
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Good final exam question for the next time you teach a course based on your book.

148
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah, that's actually a good point.

149
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I mean, if I, you know, after this interview, I'll try to sit down and figure this out.

150
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Okay, that's a good one.

151
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And it's simply because the information cannot be anywhere else.

152
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The fact that you ordered, the only thing that makes that possible is the information in your genome.

153
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And as a consequence, in a sense, mathematically, it has to be like that,

154
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
even though just like you said, that seems low.

155
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It does seem low.

156
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I like to think I can make more information than that.

157
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I mean, certainly in my brain, there are neurons with certain weights and things like that,

158
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and there's probably more than half a million bits there.

159
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Right, okay.

160
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Now, you're making another point.

161
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Of course, there's information that you have acquired during your lifetime that is not being counted.

162
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That is definitely there.

163
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Good.

164
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,000
However, if you take, let's say a brain, before it learns something, let's say a baby brain,

165
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
physically speaking, of course, there are differences.

166
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah, but I mean, like the information is stored in the weights of the neurons in the brain in some way.

167
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So, definitely, that is in addition.

168
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
However, that, of course, does not give you your physical appearance.

169
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It doesn't change the organization of the rest of your body.

170
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's an interesting train of thought, but no doubt.

171
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Either a final exam question or a paper to be written here, I think, about this.

172
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
How many bits am I?

173
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But okay, something very interesting and important happened just now in your discussion of information,

174
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
because I think that if you asked people on the street, do you have information about where your car keys are?

175
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
They would think about that as a yes-no question.

176
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I know where they are or I don't.

177
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And you've sneaked in the idea of a probability distribution, which is kind of central here.

178
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Right.

179
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So, how does that come in?

180
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
How central is probability to information theory?

181
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, actually, it is the central aspect of it.

182
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So, before you can really understand information theory, you should have a very basic course in probability statistics.

183
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Now, to tell you the truth, not everybody who is working in the field did have that, and that shows.

184
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But simply because the concept of probability, actually, to fully understand it,

185
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
is not as simple as just writing down, you know, p sub i or some distribution, you know.

186
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What a probability is, and I know you're familiar with this because you've thought about this in the context of quantum mechanics for a long time,

187
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
is, you know, not immediately trivial.

188
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Some people think, oh, a probability exists by itself.

189
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Other people say, no, a probability is just simply something that you can estimate, but that itself, in a sense, really doesn't exist.

190
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But the idea of prediction, of course, is central to that.

191
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So, when you're asking yourself, can I predict with accuracy better than chance,

192
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
then you have to, in a sense, have an idea of, well, what is the chance prediction here?

193
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And for that, in a sense, you need a prior, you need an assumption about what is expected.

194
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Right.

195
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And so, if you're going to talk about a probability distribution, then you're really talking about, what am I expecting?

196
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So, let's go to the example of the car keys.

197
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Right.

198
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So, generally speaking, we could say, okay, here's a person who's looking for their car keys.

199
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
They know, with 90% of the chance, from past experience, right, we're setting up the priors now.

200
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
From past experience, 90% of the time, it's in my pocket.

201
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Right.

202
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But if it's not in my pocket, it could be in 10 different places.

203
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah.

204
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Right.

205
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
If that is the case, you can set up, just set up the probability distribution for you,

206
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
because that means that there are 11 possible places that the keys could be in.

207
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Right.

208
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And the chance to find it in your pocket is 10%, sorry, 90%.

209
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And then, in each of the 10 other places, the chance to find it is 1 out of 100.

210
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Right.

211
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yeah.

212
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So, now, I've set the expectation.

213
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Before, I've done any experiment.

214
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Right.

215
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Now, I'm doing an experiment.

216
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And of course, what experiment are you going to be doing?

217
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You're going to check your pocket.

218
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
First, yes.

219
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Right.

220
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And now, what happens is that this measurement is going to give you information.

221
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Right.

222
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And in fact, we call this, you know, this outcome of this measurement, it's called a

223
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
specific information.

224
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Okay.

225
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's a specific information, because I can do 11 measurements.

226
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And the average of the outcomes of that, that's actually the information gained from the measurement

227
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
of the locations.

228
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,680
The interesting thing here is that if I don't find the key in my pocket, then I have a problem.

229
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,000
Now, it could be in 10 different places.

230
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,400
So, it turns out that the specific information of this measurement, namely that the key is

231
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
not in your pocket, is negative.

232
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah.

233
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's a negative specific information, even though the average information gained from

234
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,760
the car key searching measurement is still positive.

235
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,440
Because you're now less sure of where the keys are than you are before.

236
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
Exactly.

237
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,440
Exactly.

238
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,000
And it's like, oh my God, it's like, I thought I knew.

239
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
See, that's the thing.

240
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah.

241
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
I thought I knew means that's the priors.

242
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,440
From the priors, you had a pretty good idea.

243
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,960
Then you make your measurement and you go like, oh my God, now I don't know anything.

244
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,960
And this is mathematically, in fact, it's an exercise in my book in chapter three.

245
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,080
Very good.

246
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,760
And let me just raise, again, I'm super on your side, but it's my job to, you know,

247
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,600
play the devil's advocate sometimes.

248
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,720
Don't worry about this way of thinking about information because it sounds a little subjective.

249
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,040
It's not out there in the world.

250
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:38,000
You're talking about information as an ability for some agent to make predictions, right?

251
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,080
Is it truly objective or is it only relative to the capacities of some thinking being?

252
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,320
So you're asking, of course, the most important question about information.

253
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,640
And the answer is information is contextual always.

254
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,120
It is never absolute.

255
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,240
Now I'm going to give you a great example that will get you, you know, to think about

256
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
this.

257
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,880
Suppose you are a virus and you are, in fact, reaching a wreaking havoc inside of a patient,

258
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
right?

259
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,400
You are replicating fast.

260
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,200
Everything is going good for you, right?

261
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,680
Let's imagine your mutation rate is actually kind of low so you don't change much while.

262
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,280
So the information that you have about doing your job is doing its job, right?

263
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,840
Now the patient takes an antiviral, right?

264
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,600
The patient takes an antiviral and suddenly this virus goes like, man, you know, this

265
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,680
replicating thing is now really, really, really hard, right?

266
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,080
And what you can now do is you can calculate the information about how to do this job and

267
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,800
it has changed dramatically.

268
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:47,040
In fact, now the virus does not have this amount of information about doing its job anymore.

269
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,760
But the sequence is the same.

270
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,640
How can a sequence is the same?

271
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,680
Earlier I have lots of information and then have very little information.

272
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:02,720
The answer is because the context changed because that what you have information about has changed.

273
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,800
So what was the environment yesterday, isn't the environment today?

274
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,760
You have information about yesterday's world, not about today's world.

275
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,840
And that is the important thing.

276
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,400
Information is completely contextual.

277
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,840
The same sequence evaluated in different environments will have different information

278
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,120
and therefore different meaning.

279
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,120
A lot of times people think like, oh, information theory can't deal with meaning.

280
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,680
It's absolutely untrue.

281
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:35,440
My molecular sequence means something here on earth, actually, you know, above the surface

282
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,000
of the water, for example.

283
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,320
You put me underwater and my sequence is making wrong predictions, right?

284
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,600
About how to breathe, no underwater, that thing doesn't work.

285
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,320
Your fitness is zero.

286
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:55,440
I will have zero offspring underwater unless I actually, you know, am in a submarine or

287
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,560
something like that where I'm taking the environment with me, right?

288
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,400
Then I could still have information.

289
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:09,560
So very, you know, very nearly so in biology, information and fitness are exchangeable.

290
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,960
You have high information about how to do something, how to survive in the environment

291
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,880
means having high fitness.

292
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,360
They are related.

293
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,040
In fact, they are mathematically related and we don't have to talk about what that relationship

294
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,280
is, but you can read about it in my book.

295
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,120
So in other words, what happened in evolution is that fitness and information are essentially

296
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,600
intertwined.

297
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,880
They are almost the same thing.

298
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,520
And so the way you are increasing your fitness is you're increasing the information about

299
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,960
how to live in that environment.

300
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,160
I guess I was trying to make a similar point to what you just said in my book, The Big

301
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Picture.

302
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,320
I mentioned the Voynich manuscript, right?

303
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,960
This wonderful old book full of symbols and nobody knows whether it's nonsense or whether

304
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
it refers to something.

305
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,720
And so I asked the question, how much information is there in the Voynich manuscript?

306
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,680
How would you answer that question?

307
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,480
The answer is unless we know what the information is about, this is entropy for us.

308
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:14,560
So if you have text or any data, that is not information.

309
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:21,760
In fact, it is literally just entropy in the sense that you are talking about, oh, it represents

310
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,680
an example of another similar set of things.

311
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,160
And so you're setting up your hypothetical ensemble so that you can talk about an entropy.

312
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:36,640
The moment that you know what things you can predict with it, then it becomes information.

313
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,960
If you do not know this, the same piece of information or the same text, should I say,

314
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,160
the same symbolic sequence would just be entropy to you.

315
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,400
In other words, just to repeat it, because information is that which allows you to make

316
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,260
predictions about a particular system with accuracy better than chance.

317
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,080
If you don't know what this is, it's not information.

318
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:05,400
Another example is somebody hands you a subway chart, and he goes like, well, that's fantastic,

319
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,640
except I don't know which city this is.

320
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,200
Well then it's useless to you.

321
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,320
And if it's useless, so in other words, useless information is entropy.

322
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Got it.

323
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,160
The other idea at the technical level that I have found super important in my tiny little

324
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,600
forays into information theory is mutual information.

325
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,720
I love this concept, and it never gets explained in a popular level, so maybe you can give

326
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
us a shot.

327
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
Right.

328
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,320
So first of all, information is really a mutual entropy.

329
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,040
It's a shared entropy.

330
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:43,880
So in other words, the reason why me, if I have information, can make predictions about

331
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,440
another system is because, in a sense, we have certain correlations.

332
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:54,640
We know something about each other, and so information, even though I showed you earlier

333
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,360
that it's really a difference of entropy, you can also think of it as a shared entropy.

334
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,200
The mathematics to show that this is one and the same thing, we're not going to go into.

335
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:09,920
Just trust me here that if you think about a Venn diagram about a system and the one

336
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,840
who's trying to measure the system, the intersection of that Venn diagram, that's the information

337
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,760
that the measurement device has about the system.

338
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,360
That's a shared entropy.

339
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,360
That shared entropy is, of course, the information.

340
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:31,000
So when people say mutual information, they're meaning mutual, mutual entropy.

341
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,240
So in fact, nobody should be using that word.

342
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,920
In my book, for example, when I have an index where it says mutual information, I say C

343
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
information.

344
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
Fair enough.

345
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:50,040
But it's just that for the reason that we talked about earlier that people are using

346
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:56,880
information and entropy synonymously, they have taken mutual entropy, which is an information,

347
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,560
and called that mutual information.

348
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,000
But in principle, they're one and the same thing.

349
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,520
We just should call it information.

350
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,400
It is that that correlates the two systems.

351
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,720
Because remember, we always have to talk about two systems when we are talking about information.

352
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,760
One that makes the prediction and one that is being predicted.

353
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,880
And what is shared, the shared correlation between them.

354
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,400
In other words, what's not random between them, that is information.

355
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Good.

356
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,240
So now we have a pretty firm grounding on information theory.

357
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,600
We can move on to applying it to biology, which is what your book is all about.

358
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,520
But let me just first ask the background question.

359
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:47,200
How popular in biology is this task of thinking about things in terms of information theory?

360
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,360
Is it everyone does it or no one does it?

361
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,240
Or it is the new hotness and it's sweeping the field?

362
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,720
Let me put it this way.

363
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:01,040
If this was something that everybody does, I wouldn't have had to write this book.

364
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:06,920
This book really came out of a frustration that I have this tool.

365
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:13,120
I see how valuable it is to understand essentially anything in biology and nobody is using it.

366
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,560
When I say nobody, that's not quite true.

367
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,240
There are a few people who do.

368
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,000
Bill Bialek in Princeton, for example, has certainly done this and he does know how to

369
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,880
do this.

370
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:30,560
There's a few people often, in fact, in Bill Bialek's orbit who have looked at information

371
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:37,080
transmission in cells, for example, in gene regulation and calculated the channel capacity

372
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,120
of a cellular communication channel and did this very well.

373
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,320
And I, in fact, have these examples in my book.

374
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,600
But it is woefully underrepresented.

375
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:55,440
There is something about information theory that presents a barrier, a hurdle in a sense

376
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,440
to acceptance.

377
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,240
I only have a vague memory of when I first learned about information theory, which was

378
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:10,760
in fact at Caltech when a postdoc that was placed into my office actually first started

379
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,840
explaining classical information theory to me because we were actually working in quantum

380
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
information.

381
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,060
And it was like, well, let's do the classical theory first.

382
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:24,200
And I remember when he was first writing these formulas on the board, which has these vertical

383
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,160
bars and these columns and semicolons, thinking, like, what is this?

384
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,080
This is not my mathematics.

385
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,120
My mathematics, there's integrals, there's differentials, you know, there are matrices.

386
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,440
And now I'm seeing these weird symbols and my brain doesn't really understand them.

387
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,720
In a sense, from the cognitive science perspective, is you don't have these representations that

388
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,480
allow you to recognize these things and they have to build over time.

389
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,320
And I think this barrier that I felt at the time and was like, oh, there's all these different

390
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,320
entropies, there's a mutual, there's a shared, a conditional, and you were like, how am I

391
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,200
going to keep them apart?

392
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,200
And you have to get used to them just like you got used to integrals and differentials

393
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,320
and things like that.

394
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:17,560
If I ask anyone who had algebra and calculus, it's like, would you ever confound differentials

395
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
with integrals?

396
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,600
And it goes like, of course not, right?

397
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,120
Yes, because you got used to this stuff, right?

398
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,520
So there seems to be this barrier and in particular, very often information theory is perceived

399
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,360
as being an engineering discipline, right?

400
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,680
And they're going like, well, the engineers, you know, like, well, they want to do error-correcting

401
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,240
codes and like, what does this have to do with biology?

402
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,120
In fact, I've seen this in print saying like, you know, the engineering discipline of information

403
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,360
theory has nothing to say about biology because these are very different things.

404
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,160
It's like saying, well, information theory can't apply to physics when in fact we do

405
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,720
know very well that it does.

406
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,560
In fact, I just explained the second law of thermodynamics in terms of information theory.

407
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,720
And so this barrier is very palpable.

408
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,840
So if somebody is an established scientist and you tell them, well, you know what, you

409
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,400
should really be using information theory, they're not going to do it.

410
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,680
They're entrenched in their ways.

411
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:20,840
And they usually are not receptive to learning in a sense a whole new bag of tricks, right?

412
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,680
It is not that different from what happened in black hole physics where they constantly

413
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,560
talk about information loss in black holes and not a single paper is trying to calculate

414
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,920
the capacity of the black hole channel, except of course, me.

415
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:40,000
That's because, you know, because I know information theory, but, you know, these people

416
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,640
have been working in this area for 30 years and not picked up a single book or article

417
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,040
on information theory.

418
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,360
Again, there's this barrier, they're saying like, this concept is different from the concept

419
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,360
I need.

420
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,040
And the answer is no, it is the same concept.

421
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,200
You know, I'm a little bit sympathetic because I know that when I read papers in economics,

422
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:07,000
they have this habit of denoting variables in equations by words rather than by single

423
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
letters.

424
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,920
And it's so trivial and silly, but it truly rubs me the wrong way and I have trouble

425
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,720
wrapping my brain around it.

426
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:22,280
No, I fully agree with you because that is not how we write equations, right?

427
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:30,040
You know, I still almost vividly remember this aversion where I'm like, this is not

428
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
my thing, right?

429
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,760
But you have to power through this, right?

430
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,840
And in my lab, everybody gets, you know, the basic, you know, introduction to information

431
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
theory.

432
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,000
And then once you've sort of internalized it, you cannot see the world except through

433
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,640
that lens of information theory.

434
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,480
It's like the hammer that makes everything look like a nail, right?

435
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,680
And in my book, in fact, I sort of co-op the famous saying which we all know in biology

436
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,480
which says nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution, which certainly

437
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
is true.

438
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,840
But I basically have changed it around to say nothing in biology makes sense except

439
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,840
in the light of information.

440
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,640
Then of course, information is that which evolves, really.

441
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,480
I mean, people would say, well, organisms involve, no, what evolves actually is information.

442
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,680
The information is what is essential in an organism.

443
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,880
The organism itself isn't really that essential in the sense it's replaceable, right?

444
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,880
If we have offspring, they carry most of the information with them.

445
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:36,320
But only the encoded information, of course, what we think as specific to ourselves is

446
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,080
of course the stuff in our brain that we have talked about about 25 minutes earlier.

447
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,160
The information that we acquired over a lifetime is, of course, making us special, right?

448
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:50,360
The information in your genome does not make you special, but it is what makes you alive.

449
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:57,840
So is it fair to think of Charles Darwin as an early information theorist?

450
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:07,640
Well, I would say no, simply because he didn't really, and he had no way of understanding

451
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:15,440
that the basis of inheritance was really the replication of information.

452
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,880
He didn't even know how any of the stuff was encoded because that was discovered in 1958.

453
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,760
Or we should say that John von Neumann kind of figured it out a little bit earlier when

454
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:36,680
he came up with this theory of self-replicating machines, which essentially could have told

455
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:42,640
Watson and Crick where to look for stored information.

456
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,480
So Darwin did not know that, but he had, via his sleuthing, in a sense, going on boats

457
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,680
and looking at stuff, figured out, hey, there's variation going on, there's selection going

458
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,800
on, and there's inheritance going on.

459
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,920
The fact that these three things are properties of information, so inheritance being the replication

460
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,640
of information, variance being the mutation of information, the changing of information,

461
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,280
and selection is the meaning of information.

462
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,640
In other words, those pieces of information that have a lot of information are fitter

463
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,840
and therefore will have more offspring, and therefore, in fact, because I told you about

464
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:26,920
the relationship between information and fitness, then the meaning of information is selection.

465
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:33,160
So we can think of the entire evolutionary process in terms of what happens to information,

466
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,520
and we should, in fact.

467
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,240
But Darwin did not think that way, even though, of course, I haven't read all of his works,

468
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,720
even though many of them are in my little natural history collection in my bookshelf,

469
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,880
but they are big, big tomes.

470
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:53,760
I mean, one of the things that is so astonishing to me is that Darwin had, in his head, essentially

471
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,080
had 12 book treaties and then was forced to publish the abstract of it as the first book,

472
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:06,200
which is now the origin of species, but he had so much more to say, and then over the

473
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,280
rest of his life, in fact, said many of these things.

474
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:16,000
And of course, most of those things, you know, like about worms and about plants and things

475
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
like that.

476
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Barnacles.

477
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,160
We don't usually read.

478
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:29,240
But in there, if you study those volumes maybe with more attention to the concept of information,

479
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:38,040
in the idea that what makes these plants how they are, in fact, is making predictions.

480
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,080
But he's, in fact, a good example.

481
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:48,240
Darwin himself, at some point, noticed a particular orchid which had a very, very long neck, you

482
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,640
know, which he knew had to be pollinated, right?

483
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:59,240
And it was about 30 centimeters over, you know, what is that, and it's about a foot,

484
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,240
right?

485
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
Yeah.

486
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,800
Or even longer, in fact.

487
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,520
But basically he said, now I will make a prediction.

488
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,800
I will predict that there is a pollinated exists with a proboscis or a nose, you know,

489
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,840
what they're using for, which is about that length, right?

490
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:22,600
And even though he didn't live to see that prediction come true, in fact, his competitor

491
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,880
in the evolutionary field that almost scooped him, he, in fact, basically said, oh, and

492
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,840
I'm going to tell you that this must be a Sphinx moth.

493
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,680
And in fact, they later found it after Darwin died.

494
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,480
And that was exactly, you know, as he had predicted it.

495
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:43,760
So to some extent, you know, he knew that evolution, this idea, the theory of evolution

496
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,080
is a predictive theory, right?

497
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:51,420
Even though he didn't think of it in terms of information, theoretical terms.

498
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,600
So yeah, a typical evolutionary biologist would try to explain things in terms of there's

499
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:01,800
a population with certain traits, and there's a fitness landscape, and they, you know, move

500
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,840
towards peaks of the fitness landscape.

501
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:08,280
And so you're not undermining that, you're just saying that a useful way of thinking

502
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,360
about fitness is having the information to successfully predict what's going to happen

503
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,960
in your environment, and therefore survive.

504
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
That's right.

505
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,120
I don't undermine any of the standard population genetics.

506
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:25,440
It is really just a very different way of understanding what fitness is.

507
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,280
You know, after all, fitness, the way, you know, it is not the same word as we talk about

508
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,840
physical fitness, of course, right?

509
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,280
Fitness in biology means fitting your environment well, right?

510
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,200
It means being adapted to your environment, which means corresponding to, right?

511
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,400
And see, we're seeing, aha, that means in a sense that your body structure, you know,

512
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,840
is predictive about what world you live in, right?

513
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:59,240
So for example, E. coli bacteria, they grow best at 37 degrees Celsius.

514
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,200
Well, that's weird, isn't it?

515
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,320
Well, no, it's not weird.

516
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,800
That's the temperature of our stomach.

517
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,200
So basically, their molecular biology makes a prediction about what environment they're

518
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,680
in, namely one at 37 degrees Celsius.

519
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,640
Their prediction is off, where that means, in fact, you know, they don't have as much

520
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,840
information as they think, and they're actually not going to grow as fast, right?

521
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:30,680
So this correlation between the genome and the environment gives you the fitness because

522
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,280
it tells you, you're fitting this environment well, you're well adapted to it.

523
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,800
And that concept information is precisely that, this correlation, right?

524
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,440
And this is a very important point because it reminds us that just so people don't get

525
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,560
the wrong idea, information isn't necessarily conscious, right?

526
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,880
It's not something that you might say, you know, the information in your genome is very

527
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,600
well adapted to your environment, even though you personally might have no idea with the

528
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,680
arrangement of nucleotides in your DNA is.

529
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
That's right.

530
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,440
So obviously, you know, when we're talking about the fact that cells make predictions

531
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,440
about their environment, which they do all the time because cells have to make decisions,

532
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,440
it's not like they have a brain.

533
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,880
But to some extent, we also know that because once you understand that information is just

534
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,240
a correlation, which is a non-random correlation, because sometimes you get correlation by chance.

535
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,160
But no, we're looking for correlations that are not by chance and that are on top of that

536
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,200
being maintained, right?

537
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Because in thermodynamics, you might have correlations by chance, but they are going

538
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,600
to disappear very soon, right?

539
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:42,280
The genome is making sure that these correlations are being maintained so that we can continue

540
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,960
using, you know, what we have to make predictions about the environment.

541
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:53,080
If you would be loosening this continuous maintenance, then information would go away

542
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,680
and we call that death.

543
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,680
Is that what we call death?

544
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
Good.

545
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
Now that we know.

546
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:04,160
But this does bring us to a very fun point you make in the book is that we can think of

547
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,960
evolution as a kind of Maxwell's demon and maybe be fun to explain what Maxwell's demon

548
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,680
is, not everyone knows, and what it has to do with evolution.

549
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,680
Right.

550
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,560
So that's a good point and thank you for leading me into that because it's one of my favorite

551
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,160
parts of the book, actually.

552
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:30,000
So Maxwell's demon, let's not talk about why this sort of devil was invented, but let's

553
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,680
focus on what he does.

554
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:39,120
So the Maxwell's demon basically is sitting at the intersection of two, let's say, boxes

555
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,760
and there's a little window inside of the box.

556
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,680
And now both boxes have gas in them, gas molecules who have different speeds, you know, by in

557
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:53,160
fact described by the Maxwell distribution, right?

558
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:58,800
Turns out that and now imagine that this demon who sits there, he operates sort of the door

559
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,120
between the two, the two boxes.

560
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,800
And he also has a measurement device that he uses in order to measure the speed of a

561
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:12,040
molecule, for example, one that is about to go through the through the through the door.

562
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,960
And then he goes like, OK, if this is a fast molecule, I'm going to let it go through.

563
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,760
But if it's a slow molecule, I'm going to shut the door and so that it is in fact going

564
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,000
to be reflected.

565
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,160
If he does that a lot, he's going to have one half of the two boxes, I mean, or should

566
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,120
say the left box as opposed to the right box, with lots of fast molecules.

567
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,840
And the other one will be, you know, stuck with all the slow molecules.

568
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:42,280
That is in violation, in apparent violation, I should say, of the second law of thermodynamics,

569
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:48,280
which basically says no, that can't happen, namely the formation of a non-equilibrium

570
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,200
situation from an equilibrium.

571
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:58,080
So mathematically, it looks like what the demon has achieved is, in fact, creating order

572
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,720
or violating the second law of thermodynamics.

573
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:08,720
The fact that he didn't do such a thing was, in fact, proven mathematically and fully correctly

574
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:19,880
a later by Rolf Landauer, a Rudolf Landauer, a German-American physicist.

575
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,680
We're not going to go into how that proof goes, but it is not a violation of the second

576
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,880
law of thermodynamics.

577
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,880
But this idea that via measurement, you can actually reduce entropy is, of course, a

578
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,880
very common one, because measurements give you information and information is sort of

579
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,600
the opposite of entropy.

580
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:43,280
So yeah, if you, for example, look into a room of molecules and then essentially measure

581
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,200
the speed and position of all the molecules you're looking at, you could in principle

582
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,200
achieve a lot of order because you could punch them, so to speak, with a laser and then all

583
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,000
go into one corner.

584
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,560
So in other words, measurements do allow you to decrease entropy.

585
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:03,080
Now that we have described the Maxwell demon, now let's think about the Darwin demon.

586
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:10,160
So in order to understand this, let's imagine that instead of these measurements that the

587
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,080
demon does, we're basically doing, so the molecules are now mutations.

588
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,200
So you have a genome and a mutation happens.

589
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,920
The mutation happens is completely random.

590
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,120
It could actually increase your fitness or it could decrease your fitness.

591
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:32,440
And now the demon basically says, look, I'm actually closing the door and not allowing

592
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:39,480
the decreasing fitness mutations to persist, but I'm going to keep those that actually

593
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,520
are increasing my fitness.

594
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,160
So in a sense, the organism now performs a measurement, but it turns out, of course,

595
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:55,640
that the mechanism of evolution is precisely that way, namely the deleterious mutation

596
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:01,720
will make it such that the organism carrying it doesn't have as many offspring.

597
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,720
It's less fit.

598
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,720
And as a consequence, its frequency in the population will go down, or else even if it's

599
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:15,240
a lethal mutation will disappear, whereas the beneficial mutations will in fact be enhanced.

600
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:21,860
So because the beneficial mutations create order, because there's now a type that increases

601
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:28,600
in frequency, maybe even very fast at the detriment of all of the other sequences where

602
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,440
that creates order in the population.

603
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,440
And it's essentially because you learn something about the environment.

604
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,480
You have extracted information about the environment by having this measurement of the environment.

605
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,320
So in other words, these mutations that are being kept, they are measurements of the environment.

606
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,280
It's like, ah, 37 degrees Celsius.

607
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:54,920
Okay, so let's adjust our genome in such a way that we grow well at 37 degrees Celsius.

608
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,200
Whereas the deleterious mutations, of course, are misinformation, and they reduce your

609
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,560
fitness and as a consequence, they're thrown out of the window.

610
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,960
That's the Maxwell-Diemann closing the door on them.

611
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:14,200
And what that means is that, well, if this is a continuous process, then it should lead

612
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:23,080
to a constant increase of information inside of an organism over time as evolution proceeds.

613
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:29,360
And therefore, we can actually formulate this as a law, namely the law of increasing information

614
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:36,480
in evolution that actually predicts that if you start out with a low information

615
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:43,280
beginning sequence, that over time, the information must increase, but not all the time.

616
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,960
For example, if the environment changes, well, we already discussed that,

617
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,600
then your information drops, right?

618
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,320
And you have to sort of relearn things, right?

619
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,640
There are other ways in which information can get lost.

620
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,400
For example, recombination can actually destroy information, right?

621
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,160
It can also lead to a good thing.

622
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:10,400
So this natural demon, this Darwin-Diemann, is not perfect in a sense.

623
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,200
It's leaky.

624
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:17,440
It sometimes makes wrong decisions where information can actually go down instead of up, right?

625
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:23,200
But overall, on average, this theory of evolution predicts that the amount of information

626
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,840
that is stored in a population of genomes has to be going up.

627
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:33,360
And that is very interesting because we've been searching for a way to understand the

628
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:39,280
bio-complexity that we are seeing around us and asking, how on earth is all of this possible?

629
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,360
And can I understand if one organism is more complex than another?

630
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,160
And this idea of complexity, of course, is difficult to put in mathematics.

631
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,320
But in fact, it turns out that complexity is literally just information.

632
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,960
In other words, complexity is just a proxy for information.

633
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,520
Why?

634
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,920
Complexity essentially is stuff that is complicated but helps you do something interesting, right?

635
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,520
We don't associate complexity with something that is just structurally interesting,

636
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,760
but actually doesn't do anything, right?

637
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,040
What was called a spandrel by Gould and Lewinton in biology, right?

638
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,560
Something that looks very complicated.

639
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,920
Once we understand it, it's actually just, let's say an icicle.

640
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,840
Oh, it's not really that complex.

641
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,680
But there are really complex things, for example, our brains, right?

642
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:35,520
But that is in fact reflected by the information necessary to make it, right?

643
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:42,480
So it turns out, therefore, that information is really the correct way of measuring complexity.

644
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:49,280
And therefore, the question of is complexity increasing in evolution is simply answered

645
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,800
as a yes, as long as you understand that complexity is really information.

646
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,360
And the natural demon is responsible for that law of increasing information.

647
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,080
Good, because naively, we might look at an organism and try to figure out,

648
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,440
oh, that looks complicated.

649
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,560
That looks pretty simple.

650
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,640
And we wonder why all this complexity has grown.

651
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,200
But you're saying that that's just a pale reflection of what's really going on underneath the hood.

652
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,880
That's right.

653
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,160
But it's almost like saying, if I look at a sequence, right?

654
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:23,280
Somebody's genome or some animal's genome or a bacterial genome, I can't immediately see,

655
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,880
well, this is information.

656
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,160
This is not information.

657
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,120
Here's some information.

658
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,840
Is it like, they look the same, right?

659
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,880
So we need to figure out how they're making predictions.

660
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,280
Or in other words, how are they functioning in the world?

661
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,840
So if you have something that looks complex, then you have to ask yourself,

662
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:45,440
let's observe this thing and see whether what looks such an intricate mechanism

663
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,200
is in fact necessary for survival.

664
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:55,280
Or whether it is just something that is a consequence of something else, right?

665
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,760
We see sometimes like these complex display behaviors in animals.

666
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,240
And they are obviously important in mating.

667
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,080
And if you would remove them, in fact, your fitness drops to zero

668
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,840
because you don't get to mate, zero offspring, zero fitness, right?

669
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,640
But then there are other things that are in a sense just

670
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,680
no, they're not important for the actual survival.

671
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,880
You would take them away and it doesn't change the fitness.

672
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,320
It's like saying, you're removing a section of the genomic code,

673
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,520
but if that is not predictive evidence, if it does not carry any information,

674
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,560
it is not important for fitness.

675
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,840
You can take it away.

676
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,760
And we don't, so to get, if I understood what you said correctly,

677
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,560
we don't right now have a clear cut way of looking at a genome and saying,

678
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,640
this part contains information, this part doesn't.

679
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:45,520
We actually do, but only if we're looking at many of them, not a single one, right?

680
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:53,680
If I have a hundred versions of a gene, there are regions in it

681
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,520
that are unimportant for survival.

682
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,200
If I then make an alignment of them, then I can recognize, oh, look,

683
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,920
this changes all the time at this position.

684
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,200
Clearly, that doesn't mean anything because you can just willy-nilly change it.

685
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,520
But then you go like, oh, but look at this section.

686
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,200
It's the same everywhere.

687
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,880
The same for every organism.

688
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,080
I bet you it is because when you change it, you die.

689
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,880
And that's why I haven't seen it, right?

690
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,440
If you would make it, it would simply die.

691
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,760
And therefore, it doesn't enter your database.

692
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,080
So you have to do these multiple sequence alignment,

693
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,480
as they're called in bioinformatics.

694
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,080
And when you're looking across column by column,

695
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,040
and you see some columns being completely conserved by evolution,

696
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,400
even though evolution constantly tries to change them, right?

697
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,760
Because it's through the mutational process.

698
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,680
And then you see columns which are willy-nilly.

699
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,760
Like on the nucleotide level, you see A, Cs, Gs, and Ts with 25% frequency.

700
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,800
And you go like clearly, not information, right?

701
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,560
And so that is, in fact, the basis of the algorithm

702
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,480
that I describe in the book that allows you to measure

703
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,400
the amount of information in a sequence.

704
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,760
But if you do not have a multiple sequence alignment,

705
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,280
in other words, a bunch of examples,

706
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,240
then you cannot understand what is information,

707
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,440
because everything looks the same.

708
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,600
And this reminds me that you, of course,

709
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,400
have collaborated with your colleague Richard Lensky

710
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,920
on his long-term, who is the boss of the was,

711
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,600
of the long-term evolution experiments.

712
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,200
You've actually seen data like this.

713
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:20,720
That's right.

714
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,480
In fact, we constantly see this.

715
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,080
We see this more easily in digital life experiments

716
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,480
where we have self-replicating computer programs

717
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,160
that live inside of a computer,

718
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,240
just like the one I'm staring at right now,

719
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,840
and that you're staring at right now.

720
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,040
And there, we can extract these sequences

721
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,760
and we can look precisely where the information is.

722
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,360
And in fact, we can measure the information

723
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,200
and see as the fitness increases, the information increases.

724
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,080
It's literally, if you would be taking the log of the fitness

725
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,240
and superimpose it with the calculated information,

726
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,320
they're almost on top of each other, right?

727
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,920
Because it's the log fitness,

728
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,840
which is basically the growth rate,

729
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,240
which is, in a sense, mathematically equivalent

730
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:00,880
to information.

731
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,560
So if information is zero, your growth rate is zero, right?

732
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,200
So my own biological knowledge is not very big,

733
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,040
but I do recall understanding that the human genome

734
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,320
is not the longest out there in the ecosystem, right?

735
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,520
Is that something we understand?

736
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,360
But, so you're addressing an important question.

737
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,280
In the biological literature, it's called the C-value paradox.

738
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,480
If you just look at the length of genomes,

739
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,760
there is an amoeba out there, which has 200 times more DNA

740
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,800
than we have.

741
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,200
It's called amoeba dubia, actually.

742
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,160
So it's almost like the W in a former president.

743
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:42,720
Yeah.

744
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,280
So, you know, you can think of that as you may.

745
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,160
So clearly, genomic content isn't information, right?

746
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,160
But if you would take the genome of, let's say,

747
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,440
a thousand of these amoeba and then align it,

748
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,120
then you would see that most of the stuff

749
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,480
is completely meaningless.

750
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,160
Or else, in fact, it might not be haploid.

751
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,720
So in other words, you have 100 copies

752
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,120
of the same small piece of information.

753
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,960
And here's another thing that you need to understand

754
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,240
about information.

755
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,320
If I have one book that, let's say,

756
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,560
is predictive about certain things,

757
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,400
and then you have a copy of the book,

758
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,560
that's not twice as much information.

759
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,880
It is exactly one time as much information.

760
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,160
So if you have 100 copies because you have 100 copies

761
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,840
of your genome, like we, for example,

762
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,840
have two copies, we are deployed.

763
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,400
There's many other organisms, like in particular plants,

764
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,160
which are teraploid, you know,

765
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,080
they have 16 copies and so on.

766
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,200
So this amoeba probably has over 100 copies

767
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,240
of its own genome.

768
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,120
So in other words, clearly, this amount of DNA

769
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,760
you have divided by 100, that still wouldn't get us

770
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,920
to the three billion that we have,

771
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,080
three billion per chromosome, right?

772
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:54,880
So, yeah.

773
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,880
And it's not six billion, you know,

774
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,400
it's six billion base pairs.

775
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,640
But in fact, out of the three billion nucleotides,

776
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,040
which in a sense give you a entropy or potential

777
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,440
information of six billion bits,

778
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,320
but it's potential information,

779
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,400
which is the same thing as entropy, right?

780
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,880
Only a small fraction of this actually encodes information.

781
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,400
And from the encode project, it is probably about 8%.

782
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,560
And that's how you're getting to that number of 500 million bits,

783
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:35,520
which is about 8%, I think, of the 3.1 billion or so, right?

784
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,280
And so there are some plant genomes that are enormous

785
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,520
because of this, you know, explosion.

786
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,760
But, you know, if you have several copies,

787
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,360
and if you have in plants, for example,

788
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,760
there's lots and lots of intergenic regions,

789
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,520
which are meaningless.

790
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,600
In other words, there's no information in there.

791
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,840
Plants are sort of spectacular for that.

792
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,880
They have far more intergenic stuff than humans, for example.

793
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,960
Some of them have up to 70% intergenic stuff.

794
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,200
And this intergenic stuff is probably also riddled with transposons.

795
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,080
So literally, if you would be taking it out or mutating it,

796
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,640
it would not change what the plant does at all.

797
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,640
So there is no information encoded there.

798
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,920
So if you really want to plot just information content,

799
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,480
in fact, Eugene Coonan, who works at the NIH, he has done that.

800
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,240
In fact, his plot is in my book.

801
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,040
And you find out that, yeah, bacteria are sort of very low there.

802
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,400
And humans, as far as we can measure,

803
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,400
in fact, have the most information.

804
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,280
Mammals generally, but humans the most.

805
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,800
So this idea that humans are, in a sense,

806
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,000
the apex of complexity that some people think is sort of very self-serving,

807
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
that might not be wrong.

808
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,200
Certainly, if you take a look at it through the lens of information theory.

809
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,560
I believe that.

810
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,560
Let me, that number went by pretty quickly.

811
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,360
So I want to get it right.

812
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:59,680
8% of the human genome is information theory?

813
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,480
It's coding.

814
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,040
Yeah.

815
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:01,280
Okay.

816
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,640
And the rest is intergenic stuff or repetitive stuff.

817
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,120
In other words, it's uninformative.

818
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,400
It seems a little inefficient.

819
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:08,800
I don't know.

820
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:13,040
Well, I mean, it's because there is so much, for example,

821
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,960
if you have a gene, there are regions that are called introns,

822
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,360
which just have junk in it.

823
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,960
And they're being excised before the stuff is being translated into proteins.

824
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,240
And so there's a vast amount of that.

825
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,640
And then inside of chromosomes, there's vast regions of repetitive stuff.

826
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:38,880
Some of it might even serve structural features so that molecules can attach to it.

827
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,800
But it does not actually provide information about surviving.

828
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,320
Right.

829
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,880
So obviously, it is difficult to measure the information content

830
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:55,760
because we would have to have thousands of human genomes that you can align.

831
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,880
Now, we have, in fact, now thousands of human genomes,

832
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,120
but nobody's actually tried to do that.

833
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:11,920
And I should say that in order for a good ensemble to really be reflective of the information,

834
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,640
we needed to have a good amount of variation.

835
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:21,840
In other words, those nucleotides that are mutatable, they should have had a chance to mutate.

836
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:26,080
But because we humans have a relatively common recent ancestor,

837
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,440
there's a lot of conservation in the genome that is common through common descent.

838
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,560
Right.

839
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,520
And it looks like it might be information if I'm making such an alignment of a thousand genomes,

840
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,280
but in fact, might not be.

841
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,680
So one of the things you might want to do is you want to take a lot of African genomes

842
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,200
for this alignment because there's much more variation in the African genomes

843
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,040
because they have, in a sense, been evolving longer.

844
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,120
And their common ancestor is much, much, much earlier,

845
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,080
which is why there is so much more variation.

846
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:56,800
Right.

847
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:02,800
And that would be a much better estimate is if you take European genomes and make that alignment

848
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:08,640
because really, we're looking at like a hundred thousand years of variation,

849
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:14,320
which, given the population sizes, might not be enough to really reveal the information content.

850
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:18,640
So if you have a population that has a fairly common recent ancestor,

851
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:24,240
then even this alignment is not going to do a very good job of giving you the information.

852
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,800
But very often in proteins, single proteins, for example, or viral proteins,

853
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,720
which are evolving very quickly, you can actually measure this information.

854
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,760
And I've done this, for example, for the HIV protease, which is a 99 amino acid sequence.

855
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,680
And then C, for example, like the example with drugs that I gave you,

856
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,960
but when you introduce anti-HIV drugs in the population, you see the information dropping

857
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,320
very rapidly.

858
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:58,240
And then because we have data over time, you can see how as the virus evolves drug resistance,

859
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,400
it really learns about this new world that is being cast into.

860
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,760
And you see the information over 10 years really approaching the pre-introduction levels.

861
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:14,800
So for certain proteins and molecules, it's much easier to actually do this analysis

862
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:18,960
and measuring information than, for example, to do it for a whole genome.

863
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:26,400
In principle, it can be done, but ideally, you would do assays where you're trying to

864
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,560
mutate every nucleotide and see how it reacts.

865
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,160
And that's, of course, not feasible right now.

866
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,320
And it would be unethical, by the way, also.

867
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,680
By the way, yeah, that happens in other podcasts I do.

868
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,040
It'd be fun to do certain experiments.

869
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,080
You just can't really do it.

870
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:45,040
But one way of saying what you just said a little while ago is that the human genome

871
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,080
has not had time to equilibrate in some sense.

872
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,320
That is exactly what I say, yeah.

873
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:50,800
Good.

874
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,000
So there's plenty of unexplored variation in it.

875
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,880
Because I was going to ask, are there sections of the human genome or, for that matter,

876
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:04,400
other advanced genomes where there is some continuity over time?

877
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:10,560
So clearly, this section of the DNA is carrying information, but we don't know what it does.

878
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,480
Absolutely.

879
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:20,320
One of my favorite examples is that there are untranslated regions in the genome

880
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,040
that seem to be completely conserved.

881
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,600
And it goes like it's untranslated, which means no protein is being made.

882
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,040
Well, an RNA is actually being made.

883
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,440
So in fact, these are long stretches of RNA.

884
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,880
And what they do is they can form molecules called ribozymes.

885
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,360
And it is a fairly recent discovery that these, in fact, are actually very important

886
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,040
in understanding brain function.

887
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,680
So there are these long, non-coding RNAs.

888
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:54,160
And remember, DNA has this neutrality in the third position of a codon.

889
01:00:54,160 --> 01:01:00,400
So for many of the amino acids, when you mutate the third codon, because every amino acid is

890
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,360
encoded by a triplet, you can change it willy-nilly.

891
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,800
It doesn't change the amino acid.

892
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,800
So there should be neutrality in that position.

893
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,280
And you see this throughout the genome.

894
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:14,080
But then you have these non-coding regions where there's no neutrality whatsoever.

895
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:21,600
Well, yes, because if you translate it into an RNA, the ribozyme, there is no codon translation.

896
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,280
It's not made from amino acids.

897
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,840
So in fact, every nucleotide is important.

898
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:32,400
And that's how it comes that these vast, long, non-coding RNA regions are completely conserved,

899
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,320
which means that they carry 100% information or close to that.

900
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,160
They're not 100% conserved.

901
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:44,400
But that's because sometimes in these ribozymes, because they're folding into structures,

902
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:50,240
you can make a mutation on one nucleotide as long as you're making the complementary mutation

903
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,600
at the corresponding one.

904
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,880
But this is a fundamental discovery because it means that these ribozymes

905
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:03,280
that are super important in the survival of the organism, and in fact may explain,

906
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:10,080
so they did this study in brains of flies, that they are super important in controlling

907
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,600
mating behavior of the fly, which was previously not understood.

908
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,000
And you can't find a protein that does it.

909
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,600
Well, it's because done by these RNA sequences.

910
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,360
That's actually super interesting.

911
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,680
And I'm pretty sure I didn't know this.

912
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:30,160
So the central dogma in molecular biology is that the DNA contains information that gets

913
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:35,120
transcribed into RNA that tells the ribosome, which proteins to make.

914
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:38,000
And what you're saying is that that's not all the DNA does.

915
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,760
There's a separate function where parts of it get transcribed into RNA,

916
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,600
and then don't make proteins, they make ribozymes instead.

917
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,120
And those also play a crucial role.

918
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,040
That's absolutely right.

919
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:52,400
So whenever you hear the word dogma, then you're always going like,

920
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,720
well, okay, so I'm sure it's not really a dogma.

921
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,640
So let's actually look for the violations of it.

922
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,880
And that's always a fruitful avenue of investigation.

923
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:10,720
So yeah, in fact, the role that RNAs play in the molecular biology of the cell

924
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,080
cannot be underestimated.

925
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,000
I mean, these are highly functional molecules.

926
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,080
They modify DNA.

927
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,440
If you didn't know that, there's a whole bunch of gene editing going on,

928
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,240
certainly in single celled eukaryotes.

929
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,600
And I talk a little bit about that in my book about the tropanosomes,

930
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:36,640
a fantastic, absolutely stunning story of how these RNAs are ensuring, in a sense,

931
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:41,280
the survival of genetic information that should have died 100 million years ago, in a sense.

932
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,520
And so these molecules, they're also regulators.

933
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:51,120
So the RNA molecules, the ribozymes, which are untranslated,

934
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,960
are so functionally important that we cannot understand, really,

935
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,320
the molecular biology of the cell without their action.

936
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,040
Interesting.

937
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:03,200
And that's actually a great segue into the sort of final topic that I wanted to hit here.

938
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:07,120
It would be a shame if we didn't talk about the origin of life.

939
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:11,040
And of course, you know that there's a lot of people who put RNA front and center

940
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:15,200
in that story, but we don't know what the right story is for the origin of life.

941
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,120
So how can information theory help us here?

942
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:26,400
Right. So that's a great segue because, in fact, the current thinking is that

943
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:32,080
prior to DNA, we know that DNA and proteins cannot have been at the very origin of life

944
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:39,280
because you need proteins to, in a sense, understand how DNA is acting.

945
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,400
And you cannot understand one without the other.

946
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:48,240
So you cannot have this separation between storage material, which is DNA,

947
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:53,360
and machine, which is the proteins, in the origin.

948
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:57,760
Now, it turns out that RNAs, they can store information because really,

949
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,240
the RNA nucleotides are cousins of DNA.

950
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:06,800
They just basically have an oxygen compound more.

951
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:13,760
That's why the RNAs are called ribonucleotides and the DNA is called deoxy, namely removed

952
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,360
ribonucleotides with an oxygen removed.

953
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,960
That difference is actually very important because it affects the stability of the molecule.

954
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,640
And of course, if you're going to do information storage, you want to have a stable one,

955
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:33,120
and that's the DNA. However, the RNA molecule, which it's almost like a DNA, but can actually

956
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,520
conform in all kinds of different ways, they can play the role of a machine,

957
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,680
the ribozymes that we just talked about.

958
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:44,320
So according to the RNA world framework, you're going like,

959
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:49,360
hey, how do you have something where information and machine is one and the same,

960
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,640
and that would be the RNA world?

961
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:59,760
So in other words, self-replicating RNA molecules, like where they store information

962
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,480
and are folding into the machinery that replicates the information.

963
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,760
We, as you correctly pointed out, we don't know if that is the ancestor,

964
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,240
because the biochemists tell me that there are some fundamental problems

965
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,320
of how this whole stuff could have worked out.

966
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,520
And that's a problem in biochemistry, which I'd only likely touch upon in the book

967
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,000
because I'm certainly not an expert on that.

968
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,160
But the important thing to understand the origin of life

969
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,320
is to first understand what life is.

970
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:36,320
And what life is, is basically information, a string of information,

971
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:41,760
or a string that contains information about how to make copies of that information.

972
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,200
You might think, oh, but that's not so difficult.

973
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,880
I make copies of information all the time.

974
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,000
I have a copy machine.

975
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,080
It's like, yes, but who built the copy machine?

976
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,160
The copy machine isn't some random thing.

977
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:02,240
If you just throw a bunch of piles of metal together,

978
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,080
it's not going to form a copy machine.

979
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:09,760
In fact, it takes an enormously complex set of instructions to make that copy machine.

980
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,320
So yes, it makes copies, and it's great at doing that.

981
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:17,360
And you could, in fact, make copies of the blueprint of a copy machine.

982
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:24,400
But that copy machine isn't going to make the copy machine from that blueprint.

983
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,520
It's not. It makes copies. That's it.

984
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:34,640
But if you had a machine that is, in fact, built from information,

985
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,960
and therefore then, once it's crumpled up, in a sense, into this ribosome,

986
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,120
then makes copies of the actual information, well, that's life.

987
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,200
So life is information that copies itself.

988
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:50,560
But if you just have a little bit of information, it is not going to do that.

989
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:55,120
Because, like I said, to create a machine that can make copies of information,

990
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:58,880
you need a minimum amount. Five bits is not going to do it.

991
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,400
Maybe 100 bits is not going to do it.

992
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,480
In fact, we don't know what the smallest amount of information is

993
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,200
that has a capacity to replicate.

994
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,600
You know why? Because we also don't know what the environment is within which

995
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,760
this replication happened.

996
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,440
Because I told you that the information is really an information about the environment.

997
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,760
A string of 100 bits, that's 100 potential information.

998
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,880
But depending on the environment, it could be a lot and it could be a little.

999
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,760
We don't know a whole lot about the very early Earth,

1000
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,560
but there could be very many different environments.

1001
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:41,840
But what we do know, and I can say that unequivocally, is that there is a minimum

1002
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,160
about information and that amount of information cannot be obtained by chance

1003
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,400
under no circumstance.

1004
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,200
Okay.

1005
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:53,360
Right? Well, I should say, mathematically speaking,

1006
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:02,880
if the likelihood of finding any of these molecules would be a chance.

1007
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:11,840
However, there are in fact mechanisms that could make an avenue where information can

1008
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,640
actually gradually accumulate without a Darwinian process.

1009
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,040
This is speculation, but think of it this way.

1010
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,320
We can imagine a process where a molecule that carries no information,

1011
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:31,040
but is in fact a sequence in some alphabet.

1012
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,960
Let's imagine even it to be an RNA.

1013
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,440
We can imagine that there is a process by which it can be replicated,

1014
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,240
but in a sense passively.

1015
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,000
For example, it could be laying on a clay surface,

1016
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:50,800
and then you can basically have a process that will make sure

1017
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,920
that only complementary bases are being added.

1018
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:58,720
Then basically it becomes copied, but there's no information in it.

1019
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,880
So this copying of information or of a sequence, you're copying entropy really.

1020
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,920
But now, because the copying machinery is actually in the hardware,

1021
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:14,080
not in the software, it's this clay and it's the process of complementation.

1022
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:26,000
Now imagine that if in fact the rate of making errors in the complementarity

1023
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,320
can sort of vary.

1024
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:34,560
So it turns out that the speed of this operation of copying varies

1025
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:39,520
depending on how many errors you are making in that complementarity.

1026
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,040
So if for some reason you have something that makes this faster,

1027
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,120
well that's actually a good thing and you're going to make more of these copies,

1028
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,800
even though you might think there's no information.

1029
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:55,120
But now imagine that what makes this faster, which means makes it more accurate,

1030
01:10:55,200 --> 01:11:01,360
because you have the same thing, is actually something that is part of that information,

1031
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,040
that sort of helps and binds.

1032
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,080
Like something breaks off and then sort of goes like,

1033
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:14,720
hey, I'm using that broken-off piece to actually make that process more error-free

1034
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,160
and therefore faster.

1035
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:20,720
What just happened then is that information just seeped into the genome,

1036
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:24,880
because remember that piece that broke off is actually one of your own.

1037
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,040
And you can imagine, but so a process like that,

1038
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:31,040
that slowly but surely information about how to do the replication

1039
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,600
moves from the hardware into the software.

1040
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,440
It's a non-equilibrium process, but it is at least imaginable,

1041
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:43,600
because you have to reach this limit until there's enough information in the sequence

1042
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,520
that it autonomously replicates without the support of the hardware.

1043
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:51,840
That is my sort of imaginary view of the origin of life,

1044
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,960
but it is a hard thing because you have to reach this limit.

1045
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,640
Let's say the limit is 200 bits.

1046
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,640
Only after 200 bits can evolution take hold,

1047
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,800
which then means I can have the evolutionary process increase this amount of information

1048
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,840
to infinity, theoretically.

1049
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,240
But before you have achieved Darwinian evolution,

1050
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:17,680
any information that is in the sequence is now highly fragile.

1051
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:24,160
It is basically prone to deteriorating due to the second law of thermodynamics.

1052
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,920
So you basically have to have a process where you are constantly working against this law,

1053
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:36,720
but it is because information from the replicative machinery,

1054
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,600
that the hardware is seeping into your sequence.

1055
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,320
And if this happens fast enough, you might actually get to this point

1056
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,080
where Darwinian evolution can take place, and therefore,

1057
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,880
you separated yourself from the second law of thermodynamics.

1058
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,960
Okay, good. I actually think I understand that.

1059
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,160
Let me try to run it by you again and see if I got the right idea.

1060
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:02,640
We talked about Maxwell's demon and evolution, and that was pretty clear to me.

1061
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,680
If you just had a set of genomes and you just acted randomly on them,

1062
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,640
they would randomly walk through the space of all possible genomes,

1063
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,680
and the entropy of that distribution would go up.

1064
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,680
That's the second law of thermodynamics.

1065
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:20,400
But you're saying that selection kicks in in the case of evolution,

1066
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,920
and that basically acts like Maxwell's demon to lower the entropy

1067
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:28,560
by sort of nudging all of the genomes towards areas of higher fitness.

1068
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,880
And that's pretty darn efficient.

1069
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:36,880
And you're suggesting that maybe the origin of life was a similar mechanism,

1070
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,120
not quite the same and not quite as efficient, but something that was a little Maxwell's

1071
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:47,200
demon to allow the distribution to become lower entropy until Darwin could kick in.

1072
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,000
That's exactly right.

1073
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:57,040
If you think about this idea that if you're making fewer mistakes in the copying process,

1074
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:02,240
that the copying goes faster and you're therefore making more copies,

1075
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:05,840
that means that there is a Darwin-y mechanism at work,

1076
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,160
even though there is no self-replication.

1077
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:13,920
But there is replication, but it is replication of non-informative things,

1078
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,440
which by this mechanism, well, some of the stuff by chance

1079
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,760
happens to increase your speed of replication, well, those are being maintained.

1080
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,960
And that's this idea, well, yes, the information about to replicate

1081
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,440
is in the hardware, not in the software, but it slowly starts seeping in.

1082
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,800
Slowly or fast, it really depends on the environment that you're in.

1083
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,720
And of course, we have no glimpse of any of that.

1084
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:42,960
Because if you imagine that, you know, let's say it's actually a process that

1085
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:49,760
isn't that difficult to achieve, well, wherever it constantly keeps occurring,

1086
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,400
it would be dwarfed by any form of life that is actually there,

1087
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,400
that has perfected this for four billion years.

1088
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,840
So there are these dark smokers and like these underground,

1089
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,040
what are they called?

1090
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:09,200
This pure hydrogen, basically, these underground volcanoes almost.

1091
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,800
And there is all kinds of interesting bacterial life going on,

1092
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,800
and who knows what else goes on there.

1093
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:20,080
There are some theorists that claim that, yes, these type of environments

1094
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,760
are perfect for the origin of life.

1095
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,880
But even if it would be constantly reoccurring there,

1096
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,600
we wouldn't see it because bacteria have already colonized them.

1097
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,120
Okay, that is great.

1098
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,440
That's a very interesting set of ideas.

1099
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,520
I hope that it's followed up on.

1100
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,000
But we're near the end of the podcast, so we are allowed to think big now.

1101
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,480
And it does lead into, I guess, the last question, which is,

1102
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,320
human beings have developed capacities for manipulating information

1103
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:51,600
that didn't exist before human beings came along, right?

1104
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,440
We can not only think, but we can learn.

1105
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,080
We can teach in ways that other species don't.

1106
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:00,480
We can store information and replicate it in books and on computers and so forth.

1107
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,960
Is this analogous to the origin of life?

1108
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,680
Is this another way that information is reproducing itself?

1109
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,840
Are we seeing a phase transition to a new kind of information phase?

1110
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,880
I think you're right about that.

1111
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:24,080
I mean, just imagine the advance of being able to write down what you have learned

1112
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,520
so that other people can build upon that.

1113
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,320
That obviously, in a sense, I'm saying obviously,

1114
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,640
but maybe that's not obvious to everyone.

1115
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:38,320
But obviously, that is the magic power that we have acquired as a human species

1116
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,640
that no other species has.

1117
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:46,960
The best that other species can do is to somehow teach young generations

1118
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,120
about certain behaviors, hunting behaviors,

1119
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:53,680
or maybe even tricks that you can use with rocks and sticks and things like that.

1120
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:58,160
But to actually figure out mathematics and write it down into a book

1121
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:02,240
and then teach that to other people so that they can, for example,

1122
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:06,640
predict the orbit of a planet 100 million years from now.

1123
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:11,360
I mean, if that is not mind-boggling, then I don't know what.

1124
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:17,040
Now, if you think about it, what we call our ability

1125
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:21,280
to make predictions over long distances as far as humans are concerned,

1126
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,440
in a sense, we call that intelligence, right?

1127
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:29,440
We're making intelligent decisions so that we, in a sense, can survive better, right?

1128
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:34,240
But in fact, clearly, making predictions about what the environment is tomorrow

1129
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:37,280
is going to be an important element in my survival.

1130
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,040
It was an important element for survival for any hunting species that goes like,

1131
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:46,240
oh, I predict that this prey is going to be at this location in about 10 seconds.

1132
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:50,240
And if I can make that prediction very accurate, I will catch that prey, right?

1133
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:55,040
Now, if you think about intelligence as the temporal radius

1134
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,560
at which you can make predictions with accuracy better than chance,

1135
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,840
well, then you realize, well, bacteria make predictions all the time,

1136
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,480
but they make predictions about the next second, right?

1137
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,120
Because they're making predictions about where the nutrient is,

1138
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,840
but that could change very quickly.

1139
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:17,120
But for example, this behavior of finding food, chemotaxis,

1140
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:20,400
well, that's clearly, in a sense, an intelligent behavior in the sense

1141
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:25,200
that it makes certain predictions that are going to come true or not within a second or so.

1142
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:32,480
But other animals, for example, let's say chipmunks, they make predictions about,

1143
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:36,400
well, the next season will be such that there will be winter,

1144
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,280
so I may have to actually store some food, right?

1145
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:42,080
But we as humans, by having developed writing systems,

1146
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:46,000
by having developed mathematics, can now make predictions in time

1147
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
over a far, far longer period that are accurate better than chance.

1148
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,720
The fact that we are talking about global warming

1149
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:59,040
and how that could affect us as a species is an obvious intelligent concept

1150
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:03,440
because we have understood that if we don't do anything,

1151
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,600
then we might be in big, big trouble, right?

1152
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,280
That is making predictions in a time scale far removed

1153
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:12,560
of our day-to-day activity, right?

1154
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,360
And our brain does that, but our brain, of course, has been doing this

1155
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,640
before we had figured out writing systems, right?

1156
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:25,840
But now the conjunction of our brain, where information during a lifetime is stored,

1157
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,480
and then we can make it permanent in books,

1158
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:33,200
that is the real secret sauce to the success of this species, as far as I'm concerned.

1159
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:38,320
Well, we'll see whether or not we have the collective strength of will

1160
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,280
to actually act on these predictions that we're making or not.

1161
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,760
Yeah, that's right. Of course, that's the big political question.

1162
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,800
Unfortunately, it is a political one and not a mathematical one.

1163
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,800
The mathematical one is very obvious.

1164
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,360
Good. That helps us a little bit.

1165
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,160
Chris and Tommy, thanks so much for being on the Mindscape Podcast.

1166
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:56,240
It was really my pleasure. Thank you, Sean.
