00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello everybody and welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,080
And this is going to be one of those podcast episodes that people have been clamoring for for a long time

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,400
I get a lot of suggestions and a lot of people suggest the same guest over and over again

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,240
Sometimes I ignore the people, you know, I love the people, but I don't always agree with them other times

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,480
I think you know what the people are right and in this case

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:29,000
I think that they are so I invited Stephen Wolfram to be on the podcast now Stephen Wolfram was a physics prodigy at a

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,360
young age one of the youngest winners of the MacArthur genius grant started out in particle physics before he moved to think about

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
complexity and cellular automata

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,800
Maybe best known right now for inventing the Mathematica

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,400
programming language and analysis system as well as the underlying Wolfram

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,480
Language that was used to write it and Wolfram Alfa answer engine

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,560
I use Mathematica all the time many people in my field use Mathematica

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,280
But he's also still interested in fundamental physics a few years ago some years ago

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,200
He wrote a big book called a new kind of science where he suggested that cellular automata

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,120
Might give a clue as to different ways of thinking about all sorts of science right biology economics as well as physics

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,640
More recently he has launched what is called the Wolfram physics project

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,000
Which is simply an effort to start with almost nothing and get the fundamental laws of physics out of them

18
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,240
Now there's a lot to say about this and we don't say everything in this podcast even though it's a long one

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,740
I wanted to focus the podcast on

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,480
giving a sketch for what the main ideas are of the Wolfram physics project and

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,920
How they are not yet fully developed but might be developed going down the line

22
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,120
There were a lot of criticisms and some kudos about how he developed it sort of outside the mainstream

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:01,400
Physics research and so forth and then you know late on us hundreds of pages of work with he and his collaborators at the same time

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,080
And you know, it's not the mainstream of theoretical physics

25
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,920
Most physicists who are doing their own thing did not drop everything to work on it

26
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,640
But some became interested and they're inviting people to help out

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,240
So you'll learn a lot in this podcast not about I'm not gonna talk about you know

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,960
How the research was done or the fact that it was uploaded and shared with the world or whatever you can draw your own conclusions

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,040
about that I care about the substance of the actual ideas and

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,520
Mostly I'm giving Steven here the opportunity to explain those ideas

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,480
But there is a family resemblance between what he's trying to do and what I and my collaborators are trying to do in

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,520
Quantum mechanics stuff like that. So let me very briefly tell you what I how I see that relationship

33
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,480
What we're trying to do is to start with the

34
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,080
Simplest most stripped-down version of the best theory we currently understand namely quantum mechanics, right?

35
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:01,400
To start from almost nothing but quantum mechanics and see how things like space and time and matter and energy

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
Emerge from that fundamental description

37
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,720
Steven Wolfram and his friends are trying to be way more ambitious than that. They're starting with a kind of

38
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,000
automata a kind of discrete system called a hypergraph and

39
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,320
generalizations thereof and

40
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,680
Basically, you have a guess as to what the rules are for how hypergraphs are updated

41
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,200
And the point that they're trying to make is that some guesses lead to things that kind of look like the real world

42
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:35,640
So the hope is that eventually we find specific guesses for what those update rules could be that actually get us the

43
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,000
Specific real world or very very close to it. My own attitude is you know, good luck to them

44
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,160
I'm very much in favor of lots of different approaches to fundamental physics. This is one of them

45
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:53,680
Great let a thousand flowers bloom, etc. I actually think that our my and my collaborators

46
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,920
Approach is more promising because it leans heavily on something we already understand quite well

47
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,600
Which is quantum mechanics as I see it if the Wolfram physics project works

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,080
They're first going to have to find quantum mechanics in exactly the right way and then

49
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,960
Find all of the features that we have about the real world

50
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,800
So it's kind of a precursor to what I'm trying to do, etc

51
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,640
But you know, I might be wrong about that

52
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,880
It could be that this particular way of doing things leads to not just quantum mechanics

53
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,440
But a specific implementation of quantum mechanics that gives us other clues to understand the nature of space and time, etc

54
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,760
So as I said what we're trying to do here in this podcast is help you the listener

55
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,880
Actually understand what the ideas are and where they're going. Hopefully we succeed in that

56
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,640
Let me very briefly take an opportunity to as I occasionally do

57
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,240
Remind you that we have resources for the mindscape podcast

58
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,640

67
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
You

68
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
Stephen wool from welcome to the mindscape podcast

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,960
Hello

70
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,280
So it's been a little over a year I guess since you announced your physics project and I think I finally

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
By no means have become an expert

72
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,920
But at least I know enough about it to ask a whole bunch of ignorant questions to help us all understand it a little bit better

73
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
I mean maybe to start off

74
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,960
Is this do you consider this current project be a continuation of the cellular automata type of stuff?

75
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,960
You did in your book a new kind of science or is it a new branch somehow?

76
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,640
Yeah, so I mean it builds on basically a tower of ideas technology

77
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
intuition and so on

78
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,000
that

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,840
Uh, actually, I'm sort of amazed we've managed to get to the point we've managed to get to

80
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,080
But all those previous pieces seem to be necessary to get to where we are

81
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,000
And for example, you know, I studied a lot in new kind of science 20 years ago. I studied a lot

82
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,680
cellular automata, which are these very simple programs with

83
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,120
You know arrays of black and white squares and so on and from studying those things

84
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,680
I developed both a bunch of intuition about how sort of things work in the computational universe

85
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,760
And I managed to figure out some fairly general principles

86
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,960
Which we've been able to get more and more evidence for which are necessary to kind of launch into

87
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,880
Figuring out things about physics now when I wrote new kind of science, you know

88
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,720
It has 12 chapters and one of those chapters was called fundamental physics and it had two sections

89
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,760
One was about thermodynamics and one was about kind of the fundamental underlying theory of physics

90
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,600
And for me at the time I viewed it as being an incomplete

91
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,040
potential application of the general kinds of ideas that I was developing a new kind of science

92
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,880
And I had a bunch of specific ideas about thinking about space as a network

93
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,440
Thinking about the way time would operate and so on

94
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,480
I was very pleased with the fact that I had managed to get a fair distance in deriving general activity from that kind of

95
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,160
Theory of gravity from that kind of approach. I was not satisfied with where I had got with quantum mechanics

96
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,280
And you know that project so so now

97
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,640
restarting that project nearly 20 years later

98
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,440
with energetic young physicists and so on and

99
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,720
One kind of initially rather technical new idea that kind of made the model just seem much cleaner to me

100
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,920
It was kind of it's been a new development and and really now I've seen a lot of things that I say to myself

101
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,400
I should have been able to figure that out 25 years ago

102
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,320
Welcome to the club. That's that that does not distinguish you from anyone else working on science, right? Yeah, you always look back

103
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,760
with that

104
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,920
No, I think I think what's what's so I view it as being what what's really neat is that the formalism that we've now got

105
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,560
Is something which was sort of there were precursors of it a new kind of science

106
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,400
But the full sort of story of it is just emerging now

107
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,200
And it's really neat because it really it gives one sort of a to me

108
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,880
There's sort of this way of understanding things in terms of how simple programs behave

109
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,920
Developed a bunch of intuition a new kind of science now

110
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,240
There's a whole another level of intuition and results that we're getting that provide in the sort of formalism for this project

111
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,280
And that's so it's it's both applicable to fundamental physics and to a bunch of other things

112
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,200
And I'm I'm pretty excited about that

113
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,560
So let's imagine that first I'm sure this is not true

114
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,800
But let's imagine that there's going to be a listener who only listens to the first few minutes of this podcast

115
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,080
And we want to let them have a takeaway for what is going on here

116
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,280
I mean is it accurate my vague impression to say that the cellular automata

117
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,480
Had a grid right like you had some checkerboard or something like that and some rules for updating them and some discrete model

118
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,600
Which you're going to hope that if you squint and look at very far away

119
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,680
It looks like physics whereas here you still have a discrete set of models

120
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,080
But you're not starting with a fixed grid. You're kind of building things up by rules as you go

121
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Right. Yeah, that's right. I mean, I never thought that that cellular automata would be relevant to fundamental physics

122
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,640
I mean other people were sort of saying cellular automata are going to solve fundamental physics

123
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,000
And I was like, no, please don't say that that's just not going to work

124
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,840
And you know cellular automata are very minimal models once you have a fixed notion of space and time

125
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,920
And they've been extremely fertile models for huge numbers of different kinds of things from, you know, road traffic flow

126
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,480
To chemical catalysis to you know leaf growth all kinds of different things

127
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,920
But they assume a pre-existing notion of space and time and so in thinking about physics

128
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,560
I had realized ages ago that we really need to go underneath the notions of space and time that we're familiar with

129
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,440
And see how to build those up from something more fundamental

130
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,840
And so sort of the real starting point of our project is to think about just these that they're just

131
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,520
Space is made of something that's not that has not been sort of in the tradition of physics

132
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And the traditional mathematics as well

133
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,800
That's not really been a thing that people think about space just is a is is something in which

134
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,680
Things are placed at certain positions and so on

135
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,040
And so, you know in this and it's kind of like what people might have thought about a fluid like water

136
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,720
It's just water. It's just flows. It does all these kinds of things

137
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,560
But you know 150 years ago we found out no those greeks were actually right some of those greeks were right

138
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,960
It's made of discrete molecules bouncing around and with space

139
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,520
We haven't yet sort of made that definitive leap and one of the sort of starting points of this project

140
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,200
Is to think space is made of something. What's it made of?

141
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,880
It's just made of these disembodied discrete points and each point is just an abstract element

142
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,040
It doesn't it doesn't have a position. There's nothing. It's just this element

143
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,040
And then what we say is what all we know about those elements

144
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
Is how they're related to other elements

145
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,920
How they're effectively connected to other elements

146
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,960
So it's like you think about all these points in space all they have is a friend network, so to speak

147
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,120
They don't know where they are. They just know who their friends are so to speak

148
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,560
And so the you know the first big sort of realization is from something as unstructured as that

149
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:09,600
By looking at that on a large enough scale. It's kind of like how you know continuous fluids emerge from lots of discrete molecules

150
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,120
Underneath bouncing around

151
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,800
There's a there's a notion of a kind of continuous like space that can emerge when you look at that on a large scale

152
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,400
And that's that's kind of the you know, that's that's one starting point

153
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,800
I mean another important thing to realize is that in our setup

154
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
The only thing in the universe is space

155
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
And there's no

156
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,280
You know, we're not saying space is a background and there are things placed in space

157
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,040
We're saying everything in the universe is just kind of made of space

158
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,480
So what I have in mind is a bunch of dots you write nodes that are connected by lines to form some kind of graph

159
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,920
and

160
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,800
Do I imagine that the line that the dots rather the nodes are they labeled?

161
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,840
Do they come are there different kinds of dots or is there just a an ur.ness that they all share

162
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,840
It's an ur dot. Okay. That's just all identical

163
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,880
the only thing the only thing about them is

164
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,320
They are two dots are either identical or they're not identical. That is there's there's a there's a particular dot

165
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,400
Or there's another dot and so the only the only thing about them is is kind of their their

166
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,920
You know their identity so to speak they don't have

167
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,080
They don't have colors. They don't have they don't have positions

168
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,920
They just know i'm this dot and not that other dot right

169
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,960
So there's some dots and there's some lines. They make a graph or a hypergraph, I guess and there's a rule

170
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,720
There's a rule for updating to go from one collection of dots and lines to

171
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,320
The next one and then we just iterate that forever, I suppose

172
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,840
That's right and the whole universe comes out of that. That's very nice

173
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,600
That that that's the idea. So, I mean, you know, there are many pieces to that setup

174
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,760
For example, one thing is all there is is these kind of atoms of space and connections

175
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,760
There's nothing in space. There's nothing. It's not like you then say we've got space now. Let's put

176
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,080
A an electron in space if you want an electron you have to make it out of space so to speak

177
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,760
You have to make it from features of that pattern of connections between the atoms of space

178
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,400
So that's kind of the that's that's sort of the

179
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,240
The base story of what what is the data structure of the universe?

180
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,000
What is the universe sort of made of and that's the idea it's made of these discrete elements

181
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,600
And relations between those elements which we can think of as being kind of lines joining them

182
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,080
It's actually convenient and this was the sort of technical innovation of a couple of years ago

183
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,520
To realize that the best way to think about this is in terms of a so-called hypergraph

184
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,320
Where we just have elements and relations

185
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:53,440
In a graph you have you have nodes and you have edges connecting those nodes and each edge connects two nodes

186
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,520
In a hypergraph you can have any number of nodes involved in a hyper edge

187
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,640
And that sounds like a it is really a technical detail

188
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,480
But it makes the whole model much much easier to deal with or at least I thought it made it

189
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,280
Much easier to deal with in the end it doesn't make much of a difference and I could have figured this out 25 years ago

190
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,720
But that's that's that's the that's the way these things work

191
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,320
It it seemed to make it easier technically to make forward progress

192
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,840
But I think you were you were then talking about sort of what do these

193
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,920
What do these atoms of space do and you're describing kind of the rules that they use to get updated?

194
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,080
And um, yeah, you're right. I mean the the basic idea is you look at the local structure of this graph

195
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,680
And you say whenever the local structure of this graph looks like this particular pattern

196
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,720
Then it should be updated to be a local piece of graph that looks different, right?

197
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
And that's the whole story

198
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Some things are just better at home

199
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,640
You can pause the movie whenever you want you can have two desserts and no one will judge you

200
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:01,440
An exercise is one of those things peloton delivers a workout experience that you'd never imagine was possible

201
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Right in your own home one of the things

202
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,200
I especially like about peloton is the variety of classes driven by different kinds of instructors

203
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,880
If you're the kind of person who needs to be encouraged by your instructor

204
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,800
Robin Arzon is especially good at that whereas if you just want to get down to business and get the workout in

205
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,200
Adrian Williams might be the instructor for you

206
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Whatever your mood or overall fitness goal you can mix and match classes for a total body workout experience

207
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,880
Choose from cardio strength yoga pilates outdoor runs meditation and more

208
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,080
With the peloton bike, there's nothing like working out from home

211
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,920
I like I like the fact that you just use the word hypergraph because I like to

212
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,560
Share the jargon with the audience so they can go look it up because especially I mean I should note you

213
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,560
I don't want to talk too much about like style and procedure here because there's far too much physics to talk about

214
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,120
but you did announce this project with a website and a call to

215
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,120
Participate right if people want to dig into the details. What is the url? They should be going to

216
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:24,240
Well from physics.org there you go and and people can find out what the details are and do their own calculations

217
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,760
So that's that's yeah. I mean the other thing we've done kind of in terms of the public

218
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:33,120
Which has been really a big success is we've we've live streamed a lot of our internal working meetings

219
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,360
And we've you know all the notes from this project are all

220
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,480
You know posted on the web basically the the day after they're made typically and that's some and and it's been really

221
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,280
Interesting because a lot of people who are you know a lot of professional physicists have gotten involved

222
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,840
But also a lot of people who are for example

223
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,520
Involved in computer kinds of things and understand

224
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,360
Sometimes more of some of our jargon than the physicists would understand have also gotten involved

225
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,440
And it's it's really been an interesting process to sort of do science live and in public so to speak

226
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
it's you know and I

227
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
the it's like

228
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,680
It it's a good kind of generator of reality because you know we say some things that are right

229
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:24,240
We say some things that are wrong it kind of a a place where you can get to see kind of the process really happened

230
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,560
And there is something that is very different about what you're trying to do in terms of fundamental physics

231
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,280
I would I would argue and then correct me if i'm wrong

232
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,160
Usually not always but usually physicists work from the phenomena

233
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,680
To try to come up with an explanation right like there are stars in the sky. They're planets moving in certain orbits

234
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,240
What can we do about that? There's an apple falling from a tree

235
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,280
But in some sense you're just saying well here is the simplest possible thing that physics could be

236
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,440
Let's just see if we can guess the right one. Is that more or less accurate?

237
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,680
Yeah, I mean it is closer to that than the reverse engineering approach

238
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,760
and in fact when I see people try to sort of understand what we're doing and

239
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,680
Sort of say well, what about doing this and that and the other the great tendency is to try to reverse engineer

240
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,360
And this was a thing that that I kind of uh, you know, I as

241
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,840
You know, I used to do sort of mainstream standard physics back in the late 1970s early 1980s

242
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,040
And you know, that was what one did in those days

243
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,840
And the thing that was really for me very liberating

244
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,080
Was when I started studying well, I got interested in how the complex phenomena occur in the natural world

245
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,200
And the question was what are the right models to study that and my initial thought was

246
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,360
Let's use all the fancy stuff from physics all those differential equations and all these kinds of things

247
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
I tried doing that total failure

248
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,360
So I said, let's step back and see, you know, is there an alternative approach to modeling that we can use

249
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,880
And I had the very fortunate experience that I had been working as a practical matter on building my first computer language

250
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,760
as a forerunner of mathematics or more from language

251
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
This was back in 1979 1980

252
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,360
And what one does when one builds a computer language is one saying

253
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,280
Let's take all these computations people might want to do and let's in a kind of natural science type way drill down

254
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,360
And try and find out what are the primitives from which we can build up all these computations

255
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,440
What are the kind of atoms of computation and then build up from there?

256
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,720
And the thing that's really interesting about that process is you're just making up these atoms of computation

257
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,000
It's not like, you know, it's not really the same kind of oh, we've also we've got to make sure we get

258
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,640
You know, einstein's equations here. We've got to do this and this

259
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,640
You're just making it up and you're hoping that it will be in that case useful to people

260
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:43,520
And so that experience got me into this idea of just figure out the most minimal model and see what it does

261
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,600
And that's what I did with cellular automata and it worked great in that case

262
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
So in a sense with physics

263
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,320
What I was trying to do with this project is find

264
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,000
The most structuralist model of structure in the universe

265
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
because that was and

266
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,720
And it is not it is by no means self-evident that that will work

267
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:12,240
I mean, that's sort of the ultimate Occam's razor type idea is you know, just make it, you know, absolutely minimal

268
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,600
Now the thing that's really neat and maybe we'll talk about this a bunch later

269
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,400
Is that now that we have this foundation

270
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,920
We can start to see how a lot of ideas that people have had in mathematical physics

271
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,680
Over the last many decades actually plug into this idea and both inform it

272
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:33,440
And help make those other ideas more more, you know founded and it's it's I think come

273
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,480
So so this this notion which basically

274
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,640
You know this idea of find the simplest primitives and then see what they do

275
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,800
This is what I get for having spent 40 years being a computational language designer

276
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,480
This is what that's what that's what that involves and it's different from what people do traditionally

277
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:59,760
In sort of reductionistic science where you say start from the phenomena and then say how do I get this phenomenon?

278
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,440
right and

279
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,680
I do want to it's a somewhat different methodology

280
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,000
I do want to definitely get to how we recover all of known physics or at least you know

281
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,640
Move in the direction of recovering all of known physics

282
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,000
But there also seems to be like a couple of deep principles

283
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,240
That you have in mind when you're working on this stuff that maybe it's worth sharing

284
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,920
I mean one of them is this idea of computational equivalence, right?

285
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,680
I could try to gloss it, but why don't you tell the audience what that means?

286
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Yeah, yeah, right so

287
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,600
You know you set up some simple program you run it you see what it does

288
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,920
You might think if it's a simple program it will always do simple things

289
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
That turns out to not be true

290
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,280
That's sort of the big thing that I discovered in the early 1980s

291
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
That for several years

292
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,960
I kind of resisted that conclusion and eventually realized that is really the way things are

293
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,320
When you look in the sort of computational universe of possible programs

294
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,560
If you just sort of pick a program at random

295
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,400
Even though the program may be very simple its behavior may be very complicated

296
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,520
Programs that we typically build as humans for some particular known purpose

297
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,320
Will tend to not have that feature because we want to have them achieve the particular purpose

298
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,000
We want them to achieve which is one some purpose that we can describe

299
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,600
And so you avoid this thing that the simple programs producing complicated behavior

300
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,960
That idea of simple programs producing complicated behavior

301
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,320
I think is sort of the essence of the secret that nature uses to make complicated stuff

302
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,720
And that's why you know we look around in nature. We steal this complicated stuff

303
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,200
We say how could it possibly make all this complicated stuff?

304
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,320
That's just the formal fact about what happens in the universe of possible programs

305
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,880
So first thing is is the realization simple program doesn't necessarily have to have simple behavior

306
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,240
And then the next question is okay, so you see this very complicated behavior

307
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,680
How do you characterize it? You could just say oh, it's very complicated

308
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,160
And in fact a lot of the you know people had seen these phenomena for centuries actually of you know

309
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,960
Fairly simple setups like you know the digits of pi

310
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,400
Specifying them is quite easy yet once you've generated the digits

311
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,960
They seem completely random and people would typically say oh, it's very complicated

312
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,640
There's not much we can say about that and they would try to find you know

313
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,800
Like the distribution of prime numbers or something

314
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,720
They work for a long time to try and figure out what regularity can be teased out of this thing that seems quite random

315
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,200
And so what I was interested in was trying to understand how do we characterize this complexity that gets generated

316
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,320
And so the thing that I realized is the way you can think about what's happening is

317
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,520
Any process of generating some pattern for example you can think of as a computation

318
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,360
And then the question is how sophisticated is that computation?

319
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,400
So for example, it might be that computation is just like adding numbers together

320
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,720
It's something very simple or that computation is something more sophisticated

321
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,480
And the question is can you kind of can you rate the sort of sophistication of computations?

322
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,400
And so the big discovery of the 1930s and so on was that you might have thought

323
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Every different kind of computation you want to do you'd need a different machine to do it

324
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,720
But then with Turing machines and combinators and a bunch of other ideas

325
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,240
This notion of universal computation arose that says you can just have one piece of hardware

326
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,440
You just feed it different programs and it can do different things

327
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,960
And you know, that's been a that's been a pretty centrally important idea in the technology of the last 15 years

328
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,680
You know, that's the origin of software the sort of developments of the computer revolution

329
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,320
But in for science the implication there is well, perhaps these simple programs

330
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,520
Might actually be for example computation universal

331
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,480
They might be able to do essentially any computation you want

332
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:47,360
So this principle of computational equivalence of mine is basically the the idea that

333
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,720
When you pick a program if the program doesn't do something obviously simple

334
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,360
It will be doing a computation that is as sophisticated as the computations that anything can do

335
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,200
So in other words, what that's saying is, you know, you might think you start off with an incredibly trivial program

336
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,960
And only those trivial computations as you make the program a little bit more complicated

337
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,000
It would gradually do more and more sophisticated computations

338
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,640
And as you make a really really really complicated program

339
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
It would do really really complicated computations

340
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,880
But the the the somewhat surprising claim of the principle of computational equivalence is that that's not true

341
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,520
Once you get above some very low threshold

342
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,240
You're immediately at the max you're immediately doing computations that are as sophisticated as anything

343
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,200
And that that principle, I mean that has that principle has many implications

344
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,520
And um, I mean probably the most important for for immediately for physics is this phenomenon

345
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,360
I call computational irreducibility. That was the next one. So go ahead and say that yeah

346
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
right, so so I mean the um

347
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,360
You know the question there is

348
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,560
If you are running a program, can you tell what it will do?

349
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,840
One way you can tell what it will do is you just run every step just like the program would run itself

350
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,520
But another thing you can do is say I'm much smarter than that program

351
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,040
I can jump ahead and it's going to run for a million steps

352
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,040
But I can just jump to the end and say the answer is going to be 42 or something

353
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,960
and so

354
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
You know one of the ideas of

355
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,960
Of sort of the exact sciences the mathematical scientists for a long time has been

356
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,280
Sort of a sign of doing wonderful things is that you can jump ahead like that

357
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,800
You can make you can readily predict, you know, where will the planets be at some time in the future and so on

358
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:38,000
But so that's that's what I call computational reducibility the ability to reduce the computational effort necessary to find the answer to jump ahead

359
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,240
So the claim is

360
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,760
Actually, there are lots of systems that are computationally irreducible in the sense the only way to find out what they'll do

361
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,160
Is just to run every step or in effect just to observe what the system does

362
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,840
And the reason that happens is because the principle of computational equivalence because if you think

363
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
You're the observer you're the predictor

364
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,440
You are you are a computational system as well

365
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,400
And the question is how do you as a computational system compete with the system?

366
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,760
You're trying to predict

367
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,280
So if it was the case that you could really be smarter than the system you're trying to predict

368
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Then yes, you could potentially jump ahead

369
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,080
But what the principle of computational equivalent says is no actually that won't be that way

370
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,320
You will be exactly computational equivalent to the system. You're trying to predict

371
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
And so the system you're trying to predict

372
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,800
Its behavior will seem to you sort of irreducibly complicated. So that's that's one of its implications

373
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,560
So in some sense, this is saying, you know, both of these principles the equivalence and the irreducibility

374
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,320
There are computers as we've known since touring that are universal computers

375
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,760
They can calculate any function you want to calculate and what you're saying is in the space of all computers computations

376
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,080
Computations with that capacity are generic in some sense. They're all over the place

377
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,800
They're much easier to find than you might have thought and there's no way to simplify the the typical one into a something that you can just leap ahead

378
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Right. I mean principle of computational equivalence

379
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,960
One of its predictions in effect is that universal computation will be ubiquitous

380
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:16,480
It actually goes considerably further than that because at a technical level one of the things that one talks about in universal computation is

381
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,960
It is possible to program this system to do whatever computation you want

382
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,720
It's a little bit of a different statement to say if you are presented with this system and it is fed

383
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
Even this very simple program

384
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,520
Then it will already do something complicated. So it's a couple a couple of additional steps

385
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,640
But one of the one of the key predictions is computation universality is ubiquitous

386
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,320
And that that has many implications. I mean it has implications in terms of the practicalities of building computers

387
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,280
It has implications in terms of what aspects of physics we can expect to understand

388
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,960
It has implications at a more philosophical level about things like free will and so on which maybe we'll talk about

389
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,920
Well, and one of the implications is that it it if we buy into the philosophy of it

390
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,360
It gives us some optimism for this program of starting program in the human sense

391
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,760
Not the computer sense for this project of starting with some very very simple rules and getting the actual universe out

392
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,680
Right if all sufficiently complicated computations are at the same level of

393
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,320
Ability in some sense

394
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,120
Yes, that's true. I mean one of the things that is sort of a key

395
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,720
I would you could even say prediction statement of our physics project is

396
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,480
What can be done in our universe is just computation and not hyper computation

397
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,480
That is it's the kind of computation that can be done by a Turing machine

398
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,680
It's not the kind of computation that can be done by a thing that is infinitely more powerful than a Turing machine

399
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,400
Right that you can conceptually imagine

400
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,680
But you can't uh, you know the claim is no such thing exists in our universe

401
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,400
And in fact you can get a bit more technical about it

402
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,480
And the the claim of these models is even if it exists

403
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,040
It will be hidden by behind a cosmological event horizon from us

404
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,600
Um, we will never be able to observe it

405
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,840
So it's kind of like well, you can say it exists

406
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,840
So you can say it doesn't exist doesn't really matter because we'll never be able to interact with it

407
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,800
But so, you know, that's one of the the key statements. Yes, and and the idea that

408
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,680
That it's sufficient to have something

409
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,880
That is a simple a computational system that we humans can kind of understand how it's constructed like a Turing machine

410
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,880
Or like one of these hypergraph rewriting systems that is a you know

411
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,520
That's a that's a supposition of this project

412
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:37,600
And it's a supposition that in a sense is is sort of encouraging for us humans that that it might be the case

413
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,920
There's something we can kind of hold in our hands that represents everything the universe does

414
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,440
Even if the implications of that thing we can hold in our hands are irreducibly complex

415
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,720
And even if we couldn't tell, you know, given that you give us the rules for the universe

416
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,000
If you say can I make a warp drive the answer might be it's really hard to tell

417
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,360
It's an irreducibly complicated thing. Yeah, it's like, you know

418
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:08,160
Recapitulating the whole history of mathematics and so on to get to the point, you know, can we prove this theorem that there is or isn't a warp drive?

419
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,640
so it's

420
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
but but to me that's yes that that that's

421
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,520
That's that's the concept. I'll take all the reasons for optimism I can get I'm all on board with that so so good

422
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,840
So with those in mind, I mean, let's go back to the physics that you're actually constructing here

423
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,200
We have a hypergraph

424
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,600
We have some rules for updating it now

425
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Should I read the specific

426
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:37,120
Is it is the idea that there is a specific correct rule for our universe and that rule basically is the fundamental laws of physics?

427
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:43,520
Okay, so this this is where things get a little bit more complicated. Yeah, so I think

428
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:50,000
That it is probably the case that there will be a rule that we'll be able to hold up and say

429
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,840
With this rule, we can reproduce what we observe in physics

430
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:01,520
Now footnote, which is really interesting footnote. I think you might say why did we get this rule and not another rule?

431
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,480
You know, it seems very particularly if the rule is simple

432
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:10,320
That's like, you know, Copernicus was wrong. So to speak, you know, there isn't nothing special about us

433
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,480
We got the simple universe so to speak or we got the universe with the simple rule

434
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,320
Not the universe with the to us incredibly complicated seeming rule

435
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,600
So the the thing that is then very surprising

436
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,000
Is that and and this is you know, we probably have to go a few more steps before we can really really dig into this properly

437
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,880
Is the idea that actually you can think of the universe

438
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
as running all possible rules

439
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,800
And we as observers of the universe are essentially exist in a particular in a sense reference frame

440
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,640
In a particular position in rural space as we call it

441
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:51,440
That essentially gives us a particular sampling of this sort of universal possible universities

442
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:59,440
And that particular sampling has is is given our way of parsing what happens in the universe

443
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,160
That is something that we could attribute to a particular underlying rule

444
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,120
But actually we can also think of it as just a slice

445
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,240
Of this kind of universal or possible universities

446
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,800
So it's a it a little bit more but but I think you know, operationally

447
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,920
I would hope that we will be able to

448
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,520
Produce a rule that will have the property that if we work out all its consequences

449
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:30,080
And we cannot because remember one of the very tricky things is we as observers of the universe are embedded in this universe

450
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,520
And so as you change that underlying rule, you not only change the rule for the universe

451
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
You also change the rule for us

452
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,960
And so that those two effects

453
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,680
In some very very vague sense cancel each other out so that there is a large class of

454
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
rules for the universe and rules for us

455
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,720
Which all seem the same

456
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,680
And which which all have the same laws of physics effectively

457
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,680
So to give an analogy to make this a little bit less less bizarre

458
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,920
The you know, so let's go back to fluid dynamics, for example

459
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,120
And you know, we have the laws of fluid dynamics there the navier stokes equations all these kinds of things

460
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
And you might say, how do we derive these?

461
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,920
Underneath there are a bunch of molecules bouncing around

462
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,720
Well, there can be water molecules which have their particular, you know, h2o form

463
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,480
There can be you know air molecules there, you know, n2 or whatever it is

464
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,840
These different kinds of molecules bouncing around

465
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,040
All of their physics is quite different all the details of what happens when those molecules collide is quite different

466
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,000
Yet on a large scale the laws of fluid dynamics are the same for air and for water

467
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,640
They have some different parameters, but they're basically the same laws

468
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,720
And it's the same kind of thing that I think happens in the derivation of laws of physics

469
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,880
That is certain aspects of the laws of physics are quite generic

470
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,400
I think general relativity and quantum mechanics are quite generic

471
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,680
And they are things which if you are an observer even vaguely like us

472
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
They are inevitable that you will observe

473
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,600
And if you want to home in on well, do we have the fine structure constant where the particular value it has

474
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,920
You probably have to home in on more features of us as observers

475
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,560
Right. I mean, do you think that do you anticipate that at some step in understanding the relationship between these rules and our universe

476
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,680
There will be an anthropic move of some sort where you say there's a lot of things going on

477
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,880
But intelligent observers will only observe this subset of things

478
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
Intelligent observers, no

479
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,880
Observers with so the question is what is the right idealization of the human observer, right?

480
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,280
So I'll give you a couple that

481
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,520
That seem to be enough. Okay. So one important one is we're computationally bounded

482
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,720
We don't get to observe. So let's take the gas molecule example again

483
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,960
If if you are, you know, you have this gas has got a bunch of molecules bouncing around

484
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,720
If you're a sophisticated enough observer, you can see every single molecule you can work out all the collisions

485
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:03,200
And in particular that will allow you. So, you know, a big principle of statistical mechanics is second law of thermodynamics

486
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:10,000
Which says, you know, typically the the sort of typically things get more random as the molecules bounce around in a gas

487
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,080
But if we are not computationally bounded observers and we can

488
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,520
You know, we can figure out what all these trajectories of all these molecules are

489
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,160
We don't get the second law of thermodynamics as non computationally bounded observers

490
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,320
The second law of thermodynamics simply isn't true

491
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,400
And so the first and that same idea of a computationally bounded observer is necessary

492
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,320
I think for us to believe that space has a continuous structure and various other things about the universe

493
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,120
So that's kind of step one. So we're not Laplace's demon

494
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,160
What's that? Sorry. We're not Laplace's demon

495
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,000
That is correct. We're not we're not Laplace. We're not Maxwell's demon. We're we're um

496
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,160
We are we are we are thoroughly non-demonic in that sense

497
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,840
And finite and bound we only have this sort of bounded ability to understand to look at the details of the universe

498
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,960
That's step one step two. I've understood more recently actually and step two is

499
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,840
Something which I think is sort of the the physics essence of consciousness

500
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:15,280
Which is that we have this idea that there is a single thread of experience that we that we have

501
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,280
It might not be that way

502
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,400
That is in the universe and we didn't talk about this in detail yet

503
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,760
But in the universe all these little updates are happening all over the universe

504
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,840
But we think that and in a sense there's sort of microscopic pieces of time

505
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,800
Happening all over the universe, but we believe we have a single identity through time

506
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,880
And that there is a single thread of experience that we have through time

507
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,240
Now it's it's by no means self-evident that that would be the way it is because in our model of physics

508
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,680
Everything about the universe is being rewritten, you know, 10 to the 100 times or something or something like this

509
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,000
And so the fact that we have the idea that we are still the same us

510
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,880
A second later is non-trivial

511
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:07,120
And so I think that an observer who has that idea that there's a single thread of time

512
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:14,000
Has that is that is the one of the things that you need in order to get the laws of physics that we humans observe

513
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,800
And I think that's a so there's this idea of we maintain our identity through time

514
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,720
Yeah, which we might not

515
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,560
Um and the thing I realized actually even more recently, although I should have realized this earlier

516
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,560
Is there's a similar idea for space? It is not self-evident that there is a notion of pure motion

517
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,240
So in other words, you take an object you move it somewhere else

518
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,920
In our models, you know, I take an object. I move it somewhere else

519
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,320
It's made of different atoms of space by the time it gets to its destination probably

520
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,720
And so then the question is how come there's an idea of pure motion

521
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,240
How come a thing can just be moved without changing now?

522
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,160
Obviously we know in general activity, you know, you're close to a black hole funky thing can happen to you if you move

523
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
Because the structure of space is changing

524
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,080
But this is a very basic fact that most of the time, you know, something moves

525
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,560
And it is still the same thing

526
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,760
And so this idea of this sort of this this single thread of experience in time

527
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,720
This idea that it is possible to have pure motion

528
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,640
And it's possible to maintain your identity as you move around in space

529
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,000
Those two attributes seem to be what you need to derive generic log of physics

530
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,160
That is that that's what you seem to need to derive general activity and quantum mechanics

531
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
Now if you start asking

532
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,840
Why does the electron mass come out to be the actual value it has

533
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,120
For us humans, we probably need a little bit more information about us humans to be able to figure that out

534
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,960
I think I'm not sure. I mean, for example, one of the things that's a current

535
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,600
Challenge is the the local symmetry groups local gauge groups

536
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:55,120
It is looking very likely that it is an inevitable feature of our models that there will be local gauge invariance

537
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,880
And the thing that looks conceivable. I don't know yet

538
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,520
Is that the actual

539
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,520
Gauge group will be determined

540
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,440
So in other words, even though we don't yet know why the universe has three dimensions

541
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,400
We might actually know why the internal symmetry group is maybe a subgroup of v8 or whatever it is

542
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,040
Before we even know this thing about

543
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,600
About about space and so that would be an example

544
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,360
But we don't know, you know, if you ask what's the electron mu on mass ratio

545
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,400
You know, we're we're still a fair distance away from figuring that out the classic my expectation would be

546
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,760
That there'll be a particular rule that we'll find

547
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,120
Which will have where a whole bunch of those things will come out

548
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,480
And one of the features if you believe that the rule is simple is if you move from one simple rule

549
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,080
To another nearby simple rule everything's going to change because there just aren't very many rules

550
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,560
That are that simple and so instead of having, you know, electron mu on mass ratio

551
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,440
It'll be well

552
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,520
There actually are an infinite number of generations of particles and there are

553
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,400
You know a bizarre number of dimensions of space and all this kind of thing. It'll just be completely different

554
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,360
But that's that's the current expectation

555
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,640
I think you you raised the anthropic principle and to me the anthropic principle is sort of a story of

556
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,360
Of lack of imagination so to speak

557
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
Because it's saying, you know

558
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,680
The only way that we can have life intelligence consciousness, whatever

559
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,320
Is the particular way we've seen it

560
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
and you know, I

561
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:25,760
My one of the consequences of this principle of computational equivalence is that actually

562
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,720
Something like intelligence is ubiquitous

563
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,680
That is you might have thought to get something as computationally sophisticated as us humans with our brains and all this kind of thing

564
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,640
You need the whole process that's led to us humans

565
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,080
But what the principle of computational equivalence says is that's not true

566
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,000
Even these very simple the system with various simple rules can do it

567
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:52,160
And that has well has lots of consequences, you know, if you're if you're worrying about extraterrestrial intelligence, for example

568
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,120
That tells you it's everywhere. It's a question of whether we are sufficiently aligned

569
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,600
with that intelligence

570
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:06,560
To be able to recognize it as something that for example has purposes that we can understand as sort of human like purposes

571
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,600
So, you know, it's a and I think this idea intelligence requires liquid water is almost laughable

572
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,520
I'm on your side when it comes to that but but intelligence might require space time in some sense

573
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,840
So let's let's at least try to get that I mean

574
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,520
Do I is this naive picture that I have in mind where you have the hypergraph you update

575
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:35,840
It's a discrete updating should I can I think of the graph at any one update as space and the update itself as time?

576
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,920
Or is that too simple minded?

577
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,400
Okay, so it gets a little complicated and in fact

578
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,400
The complexity of the rises is quantum mechanics, I think

579
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,880
and so it's in a sense you try and make it that simple

580
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,560
and

581
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:55,920
You okay, so so the basic point is the sort of the rule says if you have a lump of

582
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,720
of atoms of space that are connected in this way

583
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,680
Transform it into a lump that's connected in this other way

584
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,240
And it basically the rule just says that's what you do. It doesn't say where you do it

585
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,160
Doesn't say when you do it

586
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,040
It's just any time there's a lump that looks like this

587
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,520
You can transform it into a lump that looks like that and so those transformations can be happening all over this hypergraph

588
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,120
And so it is not at all obvious that that is the only thing that's defined that these can happen

589
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,240
The question of when they happen what counts as the sort of simultaneity surface?

590
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,360
What counts as that moment in time is something that's really in the eye of the observer

591
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,240
Okay, but the updated graph is supposed to represent spacetime and the things within it or is it a more subtle map there?

592
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,200
No, no, so so so at any given

593
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,280
What's happening is this graph is getting updated and there are lots of little places where it can get updated

594
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,040
And you can say okay, I'm going to consider the graph with this collection of updates having been done

595
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,720
I am going to consider that as time t equals zero let's say

596
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,520
And then another situation

597
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,200
You're saying I'm going to say now I'm going to say this collection of updates is time t equals one for example

598
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:15,040
And each one of those time slices at each one of those sort of well in the language of physics space like hypersurfaces

599
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,040
the

600
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,120
You know that represents

601
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,280
An instantaneous structure of space

602
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,360
But it is somewhat arbitrary what you consider to be this instantaneous sort of structure of space

603
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,760
Just as it is in general activity. Well, sure right and that's that's very familiar from general relativity

604
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,160
But I'm just saying is the collection of the whole shebang

605
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,400
spacetime

606
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,320
And the things within it. It's just space a single hypergraph a single the collection of all the updated hypergraphs

607
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,760
That's what I'm asking. Oh, yeah. Yeah, right the sequence of updates

608
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,080
The hypergraph together with all its updates is supposed to be spacetime

609
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,120
Okay, and and one of the things that is is interesting and non-trivial here is

610
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,040
You know a lot of most traditional views of physics have thought of space and time as being the same kind of thing

611
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,680
In this model, they're really not sure spaced as the extent of the spatial hypergraph

612
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,000
Time is the computational process of updating this hypergraph

613
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,160
So time is a time is the is the progression of a computation

614
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:20,320
Space is just oh, you follow these these connections in the hypergraph. Okay, and so

615
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,560
That makes it not at all obvious that you're going to get things like relativity

616
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,360
Out of the model because it's some

617
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,360
You know because one is breaking apart the sort of traditional

618
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,760
Connection between space and time

619
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,000
But it does sound you say that the whole the whole shebang is spacetime

620
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,120
one of the reasons I hesitate a little bit about that is

621
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,040
The shebang is made by a computationally irreducible process

622
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:51,520
So we don't get to it is a you know to say let's just unroll the whole structure of the universe forever

623
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,080
Well, we don't get to do that in the universe

624
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,920
I mean the universe will do that as the universe does it but we can't just say this is what's going to happen

625
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,040
Because there is this phenomenon of computational irreducibility

626
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,760
But I do want to just distinguish between this idea and something that someone like myself would be very fond of which is

627
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,000
Some combination of quantum gravity and ever ready in many worlds

628
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:20,320
Where there are different branches of the wave function where the geometry of spacetime is just different perhaps radically different

629
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:25,280
It sounds like that is not something that is coming out of your hypergraphs. Oh, no, no that that will come out

630
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,240
Okay, I was simplifying a bit. Okay. Okay, so what's happening is at every

631
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,960
You know these updates they get they you're just saying whenever you see a piece of hypergraph

632
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,680
That looks like this you can do an update. Okay

633
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,880
There are many possible sequences of updates that there are many possible

634
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,200
Sequencings of these updates that could occur each one of those sequence things

635
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,440
Defines a different path of history effectively

636
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,400
Now the nontrivial fact another additional piece is this thing we call causal invariance

637
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,280
and so what's happening is if you look at this um, uh, this

638
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,560
Okay, so if you if you look at this this hypergraph and you imagine

639
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
You roll up the whole universe

640
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:21,520
Into a single lump that you can kind of hold in your hand and then you say that single lump is going to evolve to another whole universe

641
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,320
That process of evolution

642
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:29,920
Is not a single thread that that process can branch because the whole universe

643
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:35,520
If you did two updates in different orders, for example, you would get different outcomes

644
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,840
You would get different whole universes and that's very similar to the many worlds story

645
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,960
And one difference is that in our models

646
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,280
We're really, you know taking seriously this idea that there's that there's

647
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,120
branching as a result of these different possible orders of updating and so on

648
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,720
And that there's this thing we called in a multi-way graph

649
00:48:55,120 --> 00:49:00,000
Which is just this this description of all these different possible paths of history

650
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,360
But for us, it's very important that the paths of history can branch and they can also merge

651
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,920
and they merge when

652
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,200
two

653
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,600
Two outcomes for the universe end up you apply two different rules

654
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,640
And it so happens that they end up with an identical universe

655
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:22,560
They end up with a hypergraph that is isomorphic that you can rearrange to be exactly the same hypergraph

656
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,000
And so that branching and merging process is really important because one feature

657
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,080
Of many of our models and in fact it seems to be in the end

658
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,840
It's a ubiquitous feature of all of them, but that's not how it initially looks

659
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:40,080
Initially, it looks like you have to pick it specially but in the end you don't is this thing

660
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:45,840
We call causal invariance and so essentially what causal invariance says is every time there's a branch

661
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,320
There will be a subsequent merge

662
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:53,600
So in other words, even though you thought you were going to go in two different branches of history

663
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,080
Even though for a while

664
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,760
You've got two completely incompatible structures of spacetime

665
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,480
In the end they will merge

666
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,640
In the end there'll be and that's some and so that's why

667
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:11,600
In our models, that's in the end. Why you get objectivity and quantum mechanics

668
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,920
Well, let me see. So what happens if I'm just a conventional many worlds person

669
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,840
Um, there's perfectly deterministic evolution of the entire wave function

670
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,680
it will branch and part of the reason why it branches and

671
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,280
Operationally they never merge is because there's some environment

672
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:35,520
Which is huge numbers of degrees of freedom and the different states in the environment will never exactly line up

673
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:41,920
So eventually you might imagine them emerging back together 10 to the 100 years from now

674
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,640
Is that the kind of thing you have going on or is you're

675
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,520
Remerging much more rapid. No, the the remerging is faster than that

676
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,920
But again, it's a little complicated

677
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,800
But the the fact that there is divergence and merging is basically

678
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:03,840
So what what in the end happens is that the uncertainty principle is a story of essentially curvature in this

679
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,200
Uh, in this basically multi-way graph space

680
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:14,560
And it's just like in in spacetime one of the sort of you know, the classic feature is you go around a square

681
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,560
Does it does it, you know, you you go around a square with all the right angles and distances

682
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:24,080
Does it close up if space is curved it doesn't close up and what's happening in our models is

683
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,720
It's the exact same thing. Although the space is more complicated and more like a Hilbert space

684
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,960
that

685
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,720
What's happening is the same exact kind of thing is what leads to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics

686
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:44,160
It's that same failure to close up and now what ends up being the case and we don't understand this

687
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
As completely as I would like yet

688
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:53,360
So so just to give some sense of the sort of the situation with respect to you know, what we know and what we don't know

689
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,840
So these multi-way graphs

690
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:03,920
Okay, so first thing to say about multi-way graphs is they represent the sort of branching and merging of paths of history for the universe

691
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,680
So what you one thing you can do is you can say at any given time

692
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,680
What is the structure of all of those possible branches of history?

693
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,280
So just like in in spacetime, we're going to say let's pick a space like hypersurface

694
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,480
Let's pick a

695
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,280
A simultaneous moment for all these different parts of space

696
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,760
What does space look like or we can do the same kind of thing for this multi-way graph

697
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,280
If we do that we get this thing which has all these different all these different sort of possible

698
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,480
States of the universe and how are they connected?

699
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,280
Well, they're connected in what we call a branchial graph

700
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,200
A graph that represents these different branches and so one

701
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:46,720
Convenient way to construct a branchial graph is to look at the common ancestry of those states

702
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:53,040
So if two of those states just branched one step before they're close together in the branchial graph

703
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,880
If they branched many many many steps before they're further apart

704
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,120
And so you can you can construct just like from this sort of

705
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,440
Structure of spacetime you can construct a sort of instantaneous structure of space

706
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,160
So from this multi-way graph you can construct what we call branchial space

707
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,760
This is the instantaneous representation of the possible branches of quantum history

708
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,480
And in a sense, it's a map of entanglements because every one of these branchings

709
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:26,000
That the fact that they had a common ancestor and that they will is is a story of entanglement

710
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,760
That's saying that these two branches of history are not independent

711
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,360
They are connected by the fact that they are entangled

712
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,040
So in a sense this branchial space is a map of quantum entanglements

713
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,480
And so it's really I think incredibly cool because branchial space

714
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,920
Has many of the same attributes the physical space has

715
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,120
It's more like a Hilbert space. It's a little bit complicated and we don't fully understand it yet

716
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,760
It's something like a a what is the analog in spacetime?

717
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:02,240
We have this idea of minkowski space which has both sort of the the usual euclidean type space for space

718
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,720
And then this notion of time being a separate thing

719
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:11,040
And exactly how that works for a Hilbert space the analog of minkowski space for the Hilbert space of states

720
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,840
We don't understand it. Maybe something related to twister space. That's a special case of it

721
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,240
But it's something we don't yet understand

722
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,240
But one thing we do know is

723
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,840
You know in terms of what we understand what we don't understand

724
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,880
We do know that our multi-way graphs

725
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,400
Reproduce a an approach to quantum mechanics called categorical quantum mechanics

726
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:40,080
And we can just show that they are equivalent basically and it's known that categorical quantum mechanics is equivalent to standard

727
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,840
standard quantum mechanics that people studied from the 1920s and so on

728
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,480
And not only can we show that they're equivalent

729
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:53,520
One of the recent things in the last month or two has been we can actually use our models to model quantum circuits

730
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:58,880
And we can essentially compile a standard quantum circuit into a multi-way graph

731
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:04,000
And the big excitement of the last few weeks has been and we can do better

732
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,600
Circuit optimization in multi-way graphs than you've been able to do in standard quantum circuit formalism

733
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,200
So in other words, we can we can if you want to simulate a quantum circuit

734
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:18,560
It's better to do it through our model than it is to do it through the standard mechanisms of quantum mechanics

735
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,960
But we know the answers have to be the same

736
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,080
So that's that's what we know for quantum mechanics. We don't yet know

737
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,680
Fully how that works for quantum field theory quantum mechanics just for other people's benefit

738
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:35,600
I know you know this very well, but but you know quantum mechanics is a story of you know, what do individual particles do

739
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,480
Quantum field theory is a story of even if you can make particles and the particles are

740
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,720
A sort of spread out through space. How does that work quantum mechanic play?

741
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,080
And that's a more difficult thing which we're just starting to understand

742
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,160
I do want to dig in I want to dig in more specifically to the different to

743
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:58,720
Mapping your approach onto the different interpretations of quantum mechanics, but but let me let's just give

744
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,680
Back up a little bit and keep it simple for the folks who are who are trying to stay with us here

745
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,760
If I look at the pictures of the graphs of the hypergraphs that are following the rules

746
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,640
Very naively it looks super duper classical. There's a graph something is happening at every point

747
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:22,960
So could you just explain why you know, you even get something like the double slit experiment where you can get interference?

748
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,920
But then if you look at it, you don't get interference. Is that something that pops out of your model? Yes

749
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:35,200
Yes, um, I mean by pop out there's a little bit of there's a little bit of effort to make that pop. Sure, of course

750
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,160
The okay, so when you see pictures of these hypergraphs

751
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:47,200
They are pictures drawn for a particular branch of history particular branch of quantum mechanical history

752
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,800
That's what we're easily able to visualize now. It's been a big project

753
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,640
To make what we call local multiway systems, which mix

754
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,960
spatial extent

755
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,840
With branch ill extent that is mix

756
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,880
Things which are moving around in space with things which are going to different branches of history

757
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,680
And we've been this has been a big challenge because it's pretty hard for us humans to visualize that stuff

758
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,320
And we've been we've been working on it for the last year actually

759
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,000
We're getting fairly close to having pretty good visualizations of that

760
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,800
But those are those are significantly more difficult to understand

761
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,840
But the the typical pictures you'll see

762
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,040
Our our project is full of graphs

763
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:30,160
So there are many different kinds of graphs that show up and they're they're kind of in all the one of the things

764
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,760
That's been a big kind of practical win is that we at some moment

765
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,480
We kind of did the colors for our model and you know picked this graph is going to be this color

766
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:44,000
This kind of this other color and so as soon as you see one of these things you can tell that's a causal graph

767
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,560
That's a branch ill graph or whatever. Um, that's just a uh, and and um, you know

768
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,560
Because all the all the code for our models is all openly available

769
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,840
People have been just using that code and so people have been following kind of the the color standards

770
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,080
Which really help but so there are there are

771
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:07,680
Probably six different kinds of graphs that show up the ones that are the most common and colored bullish are

772
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,640
The ones that are the the hypergraphs that represent the instantaneous structure of space

773
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:22,880
So there are then these multi-way graphs that represent the um, the kind of the the um, the branching and merging of quantum histories

774
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,000
Then there are branch ill graphs, which are traditionally pink in our world

775
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,640
That represent these slices

776
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,360
through the multi-way system they represent so

777
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,360
in

778
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,800
In space time

779
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:42,320
We are taking a slice through space time and finding this is what space instantaneously looks like

780
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:50,000
In the multi-way graph you take a slice and you're saying this is what the instantaneous map of quantum states looks like

781
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,760
And in fact what happens is in in relativity

782
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:00,320
We're used to having this idea of reference frames of how do we label what space and time are how does an observer

783
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:05,120
Decide what counts of space what counts as time and so on if the observer is going at different speeds

784
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,440
You know you're tipping the reference frame all those kinds of things

785
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:12,880
We have exactly the same kind of thing in quantum mechanics. We have what we call quantum observation frames

786
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,800
Which are basically the the the thing that represents

787
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,080
This corresponds to a a particular state of the quantum world

788
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,760
And you can think of these in branch ill space

789
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:29,280
You can think of these points in branch ill space, which are histories of the universe

790
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,360
as being

791
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,360
different quantum eigen states

792
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,000
So you you can think of them as being different

793
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,240
basis elements

794
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,120
So different different things from which you would make up a quantum state

795
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:48,000
And so then what happens is when you have one of these quantum observation frames you've you've sliced the this multi-way graph

796
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,480
You've got this whole collection of quantum states

797
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,480
And now you ask

798
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,360
In for example, so so now okay, this is a

799
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,320
One other thing I have to explain

800
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,680
In quantum mechanics the sort of the big idea

801
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:08,320
You know is this notion of quantum amplitudes. That is you just get to know there's this this

802
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,160
object

803
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:17,120
Which is that you know has complex numbers, you know associated with and all this kind of thing that is the quantum amplitude

804
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,520
and so the question is

805
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:24,960
That that quantum amplitude the the the complex numbers that are associated with it

806
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:31,920
That you know one of the things that we've realized is the idea that you can think of a quantum amplitude in some of the complex numbers

807
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,440
Is confusing in fact the right way to think about it is it has a magnitude and it has a phase

808
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,960
And in our models the magnitude of the quantum amplitude

809
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,160
Is the result of path counting in the multi-way graph?

810
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,040
So in other words if there are many ways to get to that state in the multi-way graph

811
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:55,680
The magnitude of the quantum amplitude is determined by the number of ways to get to that that point in the multi-way graph

812
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,760
The phase of the quantum amplitude is determined by the position in branch shield space

813
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,400
So in other words the idea is as you move around in branch shield space

814
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:14,800
You are changing the the the phase that coordinates a branch shield space are essentially phase coordinates in quantum mechanics

815
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,680
Sorry, you might need to tell me what branch shield space is again

816
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:22,000
Okay, so so okay, so that then we've got this

817
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,440
All possible histories of the universe which correspond to this multi-way graph. They branch they merge

818
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:34,800
It's a complicated thing now. We're saying let's let's and and and that graph is being formed through time

819
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:41,120
So every every and so now we say let's take an instantaneous time slice across that graph

820
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,800
It is the quantum analog of a reference frame in relativity

821
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,920
Okay, and that and by the way those reference frames can get quite wild in quantum mechanics

822
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:55,280
They're somewhat wilder than the ones you would typically use in general activity at least that's that's our

823
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,640
View of how this works. So so those reference frames are sort of the choice of the observer

824
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,000
They're not they're not something that is intrinsic to the physics

825
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:09,840
They're just oh, we've got this multi-way graph now. We're going to say for our purposes

826
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,640
We're going to say this is what the time slices of that will be like

827
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:13,760
Okay

828
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:20,960
So that what this branch shield graph is the structure you get by slicing through this multi-way graph

829
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,560
So you're asking the various points in this multi-way graph. How are they arranged?

830
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:31,040
Well, we can say they're arranged nearby if they correspond to something which just had a common ancestor

831
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:35,120
Just one step back. We had a common ancestor and other ones, you know

832
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:41,040
You have to so basically what happens is the the simplest way to make these branchial graphs is you simply join by an edge

833
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,920
every pair of nodes that have a common ancestor

834
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:52,000
Okay, and then so what that means is if there are if there are things are far apart on the branchial graph

835
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,520
It means their common ancestor was probably many steps in the past

836
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,760
And and the idea then is that that okay

837
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,040
so the claim

838
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:07,040
Which is again mathematically quite non-travel is that the coordination of branchial space

839
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,720
That is if you try and assign coordinates just like in in physical space

840
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,000
You'd say there are all these atoms of space and they're just connected in certain ways

841
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,800
But now we say based on those connections

842
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,640
It is we can say this one has coordinate position blah blah blah

843
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,240
And it's next to this other one which has a very similar coordinate position

844
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,080
Okay, so the same you can do the same kind of thing in branchial space

845
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,240
You can try and coordinate to i's branchial space

846
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,440
And the claim is the coordinates of branchial space are the phase of the quantum amplitude

847
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:41,680
So in other words what that means so so just to sort of perhaps for for people's benefit

848
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:45,360
Maybe we can explain something about so, you know

849
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:52,480
I don't know how how to we can try doing let's see you probably can do this better than I can but but explain the quantum phase

850
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,800
But you know the idea the way that I just say it is that you know the

851
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:04,080
The wave function for a single particle is like a wave sometimes. It's positive sometimes. It's negative or plus or minus i so

852
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,480
different contributions can

853
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,280
destructively interfere as well as constructively interfere

854
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,960
Right but the critical idea in a sense is as you have that wave that's going up and down

855
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,880
The phase of the wave is at a particular moment in time

856
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:25,760
Are you up or are you down right and the phase is kind of the shifting of that wave relative to a particular moment in time

857
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,520
so what we're saying is the these the the um

858
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:35,040
This branchial space represents kind of where the

859
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:42,960
Where that thing is shifted that a position in branchial space corresponds to a certain shift of that of that thing

860
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:48,720
So so here's the place where where it's actually my favorite result so far in our physics project, okay

861
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,840
So um, which is worth explaining because then we can talk about double-slot experiment a little bit more easily

862
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,880
Okay, so let's talk about physical space

863
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:03,440
One of the questions is if you are if you have an object a particle for example in physical space

864
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:08,800
How will it move in physical space and the standard idea of general relativity?

865
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,960
Is an and of actually Newtonian physics is it moves?

866
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:17,200
You know according to a shortest path from one from one point to another

867
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,960
So it's like whatever the shortest path is in space. It'll go

868
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,240
Along that shortest path if space is flat the shortest path will be a straight line

869
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:31,520
If space is curved the shortest path might be deformed and the big idea of you know

870
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:35,840
In einstein's equations and so on is the deformation of space the curvature of space

871
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:40,880
Is produced by the presence of energy momentum by the presence of mass in space

872
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:48,080
So essentially what we're saying is gd6 in space are deflected by the presence of energy gd6 shortest paths in space

873
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,520
Are deflected by the presence of energy. That's kind of a version of what's happening in general relativity, okay

874
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,080
So now let's look at these multi-way graphs

875
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:01,280
so the the derivation of the einstein equations and the

876
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:08,400
Deflection of gd6 by the presence of energy is something we can do on in terms of our

877
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,440
You know rewriting of hypergraphs and a bunch of mathematics associated with that

878
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,840
So it's sort of a mathematical result from that

879
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:21,600
Now something very analogous to that mathematical result is also true for the multi-way graph

880
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,360
and what then happens is the gd6

881
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,840
Essentially in branchial space the shortest paths in this branchial space

882
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,040
Are also deflected by the presence of energy momentum

883
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:39,040
Okay, so this is where it gets that's really fun because the the the sort of the

884
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:44,080
You know the sort of a good core formulation of quantum mechanics is the Feynman path integral

885
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:49,200
And the Feynman path integral says you look at all these possible paths of history

886
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:54,320
And you say the phase the quantum phase associated with the path of history

887
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:00,720
Is you know e to the is over h bar where s is this quantity the so called the action

888
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,200
Which is a an integral of Lagrangian density

889
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:12,160
Which is essentially the aversion of the amount of energy momentum in a particular region of something

890
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,560
Now in our world that that's a particular region of branchial space

891
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:20,800
effectively the density of energy momentum in branchial space

892
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,240
Leads to the deflection of gd6 in branchial space

893
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:30,320
And so what does that mean if the if the position in branchial space is the phase of the quantum amplitude

894
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:34,560
That means the deflection of a gd6 is a change of phase

895
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:41,120
And the Feynman path integral is precisely telling you that the presence of energy momentum

896
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,680
Leads to a change of phase in a quantum amplitude

897
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:50,160
So what it's saying is the sort of the the bigger picture here is that the the same mathematics

898
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:54,480
That leads to the Einstein equations in space time

899
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:00,720
Leads to the Feynman path integral in in multi-way graphs and branchial space and so on so in a sense

900
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,280
these two sort of fundamental principles of 20th century physics

901
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:12,320
General relativity and quantum mechanics and our models are basically the same thing except that the

902
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:16,560
General relativity is a story of what happens in space time and

903
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,960
the

904
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,960
In quantum mechanics the story of what happens in what we sometimes call branch time

905
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,560
The thing you get which is the sort of class of branchial space

906
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,560
together with time

907
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,880
So this might be this might be a very unfair question

908
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:37,440
But I think there's something super simple that I am missing here, which is I just don't see where the negative numbers come in

909
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,520
I hear you saying that

910
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:45,920
There's this position in branchial space as a phase and I get that if that is true you get the result you want to have

911
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,240
But why are there a little bit more complicated?

912
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,480
I just the simplest possible

913
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,960
Explanation for the negative numbers would make me happy in other words the reason why you can

914
01:08:55,680 --> 01:09:02,960
Interfer as well as add your probabilities. Let me explain. Yeah, I explain so so let's say you're doing a double-slut experiment

915
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,800
Okay, the photon can go through one slit. It can go through the other slit

916
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,760
Those two possibilities

917
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,600
The question is

918
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:17,280
Where do those different possible paths for the photon? Where are they in branchial space and physical space?

919
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:20,800
They're going through two slits the question is where are they in branchial space?

920
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,320
If those two possibilities wind up

921
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,680
At essentially the same point in branchial space

922
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,800
That is that they end up with the same phase

923
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,040
If those two things wind up at opposite ends of branchial space

924
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:41,920
Those two possible paths of the photon end up in two radically different pieces of branchial space

925
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:45,840
Okay, so what so the issue is how does an observer?

926
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:51,280
Observe what's going on. So this is again. I'm afraid there's another level of concept. We have to have here

927
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,680
Which is how an observer

928
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:58,640
Makes sense of what's going on in the quantum universe. Sure. So the one of the issues is

929
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,920
When you are an observer embedded within the universe

930
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,520
you

931
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,320
Well, we can talk about spacetime and causal and the

932
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:13,280
Let's forget spacetime for a second in this in this world of multi-way graphs and branching and merging and so on

933
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,280
One of the things that's a little bit brain twisting is you as an observer

934
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,960
Are also branching you're part of this multi-way graph

935
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:27,520
So the question of quantum mechanics is how does a branching brain perceive a branching universe?

936
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:31,680
So in other words, your brain is branching just like the universe is branching

937
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,880
Okay, and so now what you have to do and this is where for example

938
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,880
The idea of a single thread of experience a single thread of time is important

939
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:45,840
Because the whole notion of us as observers is we have at least the fiction that our brain doesn't branch

940
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,960
We have the fiction that definite things happen

941
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,640
And so the question is how do we implement that fiction?

942
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:58,640
And then is the is our implementation of the fiction consistent with what we actually observe in the world

943
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:06,000
Okay, so the way that we a convenient way and this is an idea of jonathan gorod who's one of the people who's been working on this project is

944
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:11,280
The the what he calls the completion interpretation of quantum mechanics

945
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,960
Okay, and what it has to do with is

946
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,840
Imagine we've got a branch

947
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:25,680
But then say but the observer has to corral those branches together in order to believe that something definite happens

948
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,320
So how is the observer going to do that?

949
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:34,560
What the observer does is to just say i'm going to imagine that these two branches are equivalent

950
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,120
I'm just going to make a mathematical equivalence between them

951
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,520
And then i'm going to see what consequence does that have for my view of the universe

952
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,880
Okay, and and so that's the thing

953
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:51,600
So it might be the case that the view of the universe knitting together these branches would rapidly become incredibly inconsistent

954
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:57,920
But this causal invariance property implies that eventually these branches will merge

955
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,320
So eventually it's going to be okay

956
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,680
But the question of whether the observer can kind of speed that up

957
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,120
And say no i'm going to insist it's okay right now

958
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:12,400
Even though it might take a century for these branches from different parts of the universe to merge

959
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,280
It's okay to think of them as merging right now

960
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:20,480
So that's a that's a consequence mathematically of this causal invariance idea that it's possible to do that

961
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:25,440
But so in that interpretation what you're doing is you're essentially making completions

962
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,240
That try and corral back together these different branches of history

963
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:35,040
Okay, so what happens if the two photons wind up at opposite ends of branchial space

964
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:40,720
Basically, what happens is you and as an observer have to construct completions

965
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,120
That basically complete the whole universe

966
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:47,600
Because you're trying to get from one end of branchial space to another you're trying to knit everything together

967
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,640
And that means basically that photon as far as your concern isn't there

968
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,840
Because and so that's so essentially the reason that you're getting

969
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:04,240
You know destructive interference is that you as an observer simply can't knit it together to say there really is a photon here

970
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,040
It's like the photon has been just smashed

971
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:12,400
Into into pieces that are scattered over all over branchial space. You know what I could say

972
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,960
I actually did understand that

973
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,680
Even though I wasn't necessarily expecting to but

974
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,720
Uh, it seems and maybe this is again an unfair comment, but I'll let you riff on it

975
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:30,400
It seems like just like we thought we needed interpretations of quantum mechanics in the 1930s that somehow we need interpretations of

976
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,360
hypergraphs or growing hypergraphs. I mean it

977
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:40,160
The the story you just told which I'm perfectly willing to grant gets you the double slidics, etc

978
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,360
Does seem to involve some metaphysical

979
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,160
Interpretational steps along the way

980
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,320
Fair point. I mean this is this is why

981
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,080
This is a fundamental point in in our models

982
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,040
If we were not

983
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:59,760
Roughly the way we are we would not conclude that the laws of physics are the way they are

984
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,440
So consider the case of the gas molecules again

985
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:09,920
If we were one of these little demons that's able to compute everything about the gas molecules and do all those things

986
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:12,240
We wouldn't conclude that

987
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,720
Thermodynamics and hydrodynamics work the way they do. That's right. We would say

988
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:21,920
Oh, actually we noticed that these little correlations of of of molecules here and more on the other

989
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,400
And we'd get a completely different conclusion

990
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:32,240
So the fact that we derive quantum mechanics is a consequence of the fact that we are roughly the way we are

991
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,280
Not in detail with two eyes and you know all this kind of thing

992
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:41,040
But but in you know, so and in particular the fact that the branching brain

993
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:46,480
Perceiving the branching universe has the idea that definite things happen

994
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,360
That's critical if we didn't have that notion

995
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,040
And you can think about it in terms of how our brains work, you know

996
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,440
We got all these neurons firing all over our brains

997
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:02,720
And in a sense there wouldn't be any real reason to think that there will be a definite threat of experience that we have

998
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:07,120
It could just be you know, there's all these different things happening all throughout our brain

999
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:12,240
And it's you know, this is a this is a fundamental feature of our experience of the world

1000
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,560
Is that we believe there's a definite threat of time and so yes, that is necessary

1001
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,880
And you know, I think without that and it's interesting to think about it

1002
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:24,640
You know, what do the aliens so to speak think physics is like?

1003
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,200
Because you know, for example

1004
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:34,880
It it matters probably that we are roughly the size we are it mattered that we have this notion of single threat of time

1005
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:41,920
Um, you know, I I don't think we would recognize the aliens so to speak if they didn't have something like a single threat of time

1006
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,280
It doesn't just doesn't you know, I'm fond of making the comment, you know

1007
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,760
The weather has a mind of its own, you know

1008
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:52,400
It's got all this complicated hydrodynamic processes happening in the atmosphere and so on but yet

1009
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,280
We don't have the idea that it has some sort of, you know, human-like consciousness

1010
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:02,240
Usually at least depending on our animism our level of animism and psychism. Yeah

1011
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:08,400
But so but would I be then correct to conclude from that that you think that from this kind of

1012
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,120
fundamental setup with the hypergraphs and the updates and so forth

1013
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:17,360
We could not get a universe that was fundamentally classical and had you know observers like ourselves in it

1014
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:26,080
I think our models are very fundamentally quantum mechanical. I think that you can't really get, you know, what you can okay, so

1015
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:33,520
What you would have to do is say there is only one okay, here's a way you can get something that's like a classical universe

1016
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:40,000
And at first it sounds completely crazy, but let's say the universe was built using a Turing machine

1017
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,360
So a Turing machine is this model of computation that has

1018
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:49,760
You know, it's tape that has all this data on it and has this head that moves up and down

1019
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:54,080
Along the tape and at any moment it's only doing one thing

1020
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,200
It's only at the position of the head that anything changes

1021
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,400
And so you could say imagine a universe

1022
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:06,160
Where the where the Turing machine does a definite thing. Let me think about this for a second

1023
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,720
Um

1024
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,120
Yeah, I I let me think about this

1025
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:18,160
Is that right? Well, okay, so you can certainly imagine setting it up so that there is only one possible thread of time

1026
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:25,920
Because the Turing machine is an ordinary Turing machine and for every state it gets into it has only one possible successful state

1027
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:32,160
Um, and so you might say and so that would be a kind of degenerate form of model like ours

1028
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,520
That is classical. Yeah, okay. That's fair

1029
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:40,720
But but usually what's happening is there are many different places where things can happen

1030
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,720
So there are many choices of what can happen

1031
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,200
What what what you do

1032
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,680
Now what you do next et cetera, et cetera, et cetera

1033
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:54,640
And you know, I keep on I'm sort of dancing around one issue which we haven't talked about which is the notion of causal relationships

1034
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,800
Between updating events. So we've got two different updating events

1035
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,240
And we could say which one happens before which other one

1036
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,040
Well, if one of them

1037
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,600
Specifically if the output from one of them is used as the input to another one

1038
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:16,480
Then it better be the case the one whose output is being used occurs before the one that needs that output as input

1039
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:22,400
Right. So that defines a certain ordering on certain events have a definite ordering

1040
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,680
I mean in physics terms, those are the time like separated events

1041
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:30,800
Um the uh, and those those are events that are necessarily time like separated

1042
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,840
so then then there are other events that

1043
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:41,920
Could happen you could decide that you're going to say these two events happen simultaneously the the spacecraft landed on mars

1044
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:48,800
Right as I was eating lunch so to speak and you know, that was those were considered in the simultaneous events

1045
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,240
So one of the issues is given this

1046
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,280
Set of events that are happening

1047
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:02,160
There are certain causal relationships that is one event must occur before another event and you can make another kind of graph

1048
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,800
A so-called causal graph that represents that net of relationships

1049
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,920
And just to make things more complicated in the multi-way graph

1050
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
There is a multi-way causal graph

1051
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:18,240
Which says there are these events happening and events can be separated

1052
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,640
They can either be time like that is one event must occur before another event

1053
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,280
They can be space like in the sense that they can be at different positions in physical space

1054
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:32,800
Or they can also be branch like in the sense that they occur on different branches of quantum history

1055
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,440
And so all three of those things are possible time like space like branch like separation

1056
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
and that's uh

1057
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:44,480
And in fact the interplay between those things gets pretty interesting when you start talking about

1058
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,480
You know things in black holes and adf cft and all this kind of stuff

1059
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:53,840
That that's that's that's how though those kinds of things seem to come out is the relationship between

1060
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,640
Time like space like branch like separated events

1061
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:02,640
I mean you hinted at this a little bit, but uh, maybe to concisely say how you would characterize

1062
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:07,600
The solution to the measurement problem of quantum mechanics in your view

1063
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:13,200
I mean, there's a standard list of options with many worlds and hidden variables and dynamical collapses

1064
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Are you different than all of those?

1065
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,600
probably

1066
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,840
I mean, you know, I'm not sure because I I think that um

1067
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,000
Let's see. We have a much more microscopic view of what happens in measurement

1068
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:32,160
Because we're trying to describe the whole universe. We don't get to say

1069
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:37,200
Here's my quantum system and then outside of my quantum system is my measurement system

1070
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,880
Everything has to be part of the description that we're giving of the universe

1071
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:46,000
And so that's that's the first big big difference now. I think

1072
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,080
um

1073
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,280
If it depends what you mean by what the quantum measurement problem is

1074
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:55,920
So one one thing that I think is a a significant piece of the quantum measurement story

1075
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,280
Is why do people think that definite things happen?

1076
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:06,320
And um, so what essentially is going on is different quantum measurement different quantum frames

1077
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,840
cause people to believe at some moment that different things have happened

1078
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:17,200
But there's some sense in which there is a global consistency to what must happen

1079
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,040
So again in other words, so so the fact that there are two different outcomes from this measurement

1080
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,560
Is a consequence of the fact that the observer

1081
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,840
Can have defined two different quantum observation frames

1082
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,320
And that is what causes those different possible outcomes from the experiment

1083
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,880
It sounds like you're in some sense your closest in spirit to many worlds in the sense that

1084
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:46,880
Someone who believed in hidden variables or dynamical collapses would say that there just is one outcome for every measurement

1085
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,880
You don't need to think very hard about it

1086
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:55,280
Right. No, that's correct. I mean this this does not have that idea this this has the idea that the outcome

1087
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:00,800
Is in a sense based on the the frame in which with which the observer observes it

1088
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,720
So in a sense, it's kind of like a many worlds thing where you know, which branch did you go on?

1089
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:11,840
But the the difference is in a sense that in our situation those branches always eventually merge

1090
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:18,640
So in other words, even though you've picked a particular this observer at this moment has got this outcome

1091
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:23,360
That there will be eventual consistency in how the universe behaves

1092
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,040
Now, you know, have we figured all of this out? Not completely

1093
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:31,360
Let me give you an example of where sort of the frontier of what we understand and don't understand

1094
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,560
So an obvious question is what does it mean for quantum computing?

1095
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:39,280
So in quantum computing, there's kind of this notion that has been around since

1096
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:44,880
Since I first studied this stuff around 1981 or so that gosh in quantum mechanics

1097
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,880
There's this, you know, all these different possible paths of history

1098
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,440
And I happened to study this with dick Feynman

1099
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:57,360
So he was very into the multiple paths of history idea because that had been his his idea for a way of setting up quantum

1100
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,320
It does make sense

1101
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:03,600
It's like just think, you know, if you could get this this computation to not just go in one

1102
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Not just do one computation at a time

1103
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,200
But follow all these different possible paths of computation

1104
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:15,200
You could in parallel work out all these different different results and you'd be able to, you know, factor in just fast

1105
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,640
We didn't know about that at that time, but those kinds of things

1106
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,160
The so so the idea of quantum computing, you know

1107
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:27,760
The big hope is just use all those paths of history to do a different computation on each path

1108
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:32,080
But the you know, the next question is in the end

1109
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,560
We have to observe what the answer was

1110
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,560
And so in a sense, we've got all these threads of history that have all split apart

1111
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,400
They're all doing their different things

1112
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:46,640
We've got to corral all those threads of history back together again to make a definite measurement and say what happened

1113
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:54,800
And so in our models, we can actually ask what is microscopically involved in corraling those those threads of history back together

1114
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:59,040
And so in jonathan's setup of this completion interpretation

1115
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,280
We have at least a model of that

1116
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:06,640
Which is it involves these these completions these places where you assume that two branches are connected

1117
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:15,280
And by the way, the mathematical underpinning of that somewhat interesting the the mathematical underpinning comes from the theory of automated theorem proving

1118
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,080
Which is might seem irrelevant

1119
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:22,560
But it isn't and so the point is when you have in mathematics

1120
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:28,080
You say there's some axiom system you say, you know x plus y is always equal to y plus x

1121
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:33,120
You know x plus zero is equal to zero it's equal to x and so on and then you say

1122
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:35,680
Given those rules

1123
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,800
uh

1124
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,960
Is it, you know, can you prove that?

1125
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,200
x

1126
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,560
I don't know x

1127
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,560
You know some some some results in algebra

1128
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:52,160
Can you can you prove that results by by just and you say can I one way to think about that is can I get from one algebraic expression?

1129
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:59,040
To another algebraic expression just by making this series of moves that correspond to applying particular axioms

1130
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,560
So then if you say well, i'm starting off from one expression

1131
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:08,880
Now, let me apply those axioms in all possible ways and build up this whole graph of possible outcomes

1132
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:13,040
Well, what you build is precisely one of these multi-way graphs

1133
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,720
And that the the space of possible results that you can get starting from one expression

1134
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:23,760
What can you get as a multi-way graph and so automated theorem proving is the question of

1135
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:28,960
The proof of a theorem is a path that goes from one expression to another expression

1136
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,600
So automated theorem proving is about finding that path

1137
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,680
And so completions become the formation of lemmas

1138
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:42,640
So in mathematics you would say let's make a lemma that where we assume where we where we prove that this particular thing is equal to

1139
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:45,600
This thing and that's a piece that we'll use in our big proof

1140
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,240
And so these completions are essentially lemmas

1141
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,440
They are their assumptions about how the universe works

1142
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,520
That we are that we as observers are making and so one thing we can then ask for the quantum computing case

1143
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,280
Is how many such lemmas do we have to produce?

1144
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,840
Do we how much effort of knitting together the structure of branchial space?

1145
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,360
Do we observers have to do in order to conclude the result of the quantum computation?

1146
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,280
And it seems we're still nailing this down

1147
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:20,320
It's still a little bit messy, but it seems that you can never win with quantum computing

1148
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,520
That is that when you branch out in all these different ways

1149
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:30,880
The effort to corral things back together is at least as great as the gain that you get from things branching apart

1150
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,840
Now, you know to really nail that down

1151
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:40,560
We have to get ever better models of the observer and that's just not something that traditional models of quantum mechanics

1152
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:44,800
Traditional interpretations of quantum mechanics. They are out of that business because they just say

1153
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,360
And the observer works like this

1154
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:51,920
External to the quantum system, but we have to be more microscopic

1155
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,440
And say no, we're actually going to describe how the observer is working

1156
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,320
And so our best model so far is Jonathan's completion interpretation that

1157
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,960
That involves these potential lemmas being produced. I'm sorry

1158
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:13,440
There's a traditional understanding in well, there's an understanding in traditional quantum computing that there are some problems for which quantum mechanics

1159
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,800
Certainly gives you a speed up. Are you saying that's not true in your model?

1160
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,320
Yeah, I think I think it's not going to be true. That's my guess

1161
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,400
I think what's going to happen is, you know, if you take like Shaw's algorithm for factoring

1162
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:27,120
Yeah, which is primarily a quantum Fourier transform

1163
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:33,760
The you know that Fourier transform is done beautifully quickly because there are all these threads that are running in parallel

1164
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:40,160
The problem is every thread is somewhere in a different place in branchial space that thread

1165
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:46,960
But us observers, we have to corral all those things back together again in order to tell what actually happened

1166
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:52,480
And that's you know, so there's a you know, usually in quantum computing one just says and then there's a measurement

1167
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:56,160
Now in in actuality when you have an actual device

1168
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:02,400
You have all kinds of issues in making that measurement all kinds of how quickly does it deco here all these kinds of things

1169
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,640
There are all these kinds of very practical experimental

1170
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:10,720
You know features and I think people have generally said given the formalism of quantum mechanics

1171
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:15,200
It you know, it's like well all this quantum stuff happens and then boom

1172
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:20,480
We do a measurement and the boom we do a measurement is actually pretty difficult in practice with actual experiments

1173
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,760
But people have said but you know if we do these experiments well enough

1174
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:29,680
It'll become the mathematical idealization that you know von Neumann and others made about how measurement works

1175
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,960
And I don't think that's going to be true. I mean we're not sure yet

1176
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:39,280
But it seems likely that there will be no way to do to sort of that

1177
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,680
If you're honest about how the measurement works the measurement takes effort

1178
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:48,560
But are you saying that that's going to be a generic result about even conventional quantum mechanics?

1179
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,800
Or is this specific to your approach?

1180
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:57,200
Um, if you could if you could study how measurement works well enough in quantum mechanics

1181
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,640
Yes, the problem is in in traditional quantum mechanics

1182
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:05,280
It's like this is all the quantum. These are all the quantum amplitudes and the hammer comes down

1183
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:08,640
And it's you know the born rule or whatever and that's the end of it

1184
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:13,120
Um, and and so you don't you don't get to look inside that measurement process

1185
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,320
And when people you know, I'm I'm probably not you know

1186
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:19,040
one of the strange things that's happened to me in this physics project is that

1187
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,000
You know, I I knew about everything that was going on in physics

1188
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:25,120
Not everything perhaps but a lot of things 40 years ago

1189
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,720
And then I kind of went to sleep for 40 years and woke up again

1190
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:34,640
And it's remarkable. It's it's really cool actually to see you know a lot of stuff really didn't change

1191
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:40,560
And some stuff advanced and it's like, you know, I used to know the masses of all these elementary particles

1192
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:49,040
You know the mass of the lander is 1115 mev and now I look it up again. It's you know 1114.962 or something

1193
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:55,280
It's like that's um, uh, so, you know, there are things like that and they're also also mathematical ideas and so on

1194
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,280
But I'm not sure that I would know

1195
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,520
everything that people have done and kind of

1196
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:06,080
Sort of models of quantum measurement, but certainly back when I last knew about it in in great detail

1197
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:11,760
People were sort of starting to say and then we take the small number of quantum degrees of freedom

1198
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:17,200
That we're looking at as the quantum system and we let that sort of spread out in a larger number of quantum degrees of freedom

1199
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,800
Where eventually it will become unambiguous what happened

1200
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:25,680
For essentially thermodynamic reasons. Yeah, because it's it's more or less like, you know

1201
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:31,760
What happens in the gas getting randomized and in fact, this was a thing dick feinman and I worked on back when we were

1202
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,120
We were both consultants for a computer company in boston and we were

1203
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:40,160
I was insisting that we try to do something useful and we try to invent a quantum randomness chip

1204
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,880
And so we tried to think about how would you make?

1205
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:47,600
You know and those days one gigahertz seemed like an impossibly fast

1206
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:53,200
Cockrate for this chip, you know, how would you make quantum randomness that one gigahertz?

1207
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,960
And what we realized is, you know, you have this little quantum effect

1208
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:03,280
But then when you measure that effect you have to amplify it into a sort of classical number of degrees of freedom

1209
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:08,800
And that process in order for you to have an unambiguous result in in order for successive

1210
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,200
Bits that you measure to be uncorrelated

1211
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:15,920
You have to essentially have essentially sort of a thermodynamic phenomenon going on

1212
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:21,200
You have to be you know, it has to randomize then that that randomization has to not be correlated with the next thing

1213
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,960
It happens and that was that that was to me the first sort of sign

1214
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:28,160
That there was going to be a cost to measurement so to speak

1215
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:33,680
Well, if you if you start a podcast of your own you can have me on and we can talk about interpretations of quantum mechanics

1216
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,320
And that would be fun, but okay, you can teach me all about

1217
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:43,920
But I mean, I think that that that does help me understand a little bit because what you're what you're saying is that it's possible that your approach

1218
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:49,360
Um has a different attitude toward let's just say the measurement problem of quantum mechanics

1219
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:55,360
So the next obvious question is do you have a different attitude toward the schrodinger equation towards the unitary evolution?

1220
01:31:55,440 --> 01:32:00,400
I mean the conventional schrodinger equation is continuous in time and you're not continuous in time

1221
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:05,920
Are you getting the schrodinger equation as an approximation or is there some sense of which it's exact?

1222
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:11,600
Yeah, right. So so it's very similar and we don't know all the details of this yet

1223
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,960
But let's talk about the spacetime case

1224
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:16,880
In the spacetime case

1225
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,760
We've got these atoms of space and we've connections and so on

1226
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,320
And we're looking at things on a large scale

1227
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:28,560
And what should happen is that just like in a fluid where the molecules are bouncing around but on a large scale

1228
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:34,080
We get the fluid equations on a large scale. We should get the Einstein equations and that's what theoretically

1229
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:41,600
Theoretically we should get now when I say theoretically this is, you know, when physicists do mathematics

1230
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:46,640
They're really sloppy and you know, there are many limits that have to be taken

1231
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:52,320
Of um, uh, you know, it's the these these there's a certain amount of computational

1232
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:56,640
Reducibility which leads to a certain amount of randomness which leads to certain statistical averages

1233
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,600
working out in a certain way when you look at the

1234
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:05,200
You know the distances have to be large compared to the elementary distance between atoms of space

1235
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:10,160
And small compared to the size of the universe and the curvature has to be small blah blah blah blah blah

1236
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,920
A whole bunch of conditions

1237
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:17,680
But with all of those conditions in physicists level mathematics, we can derive Einstein's equations

1238
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:23,600
Now it's worth pointing out that the effort to derive the fluid equations from molecular dynamics

1239
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:26,080
Has been unsuccessful for a hundred years

1240
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,800
That is with with a level of you know

1241
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:34,880
We can derive Einstein's equations with the same level of kind of mathematical rigor that you can derive the fluid equations

1242
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:38,000
Which is to say it isn't really mathematically rigorous

1243
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,280
But if you take all kinds of limits that that and one advantage that we have actually one big advantage

1244
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:46,320
That I always forget is that we've done endless simulations

1245
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:52,480
But we actually know what limits work and what don't right so it's not like it's just let's hope this works based on

1246
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,080
You know some mathematical

1247
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:58,800
Sort of hope it's it's like we we ran an experiment with a billion cases

1248
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:02,080
And this is what happened so we can kind of check those assumptions

1249
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:07,520
But but okay, so so what then happens is what we are saying is that

1250
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:11,040
The from this kind of microscopic atoms of space thing

1251
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:16,160
When we do that when we look at that on a large scale we reproduce steinstein's equations

1252
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:19,360
So one of the things that we've been doing recently

1253
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:25,680
Jonathan has been much involved in this has been saying well, what about practical numerical relativity?

1254
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:30,000
So people study, you know black hole mergers and they do that by taking

1255
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:34,800
You know the the the structure of the black holes and they say we have steinstein's equations

1256
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,880
which are partial differential equations and

1257
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:40,960
Then we will but in order to make those work on a computer

1258
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:45,360
We have to discretize them because a computer deals digitally with with

1259
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:48,240
sort of digital elements

1260
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:50,000
and

1261
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,200
So then you make numerical relativity where you've made some kind of mesh

1262
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:57,920
That represents some approximation to spacetime as

1263
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:03,120
You know approximating the spacetime of steinstein's equations. So that's kind of the traditional approach

1264
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:07,440
Now what we're doing instead is to work upwards from the atoms so to speak

1265
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:11,040
So we're saying instead of going down from the steinstein equations

1266
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:15,440
Just come up from this kind of structure of this this hypergraph

1267
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,440
and and

1268
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,280
Look at you know, what is the aggregate behavior of all these atoms of space?

1269
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:26,880
The neat thing is that it actually works and it's a practical method for doing numerical relativity

1270
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:30,800
So and in fact, it's looking really promising to

1271
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:37,520
As a and what's interesting. So this is now a general relativity just a side comment for general relativity

1272
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,560
So one thing you can ask is so obviously in our simulations

1273
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,240
The

1274
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:47,120
We have these atoms of space and we simulate on a computer

1275
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:53,520
I think the extreme kind of amusing version is jonathan has been doing all these simulations on his laptop

1276
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,600
Just to prove that that's possible

1277
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:01,680
Which I think is totally crazy. Yeah, but so he has these simulations of black hole mergers and things done on his laptop

1278
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:08,400
Using our models you could do a lot better if you weren't just using a laptop. But anyway the the um, uh, the thing

1279
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:15,280
That is a so it's not obvious that we would be able to get enough approximation to continuum space

1280
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,160
Just kind of on a laptop from our atoms of space rather than having to go

1281
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:24,880
You know many many many orders of magnitude, but it seems that that works

1282
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,680
So the next question is in physical space

1283
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:31,360
Where might we see evidence of discreteness in spacetime?

1284
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:37,840
So in other words the in other words, is there a way of making essentially a gravitational microscope that will

1285
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:43,200
see into the structure of spacetime and so one of the things we've looked at

1286
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:48,880
Is rapidly rotating back holes right close to the critical, you know close to j equals m

1287
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:55,280
What happens and it's pretty neat because in these in these simulations that jonathan has

1288
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:02,160
What you see is the thing eventually as you go above the critical angular momentum critical spin rate for the black hole

1289
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,040
A piece of space simply separates

1290
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,080
So okay another thing to explain is in our models of physics

1291
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,920
This network doesn't have a built-in notion of dimension

1292
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,840
So, you know our experience is space is three-dimensional, but this network

1293
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:21,600
Doesn't have any particular number of dimensions that are built into it

1294
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:26,080
It can be the case that on a large scale it approximates three-dimensional space

1295
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:31,040
But because it doesn't have a fixed number of dimensions because it isn't

1296
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:38,800
Microscopically a manifold so to speak it can do things like it can change its topology things can there can be tears that form in it

1297
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:44,960
There can be holes that form in it and so on and or more extremely there can be pieces of the universe that just break off

1298
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:51,920
And so what we see happening at for critical supercritical black holes is a piece of the universe just breaks off

1299
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,000
and as

1300
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
as it at the critical

1301
01:37:56,240 --> 01:38:00,160
Angular momentum what you see is that a piece of the universe is hanging by a thread

1302
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:05,920
And so there are these small number of causal edges that essentially connect one part of the universe to others

1303
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:09,360
And so it's conceivable that we may get some kind of

1304
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:12,240
signature maybe in gravitational radiation

1305
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:17,120
Of that discreteness, you know in physics terms probably shot noise

1306
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:25,120
Associated with the fact that there is a that there are a small number of causal edges that are associated with that with that situation

1307
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:28,560
So anyway, that's but that's just the general relativity case

1308
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:32,400
In the quantum mechanics case, you're asking about the schrodinger equation

1309
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:34,720
So the schrodinger equation has to emerge

1310
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,360
As a pile of limits

1311
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:43,920
From the things that we're doing because the schrodinger equation is a non-rotivistic limit of a et cetera, et cetera, et cetera

1312
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:48,480
So the answer is I I think I mean, I'm sorry just to be just to be super clear

1313
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,360
I'm using the generalized version of the schrodinger equation

1314
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:56,400
That would be just as true for quantum field theory and relativity and everything just h psi equals i d by dt

1315
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:59,680
Psi unitary evolution of the wave function, right?

1316
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,760
So so we are

1317
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:08,320
From the setup of these multi-way graphs and the interpretation of quantum amplitudes. We are guaranteed unitary unitary evolution

1318
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,880
100 not as an approximation

1319
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:12,480
that that

1320
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,480
You think about that for a second

1321
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:19,040
It's a little tricky because you have to define what the initial and final states are

1322
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:23,840
And if you if you say I have the whole multi-way graph of everything

1323
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:25,680
I think you're guaranteed it

1324
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:31,360
But if you say if you say i'm going to make an i'm going to look at a particular region of spacetime

1325
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:38,640
I think it's not so obvious. I think there. Oh sure. Yeah, that's that's that's just true and even in the regular schrodinger equation

1326
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:43,520
So that I'm yeah, yeah, I think that I think let me think about that for a second. I think

1327
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,400
that

1328
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,120
Let me see. I mean quantum measurement is non unitary

1329
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:53,040
That's a that's a thing that we that we have to deal with but a many worlds person says

1330
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:56,480
That's just because you're only seeing part of the wave function in exactly the same way that you are

1331
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:02,000
Right, right, but I'm a little concerned about the statement that the um, uh

1332
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,480
See the

1333
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:08,080
That the statement about the the way the hamiltonian appears there

1334
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,400
In the in the non relativistic schrodinger equation is certainly not what we're seeing

1335
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:17,280
So because we have a you know, our thing is sort of relativistic from the get-go

1336
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:22,960
Um, and so what I think let me think about this for a second. Well, you could define it in terms of the path integral

1337
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:29,440
I mean, is any unitary evolution from one one wave function to another one quantum state to another between an initial

1338
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:34,640
Hypersurface and a final hypersurface. I think you inevitably get unitary evolution

1339
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:38,880
But you have to define what those hypersurfaces are as you do and you know

1340
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:45,360
As as you do when you merge your relativity and quantum general relativity and quantum mechanics. So I think it's um, I'm

1341
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,680
uh

1342
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:50,720
I think that's right. I I I would have to um

1343
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:53,920
I mean the the part of this

1344
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,520
Yeah, I think that that has to be that way

1345
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,000
Okay, I mean the part that we've been interested in recently

1346
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:07,520
Is can we make a practical scheme for doing quantum field theory in the same way that we can make a practical scheme scheme for dealing with

1347
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,120
Einstein's equations

1348
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:15,280
And so in a sense, you know, one of the things that all it encourages me in this project is

1349
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,760
What I might call proof by compilation

1350
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,520
That is the fact, you know, you say do you really get Einstein's equations?

1351
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:27,440
Well, we can do numerical relativity and it actually works and we can do you know black hole mergers and things

1352
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:31,520
So if Einstein's equations, I'll write them, you know, what we're doing is the same

1353
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:33,360
and

1354
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:37,200
In quantum mechanics, we've been able to do this compilation of quantum circuits

1355
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:41,280
The next big challenge is to do quantum field theory and to do

1356
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,840
And to be able to do things like few particle quantum mechanics

1357
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,400
And you know those kinds of things

1358
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:52,320
You know, for example, let me give you an example of how things got a little bit complicated

1359
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,960
So in in quantum mechanics, you know, a very traditional thing is the harmonic oscillator

1360
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,880
Just kind of the analog of you know, things bouncing on a spring back and forth

1361
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:05,520
In order to get that in our models you have to have closed time like curves

1362
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:09,840
So in other words to get a perfect harmonic oscillator

1363
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:14,320
It's very easy to have a perfect harmonic oscillator if you have closed time like curves

1364
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:20,480
In other words, if the if the history of the universe recapitulate if the history of the universe repeats itself

1365
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:26,480
That's kind of how you get something like a harmonic oscillator. That's how you get the idealization of a harmonic oscillator

1366
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:32,800
Now in the real situation in physics, we probably don't believe that there are perfect harmonic oscillators

1367
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:36,400
We can decompose quantum fields into you know, as

1368
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:42,960
Let's think of it as a sum of harmonic oscillators, but we're not imagining there's a perfect harmonic oscillator here

1369
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:48,880
But if you say you might say and this is relates to the kind of reverse engineering versus building from the ground up

1370
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:53,520
So to speak you might say gosh, how can you think you have a model of quantum mechanics?

1371
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,400
If you can't even have the harmonic oscillator

1372
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,800
But well, we can have a harmonic oscillator

1373
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:04,720
But it's a weird idealization, which in our models shows up with with closed time like curves

1374
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:09,120
And so that's you know, that's an example of how things get a little you know

1375
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,200
If you insist on these idealizations

1376
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,920
You end up sort of stressing

1377
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:19,840
As I think you should you kind of stress the model. So it's similar to you know, if you said

1378
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:27,200
I'm you say I'm studying molecular dynamics. Okay, so then somebody says well, why can't you get rigid body mechanics?

1379
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:31,920
Why can't you get you know, this thing with a solid object that just moves around and doesn't distort?

1380
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:36,560
Well, that's a complicated limit of molecular dynamics that involves, you know

1381
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:41,680
Input atomic forces are large compared to the you know forces on the whole object blah, blah, blah

1382
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:44,000
You know, it's it's um

1383
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,680
That's a complicated story

1384
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:49,200
And I think we're seeing some one of the things that's difficult about our model

1385
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:53,200
Is that it attempts to be a model for everything so you don't get to say

1386
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:56,960
We're going to have them of this piece. We're going to make a model for that piece

1387
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,480
We're going to idealize away

1388
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:04,800
You have to kind of everything has to come together and that means that seeing things like how does the harmonic oscillator work

1389
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:08,640
It's a weird idealization. Yeah, that that does make sense

1390
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:13,920
If you get exactly unitary evolution that is to say you get something like the Schrodinger equation

1391
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:19,920
Um, I mean a many worlds person will say all there is is the Schrodinger equation. You just need to pick the Hamiltonian

1392
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:23,360
Um and someone like me if I can indulge myself, you know

1393
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:30,320
Our project is to start from a nothing but a Hamiltonian expressed as a list of energy eigenvalues and show how there's an emergent

1394
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:34,480
Geometric structure that looks like a graph you get Einstein's equation and the whole thing

1395
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:37,760
It's it's similar in spirit. Uh in that sense to what you're doing

1396
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:40,240
But so then the question is

1397
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,880
If you exactly get unitary evolution

1398
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:48,560
What is the benefit to not just starting with quantum mechanics in the Schrodinger equation versus starting with hypergraphs?

1399
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:55,760
Well, because you have a whole structure that you're building. So I mean for example when you say, what's the Hamiltonian?

1400
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,440
You know

1401
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:02,320
That better come out of our model. So for example, you could ask which we haven't discussed. What is energy in our model?

1402
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,280
Okay, this is one of the things that surprised me

1403
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:08,320
I thought energy was going to be a very difficult to derive idea

1404
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:12,240
That was going to require notions of what particles are and so on and so on and so on

1405
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:14,880
It seems that energy is very simple

1406
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:18,800
it's basically the amount of activity in the hypergraph

1407
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,200
And a little bit more formally

1408
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:26,720
It's the flux of causal edges through space like hypersurfaces and it's concerned and it needs to be said

1409
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,280
I mean that so a causal edge is

1410
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:32,560
Is a is a causal connection between two updating events?

1411
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:36,160
And so the question is if you have a

1412
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:40,320
You have to say it a little bit more carefully because if you say it's the density of activity

1413
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:43,760
It's what the heck does density mean when we don't have a notion of space yet

1414
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:49,040
So the more formal thing is energy is the flux of causal edges through space like hypersurfaces

1415
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:52,640
momentum is the flux of causal edges through time like hypersurfaces

1416
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:54,720
and

1417
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:55,840
the

1418
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,040
um

1419
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:01,280
Actually, you you now make me wonder and I don't think I know the answer to this

1420
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:06,160
What is the flux of edges through branch like hypersurfaces?

1421
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:10,080
I should know the answer to that and I don't immediately know and that's that's um

1422
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:12,640
That that's related to okay

1423
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:18,640
So so the point here is there's a I think see one of the things that's interesting in our models

1424
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,320
Is the relationship between quantum energy and classical energy?

1425
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:27,840
Because in our models, it's the this notion of in classical energy

1426
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:32,080
It's the you know, you've got this single thread of history

1427
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:37,120
You've got this causal graph associated with that thread of history and you're asking this flux of causal edges

1428
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:40,320
But now you can also have this multi-way causal graph

1429
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:46,000
Which not only has space like separation of events, but also branch like separation events

1430
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:51,680
So events can be separated in in in in branch of space and in and in physical space

1431
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:55,360
and then the idea is that quantum energy

1432
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,240
is that activity in

1433
01:46:58,960 --> 01:46:59,920
uh

1434
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:01,360
in

1435
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:02,560
This whole multi-way graph

1436
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:05,040
So it's the amount of activity in the multi-way causal graph

1437
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:09,920
And so then like the Lagrangian is this relatively invariant

1438
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:14,080
That this is the you know the Lagrangian density is that

1439
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,480
that kind of

1440
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:21,440
You know relatively invariant notion of the amount of activity in this multi-way causal graph

1441
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:24,720
And so for example one one little mystery that this

1442
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:28,800
Seems to clear up is the thing if you look at the Planck length

1443
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:32,480
You know the characteristic length people often talk about for where

1444
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,600
Sort of quantum mechanics and gravity have to kind of come together

1445
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:39,600
In our models the elementary length is much smaller than the Planck length

1446
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:43,680
And in the a typical thing is the Planck energy

1447
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:49,440
Well, whereas the Planck length is you know 10 to the minus 34 meters or whatever it is the the Planck come

1448
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,320
The Planck energy

1449
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:55,840
Is 10 to the 19 electron volts if I remember correctly gv

1450
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,200
And um

1451
01:47:57,200 --> 01:48:01,680
What's that 10 to the 19 g e v g e v. Okay. Thank you

1452
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:07,280
But it's about the you know, it's about the energy in a thunderbolt or something and a lightning strike

1453
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:10,160
It's huge not a very small quantum thing

1454
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,800
um in our models

1455
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:15,600
The elementary energy is also small

1456
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:18,160
because the elementary energy is

1457
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:22,560
an individual causal edge in the multi-way causal graph

1458
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,600
And the fact that what you observe

1459
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:31,120
Is is this thing that the the analog of the Planck energy is something that has been average

1460
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:36,160
That has been sort of summed over all possible branches in this multi-way causal graph

1461
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:39,200
I mean, this is maybe this is a footnote. Don't forget this

1462
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,800
This is just a there's just a part of the the story

1463
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:45,120
But but so you're you're saying

1464
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:49,840
Why do we care about this whole structure that we're building? Why not just put a hamiltonian in there?

1465
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:52,160
and what i'm saying is the um

1466
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:59,200
For for listeners who don't know this hamiltonians and lagrangians are closely related. Sure. They're they're sorry

1467
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:03,440
We did that I think for you and me. That's pretty obvious, right? Yeah, that may not be um

1468
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:05,280
That may not be obvious

1469
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:11,760
But but in some sense you're like we said there's a simple set of rules that you start with and I mean maybe maybe I can just jump

1470
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:17,360
I'm going to try to guess what you're uh thinking here and then you can tell me whether I'm right or wrong

1471
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:20,320
There's an infinite number of hamiltonians I can write down

1472
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:25,040
But at least for simple ones there's a finite set of little rules that we can write down for our hypergraphs

1473
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:28,720
So maybe there's a map from the set of rules to hamiltonians

1474
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:36,000
But it's a very very, you know one, you know few to few rather than covering the whole space of possible hamiltonians

1475
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,640
Right. Well, so this is a good question

1476
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:40,880
As you look at

1477
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,080
simple

1478
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,920
You know rewrite rules for hypergraphs

1479
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:50,640
You get some set of hamiltonians if you say oh, I'm gonna have a million line program to represent my rules for the hypergraph

1480
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:54,000
Then you're going to get some other, you know, you can kind of custom engineer

1481
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:59,360
Whatever hamiltonian you want probably got it. Okay, so it is not self-evident, you know

1482
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,480
What kind of hamiltonians you get?

1483
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:07,600
From simple update rules. We don't entirely know so for example

1484
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:11,200
It looks like we get ones that show local gauge invariance

1485
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:17,760
And then we have to ask, you know, and that's a that's a, you know, if you just pick your average hamiltonian

1486
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,480
There's no particular reason for it to have local gauge invariance

1487
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,520
But in our models it probably does

1488
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,280
And so that's a good sign now, you know, will we get

1489
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:31,760
You know, what other attributes will we like our hamiltonians for the universe to have?

1490
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:37,440
Well, I mean, you know my approach here is to just say let's see what we get

1491
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:40,800
And for example, okay, so here's one of the complicated things

1492
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:47,040
So the hamiltonians that you will typically write down in in in quantum field theory. They are

1493
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:55,040
The things that are in those hamiltonians, Lagrangians, whatever are quantum fields their quantum fields that represent

1494
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:58,640
You know

1495
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:01,840
Field operators that correspond to particular particles

1496
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:06,880
Right, so there'll be an electron quantum field. There'll be a photon quantum field and so on

1497
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:10,640
Now in our models, we're not yet talking about particles

1498
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:12,640
So those

1499
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,640
Hamiltonians have to be

1500
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:18,960
What we have is a description of things at a much lower level

1501
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:23,280
Than a place where you've got actual field operators for particles

1502
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:28,880
So for us that what are the particles the particles are locally stable

1503
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,040
kind of

1504
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:35,680
Defirmations in this in this hypergraph. So for example an analogy in fluid mechanics

1505
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:39,360
If you say what's like a particle in fluid mechanics, well a vortex

1506
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:45,760
You know a kind of whirlpool like thing in a fluid that is locally stable and it can move through the fluid and it can

1507
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:50,160
Trap with other vortices. It's something vaguely similar to that in our hypergraphs

1508
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:52,960
More a kind of topological structure

1509
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,640
That is some kind of not yet very well understood

1510
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,640
feature that is locally stable under the rules

1511
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:06,240
And so when you talk about field operators that would occur in, you know, your average

1512
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,720
communal garden particle physics Lagrangian

1513
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:10,240
those

1514
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:12,640
field operators are effective

1515
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,880
descriptions of

1516
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,880
These deformations these topological

1517
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:23,120
These topologically stable objects in this hypergraph the hypergraph is a lower level description

1518
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,840
And so it takes, you know, it's not obvious

1519
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:29,280
And it's a very good question and we don't know

1520
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,840
You know, how does

1521
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:36,160
How does the thing that looks like it operates in terms of particles?

1522
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:38,000
How does that emerge?

1523
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:44,480
You know, what kind of things that look like they're in terms of particles emerge from this lower level structure because because in our models

1524
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:46,240
You know

1525
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:48,560
All we have at the beginning is the structure of space

1526
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:52,080
Particles are just features of the structure of space

1527
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:56,160
And they are, you know, so there's an underlying dynamic

1528
01:52:56,240 --> 01:53:02,080
I mean one of the things that sort of a little shocking in our models is that most of the activity of the universe

1529
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:09,040
Is is associated with the maintenance of the structure of space and has nothing to do with all the particles that we observe in space

1530
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:12,160
So that that's a and so what what?

1531
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:13,680
I mean

1532
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:16,000
So it's a it's a it's a very reasonable question

1533
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:23,840
How the Hamiltonians that we're used to in particle physics emerge as effective Hamiltonians from this underlying dynamics

1534
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:28,240
And we don't yet know the answer. Well, you know, I mean you mentioned the particles

1535
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:32,320
As something that does come out as these persistent structures. So

1536
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:35,200
But but as you certainly know

1537
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:43,520
Quantum field theory the the usual modern physics way of saying things is that fields are somehow more fundamental when you perturb them and excite them

1538
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,000
You get particle like things. There are

1539
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:51,440
Circumstances, you know, like the condensation of the Higgs field where the particle language is not appropriate

1540
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:56,480
Is there is there a view toward a more field like ontology coming out of this?

1541
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:02,640
Well, I think that okay, so again, this this is if we say

1542
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:08,000
When we talk about particles in particle physics

1543
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:14,800
They are as you say sort of, you know, what we imagine is oh, there's a particle. It's not interacting with anything

1544
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:18,800
It's you know, it's separated from everything else. It has a definite momentum

1545
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:23,440
It is a definite mode of the quantum field and when it comes close to other particles

1546
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:28,080
Then, you know, it gets more complicated and there are other modes of the quantum field that get excited

1547
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:33,200
And eventually some other particle goes out and you observe it in a particle detector, but the the

1548
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:39,280
So for us we have to think about what do those scattering experiments look like?

1549
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:43,120
What is an experiment where you have that separated particle?

1550
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:48,720
And this is one of the cases where, you know, the we are building everything from the ground up

1551
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:53,520
So we don't get to say. Oh, it's just a separated particle in the vacuum. So to speak

1552
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:56,880
It's a an excitation of some kind

1553
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:04,080
Embedded in the space that is that has a lot of activity in it. So so for example when we talk about

1554
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:10,880
You know, so one of the things that I'm wondering is will there be bizarrely different kinds of stable structures

1555
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:14,960
In our hypergraph that aren't like the particles we're used to

1556
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:20,640
So in other words, you know, you mentioned the Higgs field the Higgs field is a case where we have this condensate

1557
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:24,400
Where we have a sort of uniform value of the Higgs field throughout space

1558
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:31,280
And that's you know, that's a simple case. There are, you know, people know about, you know, soliton type solutions to field equations

1559
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:37,680
And you know, there are other kinds of things like that and one of the possibilities is that in our models

1560
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:44,160
Particularly because we have this dimension variation that there might be bizarrely different stable structures

1561
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:50,960
That could exist in the context of our models that don't seem like particles of the ordinary kind but that wouldn't mentor

1562
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:55,920
And things like that might be something bizarrely different. Maybe it's even related to something, you know

1563
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,160
Maybe it's related to dark matter for all we know

1564
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:00,800
I mean, it's just something that could exist

1565
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:06,480
As a as a sort of stable feature of our universe that goes beyond just the structure of space

1566
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:12,000
But it has a form that we don't yet don't yet understand and I think I mean in in

1567
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:15,760
The the other thing to realize so in standard particle physics

1568
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:20,880
We talk about virtual particles, you know, you can they're always part these particle antiparticle pairs that

1569
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:25,200
That are sort of popping into existence in the vacuum for a very short time and then annihilating

1570
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:31,280
So in and and one of the features of that it's always been somewhat mysterious in quantum field theory

1571
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:37,760
Because quantum field theory says there's an infinite number of these virtual particles that are occurring all over the universe

1572
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:44,000
And that corresponds to effectively a very high energy density of stuff in the universe

1573
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:45,360
How can that be?

1574
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:49,440
How can it not in einstein's equations say, you know, whenever you have energy

1575
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:53,040
You're going to curl up the universe with, you know, gravitational attraction

1576
01:56:53,360 --> 01:57:00,000
Associate without energy. How can the universe not curl up into a tiny ball because of these vacuum fluctuations of virtual particles?

1577
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:06,560
Well in our models the those the sort of limiting case of those virtual particles

1578
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:09,200
Is these actual?

1579
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:11,840
rewrite rules in our

1580
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:13,440
In our hypergraph

1581
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:18,000
So in other words the this sort of the ultimate version of all of those virtual particles

1582
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:20,720
It's just all these little rewrite rules in the hypergraph

1583
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:24,000
Which in our models are exactly what create the structure of space

1584
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:28,000
So in a sense that makes it a little less mysterious

1585
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:33,360
That, you know, all of this virtual particle stuff doesn't have this terrible effect

1586
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:36,320
This terrible gravitational effect on the universe

1587
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:42,960
Now you can ask things like, you know, can you imagine how the Higgs mechanism works and all these kinds of things?

1588
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:46,880
And yes, I've thought about that and there's a there's a certain amount you can say

1589
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:48,880
I don't think we we we can't um

1590
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:52,240
I mean, I was very disappointed when the Higgs particle was discovered

1591
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,400
I kind of knew it was going to happen

1592
01:57:54,400 --> 01:58:00,240
but it was it was um, uh, it was kind of like like it's kind of a hack and it's disappointing that

1593
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:02,720
You know, it it looks

1594
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:04,880
So far the Higgs mechanism looks like a hack

1595
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:09,360
And the question is can we make it look less like a hack and that will be really neat

1596
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:15,440
So one little footnote is that uh, you might be interested in work by tom banks and willy fishler who have

1597
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:20,240
Emphasized within the context of more or less conventional quantum gravity

1598
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:26,400
The point you just made about the cosmological constant that we should not think about it as the sum of all these virtual fluctuations

1599
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:29,120
We should think of it as an input a boundary condition

1600
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:33,680
They call it that uh, just sets the size of space in some sense. So that's more in line

1601
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:39,920
I think with the philosophy that you're thinking of. I knew tom banks, but when we were both at the institute for advanced study in the

1602
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:45,360
In probably 1980 or something. I haven't I'm great. I'm glad he's I'm glad he's doing interesting things

1603
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,480
and then the and the other point was I mean

1604
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:52,640
I don't want to dwell on all of these, but I presume that

1605
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:57,440
If your program pans out we will want to find

1606
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:02,480
Solutions to the classic puzzles of particle physics

1607
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:08,560
So not just the cosmological constant problem, but the hierarchy problem, you know, the strong cp problem barrio genesis

1608
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:13,600
Are these the kinds of things I'm guessing that I would have heard already if you would solve them

1609
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:16,480
But maybe are they solvable you think within the program?

1610
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:23,760
Uh, you know eventually they should be I mean we can we can start sort of teasing apart what each of them involves

1611
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:29,120
I mean, you know the oh, there are three generations of particles and um, you know

1612
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:38,240
The question is what's generic and what's not so the surprise for me is that general relativity and quantum mechanics seem to be generic

1613
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:40,720
Just as thermodynamics is generic

1614
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:43,760
And the question is how far does the generosity go?

1615
01:59:44,240 --> 01:59:46,240
Because I wouldn't have expected

1616
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:52,720
Well, for example, I wouldn't have expected the the detailed form of Einstein's equations to be as generic as they seem to be

1617
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:56,080
so, um, and you know, it could be

1618
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:00,240
I I'm I have this vague suspicion that

1619
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:06,880
The structure of the gay local gauge group might be generic. I might be completely wrong about that. Yeah

1620
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:12,560
Well, that that you can hope um, I I I don't think the three dimensions of space are generic

1621
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:15,520
I don't think the three for the three dimensions of space is generic

1622
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:22,800
Um, whether the you know, there are bizarre possibilities like, you know, maybe the two threes are related

1623
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:26,000
You know the three generations and the three dimensions of space may be

1624
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:29,600
Uh, you know, and I don't know. I mean that that's uh

1625
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:34,960
These things are all certainly possible. I think that when it comes to things like, um

1626
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:37,920
Well, one example is cpt invariance

1627
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:43,280
So that's a the question of why is there cpt invariance and I can explain a little bit about that

1628
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:45,200
We don't know completely

1629
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:48,560
I mean, so in sort of in the stack of things you need in particle physics

1630
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:52,160
A big feature of particle physics is fermion versus bosons

1631
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:59,760
You know particles like electrons put a fermion and have the exclusion principle don't want to be together versus photons which are bosons

1632
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
and are very happy to be together and

1633
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:06,960
Those are distinguished by the, you know, the spin statistics theorem says if you are an

1634
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:10,800
You know, if you're a half integer spin particle, then you will be a fermion

1635
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:12,960
And if you're an integer spin particle, you'll be a boson

1636
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:18,880
So one question is what are fermions and bosons in our models and can we derive the spin statistics theorem?

1637
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,360
And that's an example of a sort of

1638
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:26,240
You know one of the achievements of quantum field theory is the derivation of the spin statistics theorem

1639
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:29,360
and so for us

1640
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:35,360
Fermions versus bosons. We have a guess. We're not sure the the guess has to do with

1641
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:38,160
In these multi-way graphs

1642
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:42,240
We suspect that bosons are associated with in a sense

1643
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:49,360
Branches that merge very quickly and fermions are associated with branchings that do not merge quickly

1644
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:55,040
And so that's what leads you in a sense the the branchings that don't merge quickly

1645
02:01:55,520 --> 02:02:01,280
Wind up with opposite sides of branchial space things that can't happen effectively or things that are not observed to happen

1646
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:05,440
and and in fact at a mathematical level it is the the

1647
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:10,720
You actually will then sort of see the fermions are kind of the square root of the bosons

1648
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:16,000
Because the fermions are it just branches. It doesn't do the it doesn't merge as well

1649
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:18,800
Whereas the bosons are both the branches and it merges

1650
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:22,880
and so now the question is can we relate that to

1651
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:30,240
Rotational symmetries that are associated with with the spins and so on and looking promising not done yet

1652
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:31,680
but looking promising

1653
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:36,720
so then then if we can do that then we can derive the spin statistics theorem and

1654
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:43,040
uh, then the next question is well cpt invariance just to explain for people the the um

1655
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:47,520
This is a a fundamental symmetry that's believed to exist in quantum field theory

1656
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:52,080
Is if you turn particles to anti particles you reflect space

1657
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:55,840
and and you uh reverse time

1658
02:02:56,400 --> 02:03:01,040
Then you'll always get something where the laws of physics work the same way

1659
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:03,120
So for us

1660
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:05,920
Again, it's kind of neat because it seems like

1661
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:10,240
C charge conjugation, which is particle to anti particle

1662
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:11,920
is

1663
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:13,920
effectively like

1664
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:20,000
It is an it is an inversion in branchial space. It seems to be in other words. It's a reflection in branchial space

1665
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:22,080
Uh

1666
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:25,600
Uh parity is a is a reflection in physical space

1667
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:28,240
And time reversal is a reflection in time

1668
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:34,480
And so what this is saying is in the end that our multi-way causal graph is invariant under

1669
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:37,920
Uh a reflection in all three of those

1670
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:46,640
In all three of those uh those directions so to speak now we we so it's at least a very clean formulation

1671
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:48,960
Of what it means to be cpt invariant

1672
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:54,240
Whether we have not yet shown that we necessarily get cpt invariance

1673
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:57,120
But at least we know what it corresponds to but that gives some sense

1674
02:03:57,200 --> 02:04:00,000
So so when you ask about cp violation, for example

1675
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:04,640
That's still a little ways away because we don't yet understand cpt invariance

1676
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:06,400
um

1677
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:08,560
In in regular quantum field theory cpt

1678
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:14,240
Invariance is tightly connected to lorenz invariance the invariance under boosts and and so forth

1679
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:16,800
I'm guessing that

1680
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:21,360
In a discreet graph model lorenz invariance must be once again

1681
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,120
Approximate right and and they'll be at some point even if it's very very

1682
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:27,760
Experimentally inaccessible where it will break down

1683
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:37,440
Absolutely. There is a maximum boost you you can't get you know, there's a in other words as eventually you start seeing the granularity of spacetime

1684
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:39,680
Yeah, so you can you can do um

1685
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,160
and so

1686
02:04:42,160 --> 02:04:45,360
Yes, the the um the relationship between

1687
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:50,960
That is that is in fact the derivation path that we're aiming for is causal invariance

1688
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:53,840
in the ordinary causal graph

1689
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,960
Leads to ordinary lorenz invariance

1690
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:02,960
And the guess is that some kind of that causal invariance in the multi-way causal graph

1691
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:08,480
Is associated with the essentially extension of lorenz invariance that is cpt invariance

1692
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:11,200
So that's that that's the guess about how it works

1693
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:17,120
Right. That's yeah, we don't we don't know if that's really and you know, obviously cpt invariance is a complicated story

1694
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:19,920
in general activity and in non

1695
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:21,760
You know non

1696
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:27,360
Non, you know non flat spacetime and so on and and no doubt we will run into those issues

1697
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:36,480
There are very good experimental limits on lorenz violation from different propagation speeds of photons of different wavelengths from gamma ray bursts

1698
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:43,360
They can put limits up to the Planck scale, but as you said your scale is much tinier. So it might not be anywhere close

1699
02:05:44,080 --> 02:05:48,160
Right. I mean, I think the thing that I'm most interested in with respect to those propagation experiments

1700
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:50,720
is finding

1701
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:53,200
Kind of dimension fluctuations in the universe

1702
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:58,400
Because in our models the you know, there's no reason for the dimension to always be three

1703
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:04,880
In fact, one of the things that's a possibility is so one of the more bizarre possibilities again not properly explored

1704
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:09,680
Is that the Einstein equations are usually formulated in terms of change of in terms of the

1705
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:12,240
Change in curvature of space

1706
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:15,680
One possibility is you might be able to say that curvature is always zero

1707
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:22,400
But the dimension changes and that's and it might be that those are there is some mathematical equivalence between those for small

1708
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:24,480
Curvatures small dimension changes

1709
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:30,800
But but but you know one of the things that we suspect in our models is that the universe started infinite dimensional

1710
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:34,880
And only gradually sort of cooled down to be three dimensional

1711
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:38,320
And so that then a lot of the problems about you know

1712
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:44,000
These horizon problems in the early universe and so on disappear because when it's infinite dimensional

1713
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:48,480
Everything is closely connected. The the graph distance between things is small

1714
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:54,160
Now the suspicion from this is that as it cools down to be three dimensional

1715
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:59,200
There may be dimension fluctuations left over and so obviously, you know

1716
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:02,560
The question is would those be visible at the time of recombination?

1717
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:05,760
Can we see that in the microwave and the cosmic microwave background?

1718
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:12,720
Of course, we don't know but the the the first question is what would a dimension fluctuation do to the cosmic microwave background?

1719
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:15,360
And then if there was a dimension fluctuation that exists

1720
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:22,080
In the current universe, what would it do to the propagation of a photon through that dimension that region of dimension fluctuation?

1721
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:25,760
And I this is this is a piece of in a sense classical physics

1722
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:29,520
That I keep on meaning to work out and I keep on hoping somebody else is going to work it out

1723
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:36,320
Because it's kind of like that. I've been I've been collecting this inventory of of laws of physics in d dimensions

1724
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:40,560
Well, I think I mean, I'm just guessing here because I haven't thought of it myself, but um

1725
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:44,480
If the effective dimensionality space is not exactly three

1726
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:50,240
Coulomb's law would not be exactly true. And wouldn't that have dramatic effects on qed scattering rates?

1727
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:52,240
Um

1728
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:58,800
Well the question is something like the thompson cross section, for example does how does that depend on so

1729
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:01,360
uh, I am

1730
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:03,360
well, you you're

1731
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,680
You're correct that in d dimensional space

1732
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:08,400
So so the way to think about I think proton propagation

1733
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:14,320
Is using huygens principle where you're saying that every on this wave front of a propagating

1734
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:17,680
Propagating, uh, you know light wave or whatever

1735
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:22,480
Every every point on that wave front is a source of a spherical wave

1736
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:25,520
That is going to build up the next piece of the wave front

1737
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,560
And if you are in d dimensional space where d isn't three

1738
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:36,080
Those little spherical waves have a different, you know, there there's a different density on those spherical waves

1739
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:38,240
So to speak when you project them into three dimensions

1740
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:40,480
That's at least my thinking about how to do this now

1741
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:42,480
question is

1742
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:44,960
So the question is so so in particle physics

1743
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:51,040
Back when I used to do particle physics a long time ago. I was a big enthusiast of this method called dimensional regularization

1744
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:53,600
Which is the idea that you know

1745
02:08:53,680 --> 02:09:00,000
Well, you're doing an integral and if it's if the dimensionality of space time is four the integral diverges horribly

1746
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:02,560
But if we can only say it's four minus epsilon

1747
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:06,320
We can do the integral and then we take the limit epsilon goes to zero at the end

1748
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:13,520
So I'm sure I've worked out back in the day what the low-energy electron photon scattering cross-section is indeed dimensions

1749
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
And that's uh, that would be a good

1750
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:23,440
Uh, that that'd be a good case to look at. I mean, I think that that that I will not be surprised if there is some

1751
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:30,480
Thing that one can some fairly sensitive test of the dimensionality of space. For example, I don't know and I've been meaning to look it up

1752
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:32,080
what

1753
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:35,600
uh, the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron or the muon

1754
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:42,160
You know, it's it's one minus alpha over two pi. But that certainly depends on the dimension of space. I just don't know how

1755
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,400
Yeah, there's probably some sensitive particle high

1756
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:49,600
High precision particle physics experiment that that is uh sensitive to that so, okay

1757
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:54,400
I think I only have two questions, but they're both huge questions. So I suspect they're going to take more than two minutes each

1758
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:56,880
but uh, one of them is you you

1759
02:09:58,160 --> 02:10:02,400
Referred to this idea that in the early universe, uh, maybe we have some

1760
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:08,480
Bundle of dimensionality or dimensionality is not well defined and that sort of comes out in the wash as the evolution happens

1761
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:10,720
um

1762
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:13,280
So I've thought very much about the arrow of time problem

1763
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:17,200
But I've thought about it in the context of fundamentally reversible

1764
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:24,960
Directionless laws of physics, which is a little bit different from where you're coming from. So for me the huge question is, you know, we're

1765
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:27,840
Evolving toward an equilibrium

1766
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:32,880
Empty space situation where all the galaxies are all dissolved around and we have nothing around us

1767
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:36,400
But the cosmological horizon and that's the highest entropy state

1768
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:43,360
Uh, but we came from 14 billion years ago a very very very low entropy state and in conventional cosmology

1769
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:49,040
There's just no good explanation for that except the papers I've written and even those are not universally accepted yet

1770
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:53,280
But it sounds like you have a possible completely different point of view where

1771
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:58,400
It's just natural that you start with what we would expose fact or label low entropy

1772
02:10:59,600 --> 02:11:02,880
So I think the the discussion about entropy is kind of confusing

1773
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:05,360
Okay, that's my first statement

1774
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:11,920
I I remember actually I remember having these vigorous arguments with Dick Hyman about this very topic of whether the universe was

1775
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:15,120
You know, he made this claim the universe is a fluctuation

1776
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:20,000
You know the fact that we are in in the state where we're not kind of you know

1777
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:26,800
Where we aren't at sort of the maximally disordered state and I kept on saying that's just a completely crazy claim

1778
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:29,520
Because it's like everything we know is a fluctuation

1779
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:33,840
So, you know, I think I I would be more eloquent these days than I was back

1780
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:36,400
I'm on your side. Yeah, and um

1781
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:39,040
And explaining why that was such a such a

1782
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:44,800
A wrong idea, but anyway, no the first the first thing to understand is that

1783
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:51,120
People say oh, you know, eventually the universe will kind of unwind and there'll be nothing interesting in it

1784
02:11:51,120 --> 02:11:54,240
There'll be no structure in it. It will all just be in a high entropy state

1785
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:59,920
Okay, my claim is the reason you say that is because you're not an adequate demon

1786
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:02,800
That is in fact

1787
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:07,920
In the future of the universe if it turns out that it's all just seems like a gas and equilibrium and so on

1788
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:12,720
That you might say that's completely boring. That's all just random. It's the high entropy state

1789
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:18,160
But to another kind of observer they might say but look at all those little details about what's happening

1790
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:22,400
This is the most amazing complex structure that you can imagine

1791
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:25,360
I mean, I I happen to think if we if we ask

1792
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:31,040
What will we look back on this time in scientific history and say how could those guys have missed this point?

1793
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:37,200
My guess is one of the bigger things will be when people describe something like a gas and thermal equilibrium

1794
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:39,520
They just say it has a certain pressure and temperature

1795
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:43,680
They don't consider any other features of the gas. They don't say

1796
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:46,400
Oh, it's got the little microscopic, you know

1797
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:48,880
Things that we can measure in this way and that way

1798
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:55,200
But my guess is that there are a lot of other features now this question of are they computationally boundedly observable?

1799
02:12:55,520 --> 02:13:01,120
Are they are they measurable by a computationally bounded observer? I don't know the answer to that really

1800
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:08,160
Um, but the the the point the the claim I'm making is that when you say it's going to a high entropy state

1801
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:16,160
You're saying oh that all you're saying is so I as a as an observer of the kind of observer

1802
02:13:16,240 --> 02:13:17,280
I am

1803
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:21,040
Can't make anything out of it other than to say it's uniform and random

1804
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:23,760
I think I'm actually saying more than that. I think in this case

1805
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:28,880
I'm going to disagree with you because I think that it actually goes to the vacuum quantum state the

1806
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:32,160
the bunch Davis vacuum of decider space it's it's

1807
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:35,040
It's a dissipative system because there are

1808
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:39,920
There's a horizon around us and within our horizon all the excitations above the vacuum

1809
02:13:40,400 --> 02:13:45,040
Go away and and there is no structure there to be seen by any observer

1810
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:48,640
Computationally bounded or otherwise. What do you think is in the vacuum?

1811
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:53,360
Well, it's a single quantum state thinking in quantum mechanical terms. It's a unique

1812
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:55,840
The lowest energy state that's

1813
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:59,280
So I would claim that's the mistake and it's it may be interesting to try and take that apart

1814
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:01,920
so in our models

1815
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
The very fact that there's space there

1816
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:08,960
Space is a thing in our models. You have to make space. You don't just get to say

1817
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:11,520
Oh, there's this big area of space

1818
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:17,840
Space is made of something and in our models space is made of this sort of teaming collection of atoms of space doing all these

1819
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:19,440
complicated things

1820
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:24,320
So our vacuum cannot be just the boring. There's nothing there vacuum

1821
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:29,520
Our vacuum has to have a lot of structure in it. Now if you ask the question if you say

1822
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:34,880
Every particle excitation has gone over the horizon. That's what you're basically saying

1823
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:39,200
So let's think about that for a second. What does that mean in in our models?

1824
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:44,160
So horizons in our models are visible in essentially

1825
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:52,880
Breaks in the causal graph. So the causal graph says this is the you know causal effects can propagate between these

1826
02:14:53,120 --> 02:14:56,320
Between these at this event can affect this event can affect this event

1827
02:14:56,640 --> 02:15:04,000
And you make these light cones where one event is having an effect on a whole sort of increasing size cone of other events

1828
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:07,600
Right. So what is a what is an event horizon an event horizon?

1829
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,840
Is and you literally see this in our models when you run them and like these black holes

1830
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:15,520
You can literally see the event horizon and it's a place where the causal edges

1831
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,480
For example in a black hole the causal edges go one way

1832
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:21,120
The causal edges go in and they can't come out

1833
02:15:21,680 --> 02:15:23,680
And that's it's very concrete

1834
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:28,320
And so a cosmological event horizon is something where you're separating in the causal graph

1835
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:30,880
You have two different regions of the causal graph

1836
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:35,280
And they are you simply have no causal edges that go from one side to the other

1837
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:42,000
So what you would be saying is what what you're claiming is every particle excitation has

1838
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:47,840
Somehow is is in a region of space that is causally disconnected

1839
02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:51,520
From the region of space that that we care about so to speak

1840
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:54,240
So I think my my statement would be

1841
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:57,040
I mean your claim is an interesting one because

1842
02:15:57,200 --> 02:16:04,400
Basically what you're saying is that all the big particle excitations all these sort of identifiable topological excitations

1843
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:08,960
Will be gone and outside the you know outside of this event horizon

1844
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:15,680
Now what I would be saying is that in order for there to be space inside there there still has to be stuff going on

1845
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:20,640
Now what so what this turns into is an argument about

1846
02:16:21,200 --> 02:16:23,200
Is is there

1847
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:28,720
Stuff that is there useful stuff in that region of the universe and by useful stuff

1848
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:33,200
You might say it's this complicated topological structure that represents a photon

1849
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:39,040
But that depends on you know, and so you say the observer an observer

1850
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:45,440
That you know about right now is observing things like photons is observing these big complicated topological structure

1851
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:50,480
But you know in terms of the pure underlying structure of the universe

1852
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:55,360
You could still have all these little atoms of space doing their thing. It's just maybe

1853
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:57,920
Maybe it's smoothed out enough

1854
02:16:58,400 --> 02:17:04,240
Conceivably that there aren't any of these sort of identifiable topologically stable structures that still exist there

1855
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:10,720
That's a possible that's a possible kind of and then the observer would have to be at the demon level

1856
02:17:10,720 --> 02:17:14,240
So to speak in order to observe that there's anything interesting happening there

1857
02:17:14,640 --> 02:17:19,120
And not at a level if the observer is made of particles for example is made of photons

1858
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:23,680
That might be the case that you you couldn't get with an observer made of photons

1859
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:28,240
You simply couldn't get information about that more microscopic structure

1860
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:35,520
So, yeah, I think we should postpone this to either an in-person conversation or me appearing on your podcast because

1861
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:39,440
It does get kind of technical at some point, but I don't want to

1862
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:44,320
Not give you an opportunity to talk about the beginning of the universe. You talked about the end there

1863
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:47,040
But is there is I

1864
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:52,000
I'm going to guess that you're going to say that there is a principled reason within this approach to

1865
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:56,240
Start in what looks something like very roughly the big bang

1866
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:02,320
Well, okay, so the question is what you know in these models

1867
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:04,880
Okay, this gets us into another

1868
02:18:05,360 --> 02:18:10,560
This is a deep rabbit hole that we're about to enter but but let me let me say a few things about it because it's something

1869
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:13,600
I've recently been thinking a lot about the the um

1870
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:16,800
so

1871
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,600
The

1872
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:21,600
Okay, so in these models

1873
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:26,400
You might imagine that the universe starts as a fairly small

1874
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:29,040
Hypergraph and gradually expands

1875
02:18:29,360 --> 02:18:31,760
And so one of the mistakes I've been trying to not make

1876
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:39,280
Is kind of a repeat of the einstein mistake so to speak because in our models the most natural thing is that this hypergraph

1877
02:18:39,360 --> 02:18:45,280
Just expands dramatically with time. Okay, and you know, I'm I'm not

1878
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:50,400
I I have a great tendency and this is kind of a reverse engineering type tendency to say no

1879
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:56,560
No, there's got to be these other rules that reduce the size of the hypergraph so that it doesn't expand insanely

1880
02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:02,480
You know just like einstein was saying well, you know, even though the einstein equations predict the universe should expand

1881
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:06,880
Of course, we know it doesn't expand except it turns out actually we discovered it does expand

1882
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:13,040
So i'm trying to not repeat that mistake, but um, uh, you know, I think that the current

1883
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:17,600
Expectation would be that just as there's a simple rule

1884
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,240
So also there's a simple initial condition and that is a small hypergraph

1885
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:29,280
And which is something that doesn't really even define a dimension because it's just a tiny little hypergraph and it starts expanding

1886
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:35,440
And at the beginning that expansion is like, you know is is uh, uh, is something which effect

1887
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:37,360
It has high dimension then it goes down

1888
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:42,240
So one of the things we've been trying to do which is probably more in your in your day job wheelhouse

1889
02:19:42,320 --> 02:19:47,120
So to speak is we'd really like to know what the analog of the Friedman Robertson walker

1890
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:49,680
Model of the universe is

1891
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:51,040
For dimension change

1892
02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:56,400
So we were pretty sure that there is a an analog for a homogeneous isotropic universe

1893
02:19:56,960 --> 02:20:02,960
That there's something just like the usual model just as it's homogeneous and the universe is homogeneous and isotropic

1894
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:05,840
So what does the scale factor of the universe? What does the you know?

1895
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:07,840
How does that how does that work with time?

1896
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:13,040
We're pretty sure there's a directly analogous thing that describes dimension change in the universe

1897
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:19,040
And that will be the effective equations that describe in our models the very early universe

1898
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:21,360
Yeah, I think

1899
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:26,800
There it's actually i'll just sort of mention a couple of things for your benefit as well for the audiences

1900
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:33,360
If you want to imagine you have a bunch of dimensions that start small and some of them start expanding

1901
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:37,760
There's a very set of cute models from brandenburger and wafa

1902
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:42,240
Based on string theory, but they have a way why only three

1903
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:47,440
Dimensions of space would start expanding and it's basically because you can tie your shoes in three dimensions

1904
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:52,480
But not in four dimensions, right strings will generically intersect in three dimensions

1905
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:57,280
But not higher numbers of dimensions. So that was there. I wrote that down. I'm gonna look that up. That's yeah, that's a fun one

1906
02:20:57,760 --> 02:21:00,560
The dual of that the converse was actually

1907
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:05,360
By me and lisa randall and matt johnson where we showed how if you start with

1908
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:10,960
Higher dimensional decider space you could actually create a sub universe with fewer

1909
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:18,640
Microscopic dimensions by spontaneously compactifying some dimensions. So I think dynamically given curve space time

1910
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:24,000
You're allowed to go either way you can have them all small and let some grow or you can have them all big and let some shrink

1911
02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:29,360
Oh, that's interesting. I mean, you know in the question is if it's homogeneous and isotopic

1912
02:21:29,440 --> 02:21:32,080
Whatever the generalization of that for dimension changes

1913
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:39,120
What I expect is that there's going to be some equation that eventually will have the dimension and the scale factor in it

1914
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:44,240
And it will be a only those things. So you don't in the things you were just describing

1915
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:48,880
There's presumably non homogeneity because you're saying that there are some, you know

1916
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:55,440
Pieces some dimensions that grows some that shrink and so on this will be kind of the the homogeneous isotropic analog of that

1917
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:57,680
I mean, I think this is a in a sense

1918
02:21:57,680 --> 02:22:01,440
This is a quintessential not particularly easy mathematical physics problem

1919
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:05,840
But it is in a sense. It's it's the reason one reason it's not easy

1920
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:08,800
And it's perhaps of perhaps interesting to say is that

1921
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:16,400
Calculus which is what all of this stuff is based on is a story of changes with respect to a variable like time

1922
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:20,640
But in our models and you know when people do multivariate calculus

1923
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:24,800
They're doing calculus with you know with two variables or three variables

1924
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:28,240
But they never get to do calculus with two and a half variables

1925
02:22:28,720 --> 02:22:31,840
That's not a thing and nobody knows how that works

1926
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:39,600
And so in our models what we effectively have to do is go below the level of where we talk about variables

1927
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:42,080
And we're actually in our hypergraphs

1928
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:46,000
You can think about a direction in the hypergraph as being like a variable

1929
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:50,400
So as you move through the hypergraph in a certain direction, that's like a variable

1930
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:54,640
But if the hypergraph is a big mess, it's not obvious what you mean by a direction

1931
02:22:54,960 --> 02:23:00,320
If the hypergraph was a nice orderly like crystal like thing, then you'd have a well-defined notion of direction

1932
02:23:00,640 --> 02:23:05,440
But in the actual hypergraph you don't right and that's some and that's kind of where you begin

1933
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:08,880
I mean that there needs to be a generalization of calculus made

1934
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:15,840
That works in fractional dimensional space on these hypergraphs and so on and that's kind of the that's the technical difficulty of this

1935
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:20,080
But but that's I mean it's interesting. I'm I'm I'm gonna look up that that that reference

1936
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:25,760
That's that's very useful. Well good and and I think this leads actually very naturally into the final big issue

1937
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:27,760
I wanted to address

1938
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:30,880
Which is locality and you know you talked a lot

1939
02:23:30,880 --> 02:23:33,760
I think even though I never got to sort of specifically ask

1940
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:39,680
I think you've done a good job of explaining how spacetime arises and einstein's equation and general relativity and as you said

1941
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,480
Three dimensions doesn't seem to magically come out

1942
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:47,840
But maybe we can figure that we get it with the right rules so that that's future work good

1943
02:23:49,360 --> 02:23:53,440
But locality is an interesting thing by locality. I just mean the fact that in space

1944
02:23:54,320 --> 02:24:00,480
The laws of physics for the most part have the property that if you poke the system in one location of space

1945
02:24:00,880 --> 02:24:05,840
The effects ripple out locally right only to nearest neighbors as you go forward in time

1946
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:12,000
So that's one thing you might want to get out of an approach like yours is that you have this notion of locality

1947
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:14,240
Quantum field theory is based on locality

1948
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:19,680
But in the real world, there's at least two interesting places where we think locality breaks down

1949
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:23,360
One is in quantum measurement with bells inequality, right?

1950
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:30,320
And the other is potentially in quantum gravity with the holographic principle complementarity adscft

1951
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:38,720
So what is your feeling about how you can thread that needle of getting enough locality out of your rules but also

1952
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:42,000
slight deviations from locality when you need them

1953
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:47,600
Okay, my current guess is the following in space and physical what in these hypergraphs

1954
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:51,360
We are saying there's a a certain

1955
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:53,120
clump of

1956
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:57,840
Of nodes in the hypergraph that have this structure. They get transformed into one of that structure

1957
02:24:58,320 --> 02:25:03,440
That's an essential local in space in the sense that it involves this local region of nodes in the hypergraph

1958
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:05,040
Okay

1959
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:10,720
Now there's two kinds of locality one is spatial locality and the other is bronchial locality

1960
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:17,520
In other words is it and so my guess is and the way that things like bells inequality that the violation of bells inequality

1961
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:19,600
come out is through

1962
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:20,720
non

1963
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:22,160
That that

1964
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:24,160
bronchial space

1965
02:25:24,240 --> 02:25:27,280
Is differently laid out than physical space physical space

1966
02:25:27,360 --> 02:25:33,200
We we know in this hypergraph that it's you know, we are we are choosing to a rule

1967
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:35,600
That is local with respect to the hypergraph

1968
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:40,880
But the question of what counts as local in this in in bronchial space

1969
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:43,360
Locality is a different story

1970
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:49,440
Locality is a story there of well, it's it's just a different kind of thing because it involves these the ancestry

1971
02:25:50,560 --> 02:25:55,760
Ancestry in the multi-way graph and so on so I think that the the story there

1972
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:58,240
is

1973
02:25:58,240 --> 02:26:04,800
Locality in bronchial space is a different issue and for example, you can ask what's the analog of a light cone in bronchial space

1974
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:10,160
So in physical space, you know, you make a perturbation somewhere it expands at the speed of light

1975
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:16,000
What happens in bronchial space? Well, it also expands at finite speed in our models

1976
02:26:16,640 --> 02:26:20,080
And that means there is a maximum entanglement speed in quantum mechanics

1977
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:22,000
and

1978
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:26,480
That the the value of that we only need we only have one parameter we really need

1979
02:26:26,720 --> 02:26:28,720
So if we knew the elementary length

1980
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:34,160
Or if we knew the elementary time or the elementary energy right or if we knew the maximum entanglement speed

1981
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:39,840
Any, you know, any one of those parameters is enough to determine the length scale for our models

1982
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:46,000
But the this maximum entanglement speed is saying in bronchial space

1983
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:48,720
you have a

1984
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:51,840
One vague estimate that we have is the the

1985
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:56,000
Maximum entanglement speed is 10 to the 5 solar masses per second

1986
02:26:56,560 --> 02:26:59,520
I don't know if that's correct. That's based on a very hokey

1987
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,960
Calculation that I did which makes a bunch of assumptions

1988
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:08,240
But it gives you some sense of scale if if that was the right value we would observe

1989
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:10,240
We would observe

1990
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:12,240
limitations on black hole mergers

1991
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:18,960
Of big black holes or very rapid mergers that are associated with maximum entanglement speed rather than speed of light

1992
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:24,320
So in a sense, it's a limit of the rate of quantum measurement or the rate of quantum

1993
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:27,440
Effects and so one question is

1994
02:27:28,240 --> 02:27:30,640
Which which we were just thinking about recently

1995
02:27:31,120 --> 02:27:38,160
Is can we actually bound in other words in in these violation of bells inequality experiments where you're looking at?

1996
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:43,600
Propagation of physical space and you're saying it seems to happen instantaneously in physical space

1997
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:48,480
Well, the reason that's happening is because that propagation

1998
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:51,600
So to speak is actually happening in our models in bronchial space

1999
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,160
Which is a different story than physical space

2000
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:59,360
But if we knew the maximum entanglement speed we might be able to make bounds

2001
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:04,160
On that speed in physical space, which would mean that even though

2002
02:28:04,640 --> 02:28:10,080
You know these these various bells inequality, you know entanglement experiments and so on are

2003
02:28:11,360 --> 02:28:16,640
Are much, you know, they seem instantaneous so to speak that actually there might be a finite bound

2004
02:28:16,640 --> 02:28:18,320
We're not sure about that yet

2005
02:28:18,320 --> 02:28:20,800
I think it's probably not exactly the same, but this is certainly

2006
02:28:21,360 --> 02:28:26,320
Spiritually a similar answer to what an ever-ready and would give to the whole bells inequality

2007
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:28,960
Question there's there's not a unique

2008
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:31,040
measurement outcome in in space

2009
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:35,360
So the the rules that bell was assuming do not necessarily apply

2010
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:38,480
right, I mean, I think that so

2011
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:45,360
In so by the way, this maximum entanglement speed has all kinds of consequences. So for example, you can have entanglement horizons

2012
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:47,760
so you can have a a

2013
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:49,760
Essentially a horizon in bronchial space

2014
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:55,920
And so one of the things we suspect but we don't yet know is that there's an entanglement horizon outside of the

2015
02:28:57,280 --> 02:28:59,760
physical event horizon in black holes

2016
02:29:00,400 --> 02:29:06,640
And so what that means is so so far we can get black holes in our single thread of history

2017
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:10,640
You know not dealing with multiway causal graphs

2018
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:14,160
It's just a technically difficult thing to do the analogous

2019
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:18,640
Calculation for a multiway graph, but we think we'll be able to do that and at that point

2020
02:29:18,640 --> 02:29:23,440
We will see black holes that have an event horizon in physical space

2021
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
And an event horizon in bronchial space

2022
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:30,560
And so the question is and that is an interesting thing because you know

2023
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:33,760
If you think about the propagation of information in the history of a black hole

2024
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:40,800
There's a question of can information be trapped between the entanglement horizon and the physical event horizon

2025
02:29:41,360 --> 02:29:46,080
And that and so one of the questions is if you're an observer falling into a black hole

2026
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:52,080
And you're you know, when you when you're an observer falling into a black hole to the outside world

2027
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:58,480
You know time has stopped for you know your and so the question is what's the analogous thing that happens in the entanglement horizon?

2028
02:29:58,960 --> 02:30:00,960
And I think what happens is kind of cute

2029
02:30:01,360 --> 02:30:07,440
I think what happens is that the observer at the entanglement horizon cannot form a classical thought

2030
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:14,480
So sorry from the from the observers point of view, they just fall right through though in classical gr

2031
02:30:14,960 --> 02:30:17,360
Yes, yes, right, but to a person correct

2032
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:21,600
So that is to a person far away from the entanglement horizon

2033
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:27,760
They would conclude that the observer at the entanglement horizon could not form a classical thought

2034
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:32,880
So that means they could never in the in the sort of traditional quantum mechanics world

2035
02:30:32,880 --> 02:30:38,000
They could never collapse the wave function. They could never and so what would happen is for them

2036
02:30:38,320 --> 02:30:42,720
You know that they're observing, you know some virtual particle pair, you know

2037
02:30:43,360 --> 02:30:47,040
You know did that did that electron go into the black hole or not?

2038
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:51,520
Well, they don't know because they can't form the classical thought

2039
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:54,320
To determine whether it went into the black hole or not

2040
02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:59,680
And so that's how that's our kind of at least qualitative thinking about

2041
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:01,040
uh

2042
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:04,160
That's sort of black hole information paradox kinds of things in our models

2043
02:31:04,560 --> 02:31:09,360
I I would suspect that that that um, I know I haven't worked on this

2044
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:12,640
but Jonathan Gorat has worked a bunch on the er equals epr

2045
02:31:13,120 --> 02:31:15,120
story in our models and

2046
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:20,000
Claims that he is about to produce an actual sort of explicit

2047
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:23,840
Simulation of an er equals epr thing

2048
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:30,080
So that that um, uh, which has been I mean, it's an imminent claim. So it will have to arrive in the next

2049
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:31,120
That's fine low

2050
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:36,720
I mean maybe by the time the episode comes out, but it does remind me of a potential and I promise is the last thing a potential

2051
02:31:37,440 --> 02:31:39,440
quantitative question

2052
02:31:40,720 --> 02:31:48,240
The entropy of a black hole is its horizon area divided by four measured in plank units according to Hawking and Beckenstein

2053
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:56,320
Someone like me would interpret that as saying that the black hole is described by a factor of Hilbert space

2054
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:00,720
With a dimensionality approximately e to that number

2055
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:04,240
But the plank length is not fundamental for you

2056
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:09,360
Is there any chance that you would be able to calculate the Beckenstein Hawking entropy and get the right answer?

2057
02:32:10,160 --> 02:32:13,040
Yeah, that's an interesting question. So I mean in

2058
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:17,360
Uh

2059
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:22,160
You know the notion of what black hole entropy is what is entropy

2060
02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:28,640
Entropy is basically a measure of the number of states the number of microscopic states of a system

2061
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:34,480
Consistent with the macroscopic thing that you identify as being the system so to speak

2062
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:38,800
So this is basically saying given this thing that we say is a black hole

2063
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:45,040
How many possible microscopic states are consistent with this macroscopic observation that it is a black hole?

2064
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:46,800
so

2065
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:48,800
I would think

2066
02:32:48,960 --> 02:32:51,360
That we should be able to compute that

2067
02:32:52,160 --> 02:32:53,440
um

2068
02:32:53,440 --> 02:32:55,440
And let me think how would we

2069
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:57,280
uh

2070
02:32:57,280 --> 02:33:03,280
Yeah, I mean I can imagine how we would compute that. Um, and I think it will you know what we have to do

2071
02:33:04,640 --> 02:33:06,640
Okay, so in spacetime

2072
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:11,360
We can see these event horizons in the causal graph you can explicitly

2073
02:33:11,360 --> 02:33:16,560
I've even studied them a bunch and you can see all kinds of exotic black holes inside black holes and all kinds of

2074
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:24,240
Interesting and wild things that can happen. Um, but uh, the I just I started looking at the multi-way version of that

2075
02:33:24,640 --> 02:33:26,640
It's just computationally hard

2076
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:34,240
Because that what's happening is you you you get these, you know, it's for the exact reason you've got this big exponential in there

2077
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:38,880
Yeah, you've got this, you know all these different threads of history that you have to account for

2078
02:33:39,440 --> 02:33:44,960
And as I say, there is an optimization of this that another person working on this project max piscinoff has been working on

2079
02:33:45,520 --> 02:33:52,400
For most of the last year actually, um, which is the theory of local multi-way systems, which are systems. So

2080
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:55,120
So, um

2081
02:33:56,320 --> 02:34:00,640
The idea is okay, so so roughly the idea is the following so you have

2082
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:07,440
In when you're looking at this causal graph that represents all these different events and they're happening through time

2083
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:11,280
And you say i'm going to take a slice of this causal graph at a particular

2084
02:34:11,440 --> 02:34:13,360
What I consider to be a particular moment in time

2085
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:18,640
Then I've got a structure of space associated with those causal connections and so on

2086
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:21,360
That is that is getting us a version of space

2087
02:34:22,160 --> 02:34:24,160
When we also have this multi-way graph

2088
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:26,640
There are

2089
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:28,960
There are many different configurations for space

2090
02:34:29,440 --> 02:34:32,160
But so there's this notion that I was calling multi space

2091
02:34:32,720 --> 02:34:35,120
Which is this thing where every place in space

2092
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:39,200
There's also the essentially this stack of multi-way possibilities

2093
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:47,040
And what's difficult is to understand we can say, okay, there's this multi-way graph and the whole universe is one node in this multi-way graph

2094
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:52,320
Or we can say we've got one path in the multi-way graph and now we're going to look at what happens in space

2095
02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:59,280
But the the the thing we're trying to do is to see how do we get a representation that knits those two things together

2096
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:01,760
Where we are looking at

2097
02:35:01,840 --> 02:35:03,280
locality in space

2098
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:05,600
And essentially locality in branch real space

2099
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:11,040
And being able to sort of have those two things combined if we can successfully do this

2100
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:16,880
I'm pretty sure we can do essentially numerical quantum field theory and we can do it in

2101
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:20,720
You know in the traditional way this is done. It's either Feynman diagrams or it's lattice gauge theory

2102
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:22,960
Lattice gauge theory is an imaginary time

2103
02:35:23,360 --> 02:35:25,840
Which is kind of a you know, not great

2104
02:35:26,400 --> 02:35:29,280
And in in this in this setup

2105
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:31,120
We will be able to do it in actual time

2106
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:35,040
And and we'll be able to do it and then you know the question of whether we see

2107
02:35:35,440 --> 02:35:39,440
Sort of perturbation theory and Feynman diagram is a story of what happens with our

2108
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:44,640
You know with our topological excitations and so on that might be a more complicated story. But anyway, that's a

2109
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:48,800
Uh, yeah, I mean the the thing that's really

2110
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
To me

2111
02:35:52,560 --> 02:35:58,320
You know just tremendously exciting about this whole thing is you know, there's this underlying structure

2112
02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:03,120
And we keep on being able to figure out more and more stuff. It's not easy to figure out these things

2113
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:08,560
But it's like nothing is we're not ending up running into something where we say, oh my gosh

2114
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:13,200
That's you know, we just can't explain that that's just a thing which just is you know

2115
02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:15,680
Totally orthogonal to what our models are saying

2116
02:36:16,240 --> 02:36:18,400
And that's some and the other thing that's happening

2117
02:36:18,880 --> 02:36:24,160
Which I think is that we keep on running into things which say, oh, that's just like causal set theory

2118
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:29,520
Oh, that's just like, you know, constructor theory or whatever. Oh, that's just like one of these other

2119
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:34,400
theories that's been developed and what's you know, to me both

2120
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:37,120
intellectually and sociologically

2121
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:42,240
A terrific thing is that you know the results that people have developed in these theories

2122
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:44,640
Like take causal set theory for example

2123
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:48,400
There's been kind of a mystery, you know, you're just throwing down events in spacetime

2124
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:52,640
And you're saying just look at the relationship between those events in a causal graph

2125
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:58,400
But there's been kind of a mystery. Why are the event thrown down in just such a way that you get Lorentz invariance?

2126
02:36:58,640 --> 02:37:03,440
Yeah, well in our models we have an algorithmic procedure for generating those events

2127
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:05,920
Which immediately gives you Lorentz invariance

2128
02:37:06,400 --> 02:37:10,560
But yet the all the mathematics that people have done in causal set theory

2129
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:16,640
Which works on arbitrary collections of events in spacetime can be applied to our models

2130
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:22,720
And so that's a that's a really neat thing and I'm you know, it's looking and the same thing

2131
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:25,200
I mean, we've been

2132
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:30,560
In higher category theory is another, you know, very elaborate area of mathematics

2133
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:36,560
Which is I mean our stuff is a concretization is a concrete instance

2134
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:43,440
Of higher category theory and all kinds of rewards that exist in higher category theory that have been extremely abstract

2135
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:47,040
Basically, my test is I can now understand a bunch of these results

2136
02:37:47,360 --> 02:37:49,360
Which I've never been able to do before

2137
02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:55,920
So because they have a concrete instantiation and you know, one of the things which we which we are not going to have a chance to talk about here

2138
02:37:55,920 --> 02:38:01,920
But the question of of um, which we sort of started to talk about is why this universe and not another one

2139
02:38:02,320 --> 02:38:04,320
You know, why does this universe exist at all?

2140
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:08,160
That we seem to be able to have some things to say about

2141
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:13,760
And it turns out that it's all to do with this limit of higher category theory

2142
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:19,760
Which turns out to also be this limit of running all possible rules in a multi-way graph

2143
02:38:20,320 --> 02:38:22,480
And these are things related to this thing

2144
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:25,600
called the infinity groupoid, which was

2145
02:38:26,240 --> 02:38:27,600
you know

2146
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:29,920
introduced by this chap growth and deke who was a very

2147
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:32,880
Abstract, abstruse mathematician

2148
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:36,480
And I never thought I would have any reason to care about the infinity groupoid

2149
02:38:36,960 --> 02:38:40,240
Except that it seems that it is the limit of a bunch of our models

2150
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:44,720
And it seems that it's it's deeply related to a lot of things about sort of

2151
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:48,960
Why this universe and and why does the universe exist anyway?

2152
02:38:49,520 --> 02:38:56,720
And you know just as a teaser of something we're not going to have a chance to talk about but but one of the things that I've been excited about recently

2153
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:58,160
is

2154
02:38:58,160 --> 02:39:00,160
Just as we are making this sort of

2155
02:39:00,240 --> 02:39:04,560
foundational model for physics. I would like to make a foundational model of mathematics

2156
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:09,200
And we're talking about the set of all possible rules for a physical universe

2157
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:12,480
You can also talk about the set of all possible rules in mathematics

2158
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:21,280
And one of my recent conclusions is if we believe that the universe exists, which presumably we do because that's a notion of existence that we

2159
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:26,640
Are pretty familiar with then it necessarily follows that mathematics exists

2160
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:29,840
In the same way and that our doing of mathematics

2161
02:39:30,480 --> 02:39:34,880
Is kind of carving out pieces of this kind of structure that is all of mathematics

2162
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:38,800
In much the same way that we're kind of carving out pieces of the universe to observe

2163
02:39:38,880 --> 02:39:42,960
But anyway, that's a that's a that's a a coming attraction as yet

2164
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:47,280
I mean what I want to do is to find a bulk theory of mathematics

2165
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:52,240
In the same way that we have bulk theories like relativity and quantum mechanics and and physics

2166
02:39:53,120 --> 02:39:58,800
Well, I can I can tell you that uh, it was just a couple months ago that we had a podcast episode with emily real

2167
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:04,240
A mathematician from johns hopkins a category theorist and we talked about the infinity groupoid

2168
02:40:04,880 --> 02:40:10,480
Oh, good. Very good. We talked about the infinity groupoid, which tells me both that there's a unity to all of knowledge

2169
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:13,680
But also there's a plenty of room to go, which I think that everyone

2170
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:19,440
Listening to this episode will definitely get that impression. So steven wolffron. Thanks very much for being on the mindscape podcast

2171
02:40:19,440 --> 02:40:22,320
That was fun. Good stuff
