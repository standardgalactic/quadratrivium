0	6120	Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll. Here's a classic question
6480	12400	What is the use of education? What is the value of being educated?
12400	18520	I'm thinking particularly here of post secondary post high school education college university
18800	24440	Even graduate school and so on. Why do this? Why get that much schooling into you?
24760	27120	There are you know lofty
27520	31400	Answers to this question about becoming a more well-rounded human being
31960	37920	Understanding the human condition picking up reasoning skills and learning skills. There's also
38640	43240	Socialization issues right meeting people getting to know the world in a certain way
43240	46480	That's absolutely an important function of going to college
46720	51440	But there's also a lot of down-to-earth practical issues, right? You're being trained
52240	57480	Perhaps for a trade for a job to become employable. That's an absolutely valid
58200	66160	reason to get an education in the modern world, especially we point toward science and technology as
67080	73160	Skills or fields for which we would like it if people had good training in these fields, right?
73160	75800	We invent the acronym of STEM
76400	83120	Science technology engineering and mathematics. This is government speak or education speak for
83520	87880	the kinds of sciencey techy kinds of areas that
88320	94400	Both governments and also employers place a lot of emphasis on so if you're not within academia right now
94400	100880	You might not know that there's a lot of hand-wringing and angst about the decline of the humanities and you know the more
101480	109640	classic parts of the broad-based humanistic education that we purport to care about and too much emphasis maybe is being put on
110160	112160	science degrees and
112160	115920	Related areas, but there are good reasons economic reasons
115920	120960	You know you want people to get a good job that's able to pay them and you give them a fulfilling life after
121280	126220	College so maybe it's fine to have a bunch of people specializing in STEM areas
126700	133460	Today's guest is John Screntany. He's a sociologist at UC San Diego and actually someone I've known for a long time
133460	140460	We went to graduate school at the same time together and used to play basketball together as you'll find out if you hang out for the very end here
140660	146940	But he's written an interesting book called wasted education how we fail our graduates in science technology
147500	150940	engineering and math the idea behind John's book is
151780	155460	sure employers and governments want
156220	158900	healthy and rapidly growing
160140	168940	Scientifically and technologically educated workforce, but does that mean that once created that workforce is actually fulfilled?
168940	176020	Is are they happy do you get a science degree and are you there for able to get a good job that keeps you?
176740	178740	Having a good kind of life and the answer
179140	183780	Not always certainly, but in a growing number of cases the answer is no
184300	187140	So it's a it's a very interesting argument
187140	192420	I mean we have to say over and over again and John will say very explicitly in the podcast of course
192940	194580	certain individuals
194580	197660	Get very rewarding careers out of science education
198420	204940	But we also have to take into account those that don't and we're not primarily talking here about people who go into academia
204940	207980	We even want to go into academia. We're talking about tech workers
207980	214420	Which is a huge fraction of the people who go from STEM degrees into the workforce. They work for
215140	216500	computing
216500	218740	technology software engineering kind of
219820	221300	corporations and
221300	224140	It can be a tough road to hoe as a matter of fact
225060	229180	For one thing novelty and innovation is of course
230060	235740	valued it turns out for various reasons that we'll discuss that it can be easier to just
236220	239380	Get rid of your workers and hire newer younger ones
239980	245860	Rather than retraining the existing workers the new workers already have the skills, right?
245860	250460	They just learn them they're fresh in their minds that they're cheaper and then a decade or two later
250500	255760	They can be fired and they can be replaced. It might not actually be a
256260	262060	Sustainable way to think about our workforce or what it means to be a scientist or what it means for
262460	268740	Colleges and universities to do their students a good service by providing them with an education
269380	274940	Harder to come up with solutions to this issue than to diagnose it
275540	282420	Certainly very deep features of capitalism and our economic and political system are involved here
282420	285820	But it's an important issue to highlight one way or the other
285820	288860	We need to know what we're doing when we're training people in these
289540	292460	Different areas that I personally value very much
292700	298980	But we have to be explicit what to be conscious of what's happening. We can't just say oh science is good
298980	302780	Therefore do it we have to look into what happens when we try to do that
302780	307620	So I think it's not exactly what we usually talk about here on Minescape. It's sociology
307620	311940	It's an important part of the liberal arts spectrum. So let's go
315820	317820	I
329780	331780	Don scrappney welcome to the Minescape podcast
332540	336980	Happy to be here. I'm excited to talk to you Sean, you know since we're old friends
336980	341180	I thought I would start you off with a couple of soft balls to get the ball rolling here as it were
341700	345820	So what is this stem acronym and why is it a terrible acronym?
348220	352600	Actually compared to the alternatives, it's it's pretty awesome
353100	360100	So do you prefer stem over smet? I prefer not using an acronym. Oh, okay
360100	366140	Well, I gotta tell you the government has been searching for an acronym for quite a while
366300	372380	And and that's because they've been trying to count people in these fields for quite a while
373140	377540	Really since the Cold War. Yeah, I in the book. I include a
378900	383260	A New York Times story in which there's this panicky headline in the New York Times
383860	388860	About how the United States is falling behind the Soviet Union in the number of technicians
389780	395020	Would you would you prefer that probably not probably not they were talking about scientists and engineers
395380	403820	The National Science Foundation has scientists and engineers or s and e s ampersand e so not exactly that
404740	406740	that
406860	407660	Euphonious
407660	409860	one might say but it appears so often in the
410500	414980	Educational context and like no one majors in technology. That's not a thing, right?
414980	418340	You can major in science engineering or math. They're very different from each other
418340	424460	So I don't like lumping right together. So I kind of like using words rather than acronyms. Yeah. Yeah, so the technology
425020	429940	I saw a government report that used the acronym set science engineering and technology
429940	437300	So people really like technology. Sorry. They might know that and then there was and then there was some use of smet science math
438140	445140	Engineering and technology and that had a rationale to it where science and math are the foundations of engineering and technology
445260	447820	so it you know by putting them first that's sort of
448140	449420	kind of a
449420	454420	Temporal ordering of what comes first you do the basic science you understand the math and then you develop
454460	460660	The technology, but smet sounds like not I'm on a Pia, right? Yes, it's not bad
461660	464180	Yeah, oh my god a smet
464700	468180	so it didn't really catch on and then a
469620	475260	Judith Romley is her name. She was one of the higher-ups at the National Science Foundation
476060	480100	She apparently is the one who coined the stem acronym
480700	484220	just changing the order a little bit making it sound a little bit better and
485340	491860	Then it just took off. I I had a graduate student kind of look who's doing research assistance for me and
492380	498100	She looked at the rise of the stem acronym and it just started to appear in
499300	506020	bills in Congress and it just took off and so you may not like stem but a
506500	508620	lot of other people like it that is and
509380	512700	It's a much more detailed and serious answer than I was hoping for so
513380	516300	we're kind of stuck with it and and
516980	524580	What exactly it means? That's it. That's a different question, but but stem seems to have taken off internationally people use that acronym
524580	527220	They seem to understand when I talk to them about stem
527700	532540	So it's stem seems to be here to stay does it include the social sciences
533340	535340	That's a good question
535460	541260	The National Science Foundation officially includes social scientists in its
541900	547580	understandings of SNE science and engineering and then they also talk about stem we could go down a very tedious
548220	550460	rabbit hole about some of this but they
551300	558820	idiosyncratically I would say include social scientists because when most of the government policy makers are talking about
559820	564020	Stem they're not thinking about me. Yeah, they're thinking about you
564260	573100	They're thinking about a lot of other folks and and I can explain why that is and and people might protest that that
574300	577500	Sociologists economists demographers can be highly quantitative
578500	580500	political scientists as well and
580660	585220	You know really use advanced statistical computational methods
585220	588980	So why aren't they included in stem and I think that I
589860	593940	Think that that has a lot to do with what the government wants with its
594460	602540	Investments in stem education and they don't really want more of me. I arguably don't be offended. They probably don't want more cosmologists. Oh my god
606700	613620	Experts on general relativity, they're not saying we need more of those give us more of those they are looking for people to
614620	621140	You first of all fulfill employers demands and and these employers have been crying shortages
621660	629140	For quite a while. They want people to innovate. They want people, you know that technology that T that you were so skeptical of that's really what
629140	633340	That's what they care. Oh, I know that's yes, I think they're riding on my coattails. Honestly
634260	639620	they are they are and and they they have this hope that
640420	646940	By cranking out more experts in stem fields, they will innovate and
647740	653980	They will create new technologies that will boost American competitiveness and boost American national security
654260	658300	And grow the economy and provide jobs for everybody. I
658940	660420	wrote this
660420	665380	book chapter a few years ago in which I kind of traced the
666420	668420	the history of
668820	671300	American policymakers and what they wanted
671700	676060	I'm using the acronym anachronistically now what they wanted stem workers to do
676540	680900	Obviously, they weren't talking they weren't using the stem acronym during the progressive era
681420	686540	But during the progressive era is really when you saw the government trying to think about hey
686540	691980	We've got these experts in these science and engineering fields. We should deploy their expertise
692140	698380	And so the interesting thing about the progressive era was that they wanted to deploy the
699220	704660	Existing expertise if we can use existing in relation to expertise what people already knew
704660	708460	Uh-huh and and so like pure food the pure food act
709020	714620	Wow, we know why food spoils now. We know how to prevent food from spoiling. We know how to keep
715500	716860	Meat safe
716860	722820	Let's keep those let's use let's deploy that expertise and make sure that we can make food better
723580	730860	Progressives were real excited about, you know, all the new knowledge being generated and and they wanted to just deploy
730860	732860	to strategically as possible
733020	735020	then you had a
736260	742020	Sort of a change that happened during World War two which I'm sure you're familiar with with you know
742020	746420	the Manhattan Project and developing the nuclear bomb developing radar and
747500	752780	That was a little bit different in the sense that the government really wanted to deploy
753620	759180	Scientific and engineering expertise to create specific technologies that they really wanted
759460	766380	So they brought together a lot of experts and said hey, we want you to develop a system that can detect enemy aircraft
766380	769860	Or hey, we want you to come and develop a system that can produce a
770620	773700	Weapon that could potentially end this war the nuclear bomb
774060	778380	So it was very targeted use of expertise even though they didn't yet have the expertise
778500	781140	So you can see we're one step away from the progressive era
781300	784660	but by the Cold War we started to get into a
785500	791780	phrase that I I kind of called it alchemy because it suggested this sort of this hope that by putting stuff together
791900	795500	Something amazing would happen. It wasn't as rational and
796220	802540	And they didn't the government really didn't even have an idea of which fields we're gonna create the most innovations or the most
803060	810140	The most innovations that would create the most jobs or the innovations that would boost national competitiveness the most economic competitiveness
810140	815020	I'm talking about here. It was just the sense that by creating more people with STEM
815260	816460	educations
816460	818460	amazing things were gonna happen and
818660	820180	We don't know what
820180	823860	But amazing things are gonna happen just get them together kind of like Bell Labs
823900	828140	Maybe it was a little bit like that bring them together and amazing things are gonna happen and
829020	831020	in this in this
832460	837260	This kind of understanding of STEM education and STEM expertise it was
837780	841580	There was a lot of hope and faith kind of the faith and I like that
842220	847580	Use of the word faith. We normally connect that with religion, but it was almost like that
847580	849780	it was like wow these people are gonna save us and
850540	855380	Let's invest in them and let's make them go so techno optimism at an early
855900	860840	Yeah, yeah, that's yeah, that's a phrase that that's that's bounced around a lot in this
861660	866420	So so you've already implicitly answered this question a little bit
866420	870860	But I'm wondering since we're gonna be talking about STEM education and what happens to people who get STEM degrees
871500	878400	It to in what sense is this a job for sociologists to think about we haven't had that many
878600	883720	Sociologists on the show. We had a great talk with brokerington about offshore wealth management
883840	890360	But you know, we haven't really gone into you know enough to for the listeners who you know
890360	895440	I assume listen to nothing but the Minescape podcast to really get an idea about what sociologists do
895440	900080	So is this is are you doing mainstream sociology? Are you kind of branching out a little bit with this topic?
901520	903520	That's a great question
904240	908480	One of the reasons I went into sociology was that I see it as
909680	914440	The big picture social science. I I think that
915200	920040	Economists produce a lot of great knowledge. I think political scientists produce a lot of great knowledge
920680	922680	but I tend to
922840	931080	Think of the knowledge they produce especially economists as kind of looking through the world through a rolled-up piece of paper
931120	932360	You know, yeah
932360	939760	Creating that right now in my with my with my hands here and and you can see something you can focus on something really clearly
940560	942560	but you
942600	949640	Don't necessarily see all the different things that might be connected to that thing that you're really really focusing on right so
949840	951320	economists can
951320	959960	Can lead us astray sometimes in ways that I think if sociologists will more inclined to study some of the issues that economists focus on
961120	963280	You know, they might have provided a little bit of a corrective
963280	964640	so for example
964640	972320	The world is is filled right now with a lot of folks who are upset about free trade and how free trade
973040	979440	Produced a lot of economic dislocation people running losing their jobs people who used to work in manufacturing
979760	983440	Not having those jobs anymore those jobs have gone abroad
986200	990840	This should have been obvious and and and I think that the
991320	996640	Economists tend toward and sorry for any in the audience. I think they tend toward a kind of
997360	1003720	really basic sort of utilitarianism and so, you know, they might think well, we might lose some
1004520	1009420	Manufacturing jobs, but overall we're gonna be happier because you can produce
1010080	1015280	televisions more cheaply in Mexico or China now these are gonna be cheaper for us to buy and
1015800	1018320	And and these workers can move like water
1018320	1023800	They'll just flow around to the places where the economic opportunities are and everyone's gonna be better off
1024720	1030920	But what they don't understand is that people have identities their identities are often linked to their jobs and
1031680	1033360	and so
1033360	1034440	they
1034440	1036720	They struggle with economic dislocation
1037640	1039040	so
1039040	1044640	Sociologists, I think can look at this big picture see all these things going on and that's kind of what I
1044880	1051880	Love to do. I often think of the knowledge that I do compared to the knowledge that you do or that you generate
1051880	1059640	I think of the kind of science that you do Sean is like vertically integrated like it's really really
1060280	1062280	deep and
1062280	1067920	And like if you are focused on a problem of general relativity, I just keep reading that up because I know you wrote the textbook on it
1068800	1072600	But and someone knocks on the door and like Sean we got to talk to you
1072880	1074880	Like you lose your concentration
1075480	1080040	The whole thing falls down. You're annoying and and then you got to get back into it
1080600	1086120	Whereas the stuff that I do and why it's hard to do this podcast just to give you a heads up
1086640	1093680	It's like horizontally integrated knowledge. It's a lot of stuff at a more superficial level, but really broad, right?
1093960	1097920	so I'm trying to understand, you know, investments and
1098840	1101600	education and what what employers in
1102560	1110880	Software and oil and gas and chemicals and biopharmaceuticals like all this stuff. It's just it's kind of at a superficial level
1111800	1115480	But there's a lot of it. Yeah, and and I I love that though
1115480	1118880	And I think it fits more with my undiagnosed
1119280	1124480	ADD, you know that it's easier for me to get back into it if someone knocks on the door because you know
1124480	1127800	There's a lot of different footholds I can grab on to rather than that really narrow one
1127880	1131880	Does that make sense to you and I'm talking about we did have herp gintis on the podcast
1131880	1137160	I don't know if you know his work. Yeah, it reminds me very much of that even though he self-identified as an economist
1137160	1141200	But game theory evolution physics it all came in and I absolutely
1141880	1146760	See the appeal of that. That's why I do a podcast rather than just sitting in my office writing papers
1147280	1151920	Right, right, right exactly. So the sociology when I when I when I looked at this issue
1151920	1156560	I got a little pushback from some some STEM workers themselves like who are you?
1156600	1159280	What are you doing? You're a sociologist. Why are you looking at this? I?
1160200	1164240	Would like to think I'm the guy yeah who can look at the big picture here
1164240	1168520	I can see things that you can't see I can bring together different
1169360	1175480	Different ideas different systems of thought that maybe you're not aware of and use those things to illuminate social reality
1175920	1180600	In in a unique way that actually adds some value that makes a contribution. All right
1180600	1182600	Well, we'll see over the next hour whether we do that
1183520	1185520	I
1186080	1190760	Put a lot of pressure on yeah, I know you really just set yourself up there better be amazing
1191520	1198040	So let's for people who are not professional sociologists are hanging out there with let's set the stage
1198040	1203320	You know we have people who get degrees in the stem and I guess the two questions
1203320	1205600	I want to ask you can address them in whatever order is
1206280	1207520	one
1207520	1211640	What kinds of jobs do they go into right like you know within academia?
1211640	1215760	We love it when people go into academic jobs and we imagine getting a PhD becoming professor
1215760	1220320	But you and I also know that's a small fraction of all the people who get degrees in these fields
1220320	1222800	And the other is you know, how does that compare to all the other?
1223160	1228840	Jobs like how what is a fraction of people when they go in the jobs? They say oh, this is a stem job versus
1229400	1231160	What management?
1231160	1233160	Factory jobs. I don't even know what the categories are
1233760	1239960	Right, so that's a good question the government talks about the policymakers in the US government
1239960	1246120	I know your audience is international talks about stem and non-stem as a binary, okay?
1246120	1248120	it's one or the other and
1249560	1255720	There's a few people who go beyond that but in general they talk about stem and non-stem jobs
1255720	1263160	And they do that because of that what I talked about before this this hope that by putting people into these stem occupations
1263880	1273680	The sort of traditional stem occupations software developer chemist biologists, you know things that you knew in high school as as science and
1274560	1277400	engineering electrical engineering mechanical engineering
1278640	1284680	That by by getting people into those occupations these amazing things are going to happen
1285000	1291360	In reality as I'm sure a lot of your listeners know stem and non-stem is more of a continuum
1292240	1298080	I spent a lot of time thinking about that it ended up getting cut from the book for various reasons
1298480	1306840	But it's definitely the case that there's a lot of there are a lot of jobs that in which stem expertise
1307600	1310580	College level stem expertise is very very helpful
1311080	1315280	So if you any of your listeners or listeners or software developers
1315480	1320800	They would almost certainly prefer a manager who understands software development
1322080	1324080	And so there's
1324640	1327360	A lot of people who get stem degrees do go into management
1329120	1333040	A lot of people who get stem degrees go into practicing medicine
1333600	1335600	Now the government does not
1335680	1342400	Consider practicing medicine to be a stem job. Really people might think yeah, they might think why is that what's going on?
1343360	1348480	It's because of this thing about trying to create innovation. Okay, and practicing medicine
1349440	1352800	Is does a lot of great things for people as obvious
1353440	1356000	Obvious for anyone who's ever been to a competent physician
1356560	1361360	But they typically do not innovate and create patents and jobs and things like that
1361440	1368240	We've got stem we got md phd's who might do that for the most part practicing medicine is it's about deploying existing expertise
1369520	1378000	And another area where where stem people with stem degrees will go that are not the traditional stem occupations is finance of various kinds
1378240	1380880	Very much. Yeah. No, we're we're we are
1381600	1383200	I know you're aware of
1383200	1387760	People in physics who went into quantitative finance and do some very high powered things there
1389440	1395520	The national science foundation data the national science foundation runs this great survey called the national survey of college graduates
1395520	1397520	And I relied on it a lot for this book
1398240	1401600	It shows that people go into this category of
1402320	1404320	Of you know accountants
1404960	1410320	Auditors financial specialists it tends to group them together. We don't know exactly what those folks are doing
1410560	1417040	It's probably not a lot of black souls equations and some of the stuff that our friends in on wall street do
1417840	1424160	But but so that's another area where folks go and then a lot of folks go into jobs that don't use stem expertise at all
1424960	1428240	And there's just too many to mention. It's hard to make generalizations
1429120	1435040	That it's a it's a very wide variety of potential occupations for people with with stem expertise
1435680	1442320	But I want to emphasize and I do in the book that when the government invests in stem occupy in stem education
1443040	1445040	They want people to go into
1445760	1447760	stem occupations
1447920	1450400	And I should say at the outset right here
1451040	1452080	that
1452080	1454960	About 50 percent of all stem workers in the united states
1455840	1462240	Are in computers in some way right like that. That's like that's like the 800 pound gorilla of stem
1463600	1467840	And we're talking software developers. That's one of the most in-demand in-demand jobs
1468960	1473040	You know computer engineers of various types people web developers
1473200	1476160	There's just a whole range of occupations that involve computers
1476640	1482560	and one of the things that's really unique about that particular stem sector is that
1483520	1485520	Whereas
1485600	1488960	chemical firms like duPont hires chemists
1490800	1494800	Trucking companies or shipping companies probably don't hire chemists
1495680	1496960	but
1496960	1498960	computer experts of various types
1500000	1503760	They're their own silo where tech companies will hire these folks
1504160	1507520	But then they're also yeah like a band across the economy
1508080	1515440	Where just about everybody hires some computer experts to you know, do things run their payroll do their logistics
1515440	1518560	I always think of trucking because we don't think of trucking as being very high tech
1519040	1524320	But actually they hire a lot of data people and to manage this whole complicated system
1525040	1526240	so
1526240	1532480	That computer related fields information technology is a band across the whole economy retail
1533120	1536560	You know all kinds of occupations or all kinds of sectors will use that
1537440	1543600	Life sciences that'll be used in bio pharma. You know all that you know life science kinds of sectors
1544240	1545520	so
1545520	1548880	computer is really the 800 pound gorilla and and so
1549680	1551680	when we talk about stem workers
1551920	1554960	People have commented on the book a little bit like they're saying hey, man
1554960	1558320	This book seems to be really about tech and really about computer workers
1559280	1561280	And there's two reasons for that
1561520	1564400	One is what I just told you that so many workers go into that field
1564880	1567600	And the other reason is that those are the employers who
1568400	1570320	argue
1570320	1578080	And complain the loudest about shortages. They're the ones who are saying hey, man, we need more workers. Where are these workers?
1578800	1581520	Where what what's wrong with your universities?
1582080	1587760	What's wrong with you society for not giving us more more stem grads so that we can hire them?
1587920	1590320	Well, that's good because that's exactly where I wanted to go next because
1591040	1595760	Is the feeling that we get within academia that the humanities are on the decline?
1596800	1601680	And stem majors are kind of taking over is that accurate and nevertheless?
1601760	1604560	There's a lot of companies that are complaining. We don't produce enough stem majors
1605440	1610960	Yeah, so I should say at the outset that you know, the book is really about this puzzle
1611040	1616480	We we haven't we I've been talking for quite a while here already and I haven't even gotten to the puzzle
1616560	1623920	We'll get there my apologies the puzzle the puzzle is that there's all these claims of the shortage of stem grads and
1626000	1632080	Only according to some measures and this is the census bureau only 28 percent of stem grads work in stem jobs
1633280	1639920	There's different ways of counting and different datasets. My counting is about 40 percent of stem grads work in stem jobs
1640720	1642720	So it's a little bit higher, but still a minority
1642960	1646720	So the puzzle is there's all these complaints about shortages what's going on
1647040	1652480	You know, why aren't you producing enough and yet it's the data looks like we're producing a surplus
1652960	1654960	So that's that's kind of the puzzle there
1655200	1659200	And is that for that that figure those figures that you quote one way or the other are they sort of
1659680	1666800	Lifetime like sometime 20 years ago 50 years ago. I got a stem degree and now I am or am not or is it right out of college
1667440	1669440	so basically what they do
1670080	1677520	Is the national survey of college graduates comes it comes out every couple years and they ask a sample of college graduates
1677760	1680560	What did you get your degree in? What are you doing now?
1681360	1687600	So it's a slice of people so it includes people right out of college and people who have been out for a while
1687840	1692240	But that's a great question because I was really interested in whether people kind of
1693680	1698240	Go in massive numbers into stem early on and then move on to something else
1698800	1703760	But there's there's a lot of data that suggests even in high demand fields like electrical engineering
1704320	1705440	that
1705440	1708000	Some data suggests upwards is 50 percent
1708880	1714080	Right out of college say nah, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna go the stem route. I'm gonna go do something else
1714720	1720160	So really it's a it's a leaky pipeline. That's a metaphor that's often used. You've probably heard that metaphor
1720720	1724000	It's a leaky pipeline that leaks at all stages
1724960	1727920	If if we think about stem as something important
1728720	1731200	In elementary school people lose interest there
1731760	1737840	High school college and then right out of college and then throughout their work lives people can
1738560	1740560	Exit this the stem pipeline
1740720	1748400	That's one of the things I really wanted emphasizing this book is that too many people studying this focus on the stem pipeline is just about
1749200	1752320	education from k through 16 k through college
1753280	1755280	But really
1755440	1759680	People have to keep and we can talk about this later. People have to keep their stem skills up to date
1760560	1761680	and
1761680	1767200	And stem education if if you want to be successful in stem you got to keep your skills up to date
1767200	1771840	Your education doesn't end at college. It doesn't end at a phd. You got to constantly
1772960	1774960	Re-up you got to constantly
1776000	1780960	I call it the stem skills treadmill. I apologize for the transparent attempt to create jargon
1782560	1787360	But I really wanted to capture something here, which is the idea of moving while standing in place
1788320	1793760	Right stem workers really have to keep moving. They really have to keep learning just to be able to keep their job
1794720	1796720	And um, I feel like I'm getting off
1797600	1800240	No, this is what I mean that is ultimately where we want to go
1800320	1803760	But that's okay because we can go back and forth. But just to like just to drive it home
1803760	1806560	It's okay to get the point halfway through the podcast. Um,
1806880	1808000	I
1808000	1811200	One gets the impression that a successful
1811920	1816080	undergraduate majoring in a stem field is going to come out of college thinking of themselves as
1816720	1819120	elite and well-trained, etc
1819200	1826720	But one of the messages of your book is it's exactly those people who the employers think of as basically cheap and disposable
1826800	1828800	Right, they're going to use them for a little while
1828800	1832160	Until their skills are not quite as cutting edge anymore
1832480	1836160	And they're not going to really mind if they just fire them in higher new graduates
1836880	1841040	Right. I I talked to a CEO of a of a stem
1842240	1844080	an innovation economy
1844080	1846160	sort of company and
1846160	1848160	they hired a lot of stem workers and
1848800	1854640	This CEO used the phrase that I title a chapter of the book burn and churn
1855440	1861200	And it was striking. He he said just so matter of factly. Yeah, we burn and churn through them
1861760	1865600	They have a lot of enthusiasm and we take advantage of that
1866320	1870160	And when their skills fall out of date or when they get kind of burned out
1870400	1876720	Then we hire some more and we there's other studies that show stem employers like to get new blood. They like to get
1877360	1879840	New folks coming in there like they like this churn
1880720	1888080	And so that's seen as as a positive and there's not that much concern about what happens to people who get burned out
1888640	1891920	There's a lot of research. It's it's funny because for years
1892080	1894640	I've advised students and maybe you have as well
1895360	1896240	to
1896240	1901200	To major in the field that you're passionate about, you know to choose a career that you think you can be passionate about
1902800	1906480	But leave it to the social scientists to find something negative about that
1907840	1911040	And there's there's new research mainly from my field in sociology
1911520	1920000	About how employers exploit this passion. They think wow, we've got these workers who really love this and let's
1920880	1923760	You know get them to work 60 70 hours a week
1924160	1927040	We don't even have to pay them extra because they're so passionate
1927360	1932080	They've had great teachers and professors who've fired their excitement about this field
1932640	1933440	and
1933440	1940080	Let's ride that wave until it crashes or peters out or something and and and maybe we can then hire the next
1940640	1942400	group of passionate workers
1942400	1949200	So what leads these companies to complain about a shortage? Is it just that they want even more cheap workers just out of college?
1950160	1952160	so I
1952720	1956080	I kind of played dumb in the book a little bit. I'm like, all right employers
1956720	1959920	You say that there's a shortage. I'm going to take that at face value
1960560	1964160	If there really is a shortage, are you behaving like there's a shortage?
1964240	1971200	Are you acting like stem grads are scarce and valuable and can just produce magic that's going to benefit all of us
1971840	1974560	Or are you treating these folks as?
1975360	1976000	as
1976000	1977520	as disposable
1977520	1978640	I I
1978640	1980640	There's a lot of good metaphors Sean that work here
1980640	1984560	One of the ones I think about is squeezing an orange getting that juice out of it
1985360	1989120	In my la times op-ed. I suddenly thought about fast fashion
1989600	1992880	Something that kind of works or that's like really great for a short time
1993280	1995840	But you don't expect it to last you move through it
1996800	2003680	And so that's what they do and I just kept believing them pretending to believe them and saying, all right
2004160	2007040	Let's see if your actions match your words
2007680	2014080	And they just really it just really doesn't the new york times has a headline today
2015040	2018400	It's I don't know if I can mention the date in in this but
2019040	2020960	But it could be almost any day
2020960	2024800	There's a there's a new round of layoffs at major major tech companies
2025440	2030320	These are the firms they they created this lobbying group called forward us
2030880	2035920	That their whole their whole reason for being is the idea of a stem shortage
2036640	2038640	their whole reason for being is
2038640	2045120	Lobbying the government for both more stem grads more stem education and also more stem migrants to come
2046080	2050720	And a lot of these companies and it's part of the reason I talk about these tech companies
2051520	2053120	they
2053120	2056960	They're rich, you know, I mean some of these are are
2058320	2062400	Are all near monopolies. We're talking google. We're talking amazon. We're talking
2063280	2071280	Well alphabet, you know, google is tedious. They changed their names facebook's now meta, but huge, you know, two billion people have facebook
2071280	2073280	They own instagram
2073600	2076000	Apple has like a billion dollars in cash
2076480	2082480	They're they layoff workers. Yeah, they you know, they just we're done with you guys. We don't know. We hired too many
2082480	2084480	Sorry, we don't need you guys anymore
2085600	2089680	I I met a guy who was a former
2090400	2093040	HR expert at a major tech company
2093680	2098720	And he had a brilliant idea and I'm not going to give him credit because he actually wanted to remain anonymous
2099520	2104000	But he moved into the education field like elementary education and high school education
2104720	2109760	And in that field for students with learning disabilities, there's this thing called the IEP
2110480	2115600	Which stands for individual education program or individualized education
2116400	2118960	Plan something like that, but the idea is
2120000	2123840	You have a student with some kind of learning disability. You monitor their progress
2124080	2126880	You figure out what their strengths are you figure out what they need to know
2127760	2131760	And and he thought that was a great model for these really rich tech companies
2131760	2133760	That are constantly complaining about shortages
2134240	2141200	If if it looks like and who's going to know better than the employers themselves if it looks like some skills are about to be obsolete
2141920	2148480	Why not tell these workers? Hey, you've already got this great foundation in STEM education
2148960	2152000	Your specialty is kind of going
2152800	2157120	Going down. We need something new. This looks like it's going to be the new thing
2157920	2162800	We're going to put a little bit of money in there and we're going to train you and deploy you somewhere else in the firm
2164000	2166000	They they typically don't do that
2166560	2168560	They they let you go
2169280	2171680	Google, um, I think it was google was
2172400	2177520	Basically told companies are told employees. You've got this many months to figure out
2178400	2182000	What skill you want to develop you're on your own to figure that out. How do you know?
2182480	2184640	How do you know what's going to be the next in-demand skill?
2185440	2191680	And so they moved into that, you know, they they were given the opportunity to move into that but without guidance or without
2192000	2194640	Without paid training. So that that's really tough
2195360	2198880	I gotta lay another metaphor on you and this came from someone
2199840	2205440	A STEM worker an engineer who emailed me after my my la times op-ed came out
2205920	2210640	And I loved you know, I love to get the the voices from the field. It's so interesting to hear their stories
2211680	2216640	This engineer told me that he thought stem work was was something like
2217440	2220480	Prospect prospecting and mining in the 1800s
2221360	2225840	And you've got these people who chase the chase the latest gold rush
2226640	2229840	We're gonna go do that thing. It's gonna be really hot for a while
2230560	2234960	Maybe some people are gonna get rich. Maybe some, you know, stem workers are gonna stock options
2234960	2238880	There's gonna be a lot of stem people are gonna get rich, but then it's gonna peter out
2239840	2241840	And then those folks got to find the next big thing
2242800	2246480	And this engineer told me he didn't want his children to go into these fields because
2246960	2249760	He said it gets tiring chasing these gold rushes
2250240	2252240	Chasing these, you know, the the next
2252960	2257440	The next mine to be exploited and and and just really really
2258000	2262400	You know people really dig into it, you know, I can give your your readers can probably think of examples
2262400	2264880	But blockchain was really huge for a while
2266320	2268320	AI is now the huge one
2269120	2274880	You know, it it goes up and down if you're in oil and gas, you know, the if the price of oil is super high
2275040	2277760	They're like, wow, we need more look at we can pay them a lot
2278240	2281680	And then suddenly that price plummets and then that goes down
2282560	2286400	For people in the life sciences, there could be some promising new
2287680	2292080	Technologies in life sciences like right now MRNA is really big
2292400	2295600	Maybe there's gonna be some limitations there gene editing really big
2296320	2298960	Might be some limitations there. We'll see but
2299680	2301680	You get these fields that get super hot
2301920	2308480	And then they try they hire a lot of folks if they don't get fda approval if the clinical trials don't work out
2309040	2310240	See you later
2310240	2313760	And and and life sciences will lay off a bunch of workers as well
2314000	2321920	Is is it possible to oversimplify your argument by saying that there might possibly be downsides to capitalism?
2327040	2329040	I would say
2329600	2336640	That the problem isn't necessarily capitalism per se the problem really is
2338240	2345360	And this is where I really put on my sociologist hat and I'm but I'm borrowing from some ideas that come from from economists as well
2346080	2348080	There are cultural practices
2348960	2353440	That characterize american capitalism, especially american capitalism
2354400	2359680	Today and certainly over the last few decades, which are creating this problem
2361200	2362560	and
2362560	2364960	there's a lot of folks who've written about this but
2365440	2370160	There's expectations that investors have that they didn't used to have
2370800	2372800	And that is that they
2372800	2375520	It they call it maximizing short-term
2376480	2378480	shareholder value various
2378560	2381040	permutations of that phrase various versions of that phrase
2382000	2388640	But shareholders like there's there's a whole movement to create this thing that that that the stakeholders who really matter
2389120	2393120	For a corporation are the shareholders not the employees
2393840	2395840	The shareholders not the customers
2396160	2400480	Not the customers as anyone who's tried to do customer service in almost any field
2401120	2406080	Any sector not the people in the regional economy where the company might be based
2406400	2409440	It's the shareholders and they should expect
2409840	2413120	Value on their investment in the short term
2414240	2417120	And there's a lot of complicated stuff about how this came about
2417840	2419840	there used to be these massive
2420480	2422480	conglomerates that are all these
2422720	2424720	diverse sort of
2424880	2426880	companies under one roof
2426960	2428960	underwear and apple pie
2429360	2431360	Sarah Lee owned Haynes
2431920	2435280	The Sarah Lee company you know like under underwear company like all these crazy things
2435760	2437680	Put together and they were doing that to hedge them
2437840	2442880	You know kind of hedge their bets if the apple pie market collapsed at least they can make some money on t-shirts
2443600	2449680	So, uh, but shareholders were like no no no we want you to do what you do find your core competency do that thing
2450400	2454960	It was a massive redefinition of what corporations were really about
2455680	2460560	And there was a redefinition of what workers were and workers became costs
2461280	2463780	And investors began to applaud
2464880	2466880	corporations that shed workers
2467760	2472400	This was a big shift, you know, you would always have companies that would lay off workers when the economy was bad
2473120	2479440	But by the 1980s as we got to shift to this maximizing short term shareholder value kind of approach to corporations
2480240	2482720	You got companies that shed workers even in good times
2483680	2486320	And and the stock price would go up
2486880	2488320	I
2488320	2493760	I give the example of Sarah Lee because it's just such a it's such a great example and and the and the ceo complained
2493920	2500320	You know that like my god, you know what the investors just want us to get rid of workers. That's what they want and
2501040	2502400	you know
2502400	2504240	investors
2504240	2509600	They don't like training in the united states, especially the europeans are better at investing in training than the american
2510160	2512160	american corporations are why
2512720	2515280	You know sociologists like to talk about training as investing
2515920	2518480	But investors see that as spending money
2519120	2526240	And why are you spending money on that when you should be maybe doing stock buybacks or something to boost the value of your stock?
2526800	2531920	So I wouldn't say it's capitalism. I would say it's this version of capitalism that we have right now
2532880	2537680	We have similar kinds of short-term expectations among venture venture capitalists
2538400	2539920	Which I think are very important
2540000	2541680	It drives them
2541680	2547440	To put their money into software at the expense of other industries, which I think we need very badly
2547920	2552080	In the book. I'm very transparent about what I want staff workers to do
2552640	2558000	I want them to save the planet. I really want them to develop clean energy better plastics
2558720	2559680	of
2559680	2563520	Carbon capture technologies. There's so many things we badly need
2564160	2566160	But investors want software
2566720	2568720	They love software
2569120	2572720	You know instagram was worth a billion dollars when it had 11
2573360	2575360	employees
2575920	2582160	Instagram was was software. Yeah, and and the reason investors love software is because
2582880	2587200	That is a from the from the perspective of investor. That's a fantastic investment
2587680	2590480	You can easily demonstrate the technology works
2591120	2592400	unlike
2592400	2597200	New battery technologies unlike things that we badly need like fusion energy
2597280	2600800	You know, there's some startups doing fusion energy. But boy, when are we going to get that?
2600880	2602880	Can we really demonstrate that that works?
2603440	2606640	With software you can pretty much show that it works pretty quickly
2607600	2610800	You don't need a factory to create it
2611280	2616400	Which is a major advantage. Yeah, if you don't need a factory, you don't need employees
2617120	2619280	You just need a few people to do the software
2620800	2622480	and
2622480	2624480	and and so
2624480	2628560	And then you can make massive amounts of money that the return on software investments are like
2630960	2638080	10 times much percentage higher than returns on clean energy, which is which is what I think we badly need
2638720	2641680	And so investors, you know, if they just keep blockchain
2642640	2646320	ai's the new ones that I mentioned but any kind of software fintech, you know
2646720	2649840	technology related to to finance social media
2650560	2656400	The surveillance capitalism, which is another very, you know, there's a term coined by shoshana zuboff
2657200	2661440	You know tracking us on the internet. Wow, we can sell you more things
2662160	2665280	And and not necessarily have to produce things. So we don't need factories
2665360	2671120	We don't have what investors call the valley of death where you kind of go from the the innovation to the actual
2671760	2675440	Manufacturing phase which can take a while making sure the prototype works and all that kind of stuff
2676080	2678080	so that's a long way to say
2678560	2683200	Capitalism is not the problem. I think it's the version of capitalism that we have right now
2683600	2685280	Okay, and there's probably like a whole other podcast
2685280	2690800	We could devote to how that version of capitalism came to be but I'll we'll stay a little bit focused here
2691600	2694400	Uh, and I do want to give you a chance to mention that
2695040	2700400	The fear of becoming obsolete and then getting fired is not the only thing that is
2700960	2704080	Keeping STEM grads slightly unhappy. I mean, there's the
2704560	2705920	Overwork
2705920	2711440	aspect there's other things where the grass isn't quite as green as they hoped it would be once you've gotten your
2712000	2714800	bachelors in electrical engineering and enter the job market
2715840	2717840	Yeah, so I I tend to think
2718480	2724720	Again taking at face value these employers that there are these dire shortages and it's a crisis and those are the words that they use
2725120	2730640	Take that at face value. Well, what are they doing? How are they treating these these STEM workers?
2731040	2735200	And one of the things that they do is they incentivize movements out of STEM
2736080	2738080	and they do that by
2738080	2740080	paying their managers more
2740480	2744160	And I I know you're an NBA basketball fan. I know you love
2745120	2746560	you love
2746560	2750400	The Sixers you've got your passions there. Do you still love the Sixers?
2750400	2752480	We had Daryl Mori as a guest on the podcast
2753360	2755360	Okay
2756160	2757840	uh, so
2757840	2760400	It's interesting because in professional sports
2760960	2766080	The players who have these scarce skills are paid more than the managers, right?
2767120	2767840	in
2767840	2771120	In STEM the managers are typically not always
2771680	2776480	typically paid more than the folks who have the skills that are supposedly scarce. Yeah, and
2777440	2779040	and
2779040	2781040	employers control wages
2781360	2783600	they can
2783680	2786240	They decide how much to pay their workers
2786800	2790960	This is an area where I I think sociologists have done a little bit better than the economists the
2791520	2793040	the economists
2793040	2795040	they have some theories about wages, but
2795600	2796960	understanding
2796960	2800000	The starting point of the wage. I don't think they've been very good at
2800640	2806080	And I think sociologists are a little bit better at this. I talked to the co of a tech company
2806080	2808000	I'm using an anecdote here
2808000	2809600	And he was telling me
2809600	2815600	We need more we need more user experience designers the folks who design the interface of the software that we're using right now
2816400	2817840	and
2817840	2820080	And I don't want to pay them what they're demanding
2821280	2827280	And and he showed me there's these there's these services that kind of do surveys of how much people are paying
2827760	2833520	People in different fields including user experience designers and he's saying look at how much they make
2833520	2837440	I don't want to pay them more than this. That's a sociological kind of dynamic
2837440	2840080	It's called it's you know isomorphism is the jargony thing
2840080	2842720	But you know, we want to look like we're doing what other folks are doing
2842720	2846800	We don't want to be someone who pays their user experience designer too much
2847680	2849040	this this
2849040	2854240	This uh, this guy decided I can't find people here to do it. I'm going to outsource this job
2855360	2857360	So he went around the world
2857760	2860160	Eastern Europe, China, Mexico
2860960	2864560	India looking for cheaper user experience designers
2865520	2869520	Until he found some that he thought were competent and he could pay them less so
2871360	2873840	And then that's you know, the more that kind of thing takes off the
2874480	2879840	The less you incentivize people to move into that field in the united states and the more you become dependent on outsourcing that thing
2879840	2883280	but but a big argument that I make in the book is that
2884480	2892800	There's a lot of self-inflicted wounds here if indeed there is there is scarcity and the decision to pay your stem workers less than their managers
2893760	2898560	And to incentivize movements out of stem which not every firm does but it's very common
2899440	2901680	It's one of it's one of the problems in this area
2902560	2903680	well and
2903680	2905680	there is also the idea that
2907040	2911520	Because there truly are so many stem graduates that these employers can hire
2911920	2917520	That they can kind of abuse them once they're there, right that they can kind of give them overtime. Uh, there's these
2918160	2922000	Schedules that are invented to hit targets and really crush people
2922320	2928480	And it can be it can be kind of uh, soul-destroying to just toil away this job for a few years before you get outdated
2929600	2934320	I I think that that's exactly right. Sean and I I rely
2935120	2937120	pretty heavily on
2937360	2939360	to kind of explore the detail of this a
2940240	2943680	ethnography an ethnography by a sociologist named ofer charon
2943760	2948480	I want to give him a shout out because I think he did such great work where he spent some time at a
2949920	2951840	big tech company he had to keep it anonymous
2951920	2955840	but it's a it's a major tech company that that folks know and that is
2956720	2960080	you know has deep pockets it has a lot of money and
2961360	2967040	Boy, they work their workers really hard and and he he kind of captured this thing and I
2967360	2972240	I actually use this for my in my intro to sociology class to kind of in my sociology of work to talk about
2973040	2976000	Again, the sort of social scientists making everything seem bad
2976080	2981200	But even these jobs that are supposedly great even these jobs that looks that look fun
2981680	2984080	And the media image of some of these STEM jobs is
2984640	2988720	people playing foosball people playing ping pong
2989360	2994080	There was a STEM employer here in san diego that had this big swirly slide in the atrium
2994720	2996720	of their of their workplace
2997440	2999440	Uh
2999760	3004560	This ofer charon went to this company and saw that people didn't really use this stuff
3005360	3012160	That it looked like a lot of fun stuff was around but people didn't use it and that was because for much of the year
3012960	3016160	These workers were in what they call crunch mode or crunch time
3016880	3021680	And that is the time when they're racing to deliver a product that has been
3022240	3026400	promised at a for for a delivery date at a particular time
3027120	3029440	And they've got to make sure that it works
3030080	3031840	and they've
3031840	3033840	They've start working
3033840	3037120	He found workers worked an average of 67 hours a week
3037680	3039680	That's a long time. Yeah
3039840	3041840	And and they and they did it
3042480	3047680	Sort of voluntarily the the managers have these clever ways of managing workers to
3048080	3054560	If they didn't come with the passion to sort of coax the passion out of them or make them behave as if they're passionate
3055840	3058960	It's these pretty bruising performance reviews
3059520	3064640	Where every worker is ranked. It's it's called stacked ranking or forced ranking
3065520	3066960	Sometimes it's called
3066960	3068960	cynically rank and yank
3068960	3074000	Where you rank up the workers and you yank out the ones that are ranked in a low in a low position
3074720	3079360	But the workers themselves choose their hours and they choose the hours
3080080	3082800	Based on this idea that they want to impress their manager
3083360	3089760	So the manager might go to them and say hey, we got us this product. We want to deliver. We want it to have this and that capability
3090960	3094560	We need someone to do this particular aspect of this software for example
3095440	3096480	and
3096480	3099600	Do you think you could do it and how long do you think it'll take you?
3100400	3104800	And they want a high ranking. They want a high evaluation for their performance evaluation
3105440	3111040	So they kind of over promise or they certainly promise very ambitiously
3112640	3116240	Because if they say uh, that looks hard. Oh, I don't know about that
3116720	3118720	Maybe you should dial down your expectations
3120000	3122640	That manager is going to think I don't know if I want this guy
3122720	3128160	I mean the obvious analogies to graduate school cannot have missed your notice
3129120	3131120	Yes, yeah, there's
3131200	3132400	There's
3132400	3137040	There's definitely a lot of analogies to to graduate school. You were absolutely right
3137680	3141840	My mind is racing right now with some of them, but trying to stay focused here. So
3142480	3144480	So what you have is workers
3145120	3150080	seemingly voluntarily taking on these excessive hours and then
3151600	3153840	Working themselves very very hard
3154720	3158320	One one software developer compared it to drinking out of a fire hose
3158400	3160880	Just trying to keep up with all the stuff that's going on
3161680	3164560	And and developing the skills that they need
3165200	3168480	Maybe they promise something that involves a skill that they don't have yet
3168880	3174160	So they got to work to develop that and and that stuff is very difficult and one of the things that
3174800	3180560	Maybe some of your listeners are familiar with. I know some of the some of the stem workers with whom I've spoken are familiar with this
3180800	3188320	It's often a young person's game and and part of that there's there's reasons for that one of them is that
3189920	3194480	Some young people kind of realize wow, I'm going to have to keep my skills up to date all the time
3194560	3197440	That's going to be hard and I can do this for a little while
3197520	3200160	But I kind of burn out and then I move on to something else
3201120	3206560	The other thing is that older workers often have families and if you have families
3207440	3209440	They take time unfortunately
3210720	3213840	Maybe that's fortunate. That's okay. It's not it's not
3214880	3218000	It's it's something it's a job that you have to do
3218720	3219600	and
3219600	3222240	And it doesn't go away and and these workers
3223360	3225360	They have a they have a second shift at home
3226080	3228640	if they're not shunting that off onto a spouse
3229360	3233600	And and it gets harder and harder to self-train in your in your in your own
3234480	3237840	Your own time and so it just create it creates more and more stress
3238560	3246320	So these these deadlines happen and and and it does put a lot of pressure on on workers. And again, this might sound very
3247440	3251520	Softwarey very tech focused, but but those are the employers who
3252400	3258800	Say their shortages those are the employers who often are the richest those are the employers getting all this investment from investors
3259280	3263360	And if there's any place where we would expect STEM workers to be treated really great
3264000	3270960	It should be these employers and and I don't think we see that and there is there's a point you make in the book
3271040	3273040	and I wasn't sure whether this was
3273120	3276080	in your mind more aspirational or factual but the
3276720	3281280	Idea that a lot of there's some idealism in the young STEM workers
3281360	3284000	They want to or they should want to I'm not sure
3284560	3286560	make the world a better place and
3286720	3292160	That turns out not to be the most lucrative job opportunity the making a world a better place kind of fields
3293520	3295920	Yeah, so this is where I was able to
3296800	3301120	Explore some of the issues. I was a double major in sociology and philosophy
3301520	3306640	And I've always been interested like you in the meaning of life. What is this all for?
3307360	3309360	I don't get much
3309600	3313040	Opportunity to really study that but in the last chapter of the book
3313120	3317280	I wanted to really explore this question of STEM education for what?
3317920	3319360	what are we
3319360	3321360	what are we
3321760	3327200	What are we as a society hoping to get with these innovations that STEM workers are producing
3328240	3332880	And I think that some STEM workers and and I want to be really clear about this
3332960	3336800	I'm sure there's some very very happy STEM workers who are listening to this right now
3336880	3342560	I hope they're still listening and they're thinking I love my job. I'm not working 70 hours a week
3343040	3348800	This is fantastic. I'm making tons of money. I can retire early. There are those folks. I'm talking about the aggregate
3349760	3355360	And there are folks who are really excited to be working on interesting STEM problems
3356000	3358000	Regardless of what it is
3358320	3360320	Some some STEM workers are
3361200	3364560	And I admire them. They're kind of pure scientists in a way. They love
3365200	3370080	particular ways of thinking and so they could move from
3371040	3377520	cosmology or astrophysics into data science and predictive algorithms and things like that thinking
3377920	3379520	I
3379520	3381920	There's a guy I I don't know if he ended up in the book
3382000	3383120	I may have
3383120	3385040	I may have had him in there. I may have cut him out
3385120	3390400	But he was an astrophysics major who couldn't get a job or decided not to get a job in academia
3390800	3392960	And then he worked for a clothing retailer
3394320	3400960	That needed experts in AI and machine learning and that sort of thing so that they could
3401680	3403040	Give
3403040	3404560	customers
3404560	3406560	Suggestions of new clothes to buy
3407360	3410000	Okay, now very I would find that to be
3410560	3418160	Kind of soul-destroying to go from thinking about general relativity to be thinking about how can I get someone to buy things that they don't need
3419120	3424000	Yeah, but but from a pure science standpoint from the pure complexity of problem standpoint
3424400	3426400	Some folks can make that transition
3427360	3430800	But not everybody right and so there's a literature in
3431680	3434000	sociology and management and psychology
3434560	3440000	About how some jobs can produce moral stresses or even moral injuries
3440880	3444720	Anyone who's seen at at their workplace workplace bullying
3445280	3447280	That you know, they might have felt a moral stress
3447760	3453600	If they've known that their employer is someone at their job is embezzling that could create create a moral stress
3454320	3458880	But what I was interested in the last chapter of the book asking stem education for what?
3459840	3463520	Are the stem workers who are uncomfortable morally?
3464080	3467360	with the business model of their of their firm
3468320	3471280	And it's it's easy to pick on social media
3471360	3478000	But it's easy to pick on social media because there's a lot of evidence that social media produces a lot of social harms
3479120	3484240	And so I quote some workers at at facebook
3485040	3487360	Who've said facebook is hurting?
3488080	3490080	people at scale
3490320	3492880	another worker another worker more
3494320	3495440	more
3495440	3499040	Graphically said I feel like I have blood on my hands
3499760	3507200	For facebook's role in promoting disinformation and promoting political conflict in societies other than the united states
3507760	3511200	Other people have said well to actually promote conflict in the united states
3512000	3514000	there's new research coming out
3514160	3515440	about
3515440	3520560	Rises in depression, especially teen depression, especially teen girls pretty effective and
3521360	3523360	And there's studies are convincing. Yeah
3524000	3526000	there's there's evidence that
3526080	3527440	suggests
3527440	3531600	Hard to prove these things definitively causal inferences are very difficult in social science
3532080	3536320	But there's evidence that suggests social media use is part of the reason we're seeing
3537920	3540880	Very alarming rises in teen depression
3542000	3546400	So, you know, some stem workers can think oh, we're doing interesting things
3547120	3552400	Analytically these are exciting problems to solve. I'm working with smart people. They can get really jazzed about that
3553120	3555120	Other workers can kind of think
3555440	3561120	When I go home at night, I don't feel good about what I'm doing here. Yeah, um, you know, they're even like
3562560	3564320	I don't know if any
3564320	3569120	I don't know if any of your you or any of your listeners have kind of gone on these youtube rabbit holes
3569120	3573040	Where you start watching a video and then youtube saying what about this one? What about this one?
3573040	3575520	How about that one you like that check out this one?
3576320	3578640	and they they tend to
3579600	3583360	Lead you into more extreme content or more
3584000	3586000	shocking or emotionally
3586560	3588400	provocative content
3588400	3590400	there's a phrase
3590960	3596400	Engagement equals enragment or maybe you could reverse it enragment equals engagement, but the idea is
3597200	3600720	getting this emotional hook into the users by
3601600	3603200	outraging them
3603200	3605600	Is a way to get them to use the app longer?
3606320	3608080	and so
3608160	3609440	you know
3609440	3611440	Google the google owns
3611760	3613920	Alphabet owns google google owns youtube
3614640	3616640	They're involved in this stuff as well
3616640	3620480	Very rich company using using different technologies to get people
3621040	3626240	Very upset and you could imagine workers not being happy with this. Well before you
3627120	3633280	Defended capitalism a little bit saying that there's a particular type of capitalism which we've evolved to and and I
3633360	3639200	I appreciate the benefits of capitalism in in certain circumstances markets are good at solving certain problems
3639680	3642240	But a lot of what you're describing really just sounds like
3643120	3646400	Capitalism that's gotten better at being efficiently
3647520	3653280	Capitalistic because of faster information flows and faster decisions and more scales and
3653920	3656880	wider labor markets and things like that whereas
3658160	3663200	As a globe as a species we produce a lot. We produce abundance
3663440	3666640	And and do we need to think radically it's late in the podcast
3666720	3668880	This is where we let to you know get to speculate a little bit
3668960	3673120	So do we need to think more radically about the system that lets this all happen?
3675040	3678720	I actually don't think we need to think more radically about it. I think that
3679360	3682320	we have the tools available now to
3683440	3687600	Get more out of our investments in STEM education than we are getting now
3688400	3693120	One of the things we could do is create more incentives for
3694960	3697360	Innovators in the fields that we desperately need
3698160	3704000	I often think, you know, if if we're all made extinct by climate change or something like that
3705520	3708720	And you know when alien civilization comes down and they look at us and they think well
3708720	3710720	What were you guys investing in
3710720	3715680	When the planet was falling apart and there were pandemics and the signs were all around you that you were in big trouble
3716080	3718800	And if we say cryptocurrency blockchain AI
3719600	3721600	surveillance economy, you know
3722480	3724480	It's going to look a little silly
3724560	3725920	so
3725920	3728720	I think some intervention is needed, but not a radical change
3728800	3734480	So one of the things we could do is create more government incentives in investment in clean energy
3735760	3737760	Better plastics that don't
3738000	3742560	To don't create micro nanoplastics that are in our bodies and human breast milk
3743120	3744560	incredibly
3744560	3748320	Forever chemicals that we don't know what are doing with us. We can create
3749200	3751680	We can create incentives through tax
3752240	3757600	rebates or tax incentives to make these movements happen the inflation reduction act
3757680	3764560	Which is a very general name for a very big bill did create these incentives and it's created stakeholders who are are
3765200	3770480	Moving into the clean energy space. So one thing you can do is create incentives for more of the investments we need
3770880	3776080	That'll produce more opportunities for stem workers to deploy their skills in ways that might feel morally
3776720	3778720	resonant with them
3778960	3781200	And another thing you can do is simply
3782400	3784240	Make illegal
3784240	3790800	Some uses of stem skills. There's there's a lot of debate in among legal experts about whether
3791600	3793840	Targeted advertising should just be banned
3794400	3799760	So that you remove the incentive for these companies to endlessly find ways to
3800320	3806160	To surveil their all of us on the internet because if they can't do this targeted advertising
3806240	3810640	Then they don't have an incentive to do that anymore. So you can legislate things away
3811440	3813120	and then
3813120	3815120	another thing you could do is just think about
3816960	3821440	Moral limits on investors and and business models, you know
3822480	3826160	Cannabis is legal in my state of cal of california
3826880	3833680	But my understanding is the cannabis business is a little shaky because banks are a little nervous working with those folks
3834400	3839600	There's there's this kind of sense that they're sort of cordoned off like whoa, you guys are a little bit different
3840400	3841600	um
3841600	3846000	I hesitate to use this word, but pornography is a very lucrative field
3846000	3851600	That's also kind of like, whoa, we don't want to invest in that, you know, we don't really want to be a part of that
3852560	3859920	So we already have moral limits that shape investor behavior and and what people are willing to
3860800	3864720	spend their time on in terms of business practices and investing
3865520	3867360	but for some reason
3867360	3869360	it's okay to
3870560	3876080	Take away people's privacy to stoke division and conflict to encourage
3877760	3880560	Disinformation the spread of disinformation in society
3881360	3884880	A lot of things that you might argue are more harmful than cannabis
3886160	3892160	You know are okay for investors to invest in you know mass layoffs, which disrupt families
3892560	3894960	There's a lot of things that investors tolerate right now
3895760	3900000	Which perhaps they shouldn't perhaps a little more moral education
3901040	3907280	Could could go a ways here as well, you know, I'm not a cannabis guy, but I was an online poker player
3907760	3915920	And uh, it it used to be done by many many people and the government swooped in one friday and seized all their assets
3916480	3919120	And uh, really basically can't play poker online now
3919680	3923360	Certain states you can but it used to just be all over and and I agree
3923440	3926400	That's a lot less harmful than some of the things you just mentioned
3927600	3930240	Yeah, so there's there's research that suggests that
3931200	3932160	you can
3932160	3937920	You can tweak capitalism. You can you can fix it and which in ways that will generate
3938640	3945520	The productive energies the innovation the riches the capitalism that can produce and minimize some of the harms that we that we see
3946080	3948640	Well, I don't quite so the thing that I'm still missing though is
3949200	3951200	The innovation disrupting
3952000	3958000	The kinds of jobs that people grew up having you know if if if as is plausible
3958400	3961760	The rate of innovation and and which skills are relevant is
3962560	3964560	Increasing the rate so it's faster now
3964880	3972000	We're always going to have a an issue where people who hit 50 are no longer valued and that that does seem a bit harder to solve
3972000	3974000	I'm not quite sure how to do it
3974000	3975600	Yeah, so
3975600	3982080	The the national survey of college graduates. They they asked this broad range of of of college graduates
3983120	3987440	Did they take skills related training in the past year or two and
3988240	3989360	and
3989360	3995920	We looked at the time since their degree and about 60 percent have taken skills related training in stem
3996880	3998880	Up to 30 years after their degree
3999600	4004320	So we're getting into the 50s. It starts to go down when we're getting into getting into people's 60s
4004720	4009440	So you're absolutely right that that is an issue. So one of the things that we need to do is
4011760	4015120	I don't like this phrase Sean because it sounds so 1970s
4016080	4020240	The lifelong learning we we have this model of education
4020880	4022880	That you graduate
4023280	4025360	in your early 20s, and then you're gone
4026320	4027920	and
4027920	4032560	And I really think we need to change that we're in a different era now
4033200	4038800	And we need a model where we think of college as a place you return to
4039520	4041040	periodically
4041040	4043040	for skills updating or
4043600	4048480	A rescaling something in a different area altogether when your skills become obsolete
4049680	4054480	Maybe something like a subscription model or something where you can go back to your alma mater or a different university
4054960	4061040	But this expectation that we have of college is something you do when you're young and then you move on
4062000	4064080	Maybe needs to be changed a little bit
4064720	4068880	I I still think that college education is absolutely essential for creating
4069280	4074800	But I would I like to think of as foundational skills the basic skills that a college graduate has
4075280	4077280	One of the things is to learn how to learn
4078400	4080640	PhD training really makes you good at that
4081120	4085440	But even with the bachelor's you kind of learn how to learn you can discern good knowledge from bad knowledge
4085440	4087440	You learn how to sort of sort through
4087520	4089760	what's what's good and bad and in in
4090560	4093040	Trying to find the skills that you might need or the knowledge you might need
4094000	4096000	But you'll have that core foundation
4096560	4101760	But then on top of that the skills that you actually deploy at work might change many times throughout your career
4102560	4106160	So I would argue and I'm working on a book on this with a colleague right now
4106800	4108800	College education is great for that foundation
4109280	4111280	But circling back to
4111600	4114560	College to get a skills updating not for another degree
4115440	4117440	but kind of a short-term certificate
4118080	4119120	kind of
4119120	4124480	Very specific narrow kind of skill that can be deployed now might be something that many people will have to do
4124800	4130880	Repeatedly throughout their careers. I mean I am course of course. I'm very much in favor of lifelong learning
4130960	4133840	I do wonder though about the model because
4134640	4140400	What is that a very different life stage at age 40 than age 20 right when you're 20 not only you're learning it for the first time
4140560	4145680	But there's a certain freedom to fail because your obligations are relatively low
4145760	4148560	But once you have a kid and mortgages and things like that
4149440	4155200	And also you've been happy for the last 20 years doing some job. I mean I I'm in favor of efficiency
4155680	4161600	But I feel the human cost of having to say I need to do something different than what I've been doing before
4162960	4166320	Yeah, I agree with that. But the reality is
4167040	4172240	The reality is upon us. You are gonna have to do something different. There was a great study that was done
4172720	4176960	You know, social scientists love a natural experiment where something happens and you can
4177680	4179440	Something happens that's rare and you could
4180000	4182480	examine how human beings respond to it
4183120	4185120	so Steve Jobs decided that the
4185920	4190800	iPhone was no longer going to support adobe flash software right said, you know what?
4190800	4193680	We're not going to do adobe flash anymore. We're going to use something else
4194240	4196240	And there were a lot of software experts
4196960	4201600	On adobe flash not necessarily employed by adobe, but that was what they did
4202400	4208400	Suddenly that was gone. Yeah, they had to respond. So that reality is already there
4208880	4210880	Where the where a skill that
4211840	4213840	Has maybe been developed over a few years
4215200	4217200	It's just no longer needed
4217280	4218880	and
4218880	4223440	So that reality is already there. So how are we as a society gonna gonna deal with the
4224320	4228480	the regular obsolescing of technical skills and
4229200	4231200	You're right. It's definitely hard
4231760	4234080	People's identities get wrapped up in their jobs
4234720	4235920	and
4235920	4239040	And they their their skill sets get get, you know
4239520	4244560	More and more fine-tuned and then to lose that can be really tragic, especially as you say if they have a family
4244880	4246880	So that's going to be difficult. I think if
4247200	4252640	If shareholders don't punish companies for investing in the training of their workers, especially the richest companies
4253280	4256960	And for investing in their workers, that should be something that's encouraged and applauded
4257840	4260800	I got to tell you I don't want to go off the subject too much here
4261040	4265120	But google invests a lot of money in schools
4265760	4268560	They they give away chromebooks to students
4268640	4275200	They do a lot of things to get to train the next generation of software developers at that stage
4275920	4279200	But they could do more for their incumbent workers. Yeah
4279840	4282960	You know, that that's the odd thing and so social scientists
4283040	4288880	They they talk about corporate social responsibility and some things are done kind of as corporate branding, you know
4289040	4293840	Like look how good we are. We give away this money. Some of it's done to kind of create market share
4294160	4297520	Let's get a bunch of people using chromebooks and they're gonna love google
4298080	4300800	So there's there's money that's being spent in this area
4300800	4305680	But I would argue they could do more for their incumbent workers to manage these sometimes
4306240	4308240	Sometimes very difficult to navigate
4309200	4312960	Uh career changes or job skill changes later in life
4313280	4318080	Maybe maybe as a final thought we can be more idealistic ourselves because uh, of course
4318720	4320720	We want people to get
4321280	4322880	lucrative
4322880	4327120	Rewarding jobs that they can have in some level of security throughout their career
4327200	4329920	But that's not the only reason to get an education, right?
4330640	4334400	When people ask me about applying to graduate school in physics
4335120	4340960	My line is typically that you probably you will probably go in hoping to be a professor
4341120	4343440	You probably will not succeed at being a professor
4343760	4348240	But getting a phd in physics is actually an intrinsically good thing. You'll you'll be able to do something else
4348320	4349920	You'll learn a lot of skills, etc
4350560	4353680	I don't feel the same way about being a postdoc, but that's a different conversation
4353760	4356880	But you know, where does that fit in to this conversation?
4356880	4361840	Just the idea that getting a degree in STEM or related fields, you know has some value
4362400	4365040	Whatever your future life trajectory turns out to be
4366320	4369760	So I've seen that argument and
4370800	4375360	I appreciate your honesty when you tell people that the odds are
4376080	4379040	The odds are they will end up doing something different, right?
4379280	4381920	Then I think that's an important message to give them
4382400	4386240	Say yes, this is a great thing to do. You're going to get some very important skills
4386640	4389040	But keep an open mind for developing
4389680	4394480	Keep an open mind toward career trajectories that don't look like physics, right? So one of the
4395280	4401120	One of the disturbing findings I had in some research with a colleague when we looked at the national survey of college graduates
4401520	4405200	And we looked at people with STEM degrees who went into non-stem jobs
4406080	4411280	Is they were significantly less likely to report being satisfied with their jobs
4412080	4413200	overall
4413200	4415200	and interestingly
4415200	4421200	They were significantly less likely to be satisfied with the intellectual challenge of their jobs
4421440	4422800	interesting
4422800	4424800	so
4424880	4430720	A little bit less or they're less satisfied. They seem to be a little bit more likely to be bored
4431840	4433840	I don't feel so great about that
4434240	4435680	and
4435680	4436960	and so
4436960	4442400	You know being honest with people and telling them. Hey, there's a good chance. You'll be doing something else
4442800	4446720	I would encourage folks to develop a broad range of skills through
4447360	4453040	We've got this I call it STEM mania in the book at my university Sean University, California, San Diego
4453120	4458160	It's it's sort of like a public caltech. I always thought of it as that it's it's really STEM focused
4458640	4459840	It was born
4459840	4465360	It's it isn't send you because that's where the script since student oceanography was and that sort of stem tone
4466000	4468000	really kind of dominates the university
4468640	4474240	And the students who major in the humanities and social scientists are social sciences other than economics
4474800	4476960	regularly have to defend themselves to the
4477600	4483280	They're they're the stem the stem majors who are like, what are you going to do with that? What's wrong with you?
4483440	4485440	This is crazy
4485920	4487920	And so this will sound self-serving
4488000	4492000	But I tell my stem majors who do take sociology classes
4492160	4495840	It is important to get a broad range of skills skills related to
4496400	4501200	communication written oral critical thinking outside of technical skills
4501840	4503360	because
4503360	4508560	Chances are you're going to move into something outside of stem or sort of stem adjacent
4509120	4513840	And and and college is a time to really develop that that broad range of skills
4514160	4519920	I mean you always had that I mean you really always stood out your double major in philosophy and astronomy as I recall
4520080	4524480	Yeah, so you always had that message, but that's not typical
4525040	4531280	And so you could segue into this whole podcast thing and you know this this whole range of
4531840	4534640	Stuff that you do because of that undergraduate training
4535840	4538960	I'm trying to make a world of little miniature Sean Carroll's
4539680	4541680	So that they will have that
4542240	4547200	Flexibility to plug into different places in the economy stem expertise is great to have
4547200	4553840	I I would think the best thing that you could have to prepare yourself for the workplace of tomorrow is stem skills and
4554240	4558480	non-stem skills foundational sorts of skills like like like you have
4558800	4562240	Yeah, I mean you're not going to get any argument from me that the broad base is important
4562400	4566080	But if it's true that people who get stem degrees
4566800	4568320	report
4568320	4571120	dissatisfaction with their jobs once they get them
4572080	4575840	What are the data about humanities degrees or social science degrees?
4576880	4583440	No one cares about them. So I I didn't have a grant to look at them. I didn't really look at those folks
4584080	4587520	There are I I initially wanted to explore this there are
4588400	4590400	Pretty significant percentage
4590880	4597680	Different studies have different percentages, but a good 15 percent, you know of stem workers don't have stem degrees
4598560	4600560	and so you have folks
4600560	4601600	excuse me
4601600	4607520	You have folks who majored in humanities sort of subjects and they moved into technical fields
4608160	4612800	One of the great things about software development is it's a field that's pretty porous
4613280	4616800	You don't it's not like electrical engineering. It's hard to break into electrical engineering
4618880	4620880	Life sciences without those degrees
4621600	4629680	But software is is wonderfully porous you can you can be this sort of kid who worked on a computer in high school
4630320	4634720	Went and got I actually have a friend of mine who was a creative writing major
4634800	4639440	But he tinkered with computers in high school. He developed some some software
4640160	4643120	Sold it to a major software company did really well
4644000	4646000	Even though his major was creative writing
4646080	4649440	So software is is is really welcoming to people
4650160	4655280	You can do these boot camps where you get your foundational skills in writing and communication
4655680	4659200	Then you do a boot camp encoding or data data analytics or something
4659440	4662160	Then you can plug into the stem economy that way
4662480	4665920	So that's definitely something that that you that you can do
4666560	4671360	So I I applaud those folks, but for the most part people are not
4672320	4675200	Worried or valorizing our humanities majors
4675680	4676880	And so
4676880	4682720	And and I don't want to say we need to treat our stem majors and our stem our stem grads better than the other grads
4683520	4684560	but
4684560	4690320	If we say that there's shortages of stem grads if we say that stem grads are so important for the economy
4691280	4694320	We should at least treat these weeks these folks really well
4694880	4702160	And and hopefully treat everybody really well, but at least these folks who were constantly saying are so important and in such
4702480	4708880	Short supply. Well, okay. I like your final message, which is everyone should major in creative writing. I think that's a very
4710720	4715680	Wonderful world going forward. So it's John Scranton. Thanks so much for being on the mindscape podcast
4716240	4720160	Thanks, Sean. It was great to be here and you know, I just want to end with one thing
4720640	4724960	I've listened to podcasts before where people know the interviewer the host of the podcast
4725280	4728960	And they tediously kind of say, oh, we had also many great times in the past
4729440	4731360	You can cut this out my friend
4731360	4737360	But probably not many listeners know that you were a double threat on the basketball court
4737920	4742800	Not another no that you had an a sweet jump shot from the outside
4742880	4748480	I still remember the sound of the ball going through the net and nothing but the sound of that
4749120	4752160	And you had a you had a pretty good drive to the to the hoop as well
4752240	4756000	If someone covered you too close to the three-point line, you could blow by him
4756480	4759520	So not many not many of your listeners may know that about you
4759600	4765440	But that's definitely you were a multifaceted skilled guy and still are sorry to use the past tense
4765520	4770160	You must remember that that lefty hookshot was so annoying to everyone else yours
4770720	4777120	That like so many people, you know complained about it that you started complaining about them complaining about it because they weren't used to a lefty
4777840	4781920	That's that's right. But if everyone expects a right-handed jump shot
4782240	4788160	Then the left-handed hook is gonna is gonna is gonna keep me keep me going for quite a while something to remember
4788320	4790640	Thanks very much, John. Okay. Thanks, Sean
4800160	4802160	You
