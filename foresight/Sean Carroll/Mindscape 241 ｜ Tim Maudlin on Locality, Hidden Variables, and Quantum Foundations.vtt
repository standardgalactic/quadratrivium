Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.

00:03.600 --> 00:07.720
Today's podcast is one of those long-awaited episodes. People have been

00:07.720 --> 00:11.600
asking for this one for a long time. You know, it's funny. Sometimes there are

00:11.600 --> 00:16.640
some possible guests who are just so obviously Mindscape guests, and I haven't

00:16.640 --> 00:20.120
had them on yet, and people are like, well, what's wrong? Why doesn't he have them on

00:20.120 --> 00:24.560
yet? They must be feuding. There must be beef or something like that. That's not

00:24.560 --> 00:29.160
usually the correct answer. It's usually just that I'd like to space them out.

00:29.160 --> 00:34.760
As I've said many times, I like to have a variety, and that includes both people

00:34.760 --> 00:38.360
who I know very well and I'm familiar with their work and the people I've never

00:38.360 --> 00:43.720
heard of before. I got to looking for podcast guests. So Tim Maldon is someone

00:43.720 --> 00:48.160
I've known for a long time. He's a leader in the philosophy of physics or what we

00:48.160 --> 00:52.920
sometimes call the foundations of physics. So studying not physics as a

00:52.920 --> 00:58.440
philosopher, but studying nature as a philosopher, but doing so in such a way

00:58.600 --> 01:01.920
that you're looking at the foundational questions of nature. You're asking the

01:01.920 --> 01:06.720
why questions, the deep questions. You're trying to be very careful. And Tim has

01:06.720 --> 01:11.120
done very important work in thinking about space time and the geometry of

01:11.120 --> 01:16.520
space time, the nature of time and the arrow of time. I will point to, I'll try

01:16.520 --> 01:21.920
to link in the show notes to a wonderful mock debate that was done at the

01:21.920 --> 01:26.800
Foundational Questions Institute between Tim and Julian Barber. Julian Barber

01:26.800 --> 01:32.040
famously has advocated that time does not exist. Tim has famously advocated that

01:32.040 --> 01:37.400
not only does time exist, but the arrow of time is fundamental, not just an

01:37.400 --> 01:41.760
emergent approximation because of statistical mechanics. And what FUXI

01:41.760 --> 01:47.080
does is it has the debaters flip sides. So Julian was arguing in favor of the

01:47.080 --> 01:51.400
existence of time. Tim was arguing against it. And they were both really,

01:51.400 --> 01:55.000
really good. I got to say, they were both quite persuasive. For the points of

01:55.040 --> 01:59.600
view, they didn't actually agree with as well as being quite amusing along the

01:59.600 --> 02:03.480
way. But today, we're actually going to be talking about quantum mechanics. In

02:03.480 --> 02:08.760
some sense, this can be thought of as a sequel to the podcast they did a while

02:08.760 --> 02:13.720
back with David Albert talking about quantum mechanics. David and Tim are

02:13.720 --> 02:16.120
very good friends and have worked together for a long time. They don't agree

02:16.120 --> 02:20.880
on everything because no two philosophers agree on everything. But they are

02:20.880 --> 02:25.080
united in their skepticism about the Everett interpretation of quantum

02:25.080 --> 02:29.320
mechanics. And so with David on the podcast, even though I'm pro Everett, I

02:29.320 --> 02:34.280
want to give the voice to sensible voices on the other side, sensible points

02:34.280 --> 02:38.760
of view. And so David explained why he doesn't like the Everett interpretation.

02:38.760 --> 02:43.880
What we didn't get to right at a time was what he does like. So today with Tim,

02:43.880 --> 02:49.600
we're going to be talking mostly about Bohmian or de Broglie-Bohm versions of

02:49.600 --> 02:53.040
quantum mechanics, sometimes called hidden variable versions of quantum

02:53.040 --> 02:56.240
mechanics. I keep calling them hidden variable theories as most people do,

02:56.240 --> 03:00.400
even though as advocates like to point out, the variables are not hidden. The

03:00.400 --> 03:04.120
extra variables that you add to quantum mechanics to make a hidden variable

03:04.120 --> 03:09.080
theory are the ones that you observe when you actually make a measurement. And

03:09.080 --> 03:12.640
physicists have not really caught on to hidden variable theories. They're not

03:12.640 --> 03:17.920
very popular. But certain sets of people, some physicists, some mathematicians,

03:17.960 --> 03:22.800
some philosophers have kept the flame alive. And interestingly, as we talk

03:22.800 --> 03:28.720
about in the podcast, the Nobel Prize last year was given to tests of John

03:28.720 --> 03:33.680
Bell's famous theorems, his famous inequalities, which were very much

03:33.720 --> 03:38.120
prompted. Bell's exploration of these theorems and his proof of them was

03:38.120 --> 03:43.240
prompted by David Bohm's hidden variable theory, which Bell thought was the

03:43.280 --> 03:46.240
best formulated known version of quantum mechanics. Bell thought we should be

03:46.240 --> 03:51.000
teaching it in textbooks. So it's a little weird that the people who really

03:51.000 --> 03:55.320
take these theories seriously get good results that later lead to Nobel

03:55.320 --> 04:00.360
Prizes, yet the theories themselves are not very popular within physics. Again,

04:00.360 --> 04:05.360
I could give my reasons for not being a fan of hidden variable theories, but

04:05.360 --> 04:10.120
they are, as Tim says about Everett, they are absolutely a serious attempt.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.840
You know, it's something that you should think about if you care about these

04:12.840 --> 04:16.000
things. And so we'll give the sales pitch for why you should take these

04:16.000 --> 04:19.200
seriously. We'll talk a little bit about foundations of physics more generally

04:19.200 --> 04:22.720
and even a little bit about the arrow of time. And the other thing that I want

04:22.720 --> 04:26.400
to mention, because Tim reminded me of it at the very end of the podcast is

04:26.640 --> 04:31.240
Tim is a the director and I think his title is director. But anyway, he's

04:31.240 --> 04:36.000
the founder of something called the John Bell Institute for the foundations of

04:36.000 --> 04:41.160
physics. Tim has been very active, not only in doing foundations of physics, but

04:41.160 --> 04:46.760
in advocating for the status of this subdiscipline within philosophy and

04:46.800 --> 04:52.400
physics. And the Bell Institute, which is located in Croatia and serves as a

04:52.400 --> 04:57.720
place to meet and talk about foundations of physics is trying to raise funds to

04:57.720 --> 05:01.960
get a permanent home. So they literally have a GoFundMe and you can visit the

05:01.960 --> 05:07.240
John Bell Institute home page at johnbellinstitute.org that will link you

05:07.240 --> 05:12.080
to a donate button. You can donate to the permanent home for the John Bell

05:12.080 --> 05:16.280
Institute, where we're not there yet. We need a bunch more donations, but I

05:16.280 --> 05:19.960
think they just started. So it's early days. Maybe mind scape listeners will

05:19.960 --> 05:22.480
kick in a little bit. And with that, let's go.

05:38.080 --> 05:42.400
Tim Maldon, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. Thank you. Good to be here.

05:42.520 --> 05:45.400
So you've been a champion for a little while of something called the

05:45.400 --> 05:50.160
foundations of physics. So I want to ask you two questions. One is, what is that

05:50.160 --> 05:55.560
for the listeners out there? But also, what's your sales pitch like? Hypothetically,

05:55.560 --> 05:59.000
if you're talking to your colleagues in a physics department or philosophy

05:59.000 --> 06:03.560
department, how do you explain to them why foundations of physics is so important?

06:03.880 --> 06:08.880
Okay. Oddly enough, I don't have to sell it to the to the philosophers. It's a

06:08.880 --> 06:13.480
weird situation. You have to sell it to the physicists. But it's very simple.

06:13.480 --> 06:17.240
Really, foundations of physics, as the name suggests, is a branch of physics,

06:17.280 --> 06:23.080
namely the one that asks, what are the most fundamental items? How do we

06:23.080 --> 06:27.280
understand the most fundamental physical structures and things that there are?

06:27.680 --> 06:32.480
And that's only part of physics, because you could do condensed matter

06:32.480 --> 06:37.200
physics, where you say, I'm just worried about other states or the physics of

06:37.200 --> 06:42.840
stars, and you take for granted a lot of the micro stuff, or at least how to

06:42.840 --> 06:46.560
handle it. And then you're building up from there. But if you just dig and dig

06:46.560 --> 06:50.440
and dig and say, at the very bottom, what's the stuff that doesn't get

06:50.440 --> 06:55.120
explained in terms of other stuff? That's the foundations. And so if you do that

06:55.160 --> 07:00.600
in physics, that's the foundations of physics. In philosophy, it's easy. I

07:00.680 --> 07:05.280
actually just gave a talk about this to the undergraduates at Rutgers, because

07:05.280 --> 07:11.400
that is part of what philosophers call metaphysics or ontology, which is again

07:11.400 --> 07:18.720
just the question of what exists asked at the most generic level. And if you're

07:18.720 --> 07:22.080
a physicalist, you think everything that exists is somehow physical. If you're

07:22.080 --> 07:24.240
not, you might think there are other things that aren't physical, but

07:24.240 --> 07:26.880
everybody pretty much agrees. There's some physical stuff.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.960
Not everybody's happy, but not everybody. Of course, every time you say

07:30.960 --> 07:35.840
something, you can think of a counter example, unfortunately. Now, the curious

07:35.840 --> 07:39.400
thing, if I describe it that way, is you say, but why should you have to sell

07:39.400 --> 07:45.120
this to the physicists? Why isn't this just part of the physics curriculum? And

07:45.120 --> 07:50.520
that has a very strange and disturbing sociological answer that really goes

07:50.520 --> 07:56.920
back to quantum mechanics, because they didn't really understand when the

07:56.920 --> 08:00.680
quantum mechanical formalism was first developed in a way that was very

08:00.680 --> 08:04.440
predictively successful. They really didn't understand what they were talking

08:04.440 --> 08:08.680
about. They, the physicists? They, the physicists, the physicists who came up

08:08.680 --> 08:13.440
with the math. And you can come up with math and understand how to manipulate it

08:13.440 --> 08:18.800
to get predictions, but still not look at that math and be quite sure what the

08:18.840 --> 08:24.120
physics underlying it is. And those were very good questions, and they were asked

08:24.120 --> 08:30.160
very rigorously and vociferously early on by people like Einstein, people like

08:30.160 --> 08:34.560
Schrodinger, people who were very deeply involved, even in the development of the

08:34.560 --> 08:42.440
theory. But at a certain point, another crew, led by Bohr, and to some extent

08:42.440 --> 08:48.440
Heisenberg, kind of said, well, don't ask those questions, either because for

08:48.480 --> 08:52.080
some deep philosophical reason, they're not good questions, although they sound

08:52.080 --> 08:56.720
pretty good, or eventually, this morphed into what people call shut up and

08:56.720 --> 09:00.840
calculate, where you don't even explain. You just say, don't ask those questions.

09:01.320 --> 09:05.120
I mean, my impression would have been that Bohr and Heisenberg were more like,

09:05.120 --> 09:08.320
we filled you the answer to those questions. And then when the Americans got

09:08.320 --> 09:10.160
hold of it, it was like, just don't even ask those questions.

09:10.160 --> 09:15.560
That's my take on it, was that it was, I mean, Bohr, Bohr's background was in

09:15.600 --> 09:20.600
Neoconti and philosophy. He actually said very, very, very mysterious things.

09:21.840 --> 09:26.440
And I would say early on, the idea of the Copenhagen School was, say, some

09:26.440 --> 09:29.760
incomprehensible stuff and then calculate. And then when it came to America,

09:29.760 --> 09:31.200
they cut out the first step.

09:33.560 --> 09:39.560
Good. And so, but he said sociological reasons. I mean, I can imagine why,

09:39.680 --> 09:43.520
well, don't let me imagine. What is in your opinion, the sociological reason

09:43.520 --> 09:48.840
why physicists would stop asking what is going on at the fundamental nature of reality?

09:49.440 --> 09:54.160
So, and I'm speculating here, when they first started, everybody's

09:54.160 --> 09:59.000
familiar with this picture of the atom as a kind of planetary system with a

09:59.000 --> 10:03.880
nucleus and then these electrons whizzing about it. We still kind of picture it that way.

10:05.040 --> 10:09.880
And that was sort of what was called the old quantum theory said that.

10:09.880 --> 10:14.720
And it said, by the way, these electron orbits are restricted. They can't just

10:14.720 --> 10:19.360
orbit anywhere where a planet can. They're restricted to these particular little

10:19.360 --> 10:24.000
orbits. And then all they can do is jump between them. And when they jump between

10:24.000 --> 10:28.280
them, they'll either give off or or absorb some light. And there was a bunch of

10:28.280 --> 10:32.480
explanation that you could get out of that basic picture. But if you pursue that

10:32.480 --> 10:35.640
picture, the natural question is what, but how do they jump? I mean, what, you

10:35.640 --> 10:39.000
know, how does it get from here to there? And how does it orbit when it's in one of

10:39.000 --> 10:43.560
these orbits and questions like that? And they kind of work beavered away at that

10:43.560 --> 10:49.120
and couldn't make much progress on it. And I think they eventually got to the point

10:49.120 --> 10:54.040
where they, they didn't want to say, yes, those are good questions, which we can't

10:54.040 --> 11:00.400
answer. And they were satisfied that they were calculating correctly. And in order

11:00.400 --> 11:04.800
not to say, there's really deep questions, we don't know the answer to, they

11:04.800 --> 11:08.760
said, no, no, no, we've got it. We just have the mathematical formalism. The only

11:08.800 --> 11:13.240
reason you're puzzled is that you're trying to push some classical picture on

11:13.240 --> 11:17.480
the microscopic realm and it doesn't belong there. And your confusion is

11:17.480 --> 11:23.760
arising from you having unjustified desires for comprehension.

11:25.840 --> 11:30.120
I have, I don't know if I've ever mentioned this to you, I have talked to

11:30.160 --> 11:36.880
fellow physicists and I've opined that despite everything I personally care

11:36.880 --> 11:40.840
about more than just correctly predicting the outcomes of experiments. I

11:40.840 --> 11:44.720
actually care about talking about reality. And many of them are very open and

11:44.720 --> 11:48.880
explicit that all they want to do is predict the outcomes of experiments.

11:49.360 --> 11:54.240
Yeah. And I think it would if somebody had a lot of funding and a lot of time, it

11:54.240 --> 11:58.400
would be interesting to figure out at what point these people started saying

11:58.400 --> 12:04.600
that because my experience is that young people going into physics care a lot

12:04.640 --> 12:09.480
about trying to understand and they get very upset. And I know this because I

12:09.480 --> 12:13.000
teach foundations of physics in the philosophy department and I get physics

12:13.000 --> 12:16.840
students who say, this is why I went into the field. You're talking about the

12:16.840 --> 12:23.440
stuff I was interested in. And I think in most cases, I can't imagine an 18

12:23.440 --> 12:29.280
year old saying, I just want to calculate. So I think that basic curiosity

12:30.120 --> 12:34.880
about the world gets beaten out of them. Yeah. And I really think it's part of a

12:34.880 --> 12:39.560
physics education, unfortunately, to beat it out of you. So we talked about

12:39.600 --> 12:43.600
Einstein and Boris that are but it's still more or less true, he said. I that

12:43.640 --> 12:49.080
that's my impression. I certainly can testify that lots of physics students

12:49.840 --> 12:54.080
will come to me and say, I get very frustrated. I raise questions to my

12:54.080 --> 13:00.640
physics professors of the form. What's really going on here? And I'm not told

13:00.640 --> 13:04.600
these are good questions, right? I really am told, don't ask them. Don't don't

13:04.600 --> 13:09.160
spend your time thinking about this. And slight generalization, but the

13:09.160 --> 13:13.000
philosophers to their credit have kept the flame alive. They've been thinking

13:13.000 --> 13:15.640
about these things. Yeah, yeah. It's sort of, you know, it's the same way that

13:15.640 --> 13:20.240
Aristotle kind of had to be squirreled away in the Islamic world for a while and

13:20.240 --> 13:27.600
then eventually found his way back. Yes, I do think that that really philosophy

13:27.600 --> 13:33.080
has been a refuge. And in some cases, as you know, like David Albert got his

13:33.080 --> 13:36.320
degree in theoretical physics at Rockefeller, his background was not in

13:36.320 --> 13:40.200
philosophy, but he's in a philosophy department because these questions were

13:40.200 --> 13:44.880
welcomed in philosophy departments and not welcomed in physics departments. Now,

13:45.520 --> 13:50.720
my feeling, I've got a people around us and I have some concrete reason to

13:50.720 --> 13:55.240
believe things are getting better. I actually got an email kind of out of the

13:55.240 --> 13:58.880
blue from a chair of the physics department who said, we're thinking of

13:59.120 --> 14:03.280
trying to introduce foundations of physics into our program. Can you give me

14:03.280 --> 14:08.240
advice about, you know, what we might teach and how it might be done? This was

14:08.240 --> 14:11.160
great. And this was somebody I'd never met. Just, you know,

14:11.200 --> 14:14.600
I was literally just yesterday talking to an undergraduate thinking about

14:14.640 --> 14:19.640
grad school, and she wasn't sure she likes the foundations of physics, but

14:19.640 --> 14:22.640
she's a physics undergrad, so she thought it'd be better to go to a physics

14:22.640 --> 14:27.000
department for grad school. I was asking for advice on where to go, and it was

14:27.000 --> 14:31.600
hard for me to even come up with departments who would let you do that,

14:31.600 --> 14:35.160
right? Right. But maybe it's changed. Yeah. And, you know, and at a certain time,

14:35.160 --> 14:39.560
I guess, that you could say, well, you could go here because, yes, it's a normal

14:39.560 --> 14:43.400
physics department, but at least one or two people on the weekends and a little

14:43.400 --> 14:47.640
bit hiding from their colleagues are interested in these subjects, and we'll

14:47.640 --> 14:51.320
talk to you about them if you catch them, you know, off their clock.

14:52.200 --> 14:56.000
All right. So there's our sociology, but you already opened up the doors to what

14:56.000 --> 14:59.520
we want to talk about, which is these mysteries of quantum mechanics. And

14:59.960 --> 15:04.520
David Albert was on the show. David Wallace was on the show. We were mostly

15:04.520 --> 15:08.200
talking about entropy in the era of time. Adam Becker gave us his wonderful

15:08.200 --> 15:13.360
historical introduction. But when we were talking to David Albert, mostly we

15:13.360 --> 15:17.840
criticized the Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics. I say read, we being

15:17.840 --> 15:22.160
the boy, I was defending it, but I always let the guest talk. So David gave his

15:22.200 --> 15:29.040
spiel. So what we didn't get time to get into is, OK, then what instead? So if

15:29.320 --> 15:32.800
put it, let's not talk about Everett today, unless it unless it comes up, I

15:32.800 --> 15:39.720
want to be like substantive and proactive and constructive. What do we do if

15:39.720 --> 15:42.000
we're thinking about what are the what are the mysteries we're trying to solve

15:42.000 --> 15:45.800
about quantum mechanics that got us into this trouble? And what are the avenues

15:45.800 --> 15:51.600
open to solving? Good. So that's a really good question. And there are there

15:51.600 --> 15:57.160
are several different dimensions to it. But let me start with a dimension. And I

15:57.200 --> 16:03.640
am going to briefly bring in Everett, but then let it go. Everybody knows there's

16:03.640 --> 16:07.800
this experiment. They say a thought experiment, although you could do it, it

16:07.800 --> 16:12.960
would be cool to do it. That Schrodinger talked about with this cat that

16:12.960 --> 16:18.840
penned up in a cage with a with a bit of radioactive material in a Geiger counter

16:18.840 --> 16:25.200
and this diabolical device. Actually, that turns out that Schrodinger was

16:25.240 --> 16:30.560
really just reconfiguring the same thought experiment that Einstein had

16:30.560 --> 16:35.440
written to him just before, which had to do with a keg of gunpowder that either

16:35.440 --> 16:39.560
would or would not explode in the next half hour. And you could calculate a

16:39.560 --> 16:45.160
quantum mechanical probability for it to explode and not explode. And what

16:45.160 --> 16:49.720
Schrodinger was pointing out and what what Einstein was pointing out is that

16:49.720 --> 16:57.160
you hold two views, which are very natural views you would like to hold. You

16:57.160 --> 17:02.200
got into what seemed to them to be hopeless difficulties. And the two views

17:02.200 --> 17:06.800
were first of all, when we do quantum mechanics, we describe a system with a

17:06.800 --> 17:11.560
thing called a wave function mathematically. One of the questions is,

17:11.560 --> 17:17.080
okay, that wave function, does it provide us a complete description of the

17:17.120 --> 17:22.960
system? Meaning every physical fact about that system one way or another could

17:22.960 --> 17:27.880
be extracted if you gave me the wave function. And this was when Einstein

17:27.880 --> 17:31.960
Podolsky and Rosen wrote in 1935. And this is the same year as the cat paper. And

17:31.960 --> 17:37.400
the cat paper was really a response or a reaction is better to say to the EPR

17:37.400 --> 17:41.280
paper. The title of that paper is quantum mechanical description of reality

17:41.280 --> 17:44.600
complete. This is what they were looking at. And they were arguing in that

17:44.640 --> 17:51.920
paper. No, there's more, there's more to the world than wave functions. If that

17:51.920 --> 17:56.880
were true, of course, then as a physicist, again, not as a philosopher, but as a

17:56.880 --> 18:00.200
physicist, the question is, okay, what else is there? Tell me about the other

18:00.200 --> 18:05.640
stuff. So there's one question is the wave function complete. And then there's

18:05.640 --> 18:09.360
a question about how the wave function evolves through time, what its dynamics

18:09.360 --> 18:14.480
is. And there's a Schrodinger wrote down this wonderful equation that has his

18:14.520 --> 18:20.800
name, that has some nice mathematical properties, particularly linearity. And

18:21.360 --> 18:27.400
people certainly wanted to say at least part of the dynamics is this Schrodinger

18:27.400 --> 18:32.200
evolution. And you might say, well, why not just go whole hog and say all of it

18:32.200 --> 18:36.440
is Schrodinger evolution? That's all it ever does. Okay. I like that idea. That

18:36.440 --> 18:41.760
sounds promising. Yeah. So if you put those two together and you say, A, the

18:41.880 --> 18:46.520
wave function is complete and B, it always evolves by Schrodinger evolution. Then

18:46.520 --> 18:50.440
you get into this problem that Schrodinger was pointing out and that Einstein

18:50.440 --> 18:56.280
was pointing out, which is that for the cat or for the gunpowder after an hour,

18:56.840 --> 19:01.960
the wave function doesn't tell you either yes, it has exploded or no, it is not

19:01.960 --> 19:06.480
exploded. Yes, the cat is dead or no, the cat isn't dead. The wave function goes

19:06.480 --> 19:12.040
into this, we call superposition of different states, which normally you

19:12.040 --> 19:15.600
dissociate one state with the exploded gunpowder and another with the unexploded,

19:15.600 --> 19:19.160
but what the wave function gives you is not one or the other, but a kind of

19:19.160 --> 19:22.880
combination of both. And if you say, well, that's a complete description, there

19:22.880 --> 19:28.400
isn't no further fact that's left out. Then you say, but then the cat's neither

19:28.400 --> 19:33.720
alive nor dead or the gunpowder is somehow, you know, weird, suspended state

19:33.760 --> 19:38.640
between exploded and not exploded. And, you know, Schrodinger's view of that was

19:38.640 --> 19:44.400
that that was ridiculous. And John Bell, when he writes about this, I mean, the

19:44.400 --> 19:49.480
way he sums this up is he says, either the wave function as given by the

19:49.480 --> 19:56.880
Schrodinger equation is not everything or it's not correct. And Everett, now I'm

19:56.880 --> 20:00.120
just going to say the one thing about Everett is an attempt to say no, it is

20:00.120 --> 20:02.960
both everything and correct. Hiking up with a way to make it both everything

20:02.960 --> 20:06.200
correct. Right. So I would say that's the route that leads you to the many

20:06.200 --> 20:10.280
worlds theory and you understand the motivation. It's to keep both of those

20:10.280 --> 20:16.680
nice things, but it has this price to pay in terms of saying, you know, the idea

20:16.680 --> 20:20.400
that that one cat you put into the cage and either ended up alive or dead. No,

20:20.400 --> 20:25.800
that's not right. They're now, you know, and not just two cats, actually

20:25.800 --> 20:29.400
infinitely many cats. People don't point this out that the there might be only

20:29.400 --> 20:33.360
one live cat, but they're going to be a whole lot of dead cats because the thing

20:33.360 --> 20:37.440
could have decayed at all these different times. Now, if you don't want to go

20:37.440 --> 20:41.880
that way and so we won't spend our time talking about the price you have to pay

20:41.880 --> 20:45.640
and what you have to do. I suppose let's just get our cards in the table for the

20:45.640 --> 20:50.920
audience purposes. You're not a fan. I'm not, but it's a serious attempt. I mean,

20:50.920 --> 20:55.240
you have to be very clear here. There are things I'm not a fan of, but I

20:55.280 --> 21:01.320
appreciate the honesty of people who are fans. If they see the what they have to

21:01.320 --> 21:05.800
confront and they, you know, straightforwardly say, yes, I by making

21:05.800 --> 21:09.680
these commitments, I inherit these problems and I'm going to work on those,

21:09.680 --> 21:16.360
right? And nobody should just turn their back in my view on a serious proposal. I

21:16.360 --> 21:19.720
take it to be a serious proposal. I think there are other proposals out there,

21:19.720 --> 21:23.880
which I will not name right now, which I do not think are serious. I don't think

21:23.880 --> 21:28.920
that they have any chance. I would not put many worlds in that basket.

21:28.920 --> 21:34.440
Gotcha. Okay. But if we take off the table, having the wave function be both

21:34.440 --> 21:40.360
complete and always schrodinger, then your options are, all right, if it's not

21:40.360 --> 21:45.240
complete, then there's something else in the world beside the wave function. And

21:45.240 --> 21:50.200
then immediately you ask, okay, what is it? And what does it do? And why am I

21:50.200 --> 21:53.960
talking about wave functions anyway? And things like that. Those are the natural

21:53.960 --> 22:00.280
questions you ought to have answers at your fingertips. Or if you say, well, I

22:00.280 --> 22:04.360
think something went wrong with the schrodinger evolution, then you can say,

22:04.360 --> 22:08.280
well, I think the wave function doesn't always evolve in this way. It does this

22:08.280 --> 22:13.800
other thing that people call collapsing, right, or reducing that looks very, very,

22:13.800 --> 22:18.840
very unschrodinger like. This was the way that when John von Neumann wrote down

22:18.840 --> 22:24.120
his understanding of the mathematical foundations of the theory had two processes

22:24.120 --> 22:29.240
for the wave function, the schrodinger process and a collapse process. And that's

22:29.240 --> 22:34.200
also kind of okay at a very high level. But as soon as you say that, you also now

22:34.200 --> 22:39.480
inherit an obligation to tell me, all right, well, when and how does it deviate

22:40.280 --> 22:45.080
from schrodinger evolution? And there are lots of details that can be put in in

22:45.080 --> 22:52.920
different ways and different suggestions. Some people think early on that the

22:52.920 --> 22:58.120
collapses had to be triggered by something. So things would go nice schrodinger wise

22:58.120 --> 23:03.320
until X. What's the X? Oh, until a measurement is made or till an observation is made.

23:03.320 --> 23:07.480
And then that, of course, astonished. This is something Einstein was very upset about.

23:08.840 --> 23:12.440
Other people are upset about because they say, look, it's what do you mean an

23:12.440 --> 23:18.760
observation? I mean, who can do the observing? Can a mouse observe? Can an amoeba observe?

23:18.760 --> 23:23.320
Can they trigger a collapse of the wave function? If you go that direction in a certain way,

23:23.320 --> 23:26.920
you end up with Wigner who says, oh, we have to talk about consciousness and now you're in the

23:26.920 --> 23:34.040
mind body problem and you're in a mess. Other people have said, well, no, there's a kind of

23:34.040 --> 23:38.920
trigger or something that affects collapse, but it's not measurement or observation.

23:38.920 --> 23:44.920
It's like, say, gravity. I mean, this is something that Roger Penrose has been advocating

23:44.920 --> 23:51.000
for a long time, not with as much precision as a theory as some other things, but that somehow

23:51.000 --> 23:57.640
gravity, which is the one thing that is not well understood quantum mechanically, may come in here

23:57.640 --> 24:04.920
as triggering this non schrodinger evolution. And then there's another idea, which is that,

24:04.920 --> 24:10.520
no, it collapses and nothing triggers it. It just happens. It happens randomly from time to time

24:10.520 --> 24:15.800
at a certain rate in a certain way. This is called the spontaneous collapse theories.

24:16.360 --> 24:20.360
And there's a famous theory by a Gerardi-Rominian Weber, the GRW theory,

24:20.920 --> 24:24.600
and they just put numbers to it. I mean, this was the great thing they did. They didn't just

24:24.600 --> 24:29.640
wave their hands. They said, okay, yeah, it collapses every now and then. How often? Well,

24:29.640 --> 24:37.240
once every 10 to the 15 seconds per particle, and how does it collapse? Well, you multiply

24:37.240 --> 24:45.080
by a Gaussian of this width and put some math to it. This is what John Bell was so impressed by.

24:45.080 --> 24:49.480
I know when I talked to him about that theory, was that, okay, for many years,

24:49.480 --> 24:55.960
people have had this kind of general thought, but they took the step of turning it into clean

24:56.040 --> 25:00.760
mathematics. Yeah. And also clean mathematics, but a real theory, physically, right? Yeah. Not

25:00.760 --> 25:05.880
just an idea, not just a general suggestion. That's right. And it can be, in fact, experimentally

25:05.880 --> 25:11.800
tested. Yes, it does. It makes, because the wave function evolution is different, and because

25:11.800 --> 25:17.880
the predictions really depend on what the wave function does, it will make, it's easy to see,

25:17.880 --> 25:22.840
in principle, it makes different predictions. It's harder to come up with the experimental

25:22.840 --> 25:27.640
situations where you can see those differences, although people have been working at it for

25:27.640 --> 25:32.760
some decades and making progress. The progress is mostly ruling out the theory. I mean, so far,

25:32.760 --> 25:36.920
we have not seen a signature that the theory is correct, okay? We haven't ruled it out,

25:36.920 --> 25:40.760
but you could have ruled it in. If you'd seen certain things, you could have really ruled

25:40.760 --> 25:46.360
it in. It has not been ruled in. And ruling it in, these spontaneous collapse theories would count

25:46.360 --> 25:51.960
as falsifying these other theories. That's right. If that were to happen, then the other

25:51.960 --> 25:56.280
things on the table that we might talk about, including Everett, would, you know,

25:56.280 --> 25:59.960
a lot of the motivation for Everett would go away, because one of the motivations is,

25:59.960 --> 26:05.320
but gee, this Schrodinger evolution is so nice, right? So that is a motivation. I guess to a

26:05.320 --> 26:12.920
physicist, there's a sort of, I don't want to say intuitive, but emotional objection to these

26:12.920 --> 26:17.960
spontaneous collapse theories, like it just looks so ad hoc that the wave function just does this.

26:17.960 --> 26:24.840
And I guess you could say, yeah, but we're fitting the data. Yeah. And ad hoc, it's not that I don't

26:24.840 --> 26:32.120
have some sympathy, but when you realize how difficult these questions are and the weird extremes

26:32.120 --> 26:38.280
that people have gone to say, oh, but I don't like this one because it's ad hoc, that is such weak

26:38.360 --> 26:47.240
key, right? I mean, get over it. The physical world might look a little more ad hoc than you

26:47.240 --> 26:51.960
prefer. You really shouldn't rule things out in a strong way for that reason.

26:51.960 --> 26:56.920
I guess maybe following what you said about Einstein and EPR, the one thing that you can

26:56.920 --> 27:01.160
say about quantum mechanics is that someone's going to have to give up on something that they

27:01.160 --> 27:13.400
really want to be true. Yes, I think that's correct. I'm not sure. I would say, and now I'm

27:13.400 --> 27:19.080
going to tip the hand, which you'd understand already, if you already know I'm not that sympathetic

27:19.080 --> 27:24.920
to the many worlds because of the problems I see there. And I also have this feeling that I can only

27:24.920 --> 27:29.240
say by saying the collapses don't smell right to me, right? I don't want to put too much weight on

27:29.320 --> 27:33.800
that. But that's just the way I feel. I mean, when you're in this, you kind of make a judgment

27:33.800 --> 27:38.440
about what looks more plausible to you. Then we have the last possibility where, okay, yeah,

27:38.440 --> 27:43.080
there are no collapses. I agree. I like the Schrodinger evolution. It looks, it's clean. It's

27:43.080 --> 27:49.960
pretty. It's linear. I want to keep that, but I want my cats to just, one cat goes in and one cat

27:49.960 --> 27:56.680
comes out. That means I have to have something in addition to the wave function. And now the

27:56.680 --> 28:02.760
question is what? And the amazing thing, and I think anybody, whatever you think about the theory

28:02.760 --> 28:08.520
is at least just for the non-relativistic theory, there's some complications further on. For the

28:08.520 --> 28:14.600
non-relativistic theory, this thought occurred immediately in 1926 already by Louis de Broglie.

28:15.320 --> 28:18.680
And you say, what is this magical thing you're going to add to your physics? Answer

28:18.680 --> 28:24.760
particles, point particles. Just the sort of thing you were already familiar with, the sort of thing

28:25.720 --> 28:30.760
even democratists, well, his were a little thick, right? They had their shapes. These can be point

28:30.760 --> 28:35.800
particles. So they're even slimmed down and more minimalistic than democratian particles.

28:35.800 --> 28:40.920
But the idea, okay, there are some particles and they move around and they constitute cats and tables

28:40.920 --> 28:45.000
and chairs. And if you want to know whether your cats alive or dead, tell me where it's,

28:45.000 --> 28:50.120
what its particles are doing, and I'll give you a good idea, right? You might say that's such a

28:50.120 --> 28:56.840
simple idea. It couldn't possibly be the case that you just add some particles and write down a

28:56.840 --> 29:03.080
pretty simple looking equation for how they move and everything comes out right. But amazingly,

29:03.080 --> 29:09.560
in the non-relativistic theory, it does. I don't really see that as giving up on anything. I mean,

29:09.560 --> 29:14.600
because what you have to give up on is the completeness of the wave function, but it's not

29:14.600 --> 29:20.280
clear what the motivation for believing that ever was, except Bohr and so on saying, look,

29:20.280 --> 29:26.360
we know what to do with the wave function. If it's complete, then we're done. And we want to be done.

29:26.360 --> 29:31.720
So don't tell us there's something else, right? So in other words, the basic idea is when we

29:31.720 --> 29:38.120
invented quantum mechanics, we started saying, oh, electrons are like waves, right? They have

29:38.120 --> 29:43.400
interference patterns under the right circumstances. They spread out in the atom. They are also like

29:43.400 --> 29:48.600
particles in certain ways. We measure little dots on screens. And the brilliant breakthrough

29:48.600 --> 29:55.160
from De Broglie is that's because they're both at the same time. Yeah. Or to put it as Bell,

29:55.160 --> 30:00.520
again, I'm always quoting John Bell, he says, people were breaking their heads all the time,

30:00.520 --> 30:05.000
wave or particle, wave or particle, you'd hear wave a coal, right? It's a new concept you don't

30:05.000 --> 30:10.200
have. And he said, why didn't it occur to them the simple answer, wave and particle? There is a

30:10.200 --> 30:17.080
wave that is a thing that obeys a wave equation, which is why you get interference. That's the

30:17.080 --> 30:21.960
wave function or the quantum state, the thing described by the wave function. And in addition,

30:21.960 --> 30:27.000
there is a particle which always has a location. So if you ask, but why do these little individual

30:27.000 --> 30:33.480
spots form on my screen? It's because that's where the particle hit. No reason why you can't

30:33.480 --> 30:37.960
explain the wave like behavior because there is a wave and the particle like behavior because

30:38.040 --> 30:44.120
there is a particle and that and their dynamics is coupled in a way that the particles are guided

30:44.680 --> 30:49.400
by a wave like thing. And so the interference in the wave will affect where the particles go.

30:49.400 --> 30:56.040
So this table in front of us is in some legitimate sense made of particles. Yep. And the positions

30:56.040 --> 31:01.240
of those particles are among other things being guided by the wave functions. Yes. Are they

31:02.120 --> 31:06.280
separately interacting with each other, the particles? Well, of course, the word interaction

31:06.280 --> 31:12.760
here is one of those words that different physical theories will give you different

31:12.760 --> 31:19.880
accounts of what even counts as an interaction. Certainly, the particles can be in a situation

31:19.880 --> 31:26.200
where what happens to one will make a difference to what happens to others, right? So the theory

31:26.200 --> 31:33.560
will just tell you, gee, you turn on a magnetic field over here and now this particle gets deflected

31:33.560 --> 31:40.520
down. And by the way, that particle, you know, will get deflected up. I mean, the example I

31:40.520 --> 31:45.960
just gave you is a little bit misleading. But now, is that an interaction between the particles?

31:45.960 --> 31:50.520
Well, it's certainly mediated by the wave function, right? The particles can't do anything to each

31:50.520 --> 31:56.440
other. But in a way, already you have that in Newton, you say, well, how does one particle

31:56.440 --> 32:01.800
affect another gravitationally? Well, not sort of directly, but you need a gravitational field

32:01.880 --> 32:05.080
or something like that. There's a mediator, there's a physical mediator

32:05.640 --> 32:14.280
that accounts for these relations between what they do. Is that interaction? It is,

32:14.280 --> 32:21.640
but it's not quite like classical Newtonian interaction. One way to talk about this, people

32:21.640 --> 32:27.800
get a little bit, maybe this will help or maybe not. But let me say it briefly. If you've studied

32:27.880 --> 32:32.920
any physics, if you did any Newtonian physics, you'll remember that the fundamental equation

32:32.920 --> 32:40.760
is f equals ma, where a is the acceleration. And the acceleration is the change in the velocity and

32:40.760 --> 32:46.200
the velocity is already the change in the position. So it's a second time derivative. And what that

32:46.200 --> 32:51.960
means for Newton is that to give you the initial conditions of a system, I both have to tell you

32:51.960 --> 32:57.240
where everything is and what its momentum is, right? So I need both position and momentum.

32:57.240 --> 33:02.440
And then the fundamental kind of physical interaction through f equals ma is changing the

33:02.440 --> 33:10.280
momentum. But in this theory, it's not like that. It's a first order theory. Everything

33:10.280 --> 33:16.280
is just done with one time derivative. So the initial condition only has to be the positions.

33:17.000 --> 33:22.200
And then what the wave function does is guide the particles. It doesn't push them around

33:23.160 --> 33:29.640
by producing Newtonian forces on them. It guides them as it were determines where they go.

33:30.520 --> 33:37.480
More in the way, this is a kind of analogy that David Bohm used to use, as if you were piloting

33:37.480 --> 33:44.280
by radio control a little boat out on the lake. And you say, yeah, as you turn the dial,

33:45.800 --> 33:49.640
as it were sending information or telling the boat where to go, but you're not pushing the boat

33:49.640 --> 33:55.880
around, right? And in fact, if the boat goes twice as far away, so your radio signal is half

33:55.880 --> 33:59.880
as strong, still, as long as it's getting the signal, it's going to guide it the same way,

33:59.880 --> 34:04.200
right? Whereas a Newtonian force, you'd sort of think, well, the further away you get,

34:04.200 --> 34:10.840
the weaker the force has to become. So it's a different fundamental picture of physical interaction.

34:11.400 --> 34:18.520
And I think many physicists object to it or have this intuitive emotional response to it because

34:19.080 --> 34:23.880
the wave function is guiding the particles, but the particles don't influence the wave function

34:23.880 --> 34:28.520
at all, right? Maybe part of that negative feeling is that they're still thinking of

34:28.520 --> 34:33.000
the wave function as a Newtonian force field. They might be thinking that this is an objection

34:33.000 --> 34:39.880
people have raised quite explicitly that this theory violates they call the generalized Newton's

34:39.880 --> 34:45.560
third law of action and reaction, right? So they say, oh, well, in general, I think if A

34:45.560 --> 34:51.240
has an influence on B, B should have a back influence or a reciprocal influence back on A.

34:51.240 --> 34:58.040
And that, I have to say, strikes me as just silly. I mean, in a certain way, if you say to Newton,

34:58.040 --> 35:02.600
look, doesn't the law of gravity somehow affect what particles do? He'd say, yeah, yeah, yeah,

35:02.600 --> 35:06.360
and say, but what are the particles? Do they affect the law of gravity? He'd say, no, of course not,

35:06.360 --> 35:11.800
right? The law of gravity doesn't change because of what the particles do, what the way the particles

35:11.800 --> 35:19.160
behave is accounted for, as it were, by the law. So we don't usually think that if A affects B,

35:19.160 --> 35:25.320
B has to have a reciprocal back effect on A. Lots of cases where even in physics,

35:25.320 --> 35:29.480
we wouldn't say that at all. So this seems to me to be a bit special pleading of trying to

35:29.480 --> 35:33.000
find something to complain about. I mean, certainly, it sounds like a very made up

35:33.000 --> 35:38.360
metaphysical principle that they just made up. Okay, you mentioned David Bohm. Tell us his role

35:38.360 --> 35:43.080
in this story. So it's an interesting, I mean, the history of this is very interesting because,

35:43.080 --> 35:49.320
again, people were very concerned. There was the early quantum theory by Bohr, which had this very

35:49.320 --> 35:55.480
classical looking idea of this planetary atom, and then these jumping kind of jumps, which were

35:55.480 --> 36:00.760
unusual, and they didn't quite understand. And then the new quantum theory was developed in the

36:00.760 --> 36:07.560
20s, mid 20s, and the mathematics of it came out first matrix mechanics by Heisenberg,

36:07.560 --> 36:11.400
and then wave mechanics by Schrodinger. I'm just throwing some names out, but people have heard

36:11.400 --> 36:16.360
these names. But they had the math in a way, they kind of knew how to manipulate the math to make

36:16.360 --> 36:23.560
some predictions. But it wasn't at all clear what the physical picture was, right? What's the physical

36:23.560 --> 36:29.640
theory here? And de Broglie early on looks at this and says, well, I can just, I can just put these

36:29.640 --> 36:34.440
particles in these point particles and have them guided around by this quite simple equation,

36:35.000 --> 36:39.240
you need a second equation because we needed an equation to tell us what the wave function does,

36:39.240 --> 36:43.640
and we're just going to keep Schrodinger's equation for that. So we got that. No real dispute about

36:43.640 --> 36:47.960
that. Then we need a second one, which tells me what the particles do, and that's going to be a

36:47.960 --> 36:55.560
thing called the guidance equation. And just from mathematical simplicity and other very basic

36:55.560 --> 37:03.000
physical considerations, I think I've seen claim 10 different ways that would lead you in the

37:03.080 --> 37:09.560
non-relativistic theory to a very simple obvious equation, guidance equation for this. So lots

37:09.560 --> 37:16.600
of ways to motivate it, you know, intuitively. And so de Broglie discovers this and he presents it,

37:16.600 --> 37:23.880
he was very young at the time, and some rather bad objections were made to the theory, but de Broglie

37:23.880 --> 37:29.080
on his feet couldn't answer them. And the story seems to be that he was just a bit traumatized

37:29.080 --> 37:32.520
by the whole thing, because these were the big shots of physics. I mean, he's a young guy,

37:32.520 --> 37:37.000
he's at the Solvay conference with the biggest names, Einstein is there, Boris there, and so on.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.760
And, you know, they're Pauli, whoever they're beating up on him, and he just kind of

37:41.400 --> 37:47.960
seems to have abandoned the theory a bit. As far as I can tell, and I've heard people tell me this

37:47.960 --> 37:53.960
more recently who looked into it, it kind of lays fallow. Now, Einstein, who we know didn't like

37:54.760 --> 38:00.520
the Copenhagen understanding of quantum theory, we know played around with this theory or very

38:00.520 --> 38:06.200
similar theories in the intervening years. He didn't like it, but he didn't like it because it had

38:06.200 --> 38:12.040
what he called in a very manifest, easy to see way, spooky action at a distance, this non-locality.

38:12.040 --> 38:17.080
So we know why he didn't like the theory. And he could never come up with a satisfactory version

38:17.080 --> 38:22.920
to him. But it's very possible that he came up with the version that other people think is

38:22.920 --> 38:27.880
satisfactory. Exactly. He could have very well had it. And it sort of stayed that way. And then

38:27.880 --> 38:33.240
the really interesting situation, if we get into this, is David Bohm is now a young physicist,

38:34.520 --> 38:40.440
very well regarded at Princeton. He writes a book explaining quantum theory from the kind of

38:40.440 --> 38:47.480
Copenhagen-Borian point of view. And he's in Princeton, Einstein's over at the Institute

38:47.480 --> 38:53.880
for Advanced Study. And he's kind of saying, gosh, I would like to get my nerve to go ask

38:53.880 --> 38:58.440
Einstein what he thinks of my book. And he's actually trying to get other people to approach

38:58.440 --> 39:03.000
Einstein. And as this is going on, he gets a message from Einstein. And Einstein says,

39:03.000 --> 39:08.920
I read your book. Would you like to come talk about it? And the story is he goes to talk to

39:08.920 --> 39:17.080
Einstein. So it's like 1950, 51. Yeah, 51, I think. Einstein has read the book. And Einstein says,

39:17.080 --> 39:22.920
I think this is the best, the clearest exposition of the Copenhagen approach that I've ever seen.

39:22.920 --> 39:29.960
I mean, he was really trying hard. But Einstein raised some objections. And the story is, and I

39:29.960 --> 39:35.080
think it was a young man who tells this story, it was Bohm's roommate at the time that Bohm goes,

39:35.080 --> 39:39.400
meets Einstein, comes back, and he reports when he comes back, I'm back to square one.

39:40.280 --> 39:44.600
He was convinced by Einstein's objections. He just, he couldn't answer Einstein's objections.

39:44.600 --> 39:49.800
He realized that he really didn't understand what he himself had written. And within a year,

39:49.880 --> 39:53.800
he discovers this other thing, which was the same thing that Boyd had done. And apparently

39:53.800 --> 39:57.720
independently, as far as I can tell, I mean, I was told recently, I haven't done the research

39:57.720 --> 40:02.520
myself. But again, it's not hard to find that theory if you're looking in a certain direction.

40:03.320 --> 40:08.280
And then he publishes these papers, this two part paper in 1952,

40:10.040 --> 40:13.960
a theory that introduces so-called hidden variables into quantum mechanics and gives

40:13.960 --> 40:19.640
you all the right predictions. And this was something that people had believed had been proven

40:19.640 --> 40:26.440
mathematically impossible by John von Neumann when von Neumann wrote his book. So this is,

40:26.440 --> 40:31.000
of course, a shock. It's like, you're not supposed to be able to do that. And then

40:31.000 --> 40:35.960
you look at the paper and you say, wait, it does look like you can do that. And we now understand

40:36.680 --> 40:40.840
that von Neumann had made not a mathematical mistake, but a kind of conceptual mistake,

40:40.840 --> 40:46.040
which was caught at the time by Greta Hermann. Greta Hermann, yeah.

40:46.040 --> 40:49.480
And people pointed it out, but who's listening to Greta Hermann?

40:50.120 --> 40:52.600
When Bohr and Heisenberg are saying the opposite.

40:52.600 --> 41:01.320
So in 1952, the theory sort of gets reborn under Bohm's name and Bohm worked on expanding it to

41:01.320 --> 41:05.000
cover spin and some other, I mean, it's a kind of very basic theory at the beginning. And then

41:05.000 --> 41:08.680
you start adding bells and whistles to cover more and more phenomena.

41:09.480 --> 41:14.120
And it might still have disappeared, but John Bell became a fan of it, right?

41:14.120 --> 41:21.080
Well, Bell, it's not that Bell started out as a fan of it. Bell was a fan of this.

41:21.080 --> 41:26.840
He was a fan of saying, I understand what this theory is claiming, right? There's no mystery

41:26.840 --> 41:31.400
about it. There are these particles. There's this wave function. Here's what the wave function

41:31.400 --> 41:36.040
does. Here's what the particles do, okay? This is a picture of the world, like it or lump it.

41:36.680 --> 41:41.240
When I first learned about this theory, and I was very skeptical about it from Shelly Goldstein,

41:41.240 --> 41:45.480
Shelly helped me a lot at one point in our discussions because I was being very obstreperous.

41:45.480 --> 41:49.960
And he said, look, surely you'll admit this is a theory of something.

41:52.120 --> 41:56.360
Okay. It says there are these particles. There's this other thing. Here's what they do.

41:56.360 --> 42:02.360
Now, just in your mind, imagine a world as this theory describes. Wouldn't it be interesting if

42:02.360 --> 42:07.800
that world looked very much like the world we live in? Which turns out to be true.

42:08.360 --> 42:13.160
This is always good advice when people have trouble thinking about new theories because

42:13.160 --> 42:17.400
they always want to fit it into their own boxes, right? And if you just ask what it would be like

42:17.400 --> 42:25.400
if it were true, you'd make progress. And it addressed the problem that Einstein had raised

42:25.400 --> 42:32.200
about locality by saying, yeah. Yes. So this is what I was going to say. And Bell tells a wonderful

42:32.200 --> 42:36.840
story, right? Bell says when he first learned quantum mechanics, he was very puzzled by it.

42:36.840 --> 42:44.760
He didn't understand what was going on. And he thought you need to add something to it. You

42:44.760 --> 42:49.800
need these additional variables, the way functions, not the whole story. And he said he was told by

42:49.800 --> 42:55.720
his physics professors, no, no, no. Von Neumann has proven it can't be done. Mathematically proven,

42:55.720 --> 43:01.080
you can't add any additional variables and keep the same predictions. And Bell says at the time,

43:01.080 --> 43:05.400
he didn't know any German and the book had not been translated. And so that's where it sat.

43:06.360 --> 43:11.240
He just didn't know why he didn't understand. He couldn't read Von Neumann's proof, but he was

43:11.240 --> 43:18.040
told there was a proof. And then Bell says he just gets up in 1952 and reads this paper that's been

43:18.040 --> 43:24.520
published and says, wait, Bohm has just done what everybody's telling me Von Neumann proved

43:24.520 --> 43:31.720
couldn't be done. Something's gone wrong here. He quickly convinces himself that the mistake

43:31.720 --> 43:38.520
in that case was on Von Neumann's side. But he sees that the theory has this manifest nonlocality.

43:39.080 --> 43:45.160
And he asks himself surely what Einstein must have been asking himself, can you get rid of it?

43:45.160 --> 43:52.840
Can I have a kind of theory like this? But without the nonlocality in it, that still makes the right

43:52.840 --> 44:00.440
predictions, the quantum mechanical predictions, that's the very precise thought that Bell had.

44:00.440 --> 44:04.040
And when he finally got some time off on sabbatical to sit down.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.640
Because he couldn't do it during his regular work.

44:07.320 --> 44:11.880
But the amazing thing is, of course, when you see Bell's proof, it's a few lines of algebra.

44:11.880 --> 44:17.160
It's not like proving Fermat's last theorem. It's not hard mathematically.

44:18.280 --> 44:23.640
When I first read about this stuff, which was in the Scientific American in an article by Bernard

44:23.640 --> 44:31.080
d'Espagnia back in 79, I guess, it's not looking back on it. It's not the greatest article in the

44:31.080 --> 44:36.360
world. But it was enough was there that just with a little math, you could see, wait, wait,

44:36.360 --> 44:44.680
I see the problem. I really, this just stands out at you. So what happens with Bell is Bell,

44:44.680 --> 44:49.960
what Bell realizes is, wait a minute. No, you can't get rid of the nonlocality out of this

44:49.960 --> 44:54.920
theory. You can't get rid of the nonlocality out of any theory. I mean, throw away quantum

44:54.920 --> 45:01.000
mechanics and start from scratch from entirely different principles. Bell's proof is not about

45:01.000 --> 45:06.840
quantum mechanics. It's just about certain experiments and the correlations that you see

45:06.840 --> 45:13.880
in the outcomes. You can't have a theory that is local in a well-defined sense that won't predict

45:13.880 --> 45:19.400
that. Quantum mechanics does predict it. And more importantly than quantum mechanics predicting it,

45:20.280 --> 45:27.480
the world does it. That's why the Nobel Prize went to Clouser and Aspe and Zeilander recently

45:27.480 --> 45:32.600
for doing the experiments that showed that the violation of Bell's inequality actually occurs.

45:32.600 --> 45:37.800
And as you and I both complained about in separate occasions, the Nobel committee blew it in their

45:37.800 --> 45:43.720
press release. Yes, they did. They said that what they had done was what proved that von Neumann

45:43.720 --> 45:49.000
was right and you can't have hidden variables, which is just the irony there is so delicious.

45:50.040 --> 45:56.680
Because Bell then became probably the strongest advocate of this

45:57.880 --> 46:01.560
Bohm's theory or De Broglie's theory, which is a theory with additional variables.

46:02.360 --> 46:06.920
Why? Because he could say, well, what's the objection? You can't object as Einstein did. I don't

46:06.920 --> 46:11.400
like it because it's not local because now I understand, okay, the nonlocality is just in the

46:11.400 --> 46:17.240
world. Suck it up. And it's a clear theory and so on. I mean, at one point, Bell says he's going

46:17.240 --> 46:21.160
through all these different ways of approaching quantum mechanics and he says, well, the pilot

46:21.160 --> 46:28.280
wave approach shows the best craftsmanship. But then he says, but is that he says then wonderfully,

46:28.280 --> 46:33.320
I mean, he always made these cutting little remarks, is that is that a virtue in our time?

46:34.120 --> 46:38.520
Right? Do people appreciate good craftsmanship anymore? Do they like just things that sound

46:39.480 --> 46:46.040
amazing and blow your mind? Because at some level, it's a much more pedestrian kind of theory.

46:46.040 --> 46:49.800
You say, yeah, there's some particles, they move around. Yeah, there's this wave function. That's

46:49.800 --> 46:54.120
kind of funny thing. But I'll explain how it plays into the architecture here.

46:54.120 --> 46:57.880
It was a rough time for the philosophy of quantum mechanics in certain ways.

46:58.440 --> 47:04.200
But okay, so I think that there are any physicists out there who are not

47:04.200 --> 47:09.400
into the foundations of quantum mechanics and they're listening. They're very confused because

47:09.400 --> 47:13.720
one uses the word locality in different senses sometimes. I mean, if you asked a quantum field

47:13.720 --> 47:18.600
theorist, is their field theory local? They would say, yes, it's very, very local. So what exactly

47:18.600 --> 47:24.600
do you mean by this word? Good. So and there's even a technical mathematical condition that's

47:24.600 --> 47:30.920
imposed in quantum field theory that they will call locality has to do with commuting operators.

47:31.560 --> 47:39.960
Okay, so what's going on? Well, one thing to say is that there is there's bell prove there has to

47:39.960 --> 47:47.720
be some kind of influence or effect. If Alice and Bob if I set up a pair of particles in a special

47:47.720 --> 47:51.720
state called an entangled state and anybody who's heard about this at least have heard the word

47:51.720 --> 47:56.440
entangled, but send the particles off way in different directions. So they're, you know,

47:56.440 --> 48:00.520
hundreds of light years apart, one into Alice's lab and one into Bob's lab.

48:02.360 --> 48:07.800
The intuition of causal locality basically says nothing that Alice does

48:08.520 --> 48:16.040
can have any actual influence or effect on what Bob sees. Right? That doesn't mean there can't be

48:16.040 --> 48:21.000
correlations between what they see. I mean, everybody knows people give this example, you

48:21.000 --> 48:25.480
tear a dollar bill in half and send it to sides off in different directions. Of course,

48:25.480 --> 48:30.120
Alice seeing one half immediately informs you that Bob will see the other half,

48:30.120 --> 48:36.360
but that's not Alice doing anything that affects Bob at all. That's just true. Everybody understood

48:36.360 --> 48:40.680
that. Everybody understands there could be correlations like that, but those correlations

48:40.680 --> 48:46.200
are already explained by what happened at the source. And so nothing non local is going on in

48:46.200 --> 48:51.880
that case. Bell showed no, you can't get the kinds of correlations you see in quantum mechanics by

48:51.880 --> 48:59.160
that kind of local story. There has to be a sense in which what Alice does actually makes a difference

48:59.160 --> 49:06.200
to what Bob sees or the other way around. That's causal non locality. Now the next question that

49:06.280 --> 49:14.920
arises is, oh, could you implement that in some way to allow Alice to send a message to Bob,

49:14.920 --> 49:20.600
signal Bob, right? Tell Bob whether they're going to meet for lunch today or not. And the really

49:20.600 --> 49:25.720
interesting, I mean, a very interesting thing is that at least under certain pretty clear

49:25.720 --> 49:30.760
idealizations, you can kind of look at the way quantum mechanics work and say, well, no,

49:30.760 --> 49:35.960
actually, even though you can't get rid of this connection, you also can't use it to signal.

49:36.040 --> 49:41.240
And the person who proved that first was also Bell. People like to call it the no bell telephone

49:41.240 --> 49:46.040
theorem. So he was perfectly aware of it, right? You can't use the non locality to signal.

49:47.560 --> 49:54.120
Sorry, that's a feature in Copenhagen, Everett, Bohm, whatever you want. You can never use it.

49:54.120 --> 50:00.440
Well, okay, now I'm going to tread off into treacherous territory.

50:01.160 --> 50:09.640
Okay. If you say, and I think it's just a bad thing to say, that the fundamental postulate

50:09.640 --> 50:15.480
of, say, relativity has to do with signaling, that you can't signal faster than light. And you

50:15.480 --> 50:20.520
say, oh, well, then this is still a local theory. But that just, I think, first of all, signaling

50:20.520 --> 50:24.920
isn't even the right kind of concept that should be in the foundations of any theory, just as

50:24.920 --> 50:30.120
measurement shouldn't and just as observation shouldn't. And, you know, Bell proved there is

50:30.120 --> 50:37.000
this kind of non local causation. And maybe I can't use it to signal, but so what? But then

50:37.000 --> 50:43.560
the next thought is, gosh, if there really is this real physical, non local connection somehow,

50:44.280 --> 50:49.560
why can't I use it to signal? And you'd sort of offhand think there must be some clever way to

50:49.560 --> 50:56.840
do it. Now I'm going to report something. To ask that question, of course, you really need a well

50:56.840 --> 51:02.920
defined theory on the table in front of you, right? Because you have to ask, well, what can I do with

51:02.920 --> 51:10.280
this physics? Quantum mechanics tends to use these things called Hermitian operators or,

51:10.280 --> 51:15.880
or as they call them observables, and they sort of you, the mathematics of that is what they look

51:15.880 --> 51:20.120
into to ask certain questions. But if you have an actual theory in front of you, you're not restricted

51:20.120 --> 51:23.960
in that way, you know, you can just say, well, can I do something? Can I twiddle this and, you

51:23.960 --> 51:32.520
know, see something? It looks like in the Bohmian theory with spin, there are reasons to believe

51:32.520 --> 51:38.280
you could signal faster than light. Oh, this could be the most popular podcast ever.

51:38.280 --> 51:45.400
You weren't expecting that, were you? I was not. It is, it is, I am, personally, I suspected there

51:45.400 --> 51:54.200
should be a way. Sid Hunt Das, who's a young researcher, has been looking at something which

51:54.200 --> 52:01.000
amazingly people had not looked carefully at, which is in this pilot wave theory, when you add spin,

52:01.720 --> 52:06.600
okay, that's an additional physical degree of freedom, people usually just don't fiddle with it.

52:06.600 --> 52:10.920
They kind of deal with spinless particles, you know, at this level to understand things. When

52:10.920 --> 52:18.440
you add spin, and when you look at, there's a very specific thing you can look at that standard

52:18.440 --> 52:25.240
quantum mechanics doesn't have an obvious way to even treat, right? This is the key to understanding

52:25.240 --> 52:35.000
this. That is arrival times. So if I, if I... This is a well-known issue. Yes, it is a well-known

52:35.000 --> 52:39.720
issue, although people just kind of put it out of their mind. So if I have an electron as it were

52:39.800 --> 52:45.160
confined in a little box, which we kind of know how to do, and at some moment I open the box,

52:45.160 --> 52:50.440
and then I've got a screen, and at some time a flash appears on the screen, one thing you can

52:50.440 --> 52:54.600
ask is, well, what was the, what was the transit time? How long, what was the time gap between when

52:54.600 --> 53:00.440
I opened the box and when the flash occurred? And it turns out, if you ask quantum mechanically,

53:00.440 --> 53:04.280
and in quantum mechanics, you of course have to do experiments many, many times, and you get kind of

53:04.280 --> 53:11.560
statistical results, you get a distribution of results. It's, nobody agrees how even to make

53:11.560 --> 53:16.280
that prediction using standard quantum mechanics, because there is no Hermitian operator that

53:16.280 --> 53:23.080
corresponds to arrival times. Okay? In the, in this pilot wave picture, because you have these

53:23.080 --> 53:28.120
particles and they just move, it's kind of easy at least to ask the question, according to the

53:28.120 --> 53:33.080
theory, how long did it, would it take a particle here to get there? So you can actually do these

53:33.080 --> 53:38.360
calculations. And when you do them with spin, you start to see that there's a spin dependence

53:39.000 --> 53:47.000
of the arrival times, which you really weren't expecting, but it shows up. And if that's right,

53:47.000 --> 53:50.360
it's already a question of whether you'll see that. This is something you could check in the

53:50.360 --> 53:54.520
lab. We're trying to find people who'll do it, but you need specialized equipment and you need the

53:54.520 --> 54:00.280
motivation to do it. If, if there is that spin dependence of the arrival times, then there's a

54:00.360 --> 54:05.560
very quick argument. Oh, you could signal. Now the signaling would be very subtle. I mean,

54:05.560 --> 54:10.360
it's not like you could flip a switch and a light would go on there. But it would essentially say,

54:10.360 --> 54:17.480
if Alice orients a magnet in her lab in a certain way, Bob will suddenly start seeing

54:17.480 --> 54:22.360
a slightly different distribution of arrival times than if it's oriented another way.

54:23.320 --> 54:27.720
And that would be any kind of information, right? It doesn't have to be a clean,

54:27.720 --> 54:34.840
100% strong signal, any signal, right? Any Shannon information. Sure. And this suggests

54:34.840 --> 54:38.680
that, yeah, you actually should be able to do that. Now there are lots of still,

54:38.680 --> 54:42.600
there's lots of arguments within the community about whether this is right. How far do you have

54:42.600 --> 54:49.400
to carry the analysis into the observing equipment? I mean, lots of stuff. Maybe in a couple years,

54:49.400 --> 54:54.280
people will say, no, this argument breaks down for some reasons we don't quite understand yet.

54:54.280 --> 54:59.400
So I don't want to say this is nailed down, but it's there and it's a really hot, interesting,

54:59.400 --> 55:05.080
interesting topic and one that could be tested in a lab. Some of it you could do today.

55:05.080 --> 55:09.160
I'm not completely surprised because both you and I have written papers about energy

55:09.160 --> 55:13.560
conservation and its failure in quantum mechanics, which anyone could have done in the 1950s.

55:13.560 --> 55:18.920
Yeah. I just didn't ask the question. But is this a fact that you're talking about now,

55:18.920 --> 55:22.760
would it be a difference between well-meaning mechanics and other formulations of quantum?

55:22.760 --> 55:27.960
Or is it just that you can't ask the question? Yeah, it's a little hard to say because, and again,

55:27.960 --> 55:31.800
I'm now just reporting what Siddhant tells me and he's done all the research. He says,

55:31.800 --> 55:36.840
if you go into the standard physics literature about arrival times, you'll find 20 different

55:36.840 --> 55:41.880
suggestions about how to do it. They tend to agree with each other in the far field. That is,

55:41.880 --> 55:45.960
if there's a long time between when you release it and when you detect it, all of these different

55:45.960 --> 55:51.800
approaches converge on the same answers. But in the midfield, there are places where they

55:51.800 --> 55:59.800
will not converge. What can you say? It's not clear what predictions the quote standard approach

55:59.800 --> 56:05.880
even makes. Got it. You could say if the pilot wave approach makes a clean prediction, it's

56:05.880 --> 56:10.280
clearly a different theory because, look, it's doing something precise where the arrival doesn't

56:10.280 --> 56:17.000
even have anything precise to say. The other obvious question is you've been simultaneously

56:17.000 --> 56:21.480
talking about whether you can send a signal faster than the speed of light, but also working

56:21.480 --> 56:24.440
in the context of non-relativistic quantum mechanics where there is no speed of light.

56:24.440 --> 56:29.560
So do we have to talk about relativistic quantum field theory to have this conversation?

56:29.560 --> 56:34.520
Well, we certainly don't have to talk about it to have the conversation we've had up until now

56:34.520 --> 56:40.760
because even before relativity, if you said, look, Alice is in a lab 100 billion billion miles away

56:40.760 --> 56:47.320
from Bob, can Alice do anything in her lab that would make a difference to what shows up in Bob's

56:47.320 --> 56:55.160
lab? The natural thought would be no. Even if there were some effect, even if there were a

56:55.160 --> 57:01.480
fast effect, it would drop off with the square of the distance. It would tail off. So you can have

57:01.480 --> 57:06.840
the discussion about non-locality even in a non-relativistic. Now, it becomes sharper in a

57:06.840 --> 57:13.800
relativistic context because then you mean faster than light where there is a light cone

57:13.800 --> 57:19.000
structure. There's kind of an objective thing you mean there that's very sharp. So you can sharpen

57:19.000 --> 57:24.600
it up in the relativistic context, but I think you can still reasonably have it. It's not like

57:24.600 --> 57:29.160
all of your discussion of the non-relativistic case just falls to the floor when you notice

57:29.160 --> 57:37.720
there's relativity. My halfway informed feeling is that Bohmian mechanics looks quite natural

57:37.720 --> 57:43.240
in the non-relativistic regime, and it's a little bit more of a challenge to see how we should just

57:43.240 --> 57:50.120
do quantum field theory in that picture. Yeah, there is no doubt there are both conceptual

57:50.120 --> 57:56.120
and technical challenges when you go from standard quantum mechanics and one of the

57:56.680 --> 58:02.280
signals here for people who don't know is that in quantum mechanics, you talk about a system

58:02.280 --> 58:08.280
having n particles, and that's it. Unless you add some or take some away, it's going to be n

58:08.360 --> 58:16.040
particles forever. But that's not the world. That's not the world. We now know that there is some

58:16.040 --> 58:20.200
phenomenon that we call particle creation annihilation, that particle numbers can change,

58:20.200 --> 58:27.000
and so you need to account for that. I mean, there are lots of subtleties here. One subtlety is

58:27.000 --> 58:33.000
the thing we call particle creation annihilation. Is it really? And what I mean by that is when

58:33.000 --> 58:39.000
Dirac, and he's just a standard guy, was talking about this, he didn't have particles really come

58:39.000 --> 58:44.840
into existence. He said, well, there are always infinitely many particles filling up negative

58:44.840 --> 58:50.680
energy states. And what we call the creation of a new electron and a new anti-electron, a new

58:50.680 --> 58:56.440
positron, is really just lifting an electron that was there all along in a negative energy state

58:56.440 --> 59:02.840
up into a positive energy state and leaving a hole behind. So it looks like

59:02.840 --> 59:07.800
there's a new electron and the hole is the thing we call the positron. Now that's a story that would

59:07.800 --> 59:12.600
account for the phenomenon without really creating any new particles. It's just moving them around

59:12.600 --> 59:17.160
in energy space as it were. So there's certainly you have to account for the phenomenon, right? You

59:17.160 --> 59:23.160
have to account for the phenomenon. Yeah, I can take a really high energy photon and, gee, there

59:23.160 --> 59:31.400
just appears now an electron and a positron or some things that satisfy certain conservation was.

59:31.400 --> 59:38.120
We need to account for that phenomenon, whether it really deeply requires new particles or do you

59:38.120 --> 59:42.840
want to give up the particle. The other thing to say is the pilot wave picture is not tied to

59:42.840 --> 59:50.360
particles. It just says there's something that the wave function is guiding. It could be particles,

59:50.360 --> 59:55.240
it could be a more field-like thing, right? There's a kind of way of doing Bohmian field theory

59:55.240 --> 59:59.800
where you replace the particles with fields but the same kind of architecture.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:04.520
And the other point to make, which at least needs to be made, is that people can say, gosh,

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:09.800
but there's no good Bohmian quantum field theory. Standard quantum field theory has been plagued

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:17.240
by mathematical problems and runaway singularities, numbers you try to calculate and they all come

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:25.000
out infinity. It's not as if it's all conceptual lightness and clarity in the so-called standard

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.800
picture. So you don't want to hold this picture to a higher standard of mathematical precision and

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.920
so on, then you're allowing for the theory that you happen to use. Okay, that's perfectly fair,

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:42.360
but I'm just trying to get straight for the listeners out there. If I'm a particle physicist

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:47.800
and I just calculated the rate of Higgs bosons decaying in the two photons and something like that,

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:54.600
is that stuff I can do just as well in the current Bohmian framework or is that work in progress?

01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:01.400
Okay, so one of the things that people have looked at is suppose I remain, again, there are

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.520
different moves you could make. You could say, I'm going to give up the particles all together and

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:09.880
put something else more field like in or you can say, no, I'm going to stick with the particles,

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:14.040
but I am going to allow literally the number to change. I'm going to allow particle creation

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:21.000
and annihilation. You can do that. How you would work that out in a kind of pilot wave picture

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.600
was done, has been done for 30 years ago, I guess. And what you do is you say in the original

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.960
picture, you have a fixed number of particles and all they do is move around and change their

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:39.720
configuration. But now I say, no, no, the real space of possible states is there's a zero particle

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.560
state and a one particle state and then two particle states and then three. So this whole

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:49.480
thing called Fox space, which is familiar to any of the physicists you're talking about.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.800
And you say, no, that's that's what I'm now going to say. The thing is always in a particular

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:59.320
location with a particular number of particles. Sometimes it just moves around in one of these

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:03.080
sectors and the number doesn't change. And sometimes it can jump up or jump down,

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:09.320
which corresponds to particle creation and annihilation. I now need a dynamics for that.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:13.880
It turns out that dynamics tends instead of being deterministic to be indeterministic,

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.240
the easiest way to do it is say that at any given time, there's a certain chance

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:22.440
you'll jump up and create a new particle or jump down and lose particles. Okay, you can do that.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:28.440
And what falls out of doing that is the mathematics of standard quantum field theory.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:35.000
Okay. But so just just so I didn't lose it. Among people who are fans of Bohmian mechanics right

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.880
now, it's there's a camp that thinks maybe the hidden variables are field like and there's another

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.800
camp that thinks maybe there's just collection of particles that can change their number. So we're

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:50.440
not sure that's not a leading and there's a lot of things that are debated within it. So here's

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:56.680
another question. People when you start out, you're always treating electrons and gluons as

01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:03.560
particles, but then they're all fermions, right? They're all half half. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:10.360
I meant quarks. Then people ask, well, what about the photon? Is that a particle? Are there photon

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:16.120
trajectories? And it turns out you can try and develop a theory in which there are and a theory

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:22.200
in which there aren't. Okay. And people work on both sides and there's no agreement in the community.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:28.120
And you ask, well, what would be the advantages of doing it this way? What would be the advantage

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:36.600
of doing it this way? So it's a general architecture of how to develop a theory that can be implemented,

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:42.680
of course, in many different ways. And so even within the big house, right, there's rooms in

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:48.440
the big mansion of people who are working in different directions. With regard to the idea of

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:52.760
sort of stepping back from the fields and going particles as your ontology,

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:58.040
two things come to mind, one of which is against that idea, one of which is for it. So which one

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:06.200
you want me to tell you first, then you can respond. The worry I have is something like

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:12.920
the Higgs mechanism, where it seems that the Higgs boson lurking as a field with an expectation

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:17.800
value throughout all of space is playing a crucially important role in explaining phenomenologically

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:23.160
observable properties. Is that something you could use? I mean, I think I just answered that,

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:28.760
which is it sounds like you're the kind of person who would say, I'd rather, yeah, I'll treat my

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:34.040
fermions as particles and I'll treat my bosons as fields, essentially, which is, yeah, I won't

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:41.240
introduce particles associated with the integer spin objects. That I think would make you happy,

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:46.760
right? I don't have to say there's a Higgs particle to work it into the theory. And there is a

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:52.200
reason to think that you're going to work bosons and fermions can enter into the theory in different

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:56.680
roles. Okay, this is going to undo the good news that I had. So I don't know if you know this,

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:01.480
because I only recently learned it, but Richard Feynman, when he was inventing Feynman diagrams,

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.760
part of his motivation was to get rid of quantum field theory and replace it with another theory

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:11.800
particles again. And we now think of Feynman diagrams as a tool for understanding quantum

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:18.120
field theory. So he changed his mind. But his motivation, I'm told, was the cosmological

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:23.640
constant problem. Really? Yeah. No, I did not know that. Yeah, I mean, I was told that I need to

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:28.520
find the reference for it. But the idea is if you have fields, they all have these zero point

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:32.280
energies, and they add up to infinity, or you cut it off, and it gives you a big vacuum energy.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:38.040
But if you have particles, you don't have that problem. So if I were a Bohmian particle ontology

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:42.760
guy, I'd be claiming a solution to the cosmological constant. That'd be more nice.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:49.400
Look, that's a connection I was unaware of. My understanding, and again, this is not based in

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:55.000
anything other than what I somehow picked up on the street, was that one way, anyway,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.360
let me put it this way, how Feynman thought about it, I'm not sure, one way to think about

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:05.560
Feynman diagrams, which is runs contrary to way people often talk about them, is that they were

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:12.040
just a mnemonic device, right? I have a mathematical equation that has an infinite number of terms

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:16.680
that I need to sum up. And of course, the issue gets bad when that sum goes to infinity. But

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:23.640
anyway, I have this, all these terms I need to add up. And that the diagrams were just easy ways

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:29.720
to kind of remember what the different terms looked like, right? To figure out what integral

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:35.480
you had to do. Exactly. And now, the way I say people don't do that is they often point at those

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:40.760
things as if they are literal pictures of stuff going on. Oh, this is doing this and this is

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:44.280
doing this and all the stuff is going on. It's a blooming, buzzing confusion of virtual particles

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:50.200
that are running around. That talk, I don't think makes any sense on any view. I'm on your side.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.640
So, if it's just a mnemonic technique, then you're really, it's as if I like to say,

01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:01.640
suppose you wanted to calculate the volume of a sphere. And you just love cubes. And you say,

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:06.280
okay, look, I'm going to first of all, figure out the biggest cube I can sit inside a sphere and

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:11.880
calculate its volume. And now I've got these other little, you know, six round pieces sticking out.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:15.960
Now I'm going to find the biggest cube I can get out of each of those and then add those and then

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:19.480
more cubes and more cubes and more cubes. And you can see, okay, there's going to be an infinite

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:25.720
sequence of these volumes that you now need to add up to get the total volume of the sphere.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:30.280
But you'd say, but you shouldn't think that the sphere is this really complicated thing, right?

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:34.680
It's actually quite simple. And in fact, here's another way to do this calculation that is,

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:38.280
you know, is straightforward and you don't do an infinite sum and G. It's just, you know,

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:43.720
fourth or third pi r cube. No, I think that's actually an important point because

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:51.640
lots of modern physics is motivated beyond the standard model particle physics searches for our

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:56.680
next best theory is motivated by questions of naturalness, right? And fine tuning and so forth.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:00.360
And I think I don't know what the right way to think about those problems is, but I think that

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:04.920
not only do people talk as if there really are virtual particles popping out of existence,

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:11.560
which there aren't. But they also think that somehow nature starts with a classical theory

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:16.520
and then adds quantum corrections on top of it. And nature doesn't do that. And that might change

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:20.840
our perspective here. Right. And I think there's a, I think you're exactly right. And I think there's

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:28.360
a methodological point here, which is that because we start out learning classical physics and it

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:33.880
feels familiar to us and we familiar with the math of it, there's this great temptation of someone

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:38.760
says, oh, the way to come up with a good quantum theory is to start with a classical theory and

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:43.240
then do this thing we call quantizing it, right? We put the hats on, we turn certain variables

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:47.880
into operators. And well, most of the time it's clear how to do that. Sometimes it's not quite

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:52.760
clear how to do that. But you think, but this doesn't make any sense, right? The world, yes,

01:08:52.760 --> 01:09:01.000
the world behaves pretty well the way classical theory predicts at a certain scale. But that's

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:06.520
because something emerging out of a very non-classical physics. And there's no reason to think that the

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:12.920
right way into that physics is to start with the approximation and then twiddle with it, right?

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:17.880
It's got to go the other way around, right? You need the fundamental physics and then hopefully

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:25.160
you can understand why the classical approximations work as well as they do. But I think people are

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:31.880
tempted because you have this kind of algorithmic thing of, oh, just take a variable and put a hat

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.160
on it and turn it into an operator. But conceptually, that's just not the right way to think about it.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:42.440
Yeah, that's right. So good. I'm glad we can find all of our points of agreement against the

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:48.360
consensus, despite the fact that we have some disagreements. But this question of the speed

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:53.880
of light, I'm going to go back to the experiment, the possible signaling, because I do not know about

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:57.800
that work. I don't know whether it's right. So that's okay. We're putting it on. Yeah, right there.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:04.520
But the idea of looking hard for possible experiments to do, I think, is a crucially

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:10.360
important one. I mean, my impression is that your typical Bohmian on the street thinks there's no

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:16.200
experiment to do to test Bohm versus conventional quantum mechanics, whatever that is. Do you have

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:23.320
a feeling about that? I do. And this is a discussion I am in right now arising out of this work.

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:30.280
That is, a lot of people in the Bohmian camp will kind of say, oh, but we know that it won't make

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:37.640
different predictions than, quote, standard quantum mechanics. Now, I think that's just wrong. I think

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:43.480
there are kind of toy cases that make it obviously wrong, but leave those aside. I just tried to

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:51.240
understand what the argument was. And I can't get it, right? And so I think some of this is

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:57.720
defensive, right? Because there's this, and you stop back a second and you see this is so unfair.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:02.440
You have standard quantum mechanics, whatever it is. Anyway, you can make lots of good predictions

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:07.560
with it. Then somebody comes up with a new theory, and then they say, oh, does your theory make any

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:11.400
new predictions? If not, why should I pay any attention to it? Now, the first thing you notice

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:16.120
is, but wait, if these two theories had been discovered in the opposite order, right, you

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:21.240
would be going the other way around. So this can't be, from a logical point of view, a good

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:26.680
objection. Why should I take your theory seriously? Because it makes all the same predictions as my

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:34.760
theory, because that doesn't make any sense. But I think that is an objection that physicists often

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:40.120
made. And so there were certain kinds of defensive procedures that were put up to say, oh, no, we're

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:49.560
not saying they're new predictions, right? And then you'd have to go on. My view is a sharp theory,

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:56.360
again, standard quantum mechanics has certain vaguenesses in it. If you have to talk about

01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:02.520
measurement, if you have to talk about observation, because those are vague terms, these are the

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:07.480
objections that we had. And so you'd expect a sharp theory will certainly ought to differ

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:12.760
in some ways. And you should be looking hard at where those differences might be.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:19.640
Is so the unfair question, what fraction of the Bohmians out there agree with you about that?

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:26.760
It's not an unfair question, but it's a sociological question, which I just can't answer. I

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:33.800
don't know. I don't know. And even as it were, the Bohmian camp is divided into sub-camps and

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:38.440
probably the statistics and the different ones are different. And probably my guess is

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:45.400
weirdly enough, it probably correlates with age. I think younger people are more open to certain

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:51.240
things than people who've been through a lot of battles. But I really don't know.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:54.760
Where are these Bohmians of which you speak? Are they in philosophy departments or physics

01:12:54.760 --> 01:13:02.120
departments or Europe? Well, a lot of them, yeah. So there were a lot of students

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:09.000
in Europe. And I'm sorry, this is going to be just a little hard for me.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:20.120
Det Lefder, who was at the LMU in Munich, had always a dozen graduate students. Unbelievable

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:26.040
what he did that nobody else I know has ever done to promote young people and bring them into this.

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:32.360
And he was in a physics department. He was in the math department.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:41.400
And he was just the most wonderful, caring Dr. Vater and looked after these students.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:47.880
He could not get many of them jobs in academia. A lot of them have gone into other industry,

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:54.280
whatever. They did their work. But there are a lot of young people who came through that program

01:13:54.280 --> 01:14:02.280
who know the theory and work on it. Siddhant Das, who I mentioned, was one of Det Lef's last students.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:08.840
And some of his students, a couple of them are in Tubigan. So there are more of them

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:15.320
in Europe who have come through LMU and through his influence. Then the other thing that's happened

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:23.160
is a lot of physicists who realize they're interested in foundations notice that if you have

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:30.120
credentials as a philosopher, you can more literally more easily have an academic career

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.040
in a philosophy department as a philosopher of physics than you can in the physics department.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:40.760
Still true, yes. So some of them have switched over. Also Det Lef's student, Dustin Lazarevich,

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:47.560
who's now in the Technion in Israel. There are people who are around. And it's more than there

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:53.320
used to be. I mean, the total number is up. What the effect of losing Det Lef because Det Lef died

01:14:54.120 --> 01:15:01.320
during COVID? I don't know. I mean, nobody right now is doing what he was able to do. And we have

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:10.680
to hope that some dedicated person with the right psychology and so on can

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:15.880
kind of take his place and help people along. Do you think we started by talking about

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:21.080
why you don't need to make a sales pitch to philosophers? They get it. Yeah.

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:29.560
How deeply do they get it? How much has quantum mechanics changed what philosophers think about

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:39.000
metaphysics? So this is an interesting question. In philosophy, I would say there are three camps

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:44.520
of people who do what goes under the name metaphysics. I just gave this talk at Rutgers,

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:49.000
the undergraduates, about metaphysics and science. Are metaphysics and science enemies or friends or

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:55.160
what? Or the same thing? Yeah, exactly. That was my conclusion at the end. So you jumped right

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.920
to the end. Sorry. But no, there's an interesting history because really there's a certain point

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:07.800
where they're clearly considered to be enemies. I mean, Carnap. I would say that in metaphysicians,

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:12.440
people would self-identify as metaphysicians in philosophy now fall into kind of three camps.

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:17.880
There's a camp that's sometimes called analytic metaphysics, which tends to be doing things

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:27.000
which don't seem to care much about science. They're asking questions that don't... It's not

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:33.080
obvious that any scientific theory would bear one way or the other on the question.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:39.400
Oh, are there... I mean, these are not just going to be words. Are there universals or tropes?

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:43.560
Okay, so this is the kind of thing that a philosopher of a certain kind will understand

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.120
and they'll be fighting with each other forever about universals and tropes. And it's very hard if

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:52.440
you say, well, did Newton believe in universal tropes? You'd say, well, the Newton didn't care.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:57.960
It's just not an issue that is built into the guts of that theory in any obvious way.

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:05.800
Okay. Then there's another camp that goes by the name scientific metaphysics for the reason of

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:11.080
saying that what I think is obviously correct, metaphysics is about describing what exists

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:14.920
at the most general scales. And if you're interested in what exists in the physical world,

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:20.440
you better pay attention to science. Not to say that the scientists can just answer those questions,

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:29.080
but they do have relevant things to say to offer. But then that group kind of subdivides into two.

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:35.320
The ones who then specialize say to do philosophy of physics. Now that really requires learning

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:43.000
some math and some physics and at a reasonably good scale, some people have full PhDs in physics.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:49.960
But you certainly have to devote some time to just studying math and physics to do this in a

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:55.320
specialized way. And then there's another group of people who clearly acknowledge the relevance

01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:00.120
of the physics, but they're not experts. And so they like to listen to the experts and try

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:05.400
and figure what they can draw out of it without themselves delving so deeply into it. I would

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:10.920
say that's how the landscape goes. But do they talk to each other, these people? Or do they go

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:20.200
to the same conferences? Yeah, I mean, they're certainly, they do talk while they're in each

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:26.840
other's presence. I mean, there are a lot of specialized conferences, but there are conferences.

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:31.480
I mean, I was just invited to be on a panel at the Metaphysics Society of America. And I'll tell

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:37.400
you, the people in that society are not people you'll ever run into. And they were doing a very

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:41.480
different kind of metaphysics, but they were happy. I talked about what I do and the way I

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:45.720
think about it and they didn't throw bricks at me. It wasn't the way they thought about it. They

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:49.720
were interested. They were interested. Yeah, they were interested and they appreciated having the

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:57.320
conversation. And I mean, philosophers tend to be pretty open to talking about weird stuff,

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:01.240
because that's more of us comes with the territory. Whatever strikes them as weird,

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:06.920
you still don't just reject it, right? I guess what I'm getting at, and I'm not trying to presume

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:12.680
the right answer, because I honestly don't know. But to what extent can we imagine smoothing over

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:17.080
the conceptual differences between thinking about physics and thinking about metaphysics?

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:21.400
Like, it really should be thinking about reality is what we're doing, right?

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:28.600
Yeah. I mean, we do, you know, I do need to mention here that, again, you can be interested in

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:34.040
metaphysics and not be a physicalist. So you'd say, part of what I do really is not going to

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:38.360
be informed by physics. If I'm a mathematical Platonist and I'm worried about mathematical

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:42.360
reality and I say that's just not part of physical reality, so I don't care how your physics comes

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:46.520
out. That's a fair, you know, that's a fair thing. So not all of metaphysics has to be

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:52.440
hostage or all that. Interested depends on where you're focusing your attention.

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:59.400
Okay. We actually, Barry Lower was another person we had on recently and Barry, he said

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:05.160
something not on the podcast, sadly, but in informal conversation that was even stronger

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:10.120
than something I would say. I think he was being humorous about it, but he said he remembers very

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:16.600
vividly being struck the day he realized that most problems of philosophy could be cured or solved

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:24.840
by statistical mechanics. And I think that he has a different view about you than that. So we're

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:29.320
running out of time a little bit, but I wanted you to have a chance to give a little bit of

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:36.040
your view of the arrow of time and things like that, which is the other giant thing that people

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:41.320
who care about foundations of physics spend their time worrying about. Right. So let me actually

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:48.600
start with the last thing first and just get it out in the open so people at least be aware of it.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:55.800
I would say it is kind of everybody has this idea of their space and it's kind of three-dimensional,

01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:03.880
at least at large scales. And if I talked about, say, the north-south direction at a certain point,

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:08.600
if I went on to say, by the way, space goes north to south, it doesn't go south to north,

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:12.200
you'd look at me funny and say, what in the world are you talking about? Right?

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:20.120
The spatial thing, there are two directions and they're oppositely directed, but space itself

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:24.440
doesn't go more one way than the other. I don't even know what you mean. On the other hand, the

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:29.320
person in the street, you say time goes from past to future, doesn't go from future to past,

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:34.920
they will again nod at you and say, yeah, tell me something new. Now, I happen to agree with that,

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:39.400
that as I think time is fundamentally different from space, temporal structure is fundamentally

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:43.240
different from spatial structure in that temporal structure does have a fundamental

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:48.840
directionality to it and spatial structure doesn't. This turns out to be a very contentious view

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:54.520
among philosophers and physicists for funny reasons, I would say, I don't know that we have

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:58.920
the time to go into, but it surely is the minority view. And it's a little bit viewed,

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:03.800
just to clarify, it's a little bit different than there are physicists out there and philosophers

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:09.080
who will question whether or not time exists or whether it's fundamental, but here we're talking

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:15.960
about the direction of time, not time. Yes, that's right, that's right. It would be even harder to

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:22.760
deny the existence of time altogether, but certainly the directionality is hotly contested.

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:29.160
I think time itself has a direction. Now, it is clearly the case that there are temporal, manifest

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:36.520
temporal asymmetries on any view. If you give me two pictures of somebody 10 years apart,

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:41.640
usually I can look at them and figure, oh, this was the younger and this is the older,

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:48.840
because people tend to wrinkle up. Now, that's not, maybe they had cosmetic surgery. I could get

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:55.560
that wrong, but there are certainly lots of very reliable temporal asymmetries,

01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:02.680
and those need an explanation, simply saying time has a direction would not explain all by itself

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:08.680
any of those observable temporal asymmetries or what people sometimes call arrows of time.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:15.720
I think all of that is a perfectly good object of study, even if you believe as I do, that one of

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:22.200
the things that you can invoke is that time is itself directed. That doesn't give me these

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.640
observable asymmetries like that, but it might be part of the explanation. How does it help?

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:34.360
Since people like David Albert and Barry and myself think that you don't need an intrinsic

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.720
arrow if you just have an initial condition that is doing all the work?

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:43.560
Because a lot of the explanation, I mean, we can do this in different levels, but let me do the

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:48.600
first level. What do I mean by explaining something? Well, often I think it's a kind of causal

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:52.600
explanation. I talk about cause and effect, and now you say, okay, but what distinguishes cause

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:58.280
and effect? Offhand, in many cases, causes precede the effects. I mean, if people often

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:03.400
talk about running a movie backward or imagining that, which of course, you can literally run a

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:09.400
movie backward, but then the end sequence comes before the title sequence. You still have a direction

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:15.960
of time. If you took that seriously as a movie of something in the normal direction, also all the

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:20.360
causal structure would be reversed. What were causes would become effects, and therefore the

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:29.720
structure of causal explanation would be different. You have to get a bit deep, and statistical

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:36.040
mechanics does come into this here in a way that we couldn't get on the table clearly in a short

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:43.160
period of time, where you not only have causal explanations where you say this particular

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:50.280
precise physical state gives rise to this later one, but other kinds of statistical explanations

01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:57.080
where you say this kind of physical state. I haven't precisely, but I'm going to constrain it in

01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:01.640
certain ways. There's a class of various that gives rise to this kind of state. I mean, this is the

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:07.000
sort of thing that you take a box of gas, and you say, if you wait a while, it'll eventually relax to

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:13.960
an equilibrium. That of course shows a directionality to it, because from this initial state, you can

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:20.200
say in five minutes, it'll be equilibrium. If you look at the equilibrium state at a generic level,

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:25.560
kind of fuzzed out level, you couldn't say, oh, five minutes ago, it was in this non-equilibrium

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:31.960
state. There's a kind of asymmetry there, and that's connected to certain asymmetries in statistical

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:38.920
explanation, probabilistic explanation. It's a very interesting and deep, hard topic. A bit

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:43.480
different than worrying about, say, relativity, which you might say is about space-time structure,

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:48.760
quantum mechanics is about material structure. Statistical explanation is about a kind of

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:55.720
explanatory project, and what goes into it, and what succeeds as giving statistical explanations

01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:02.360
of things. But I do think that reversing the direction of time, you might have a very good,

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:07.400
what you consider to be a very good statistical explanation of something as seen as it were

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:11.640
in one direction of time. If you look at the other direction, you say, wait, there's no explanation

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:19.400
at all. The explanatory part went away. All I can say is a massive coincidence, or else,

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:26.760
to be teleological and say the future is somehow affecting the present. But I take it to be one

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:31.560
of the great discoveries of the scientific revolution to get rid of that kind of teleology.

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:38.360
Does your view that time has an intrinsic direction affect what we would call microphysics,

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.840
the standard model of particle physics, for example, or could it?

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:48.440
Sure, it could. I mean, I think that it plays into your fundamental picture of space-time

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:54.360
structure. And of course, one needs an account of space-time structure to even begin to write down

01:26:54.360 --> 01:27:01.080
what you think of as laws of physics. And I think there are very specific ways in which

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:06.680
having a direction, well, certainly having a direction, let me just give you a very

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:13.000
concrete thing one could say. Suppose I have a kind of grid, like a street grid, and I have

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:18.200
two points on it, and you ask me, okay, how many continuous paths are there that will

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:22.760
take me from A to B? And typically, the answer, if the grid goes on forever, it's infinitely many,

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:28.120
because it can kind of go short way or around or far around, go way out and come back. Now,

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:34.040
suppose I put some arrows on that grid, right? So they're one-way streets. Now it's not at all

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:40.040
clear that this number will always be infinite. Now it might be quite tightly constrained. The

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:47.800
directionality gives me a resource there that a lack of directionality doesn't have. And I think

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:52.360
that's actually quite important and plays out in trying to understand the laws of physics, but

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.840
it's much more complicated. It's much more complicated, but that's what you're thinking

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:58.600
about these days. That's one of the things I'm thinking about very hard. I mean, I've been working

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:04.120
on thinking about what space at time could be like if they were actually not continuous,

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:10.360
but discrete at fundamental scale. I worked a long time and did six chapters just on space,

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:14.920
and now I have to bring in time. And the time part really has to have a direction. Just for

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:18.360
it to work, it has to have a direction. You have to understand how the directionality comes

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:24.040
into it. Sorry, what do you say for it to work? For this scheme I have, to be a kind of thing

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:27.880
where you could do a plausible looking sort of physics with. Do you have a catchy name for your

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:32.920
scheme? Yeah, full discrete geometry. Full discrete geometry. Okay, good. And the time

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:37.560
directedness has to be part of the story. Yeah, it's fundamental in it. Yeah. Okay,

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:41.400
all right, good. Well, we're looking forward to that. We'll get some point. Yeah, I know.

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:47.960
I got really stuck. Yeah, I mean, well, I'm up on chapter eight now. I mean, the spatial part went

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:53.240
real well. And then it was like, okay, part two, let's bring in time. And then you realize it's a

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:58.200
tricky business. Is it quantum we're talking or classical? This is all this is all classical

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:03.320
geometry. But quantum field theory, there is a connection to quantum field theory, which I'll

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:08.440
just state briefly, we talked about problems just in doing quantum field theory, just mathematical

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:13.880
problems. One way that this kind of Bohmian or pilot wave approach for quantum field theory was

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:18.920
done was done by Bell, it's called Bell type quantum field theory. And one thing he does is he puts

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.800
it on a lattice, that is, he doesn't do it in continuous space, he does it on a kind of discrete

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:28.920
lattice. And you have these jumps from lattice points to lattice points. That turns out to be

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:34.760
very important to have a structure where you can do the math in a clean way. Okay, looking forward

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:39.480
to the book coming out, we will pre advertise it here. So here's the last, I'm not going to call

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:45.320
it a question thing to respond to. When we talk about quantum mechanics, and as we say, you have

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:51.320
to give up something maybe that was hopeful or intuitive or whatever. And even in relativity,

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:55.560
it seems like maybe the world is a little bit different. Is there hope for

01:29:56.360 --> 01:30:01.320
fundamentally understanding why the world is this way? Like in retrospect, can you say, oh,

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:04.200
yes, it had to be quantum mechanics, or are we just stuck with it?

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:09.800
Yeah, I think people like to say that why the quantum, you know, you'll get this thing. I think,

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:15.960
oh, come on, just, you know, grow up. No, I mean, there's going to be foundations. It's going to be

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:24.520
one of the really hard questions in this whole topic is the question, where do I stop digging?

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:30.120
Right? Where is my spade turned? Where do I say, okay, I've hit a foundation here.

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:37.320
It looks like this is a plausible place to stop. And all you can say is, yeah, this is the way it

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:41.320
is. Could it have been some other way? Yeah, it could have been some other way. It isn't.

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:45.480
This looks like a plausible place to stop. If you think if you're never going to be satisfied,

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:49.560
okay, then you're never going to be satisfied. And the problem is, there are dangers in both

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:55.400
directions, right? If you're too easily satisfied, you'll stop digging when in fact you could

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:59.480
discover a lot of interesting structure lying underneath where you've stopped. But if you're

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:03.640
too pigheaded, you're going to get to the bottom and still be banging your head against it forever,

01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:10.280
because there is nothing underneath it, right? So there's a kind of connoisseur's feel for where's

01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:16.840
a reasonable place to stop. But I don't think you're going to be stopped by some master principle

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:23.400
that says it could only have been this way. How could you expect that? The world is kind of contingent.

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:27.960
Well, that seems like a reasonable place to stop. So Tim Wilden, thanks very much for being on the

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:34.680
Can I actually, before you do that, because I'm here and I have many voices, many years

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:40.200
that I ever kind of normally will have, and I'm going to just take advantage of you and say,

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:45.960
one of the things I'm doing is trying to promote foundations of physics in the way I'm doing it

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:50.360
is I've founded this thing called the John Bell Institute for the Foundations of Physics.

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:55.720
And we are at the very moment, a kind of critical moment where we're trying to buy a physical place

01:31:55.720 --> 01:32:02.360
for us to live. And if anybody out there likes people who talk about this stuff and thinks

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:07.320
they should have a place to go where they can meet and talk to each other, we have a GoFundMe

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:17.080
or you could go to www.JohnBellInstitute.org. If anybody would like to help us out in any way,

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:20.840
it's our moment of need and we would appreciate it greatly.

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:25.400
Good to be reminded of that. I will also mention that in the intro and put links on

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:30.360
the web page. I can mention it because it's an audio podcast. Tim is wearing a very fetching

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:35.000
John Bell Institute polo shirt right now. So that could be swag. I don't know. Is that a GoFundMe?

01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:42.920
This, to get the shirt, you got to come to the place. The only exception to that are my parents

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:47.960
who are 95. And I said, you can have shirts without actually going. But this is, you can only wear

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:53.320
the shirt if you've been there and you've seen this beautiful island in Croatia and enjoyed it

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:57.160
and then you get a shirt. But it is actually an important thing. I'm glad you mentioned it

01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:03.080
because it's a reminder that ideas are great and conversations about them are great, but

01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:09.080
institutions also matter for getting these ideas out. And this is the problem. This field is an

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:15.800
academic orphan. Foundations of physics doesn't fit. It kind of doesn't fit in physics departments

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:21.480
and it doesn't really fit in philosophy departments. And so if it's going to live,

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:25.880
a place has to be made for it. All right. Let's look it up on the internet. So in that case,

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:31.720
Tim Walson, thanks very much for being on the Mindscape Podcast. Thank you.
