Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast, I'm your host Sean Carroll.

00:04.280 --> 00:09.200
And we're very excited these days here at Mindscape World International Headquarters

00:09.200 --> 00:11.720
for Book Publication Week.

00:11.720 --> 00:17.240
As some of you know, on Tuesday, I guess May 14th, here in the United States anyway, we're

00:17.240 --> 00:21.040
going to have the publication of Quanta and Fields.

00:21.040 --> 00:25.000
This is Volume 2 in the Biggest Ideas in the Universe series.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.440
The series will be a three-part series that aims to explain modern physics, the part of

00:31.440 --> 00:33.080
modern physics that we know.

00:33.080 --> 00:36.120
Not the speculative stuff, we're not going to be talking about the multiverse or quantum

00:36.120 --> 00:37.960
gravity or anything like that.

00:37.960 --> 00:44.560
The kinds that ideas in modern physics that we think will last for a very, very long time.

00:44.560 --> 00:49.720
And the gimmick is, we're explaining them in a way that involves the equations.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.080
So we're going to show you the equations.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.800
And that means it's not for everybody, but it's very much for some people.

00:55.800 --> 00:59.360
If you've ever read descriptions of physics where you thought that there was something

00:59.360 --> 01:04.080
going on, but there's a bunch of metaphors and stories and analogies and you weren't

01:04.080 --> 01:09.240
quite sure why things were working out the way they were working out, these are the books

01:09.240 --> 01:10.240
for you.

01:10.240 --> 01:16.280
In the Biggest Ideas, you'll really get to see why, for example, the Higgs mechanism

01:16.280 --> 01:20.120
gives mass to particles and things like that.

01:20.120 --> 01:23.120
You don't need to just wave your hands in any way.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.800
And the general theme of the book is quanta and fields.

01:26.800 --> 01:32.120
That's the name of the book, as opposed to the first volume called space, time and motion,

01:32.120 --> 01:34.360
which was really classical physics.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.040
This book is about quantum physics.

01:36.040 --> 01:42.200
The third book on complexity and emergence, both is a collection of the things that didn't

01:42.200 --> 01:47.360
fit into the first two books, but also is about larger scale things, right?

01:47.360 --> 01:50.800
Biggest dynamics, complex systems, stuff like that.

01:50.800 --> 01:56.920
And it's kind of a appetizer, main course dessert kind of thing.

01:56.920 --> 02:03.240
This book, volume two, quanta and fields is a book I've been wanting to write for decades.

02:03.240 --> 02:08.200
This is a book that I really have thought for a very long time would be super duper

02:08.200 --> 02:13.840
useful for a lot of people, because quantum field theory in particular is a part of modern

02:13.840 --> 02:20.880
physics that is absolutely central and gets very, very little air time in popular discussions.

02:20.880 --> 02:23.400
We talk about quantum mechanics a lot.

02:23.400 --> 02:28.080
We talk about entanglement and the measurement problem and all these weird things, bell inequalities

02:28.080 --> 02:29.480
and so forth.

02:29.480 --> 02:34.080
And then we skip to speculative stuff about string theory or quantum gravity or the multiverse

02:34.080 --> 02:35.760
or inflation.

02:35.760 --> 02:41.280
But the actual physicists doing their jobs are thinking about quantum field theory all

02:41.360 --> 02:42.360
the time.

02:42.360 --> 02:47.080
And you rarely get a very full discussion of that in popular media.

02:47.080 --> 02:51.840
We recently did talk to Matt Strassler, who wrote a wonderful book Waves in an Impossible

02:51.840 --> 02:58.240
Sea that talks about quantum field theory, but it is the opposite level of mathematical

02:58.240 --> 02:59.240
explicitness.

02:59.240 --> 03:04.680
It's all about trying to explain in words as carefully as you can how quantum fields

03:04.680 --> 03:09.920
work, whereas quanta and fields, the book that I've written, is a short action packed

03:09.920 --> 03:15.000
introduction to both quantum mechanics and to its specific implementation in the context

03:15.000 --> 03:19.040
of field theory, which is where modern physics lives.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.600
That's what we're really thinking about.

03:20.600 --> 03:28.080
So we need to understand why in the world you could take a field, quantize it and have

03:28.080 --> 03:29.760
it look like particles.

03:29.760 --> 03:33.840
That's the big mystery of quantum field theory, but that one, you know, historically was figured

03:33.840 --> 03:37.760
out relatively early on and it opens the floodgates.

03:37.800 --> 03:42.880
Once you understand that, once you understand that you can quantize fields and get particles

03:42.880 --> 03:48.200
out of them without putting particles in explicitly, there's a whole bunch of things that can

03:48.200 --> 03:53.480
happen, ways that fields can interact with each other and influence each other that leads

03:53.480 --> 03:57.840
to interactions that we measure with Feynman diagrams.

03:57.840 --> 04:01.360
I should say that we predict using Feynman diagrams, that we measure in experiments,

04:01.360 --> 04:07.200
of course, all sorts of conceptual questions with infinities and renormalization, but also

04:07.240 --> 04:12.440
new phenomena that can happen like gauge symmetries giving rise to forces, breaking those symmetries

04:12.440 --> 04:19.640
with the Higgs mechanism, confining things inside nucleons and violating parody conservation

04:19.640 --> 04:20.640
and things like that.

04:20.640 --> 04:26.120
So it's a whole wonderful zoo of things that we've spent the whole 20th century and beyond

04:26.120 --> 04:27.280
trying to understand.

04:27.280 --> 04:30.440
So there's a lot to discuss in a short solo podcast.

04:30.440 --> 04:31.680
I'm not going to cover it all.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.200
Sorry about that.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.200
You can read the book.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.880
I did do the audio book version of the book.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.400
It's about 10 hours of me talking.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.440
If you don't get enough from the podcast, you can download that and I just read the

04:43.440 --> 04:48.600
book and I try to explain what's in the pictures and the equations and everything like that.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.160
So here I'm just going to hit some highlights.

04:50.160 --> 04:55.720
I really do want to focus on that idea of why quantum fields, how you get particles out

04:55.720 --> 04:58.520
of that and the door that it opens to other things.

04:58.520 --> 05:02.200
So we'll be very explicit about where the particles come from, be a little bit more

05:02.240 --> 05:09.080
hand wavy and gestural about where all these other symmetries and how they get involved.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.080
But it's important stuff.

05:10.080 --> 05:14.400
It'll give you, I think, a feeling for the kind of thing that we're going to be talking

05:14.400 --> 05:17.880
about in the book if you are so inclined to go more deeply.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.080
So with that, let's go.

05:33.200 --> 05:39.600
I think it's useful to get one thing straight right away.

05:39.600 --> 05:45.720
Sometimes you will hear quantum mechanics came first and then we invented quantum field

05:45.720 --> 05:47.120
theory.

05:47.120 --> 05:50.960
It's fine to say that because these are words that we make up definitions of, right?

05:50.960 --> 05:53.760
You know, you're always allowed to define the words however you want.

05:53.760 --> 05:57.680
It's not the best way of thinking about things.

05:57.680 --> 06:04.160
Quantum mechanics is a broad framework that includes quantum field theory as part of it.

06:04.160 --> 06:09.800
It is literally the quantum theory of fields, quantum mechanics applied to fields.

06:09.800 --> 06:10.800
That's what it is.

06:10.800 --> 06:15.520
And it's a very simple statement, obviously, but I remember literally taking quantum field

06:15.520 --> 06:21.360
theory in graduate school and it took me a while to figure out, you know, oh, it's just

06:21.360 --> 06:22.360
quantum mechanics.

06:22.360 --> 06:27.200
It's the same quantum mechanics we had before just applied to a different system.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.080
It's a subset of quantum mechanics.

06:30.080 --> 06:36.840
The thing that we usually call quantum mechanics is the quantum mechanics of particles and

06:36.840 --> 06:40.560
quantum field theory is the quantum mechanics of fields.

06:40.560 --> 06:45.280
So the very first thing we need to understand to wrap our brains around the idea of quantum

06:45.280 --> 06:48.480
field theory is the word of.

06:48.480 --> 06:54.000
Now this is in some sort of Bill Clinton-esque parsing of language at a very deep level.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.800
We're really trying to understand, you know, what do you mean when you say you have a quantum

06:57.800 --> 07:05.040
theory of some thing like particles or fields or for that matter, strings or loops or whatever.

07:05.040 --> 07:10.040
What does it mean to have a quantum theory theory of some thing?

07:10.040 --> 07:15.480
And the answer to that is that when we do quantum mechanics, whether it's particles or fields

07:15.480 --> 07:23.400
or whatever, the usual way we start, not always, but usually we start with a classical theory

07:23.400 --> 07:25.240
and then we have a cookbook.

07:25.240 --> 07:31.760
We have a set of procedures for converting a classical theory into a quantum theory.

07:31.760 --> 07:38.200
We call this quantization, surprisingly enough, and there's a lot hidden in that word quantization

07:38.200 --> 07:40.320
or to quantize.

07:40.320 --> 07:45.240
We don't really have a well-defined map from the space of all classical theories to quantum

07:45.240 --> 07:46.240
theories.

07:46.240 --> 07:53.280
So think of it as a way to find quantum mechanical theories starting from a classical theory.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.480
And usually we start from particles.

07:56.480 --> 08:02.840
That's what we do when we first learn quantum mechanics, and it makes sense when we developed

08:02.840 --> 08:07.960
quantum mechanics in the early 1900s, people were more focused on the particles.

08:07.960 --> 08:12.000
The fields were always there, they were thinking about them, but they wanted to get the particles

08:12.000 --> 08:13.600
right first.

08:13.600 --> 08:19.400
So when you say you have a classical theory of something, you know the vague idea of classical

08:19.520 --> 08:25.120
physics, a la Isaac Newton, you have some particles and they have positions and they

08:25.120 --> 08:26.480
have velocities.

08:26.480 --> 08:30.280
Or equally well, if the mass of the particle is a fixed number, you can talk about the

08:30.280 --> 08:32.560
momentum of the particle.

08:32.560 --> 08:34.600
Momentum is just mass times velocity.

08:34.600 --> 08:40.800
For technical reasons that Professor Hamilton figured out, it's actually better to think

08:40.800 --> 08:43.520
about momentum than velocity, but it really doesn't matter.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.680
They're completely convertible back and forth.

08:45.680 --> 08:50.080
And the point is that for any one particle, once you know those two things, position and

08:50.080 --> 08:53.560
momentum, you can figure out what's going to happen to it, right?

08:53.560 --> 08:58.360
You can plug into Newton's laws of motion or Hamilton's equations or Lagrange's equations.

08:58.360 --> 09:04.000
There's many different mathematically equivalent ways to do classical physics.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.680
These are all explained in volume one of the biggest ideas, space, time and motion.

09:09.680 --> 09:14.680
And the thing that is the same in all of these different ways of thinking about classical

09:14.680 --> 09:19.560
physics is the amount of information you need to say what's going to happen next.

09:19.560 --> 09:24.480
If you were Laplace's demon, if you were able to predict exactly what was implied by

09:24.480 --> 09:29.800
the laws of physics, the data you'd need to be given is the position and momentum of

09:29.800 --> 09:31.480
all the particles.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.960
And then it's deterministic, right?

09:32.960 --> 09:36.560
The wonderful thing about classical mechanics is it says what's going to happen.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.480
It's not ambiguous about it.

09:38.480 --> 09:43.440
So quantum mechanics says, okay, think about this one particle just to start.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.200
We have position and momentum.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.200
Throw away the momentum.

09:46.200 --> 09:49.320
Forget about the momentum just for a minute, okay?

09:49.320 --> 09:56.480
And quantum mechanics says instead of having a position, we now describe the particle by

09:56.480 --> 10:00.400
having a wave function psi of x.

10:00.400 --> 10:05.480
If x were the position, psi, the Greek letter psi is the wave function which assigns a number

10:05.480 --> 10:08.520
to every possible position.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.520
That's the wave function.

10:09.520 --> 10:14.280
Usually that number will be zero or very, very close to zero, almost everywhere.

10:14.280 --> 10:19.080
And then in some little blob-like region of space, that number will not be zero.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.080
That's the wave function.

10:20.080 --> 10:26.000
For any possible place you might see the particle were you to look for it, there's going to

10:26.000 --> 10:28.760
be a number, a complex number in particular.

10:28.760 --> 10:34.520
And what the wave function tells you is the probability of observing the particle to have

10:34.520 --> 10:35.800
that position.

10:35.800 --> 10:40.120
So in particular, you calculate the probability by squaring the wave function.

10:40.120 --> 10:44.560
Or since it's a complex number, you take the modulus squared of the wave function.

10:44.560 --> 10:50.640
And in the new book, Quantum and Fields, we go through quantum mechanics really quickly.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.520
First three chapters, we do it.

10:52.520 --> 10:56.640
Wave functions, measurement, entanglement, and then we're moving on and devoting most

10:56.640 --> 11:02.320
of the book to quantum field theory because that's a very rich and very complicated set

11:02.320 --> 11:04.080
of ideas.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.840
So where did momentum go is one obvious question.

11:07.840 --> 11:14.320
And the answer is, you know, when I said that the wave function varies with space, how fast

11:14.320 --> 11:15.320
is varying?

11:15.320 --> 11:19.800
How fast the wave function is wiggling up and down basically tells you the momentum.

11:19.800 --> 11:26.080
Or more accurately, you can turn it into a prediction for measuring the momentum to

11:26.080 --> 11:31.760
have any particular value in exactly the same way wave function squared kind of procedure.

11:31.760 --> 11:35.800
So the point is, the thing I don't want to get lost, the thing you need to understand

11:35.800 --> 11:40.960
for the rest of the discussion is, when you go from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics,

11:40.960 --> 11:47.280
you start with some object with a definite state, position and momentum, and you switch

11:47.280 --> 11:52.280
to a wave function that will tell you the probability of getting different observational

11:52.280 --> 11:53.480
outcomes.

11:53.480 --> 11:59.480
That's the evolution or the transformation from a classical theory to a quantum theory.

11:59.480 --> 12:03.360
And in that case, we were talking about particles, and it's natural to talk about particles because

12:03.360 --> 12:07.280
if you think about the development of quantum mechanics, what were they thinking about?

12:07.280 --> 12:15.840
We often attribute the birth of quantum mechanics to Planck and Einstein in 1900, Planck understood

12:15.840 --> 12:21.800
black body radiation in terms of chunks of energy being given off by vibrating electrons

12:21.800 --> 12:22.800
and atoms.

12:22.800 --> 12:28.200
In 1905, Einstein really said, you know, all electromagnetic radiation can be thought of

12:28.200 --> 12:33.480
as coming out in these particle-like quanta, which we now call photons.

12:33.480 --> 12:39.280
But subsequent to that, the work by people like Niels Bohr and Louis de Broglie and Werner

12:39.280 --> 12:46.200
Heisenberg, etc., was more focused on particles, in particular on the electrons orbiting atoms.

12:46.200 --> 12:52.400
So they were trying to understand the structure of atoms, how atoms would give off radiation,

12:52.400 --> 12:53.400
things like that.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.880
So it was the particles that were really front and center.

12:56.880 --> 13:01.720
And then therefore, it makes sense, when you're an undergraduate physics student, you learn

13:01.720 --> 13:03.720
about the quantum mechanics of particles.

13:03.720 --> 13:11.080
I should say, vis-a-vis the book that is coming out, the reason why I can pack a whole discussion

13:11.080 --> 13:15.720
of both quantum mechanics and quantum field theory into a relatively short book, even

13:15.720 --> 13:20.600
though I do include all the equations, is because you're not trying to solve the equations.

13:20.600 --> 13:24.840
You're not going to come out of reading this book, being able to calculate the scattering

13:24.840 --> 13:29.520
probability of two particles or the decay rate of the Higgs boson or anything like that.

13:29.520 --> 13:33.560
You will understand what those words mean, and you will have an idea what the equations

13:33.560 --> 13:39.080
are behind them, but I'm not training you to be a practicing physicist.

13:39.080 --> 13:43.120
And that philosophy is remarkably liberating.

13:43.120 --> 13:51.440
So just to be super clear here, a very small percentage of people who get bachelor's degrees

13:51.440 --> 13:55.000
in physics ever learn quantum field theory.

13:55.000 --> 14:01.520
In fact, plenty of people get PhDs in physics without ever learning quantum field theory.

14:01.520 --> 14:05.880
Just like in volume one, we did Einstein's equation for general relativity, that's still

14:05.880 --> 14:11.400
a classical theory, Einstein's theory of gravity, many, many people get a physics education

14:11.400 --> 14:14.160
and do not learn general relativity.

14:14.160 --> 14:19.200
So part of the reason why I'm writing these books is because I want more people to be

14:19.200 --> 14:24.640
able to grasp these ideas, even physics majors, plenty of physics majors don't get to learn

14:24.640 --> 14:26.520
about these things.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.560
And they're not that inaccessible, honestly.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.040
You can learn them, I promise.

14:30.040 --> 14:33.680
You'll get a feeling for here in the podcast.

14:33.680 --> 14:40.480
So I'm going to keep referring back to what we study as physics students, even though

14:40.480 --> 14:45.280
I don't expect you to grow up to be necessarily a physics student or a working physicist.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.280
That's the idea.

14:46.280 --> 14:51.040
Okay, so the first thing we would learn if we were an undergraduate sometime in your

14:51.040 --> 14:57.480
sophomore year or your junior year maybe, sometimes the universities will split it up.

14:57.480 --> 15:01.600
So you'll sort of get like a little hint even in your very first year about quantum mechanics

15:01.600 --> 15:07.440
and you'll do it seriously later on in your junior or sophomore years.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.400
And you'll be mostly taught the quantum theory of particles.

15:11.400 --> 15:16.120
So you're imagining that the system you're studying is an electron or something like

15:16.120 --> 15:19.400
that, okay, orbiting in an atom.

15:19.400 --> 15:24.320
And you have this wave function and you have an equation that tells you how the wave function

15:24.320 --> 15:26.720
behaves and that's the short of your equation.

15:26.720 --> 15:30.520
There's different, again, mathematically equivalent ways of thinking about it, but that's the

15:30.520 --> 15:31.960
basic idea.

15:31.960 --> 15:37.200
And from that you can predict things like the spectrum of radiation being absorbed or

15:37.200 --> 15:38.960
emitted from the atoms.

15:39.000 --> 15:45.640
So the general idea is, as we said, start with particles, make wave functions, and then

15:45.640 --> 15:48.760
give you a set of rules for how the wave functions behave.

15:48.760 --> 15:53.440
They evolve according to the Schrodinger equation when you're not measuring them.

15:53.440 --> 15:58.920
When you are measuring them, they collapse and you get a probability of observing something.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.800
Then you discovered that there's this thing called entanglement.

16:01.800 --> 16:08.000
To be very honest, you could possibly take an entire one semester intro to quantum course

16:08.040 --> 16:10.800
as an undergraduate and never hear about entanglement.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.760
I know that's weird because if you hear the popular level discussions, they'll talk about

16:14.760 --> 16:16.560
entanglement all the time.

16:16.560 --> 16:22.120
But you can easily spend a semester just solving the Schrodinger equation for different kinds

16:22.120 --> 16:25.560
of potential energies that the electron could be moving in.

16:25.560 --> 16:30.280
So let me tell you, taking that undergraduate course is not necessarily as sexy as you might

16:30.280 --> 16:35.000
imagine that it is if you just heard popular level discussions of quantum mechanics.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.560
In all this stuff you learn about the particles, about the wave functions, about the Schrodinger

16:38.560 --> 16:45.960
equation, it gives you a wonderfully precise, quantitative, and experimentally testable

16:45.960 --> 16:51.320
understanding of what happens in atoms, of the ways that there are different energy levels,

16:51.320 --> 16:55.000
different orbitals, and so forth, and how they show up experimentally.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.240
And let me emphasize that bit about different energy levels, because this is absolutely

16:59.280 --> 17:05.240
crucial to the essence of quantum mechanics in a way that I think is misunderstood by

17:05.240 --> 17:08.960
a lot of people who don't study it professionally.

17:08.960 --> 17:15.400
Which is the word quantum is a little bit misleading, I would say.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.760
What does quantum mean?

17:16.760 --> 17:19.320
Before you knew about quantum mechanics, the word quantum was still around.

17:19.320 --> 17:24.320
It meant a discrete amount of something, one chunk of something, right?

17:24.320 --> 17:32.560
The idea of a quantum, or many quanta, would be the plural, is rather than having a smooth

17:32.560 --> 17:38.080
distribution of things, you have individual pieces, discrete elements, those are the quanta.

17:38.080 --> 17:43.320
So particulate, particle-like, pixelated, or whatever you want to call it, that's the

17:43.320 --> 17:47.720
sort of philosophy behind the word, quanta, or quantum.

17:47.720 --> 17:54.800
And calling this theory that we're discussing, quantum mechanics, or quantum field theory,

17:54.800 --> 18:03.040
makes you think, informally, that maybe the world is divided up into chunks, right?

18:03.040 --> 18:08.160
Into pieces, into discrete bits, that the world is not fundamentally smooth, but rather

18:08.160 --> 18:10.920
fundamentally discrete.

18:10.920 --> 18:16.560
Maybe this inspires you to think that once you include gravity in the game, space, and

18:16.600 --> 18:22.880
maybe space-time will be divided up into chunks, into a little lattice, little pixels, or something

18:22.880 --> 18:23.880
like that.

18:23.880 --> 18:29.680
This is a fundamental, deep, terrible, awful, no-good understanding of what quantum mechanics

18:29.680 --> 18:31.800
actually says.

18:31.800 --> 18:36.480
Because if you think about what I just said, if we take the idea of a particle, replace

18:36.480 --> 18:42.200
it by the idea of a wave function, and that wave function obeys the Schrodinger equation,

18:42.200 --> 18:46.800
nowhere there is the idea of chunks of anything.

18:46.800 --> 18:52.920
Nowhere there is the idea that the world is broken up into discrete bits of matter or

18:52.920 --> 18:53.920
energy.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.680
It's as smooth as it could possibly be.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.000
Everything is continuous and smooth.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.400
The wave function is a function that spreads out all over the place.

19:01.400 --> 19:05.400
The Schrodinger equation smoothly evolves that wave function, right?

19:05.400 --> 19:09.400
Where does this idea of quanta come from?

19:09.400 --> 19:16.400
And the answer is that, well, it's exactly analogous to the very well-known analogy that

19:17.720 --> 19:20.440
we use of plucking a guitar string.

19:20.440 --> 19:24.760
So if you have a guitar string that is tied down at two ends and you pluck it, there's

19:24.760 --> 19:31.440
a fundamental wavelength at which it vibrates, which leads to a fundamental frequency of sound

19:31.440 --> 19:32.800
being given off.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.640
But there are also harmonics, right?

19:35.640 --> 19:39.440
If you imagine, if you can visualize in your head, I know this is an audio podcast, but

19:39.440 --> 19:45.800
visualize in your head a string being held down at both ends and vibrating sort of uniformly

19:45.800 --> 19:48.680
smoothly up and down, except at the ends.

19:48.680 --> 19:52.840
So in the middle, it's vibrating up and down, tied down at the ends, so the amplitude of

19:52.840 --> 19:57.880
the vibration kind of goes down to zero at both ends where it's tied down.

19:57.880 --> 20:01.480
That is the fundamental frequency at which it's vibrating.

20:01.480 --> 20:07.960
And then the first harmonic frequency is, it looks kind of like an up and down wave-like

20:07.960 --> 20:08.960
shape.

20:08.960 --> 20:13.520
So it starts at one tied down end, goes up halfway through the string, it comes back

20:13.520 --> 20:17.800
down to zero again, and in the other half of the string, it's going down on the right

20:17.800 --> 20:21.520
hand side where, as it was going up on the left hand side.

20:21.520 --> 20:25.360
And so the wavelength is half of what it was.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.360
And therefore, the frequency is twice what it was.

20:28.360 --> 20:33.480
And these are two different things that can happen to the same string.

20:33.480 --> 20:38.040
And then, of course, you have even higher harmonics, where the wave goes up, down, up

20:38.040 --> 20:46.040
again, and all the way up for higher and higher frequencies, shorter and shorter wavelengths.

20:46.040 --> 20:50.040
The reason why I'm talking about this guitar string analogy, and if you're a talented

20:50.040 --> 20:54.600
guitar player, you can actually play the harmonics, get them to come out of your guitar, even

20:54.600 --> 20:58.580
without getting the fundamental note to come out of your guitar.

20:58.580 --> 21:01.640
But that's a different podcast discussion entirely.

21:01.640 --> 21:08.480
The point is, the string that you're plucking has nothing discreet about it.

21:08.480 --> 21:12.280
It's not that the string is only allowed to do certain things.

21:12.280 --> 21:17.360
The string could have any shape that it wants to, as long as it's tied down at both ends.

21:17.360 --> 21:25.160
But it naturally has a set of ways of vibrating that are sort of easiest to make it vibrate

21:25.160 --> 21:28.880
at, that are very natural and direct.

21:28.880 --> 21:32.880
In fact, at the technical level, we would say these are the ones that have a definite

21:32.880 --> 21:36.040
energy in their vibrations.

21:36.040 --> 21:42.240
And so the discreteness comes not because the string itself is discreet, but because

21:42.240 --> 21:47.160
its behavior falls into a discrete set of possibilities.

21:47.160 --> 21:51.800
The fundamental frequency, the first harmonic, second harmonic, et cetera.

21:51.800 --> 21:56.000
And you can calculate exactly what the frequencies are and so forth.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.280
So there's kind of an emergent nature to the discreteness.

22:00.280 --> 22:03.120
The discreteness is not built into the system.

22:03.120 --> 22:07.960
It is a feature of the solutions to the equations that govern the system in some high level

22:07.960 --> 22:08.960
way.

22:08.960 --> 22:09.960
But you can just see it pictorially.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.320
You can tell why.

22:11.320 --> 22:15.800
You can understand that it makes sense that there is, you know, the lowest note, a little

22:15.800 --> 22:20.000
bit higher note, a little bit higher note than that and so forth.

22:20.000 --> 22:28.120
That phenomenon is exactly why, in quantum mechanics, we see discrete behavior for things

22:28.120 --> 22:33.740
like the energy of radiation being given off by one of these atoms.

22:33.740 --> 22:39.840
So instead of thinking of the guitar string being tied down at both ends, think of the

22:39.840 --> 22:42.920
wave function of an electron in an atom.

22:42.920 --> 22:43.920
Let's make our lives easier.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.400
Let's make it a hydrogen atom.

22:45.400 --> 22:48.800
So there's only one electron and there's only one particle in the nucleus, a single

22:48.800 --> 22:49.800
proton.

22:49.800 --> 22:50.800
Okay.

22:50.800 --> 22:54.360
Well, the electron wave function is not tied down.

22:54.360 --> 22:58.560
It can extend very gradually out to infinity, right?

22:58.560 --> 23:03.720
But the wave function has to go to zero at infinity as it gets very, very, very far away

23:03.720 --> 23:06.040
from the proton.

23:06.040 --> 23:10.240
It's going to go to zero because there's only, you can only have a finite amount of

23:10.240 --> 23:11.240
wave function.

23:11.240 --> 23:14.400
The wave function can't spread uniformly over all of space.

23:14.400 --> 23:18.040
It has to be sort of concentrated somewhere and we're imagining that it's concentrated

23:18.040 --> 23:20.360
near the proton in the atom.

23:20.360 --> 23:25.360
So even though the electrons wave function is not literally tied down, effectively it

23:25.360 --> 23:26.360
is.

23:26.360 --> 23:32.360
It goes to zero as you get far away from the atom and you can play exactly the same game

23:32.360 --> 23:37.200
with the electron wave function that you play with the plucked guitar string.

23:37.200 --> 23:42.500
There are technical differences because the energy is a little bit different and also

23:42.500 --> 23:46.720
because it's a three-dimensional thing, the electron wave function rather than the single

23:46.720 --> 23:48.900
one-dimensional guitar string.

23:48.900 --> 23:51.100
But the essence of the issue is the same.

23:51.100 --> 23:56.500
There will be a lowest energy state of the electron, which is analogous to the fundamental

23:56.500 --> 24:01.500
frequency of the guitar string and that's the lowest energy the electron can have in

24:01.500 --> 24:03.000
a hydrogen atom.

24:03.000 --> 24:09.840
And then there is a next highest energy level state that has some discrete extra amount

24:09.840 --> 24:11.420
of energy.

24:11.420 --> 24:16.500
It is not the case that the electron's wave function can't do anything at once.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.920
It can vibrate in whatever way it wants.

24:18.920 --> 24:23.980
But there's a natural set of ways that it can vibrate or ways that it can sort of arrange

24:23.980 --> 24:29.260
itself around the proton and these are the ways that have definite energies and these

24:29.260 --> 24:35.500
are the natural places for the electron to settle down into and what we actually observe.

24:35.500 --> 24:41.340
So the discreteness of the energy levels of an electron, which by the way you learn

24:41.340 --> 24:45.220
about in chemistry class, we learn about the orbitals of an electron around an atom, that's

24:45.220 --> 24:47.340
exactly what's going on.

24:47.340 --> 24:54.060
These are not because you've put in any fundamental discreteness into the nature of the reality

24:54.060 --> 24:55.500
that you're talking about.

24:55.500 --> 24:58.620
The reality is a smooth function obeying a smooth equation.

24:58.620 --> 25:04.220
It's the behavior of the solutions to that equation that has a discrete character and

25:04.220 --> 25:08.140
I'm really sort of dwelling on this and emphasizing it because it's going to become super-duper

25:08.140 --> 25:11.260
important when we get to quantum field theory.

25:11.260 --> 25:18.380
So the lesson here is you start with a completely smooth, continuous, arbitrarily varying thing,

25:18.380 --> 25:23.940
the wave function of the electron and then you examine its behavior under very certain

25:23.940 --> 25:31.180
special circumstances, namely it's sitting there glued to a proton in a hydrogen atom

25:31.340 --> 25:36.100
and you find that the possible places you could find, the possible states you could find the

25:36.100 --> 25:39.980
electron wave function in, come in a discrete set.

25:39.980 --> 25:45.660
So again that discreteness is emergent because it's a property of the different solutions

25:45.660 --> 25:51.020
to the equation, in this case the Schrodinger equation rather than the equation for a string

25:51.020 --> 25:53.060
in a guitar.

25:53.060 --> 25:56.620
So that's where quanta come from.

25:56.620 --> 26:02.060
It's not because you pixelated the universe, it's because you solved an equation and the

26:02.060 --> 26:05.420
solutions come in a discrete set.

26:05.420 --> 26:11.220
And historically this was all done in the 1910s and 20s and we figured this out, quantum

26:11.220 --> 26:14.300
mechanics was a great success, great.

26:14.300 --> 26:20.420
But we always knew, even back in the 20s, that the world was not simply made of particles.

26:20.420 --> 26:26.100
As we said, the very first glimmers of quantum mechanics came from thinking about fields,

26:26.100 --> 26:27.860
thought about particles.

26:27.860 --> 26:34.900
In the 19th century we had figured out that electricity and magnetism were two sets of

26:34.900 --> 26:40.500
phenomena that were unified in a description that involved two different fields, the electric

26:40.500 --> 26:42.860
field and the magnetic field.

26:42.860 --> 26:48.460
And in fact, once Einstein and Minkowski came along with special relativity, we realized

26:48.460 --> 26:53.300
that the electric field, the magnetic field were literally two different aspects of the

26:53.300 --> 26:54.860
same underlying field.

26:54.860 --> 26:58.980
So at some point we just call it the electromagnetic field.

26:58.980 --> 27:00.980
And a field is a very different thing than a particle.

27:00.980 --> 27:04.500
A particle, classically, let's just think classically now, we haven't quantized anything

27:04.500 --> 27:07.220
yet, a particle has a location.

27:07.220 --> 27:12.380
As we said, it has a position, it has a velocity, that's what a particle is basically.

27:12.380 --> 27:18.620
Whereas a field is everywhere, okay, and I need to be very, very careful here, as careful

27:18.620 --> 27:25.740
as I can be, to distinguish the different conceptual things that sound very, very similar

27:25.740 --> 27:26.740
to each other.

27:26.740 --> 27:34.740
In this case, a classical field is very, very different from a quantum wave function, okay.

27:34.740 --> 27:39.020
They seem similar because a classical field has a value at every point in space.

27:39.020 --> 27:43.620
The electric field has a value at every point in space.

27:43.620 --> 27:47.140
It's a little vector because the electric field is not just a number, it's a little

27:47.140 --> 27:51.420
arrow with a direction and a magnitude at every point in space.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.700
You can't see it, it's invisible, it's all around you.

27:54.700 --> 27:59.660
The magnetic field, likewise, you know, you can detect it, if you put iron filings on

27:59.660 --> 28:04.380
a piece of paper near a magnet, they will line up with the magnetic field, showing the

28:04.380 --> 28:08.780
influence of the magnetic field around you, a compass that you can carry around will point

28:08.780 --> 28:12.340
toward the north pole for exactly that same reason.

28:12.340 --> 28:16.620
And you can detect the electric field likewise, but they're there, they're around you at every

28:16.620 --> 28:21.260
point in space around you right now, including inside you for that matter, and also, you

28:21.260 --> 28:23.380
know, out in interstellar space.

28:23.380 --> 28:27.940
Every point in space has a value for the electric field and the magnetic field.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.540
That's what a field is.

28:29.540 --> 28:34.940
A field is an entity that takes a value at every point in space.

28:34.940 --> 28:37.860
You're very tempted to say, well, what are the fields made of?

28:37.860 --> 28:39.220
That would be a bad question to ask.

28:39.220 --> 28:42.700
I mean, you're welcome to ask it, but the answer is there isn't anything that the fields

28:42.700 --> 28:43.900
are made of.

28:43.900 --> 28:46.260
The world is going to be made of the fields, okay.

28:46.260 --> 28:50.740
The fields are the bottom layer of reality, according to quantum field theory.

28:50.740 --> 28:52.580
Now quantum field theory might not be the final answer.

28:52.580 --> 28:57.420
I'll leave it in gesture at the very end toward the idea that it's not the final answer.

28:57.420 --> 29:01.780
But according to quantum field theory, the rules are that we start with fields and we

29:01.780 --> 29:04.740
build everything else out of them.

29:04.740 --> 29:10.300
Now that idea that there is a number, a quantity, something like that at every point in spacetime

29:10.300 --> 29:13.980
sounds very similar to the wave function of an electron, right?

29:13.980 --> 29:18.300
And I told you that the wave function of an electron assigns a complex number to every

29:18.300 --> 29:20.060
point in space.

29:20.060 --> 29:24.660
And that number squared will give you the probability of observing the electron there.

29:24.660 --> 29:27.740
But what if you had two electrons, right?

29:27.740 --> 29:32.900
You do know that there is this thing that we talk about in chapter three of the new book

29:32.900 --> 29:34.740
called Entanglement.

29:34.740 --> 29:38.820
And Entanglement says that when you have two electrons, and let's say if you were actually

29:38.820 --> 29:42.140
even better, let's make it more clear because electrons are identical particles and that's

29:42.140 --> 29:46.180
going to get in the way of being correct sometimes here.

29:46.180 --> 29:48.220
Let's say we have an electron and a proton.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.900
So two particles, but very distinguishable.

29:50.900 --> 29:53.420
You know which is the electron, which is the proton.

29:53.420 --> 30:00.300
And call the position that you might observe the electron at x1 and the position you might

30:00.300 --> 30:02.660
observe the proton at x2.

30:02.660 --> 30:05.940
You know if you looked for these particles, whether you found the electron or proton, they're

30:05.940 --> 30:08.380
very different looking particles.

30:08.380 --> 30:14.860
When the phenomenon of entanglement tells you that the combined state of both particles

30:14.860 --> 30:21.700
is not a wave function for the electron and a wave function for the proton, it is a single

30:21.700 --> 30:28.500
wave function for the system that is made of the electron and the proton.

30:28.500 --> 30:31.060
In other words, there is only one wave function.

30:31.060 --> 30:34.500
Ultimately, it will be called the wave function of the universe because it actually includes

30:34.500 --> 30:36.340
the whole universe, not just these two particles.

30:36.340 --> 30:41.260
But for right now, it is a wave function of these two particles and it is a function

30:41.260 --> 30:43.940
of x1 and x2.

30:43.940 --> 30:49.020
For every possible position you could find the electron at and position you can find

30:49.020 --> 30:52.700
the proton at, there will be a complex number.

30:52.700 --> 30:58.140
And you ask the question, where are these two particles simultaneously?

30:58.140 --> 31:02.780
And the wave function tells you a complex number that you square to get the probability

31:02.780 --> 31:05.980
of seeing those two particles at that place.

31:05.980 --> 31:12.100
So this seems like a little detail that might not be very important, but it's actually super

31:12.100 --> 31:18.740
duper crucial here, namely that the wave function doesn't depend on space.

31:18.740 --> 31:22.900
In this case, in the case of the electron and the proton, the wave function depends on two

31:22.900 --> 31:25.100
copies of space.

31:25.100 --> 31:29.460
One copy saying where is the electron, one copy saying where is the proton.

31:29.460 --> 31:33.860
So in a very real sense, even though it sounds like a technicality, the wave function is

31:33.860 --> 31:35.580
not a field.

31:35.580 --> 31:38.740
The wave function of the universe, the wave function of the real world, the wave function

31:38.740 --> 31:43.860
that we care about when we do quantum mechanics is not a field in the same sense that the

31:43.860 --> 31:46.700
electric field or the magnetic field is.

31:46.700 --> 31:50.980
The magnetic field doesn't care how many particles you have, it still has a value at

31:50.980 --> 31:52.880
every point in space.

31:52.880 --> 31:57.220
The wave function of a two particle system doesn't have a unique value at some point

31:57.220 --> 31:59.220
in space.

31:59.220 --> 32:04.580
The thing it depends on is the configuration space of all the particles, and for that matter

32:04.580 --> 32:08.060
as we will see all the fields in the universe.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.780
So it's a different kind of thing.

32:09.780 --> 32:17.780
There is sort of an accidental coincidental resemblance of the wave function of one particle

32:17.780 --> 32:24.020
to a field, but the idea, the conceptual notion of a wave function is a very different kind

32:24.020 --> 32:27.140
of thing than a classical field, okay?

32:27.140 --> 32:31.980
Classical fields really literally honestly are things that have values at each point

32:31.980 --> 32:33.100
in space.

32:33.100 --> 32:38.180
The electric field, the magnetic field, also the gravitational potential field and other

32:38.180 --> 32:40.620
such kinds of fields.

32:40.620 --> 32:44.180
Gravity was always thought to be a little bit trickier even before general relativity

32:44.180 --> 32:49.820
came along, so most of the attention in the early 20th century was being focused on the

32:49.820 --> 32:51.780
electromagnetic field.

32:51.780 --> 32:59.500
So there was this vague idea near the turn of that century that matter was made of particles,

32:59.500 --> 33:05.020
electrons, protons, and we eventually discovered neutrons and other things like that, whereas

33:05.020 --> 33:10.580
forces were being carried by fields because we knew about gravity, we knew about electromagnetism,

33:10.580 --> 33:11.580
etc.

33:11.580 --> 33:17.620
So we thought, roughly speaking, even though it was not completely laid down explicitly,

33:17.620 --> 33:22.380
that the world was going to consist of these two kinds of things, particles and fields,

33:22.380 --> 33:24.900
matter and forces, right?

33:24.900 --> 33:27.860
Matter from the particles, forces from the fields.

33:27.860 --> 33:34.300
And so once quantum mechanics came along in its more robust form in the 1920s, and you

33:34.300 --> 33:40.340
understood the quantum mechanics of particles, it was very, very natural to say, okay, now

33:40.340 --> 33:44.140
we will turn to the quantum mechanics of fields.

33:44.140 --> 33:47.860
And that's what the word of means, this is where we started this digression, understanding

33:47.860 --> 33:49.100
the word of.

33:49.100 --> 33:55.500
The word of means we're starting with a classical theory of something, particles to start, now

33:55.940 --> 33:58.620
fields, and we're going to construct a quantum theory of it.

33:58.620 --> 33:59.740
What does that mean?

33:59.740 --> 34:06.060
It means take the classical theory, take the thing that plays the role of a position for

34:06.060 --> 34:07.340
a particle, right?

34:07.340 --> 34:10.540
For a field, fields don't have a position.

34:10.540 --> 34:11.540
Fields are everywhere.

34:11.540 --> 34:16.180
You can't just say what the position of a field is, but the role of position is basically

34:16.180 --> 34:20.540
played by the value of the field at every point in space.

34:20.540 --> 34:23.900
And then you're saying, well, okay, what's the, what's the role of the momentum or the

34:23.900 --> 34:24.900
velocity?

34:24.900 --> 34:27.060
Well, it is the rate of change.

34:27.060 --> 34:30.700
It's the time derivative of the field at every point in space.

34:30.700 --> 34:34.540
But again, happily, we don't need to think about that too deeply because what happens

34:34.540 --> 34:38.900
when you quantize a particle is you temporarily forget about the momentum and just focus on

34:38.900 --> 34:39.900
position.

34:39.900 --> 34:46.900
When we quantize a field, we're going to start by thinking hard about the space of all possible

34:46.900 --> 34:50.020
profiles of the field.

34:50.020 --> 34:57.160
That is to say at every point in space, we imagine the field has a value and conceptually

34:57.160 --> 35:02.540
we can ask, you know, so what is the space, what is the set of all possible values that

35:02.540 --> 35:05.580
can have it all at once?

35:05.580 --> 35:09.860
So I'm not asking, you know, what is the value at this point X and this point Y and this

35:09.860 --> 35:11.420
point Z, et cetera, et cetera.

35:11.420 --> 35:16.620
I'm saying all throughout space, all at once, the field sort of has a shape, right?

35:16.620 --> 35:21.980
The field has an individual value at every point, so an infinite number of values, one

35:21.980 --> 35:23.720
value at every point.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.800
That is a profile of the field, okay?

35:26.800 --> 35:30.140
That is a possible answer to the question.

35:30.140 --> 35:37.380
If I could imagine measuring the field instantaneously all throughout the universe, what would it

35:37.380 --> 35:38.460
look like?

35:38.460 --> 35:40.820
That is a profile of the field.

35:41.220 --> 35:47.060
That is the idea that plays the analogous role to the position of a single particle.

35:47.060 --> 35:53.500
So you can see that, you know, mathematically, conceptually, this is a little bit more intimidating

35:53.500 --> 35:54.660
than particles.

35:54.660 --> 35:57.860
For a particle, you just had a position, you set a location, here it is, I can give you

35:57.860 --> 36:00.980
three numbers, X, Y, Z, that's where it is.

36:00.980 --> 36:04.980
For the field, you have to tell me what it's doing at every point throughout an infinitely

36:04.980 --> 36:05.980
big universe.

36:05.980 --> 36:08.900
That seems much harder to do.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.060
But fields existed.

36:10.300 --> 36:12.820
So we have to try to deal with them.

36:12.820 --> 36:19.140
In fact, I should also mention that beyond the existence of the electromagnetic field,

36:19.140 --> 36:23.420
there is also the phenomenon of radioactivity, okay?

36:23.420 --> 36:30.140
There was the experimental discovery that particles could turn into other kinds of particles.

36:30.140 --> 36:32.300
Particles could decay and give off particles.

36:32.300 --> 36:34.860
Particles could be created and destroyed, right?

36:34.860 --> 36:36.700
Even at the level of particles.

36:36.700 --> 36:42.300
And the reason why I'm mentioning this is because if you take the Schrodinger equation

36:42.300 --> 36:49.020
for a system of one electron or two electrons or three electrons or whatever, the number

36:49.020 --> 36:52.780
of electrons never changes according to the Schrodinger equation.

36:52.780 --> 36:58.100
If you just do particle quantum mechanics, you're going to be stuck with the same number

36:58.100 --> 37:00.820
of particles that you always had.

37:00.820 --> 37:04.900
You need to sort of generalize it a little bit, give it, you can do this.

37:04.900 --> 37:08.060
You can sort of say, all right, I'm going to imagine ways that the number of particles

37:08.060 --> 37:09.300
can change.

37:09.300 --> 37:15.860
But as we'll see, or as we'll become natural at some point, basically what you're doing

37:15.860 --> 37:18.220
is inventing field theory when you do that.

37:18.220 --> 37:24.060
Field theory is a very natural way of accounting for the fact that the number of particles in

37:24.060 --> 37:26.300
a system can change over time.

37:26.300 --> 37:27.300
Okay, that was just an aside.

37:27.300 --> 37:30.900
I want to get back to the electromagnetic field just for a second.

37:30.900 --> 37:34.220
So we knew about the electromagnetic field.

37:34.220 --> 37:38.100
We knew that we would have to incorporate it into quantum mechanics at some point.

37:38.100 --> 37:41.980
And people tried to do it very early on in the development of quantum mechanics.

37:41.980 --> 37:47.580
People like Paul Dirac, Heisenberg, and others tried to quantize the electromagnetic field.

37:47.580 --> 37:51.860
People like Enrico Fermi wrote down theories where numbers of particles could change using

37:51.860 --> 37:54.420
the idea of fields.

37:54.420 --> 38:00.180
So the question became, what does it mean to take something that is already a field

38:00.180 --> 38:06.900
like the electromagnetic field and to quantize it, to give it a wave function of some sort?

38:06.900 --> 38:11.420
So I can tell you the answer, and it's the correct answer, it's just sort of presented

38:11.420 --> 38:14.420
in a way that doesn't seem very helpful.

38:14.420 --> 38:19.620
To every possible profile of the field, that is to say to every possible configuration

38:19.620 --> 38:24.980
of the field all throughout space, we will attach a number, a complex number.

38:24.980 --> 38:28.500
That is the wave function of the field.

38:28.500 --> 38:32.460
And were we to imagine observing the field everywhere throughout space simultaneously

38:32.460 --> 38:37.900
all at once, we would take that wave function and square it to get the probability we would

38:37.900 --> 38:42.020
observe the field to be in that configuration.

38:42.020 --> 38:46.340
So I hope that that made a little bit of sense, but I also hope that it's a little intimidating

38:46.340 --> 38:50.820
and a little baffling as to how we would actually make any progress at a practical level with

38:50.820 --> 38:51.820
that.

38:51.820 --> 38:56.740
It was relatively easy to handle the idea of a wave function of a particle, but the wave

38:56.740 --> 39:03.700
function of a field just seems like a completely, you know, impossible to wrestle mathematical

39:03.700 --> 39:05.460
beast, right?

39:05.460 --> 39:09.860
To every possible field configuration, we assign a number that just seems impractical

39:09.860 --> 39:11.180
to write it down.

39:11.180 --> 39:14.420
What would that wave function really ever look like?

39:14.420 --> 39:19.380
And indeed, were you to take a quantum field theory class at a university somewhere or

39:19.380 --> 39:24.500
pick up a real quantum field theory textbook, they almost never do this thing that I just

39:24.540 --> 39:28.740
told you, assigning a complex number to every possible field configuration.

39:28.740 --> 39:34.340
That is a perfectly valid way of thinking about quantum field theory, but it's not really

39:34.340 --> 39:36.260
the practical way.

39:36.260 --> 39:40.340
And so that's the reason why I could take a quantum field theory course as a graduate

39:40.340 --> 39:44.860
student and have it remain hidden to me for a long time that really what we were doing

39:44.860 --> 39:49.620
was just quantum mechanics because it's presented in a very different way using very different

39:49.620 --> 39:51.380
mathematical tools.

39:51.380 --> 39:55.940
But I think that it's conceptually easier if we try to stick as close as possible to

39:55.940 --> 40:01.780
the same notion of quantization and converting a classical theory into a quantum theory in

40:01.780 --> 40:06.220
the field context that we usually use in the particle context.

40:06.220 --> 40:12.340
So the continuity of the ideas remains as explicit as it can be.

40:12.340 --> 40:19.140
So what are we supposed to do with the fact that we're imagining profiles of fields stretching

40:19.180 --> 40:24.460
all throughout space and attaching complex numbers to every possible profile, squaring

40:24.460 --> 40:28.700
those complex numbers to get the probability that we would observe the field to look like

40:28.700 --> 40:29.860
that?

40:29.860 --> 40:33.220
The answer is Fourier transforms.

40:33.220 --> 40:34.620
That's honestly the answer.

40:34.620 --> 40:39.140
If you look online, if you look at the web page that I have for quantum fields, you look

40:39.140 --> 40:45.540
at the table of contents that I published there, you will see an appendix.

40:45.660 --> 40:52.420
There's like 12 chapters plus an appendix and the chapters all have punchy titles like

40:52.420 --> 41:00.820
atoms and interactions and effective field theory and matter or whatever.

41:00.820 --> 41:08.060
So there's a lot of basic ideas that are pretty obviously big important ideas.

41:08.060 --> 41:13.460
And then the appendix is Fourier transforms, which seems like a little bit of an ugly duckling

41:13.460 --> 41:14.460
in the collection.

41:14.460 --> 41:18.740
It's like some specific mathy-sounding idea that hopefully I didn't have anything to

41:18.740 --> 41:19.740
do with.

41:19.740 --> 41:24.380
Indeed, I tell the story that when I was an undergraduate myself and I first learned

41:24.380 --> 41:29.660
Fourier transforms, I literally was thinking like this is a quintessential example of a

41:29.660 --> 41:33.540
mathematical technique I will never actually use in real life.

41:33.540 --> 41:37.580
And then you discover once you take quantum field theory as well as other parts of physics

41:37.580 --> 41:42.660
that Fourier transforms are the single most important thing in lots of areas of theoretical

41:42.660 --> 41:43.660
physics.

41:43.660 --> 41:46.060
So that is a Fourier transform.

41:46.060 --> 41:50.380
It's just another way of thinking about the value of a field.

41:50.380 --> 41:54.420
We said the value of field, the profile, the configuration of a field, whatever you want

41:54.420 --> 42:00.060
to call it, is basically a function of space or a function of space time.

42:00.060 --> 42:01.060
Let's just think space.

42:01.060 --> 42:05.540
We don't need to worry about evolution right now, although we will evolve through time

42:05.540 --> 42:06.980
at some point.

42:06.980 --> 42:11.540
So at every point in space, there's a value of the field, that's the field profile.

42:11.540 --> 42:18.420
So to give you the information about what the field profile is, requires in principle

42:18.420 --> 42:20.860
an infinite amount of data, right?

42:20.860 --> 42:25.500
I have to list every point in space, that's an infinite number of points, and at each

42:25.500 --> 42:28.340
point I tell you what the field is doing.

42:28.340 --> 42:34.460
Now realistically for fields that we might care about, maybe there's some simple ways

42:34.460 --> 42:39.100
of compressing all that information into a compact notation or whatever, but in principle

42:39.100 --> 42:41.180
that's what I have to give you.

42:41.180 --> 42:47.300
The idea of a Fourier transform is, I can represent that information in a much more

42:47.300 --> 42:52.820
convenient way, the information about what is the field doing at every point in space.

42:52.820 --> 43:01.380
Think of a simple kind of field configuration, namely a pure wave, a pure sine function

43:01.380 --> 43:07.100
or cosine function, a sinusoidal wave, that is just a fancy wave saying a wave that literally

43:07.100 --> 43:12.460
just goes up and down with an absolutely fixed wavelength and an absolutely fixed amplitude,

43:12.460 --> 43:13.460
okay?

43:13.460 --> 43:18.580
The typical idea of a wave, a plane wave that stretches all throughout space that you might

43:18.580 --> 43:23.340
see in a picture, you know, a very wave-like thing, not complicated ripples and going in

43:23.340 --> 43:29.060
different directions, just a very smooth regular wave stretching all throughout space.

43:29.060 --> 43:35.780
That's an example of a simple wave, a wave that a configuration of the field, waves are

43:35.780 --> 43:40.780
just configurations of fields, by the way, there's almost no difference between the word

43:40.780 --> 43:46.460
wave and the word field, except sadly we have attached the word wave to wave functions which

43:46.460 --> 43:50.460
are different kinds of things, I know, that's very annoying, sorry about that, I wasn't

43:50.460 --> 43:52.100
to blame for that.

43:52.100 --> 43:58.140
Anyway, this particular kind of simple wave, a sinusoidal wave, a wave with a definite wave

43:58.140 --> 44:05.140
length that remains absolutely constant all throughout infinitely big space, that is a

44:05.140 --> 44:10.380
plane wave, it is something we can represent mathematically using sines and cosines, okay,

44:10.380 --> 44:14.200
if you know a little bit about your trigonometry functions.

44:14.200 --> 44:22.220
And we call a wave of a definite wavelength a mode of the field, and of course, most field

44:22.220 --> 44:27.660
configurations aren't going to be that simple, right, they are going to be more unpredictable

44:27.660 --> 44:32.420
as you go from place to place, but we're choosing just for a moment to focus on very,

44:32.420 --> 44:37.720
very simple, very, very regular configurations of the fields, ones that look like absolutely

44:37.720 --> 44:41.520
uniform sine waves all throughout space.

44:41.520 --> 44:49.080
So back in, I don't know, but I think it was the 1800s, Professor Fourier noticed that

44:49.080 --> 44:56.420
if I took different waves, that is to say waves of different wavelengths, right, so waves

44:57.180 --> 45:01.980
of each wave has a definite wavelength, I'm imagining a mode is what we call it, a mode

45:01.980 --> 45:07.540
is a wave of definite wavelength, so I'm imagining different modes, and he says if I add them

45:07.540 --> 45:12.780
together, I can get something that is not a mode, right, because if I add two waves

45:12.780 --> 45:17.420
together with different wavelengths, I will not get a simple sine wave, I'll get something

45:17.420 --> 45:19.340
that looks more complicated than that.

45:19.340 --> 45:24.540
And if I add three or a hundred billion waves together, then I can get things that look

45:24.540 --> 45:27.940
more complicated than just a simple sine wave.

45:27.940 --> 45:31.060
And I don't know what his actual thought process was, it was probably a little bit more systematic

45:31.060 --> 45:38.860
than that, but Fourier asked himself, is it possible that if I add an infinite number

45:38.860 --> 45:44.780
of waves together, I can get any shape of the field I want?

45:44.780 --> 45:48.260
And the answer is yes, otherwise we wouldn't be going through this, right?

45:48.260 --> 45:55.900
The answer is I can express any field I want, any configuration of the field, any increase

45:55.900 --> 46:00.860
and decrease and change in direction of a field all throughout space, you give that

46:00.860 --> 46:09.300
to me, I'm going to express it as a sum of these nice simple modes, modes with a definite

46:09.300 --> 46:12.900
wavelength, I add up different wavelengths together, I get something that doesn't look

46:12.900 --> 46:18.220
like it has a wavelength at all, it's an arbitrary mess, literally any profile of the field,

46:18.220 --> 46:21.940
can be written as a sum of modes.

46:21.940 --> 46:27.700
And the point is, that's the Fourier transform, rather than giving you the information about

46:27.700 --> 46:34.380
what the field value is at every point in space, I give you how much of each mode contributes

46:34.380 --> 46:35.380
to the field.

46:35.380 --> 46:42.140
I guess I should be super-duper careful here, say not only can you take any profile, any

46:42.140 --> 46:47.660
configuration of the field you want and express it as a sum of modes of fixed wavelength,

46:47.660 --> 46:52.820
but that expression is unique, that is to say given a profile, there is one and only

46:52.820 --> 46:58.380
one way of expressing it as a sum of modes of fixed wavelength, that's what the Fourier

46:58.380 --> 47:05.220
transform does, it tells you what that way is, that way of expressing some wildly varying

47:05.220 --> 47:11.100
function as a sum of nice sine waves and cosines, okay?

47:11.100 --> 47:17.020
And the information is now been transformed, the information that used to be at every point

47:17.020 --> 47:22.700
in space, I tell you the value of the field, now the information is, I tell you how much

47:22.700 --> 47:29.540
of a contribution the field gets from each mode, from each sine wave with a definite

47:29.540 --> 47:30.540
wavelength.

47:30.540 --> 47:35.540
You know, some of them, some wavelengths might be very important, so there's a big contribution,

47:35.540 --> 47:39.660
so there's a big number times the sine wave in the sum of all this infinite number of

47:39.660 --> 47:42.300
them, some might not be that important.

47:42.300 --> 47:46.620
And this fact is kind of amazing, you know, this fact is not at all intuitive, right?

47:46.620 --> 47:51.460
You take a bunch of perfectly regular up and down waves, and in principle you can add them

47:51.460 --> 47:56.260
together to get any behavior you want, you might not have guessed that you could do that,

47:56.260 --> 47:58.980
but you can mathematically show that it's true.

47:58.980 --> 48:02.980
So in some sense that's nice, it's cute, right?

48:02.980 --> 48:08.140
It's a mathematical fact, but have we really learned anything useful by doing this?

48:08.140 --> 48:12.540
The Fourier transform is a way of saying I can start with whatever field profile I want,

48:12.540 --> 48:19.060
I can turn it into an infinite sum over waves of different definite wavelengths.

48:19.060 --> 48:26.500
Well, yes, it turns out to be super duper important for the following reasons.

48:26.500 --> 48:33.100
If I think about the energy of a field, okay, the very first thing we're going to think

48:33.100 --> 48:38.580
about when we quantize our fields is think about what energy the field has, and we're

48:38.580 --> 48:41.900
going to look at solutions of definite energy, right?

48:41.900 --> 48:44.860
So what is the essence of the energy of a field?

48:44.860 --> 48:48.660
A particle has two kinds of energy.

48:48.660 --> 48:53.340
It has kinetic energy, so a particle has an energy that depends on its velocity squared,

48:53.340 --> 48:58.140
one half mv squared in terms of the mass and the velocity of the particle, and it might

48:58.140 --> 48:59.900
also have a potential energy.

48:59.900 --> 49:04.500
So if the particle is moving in an electric field or something like that, the value of

49:04.500 --> 49:08.860
the electric field in charge of the particle will contribute to the potential energy of

49:08.860 --> 49:09.860
the field.

49:10.100 --> 49:14.340
Sorry, the potential energy of the particle will get a contribution from the electric

49:14.340 --> 49:15.840
field.

49:15.840 --> 49:19.700
The field itself has three kinds of energy.

49:19.700 --> 49:24.320
It has a kinetic energy, just like a particle does, but it means something different.

49:24.320 --> 49:29.380
We call it a kinetic energy, but it's not the field is moving, it's that at each point

49:29.380 --> 49:31.420
the field is changing its value, okay?

49:31.420 --> 49:33.820
The field has a value at each point.

49:33.820 --> 49:38.740
If that field is just constant, then the kinetic constant with time, then the kinetic

49:38.740 --> 49:42.380
energy of the field is zero at that point, but if it's sort of vibrating up and down,

49:42.380 --> 49:45.660
for example, then it has a non-zero kinetic energy.

49:45.660 --> 49:50.900
A field can also have a potential energy, but it means a slightly different thing, because

49:50.900 --> 49:56.620
for the particle, the potential energy means how it's sort of moving through space and

49:56.620 --> 50:01.580
feeling different values of the electric field or the gravitational field or whatever.

50:01.580 --> 50:05.380
For a field, what we call the potential energy, I know it's very annoying.

50:05.380 --> 50:09.620
We use exactly the same words to mean different things, but mathematically they look the same.

50:09.620 --> 50:12.180
That's why it's useful to look at the equations.

50:12.180 --> 50:17.580
For the field, we think about the field interacting with itself.

50:17.580 --> 50:21.820
So an electron gets a potential energy from interacting with the gravitational field or

50:21.820 --> 50:24.340
the electric field or the magnetic field.

50:24.340 --> 50:28.740
The fields get potential energy from interacting with themselves, and different fields will

50:28.740 --> 50:33.260
interact with themselves in different ways, but all that matters for that is the value

50:33.260 --> 50:34.260
of the field.

50:34.260 --> 50:39.620
The kinetic energy depends on the derivative, the time rate of change of the field, whereas

50:39.620 --> 50:43.060
the potential energy only matters, only depends on the value of the field.

50:43.060 --> 50:47.060
It does not matter how fast things are changing.

50:47.060 --> 50:50.140
And you might guess what the third kind of energy is.

50:50.140 --> 50:53.180
First kind was kinetic, second time was potential.

50:53.180 --> 50:57.220
There's something that is new for fields that doesn't exist for particles, which is the

50:57.220 --> 50:59.740
gradient energy.

50:59.740 --> 51:05.060
The idea is that not only can the value at each point in space of the field change with

51:05.060 --> 51:11.700
time, but as you go to a nearby point in space, there can be differences in the values of

51:11.700 --> 51:12.700
the fields.

51:12.700 --> 51:16.460
The fields can be stretched a little bit or distorted a little bit from point to point.

51:16.460 --> 51:21.900
If the field was exactly constant through space, then there wouldn't be any stretching

51:21.900 --> 51:27.060
or distortion energy, what we call the gradient energy, but usually the field is changing from

51:27.060 --> 51:30.780
place to place that will contribute to the energy of the field.

51:30.780 --> 51:35.420
Indeed, those of you who have read volume one, space, time and motion, know about relativity

51:35.420 --> 51:40.140
and you know that the difference between space and time will change depending on your point

51:40.140 --> 51:45.940
of view and therefore you will not be surprised to learn that for fields, which I didn't say

51:45.940 --> 51:52.820
this explicitly yet, but these fields are deeply embedded in the context of relativity.

51:52.900 --> 51:57.220
There's a relationship between the kinetic energy, the rate of change with respect to

51:57.220 --> 52:01.860
time, and the gradient energy, the rate of change with respect to space, because space

52:01.860 --> 52:04.140
and time are related to each other.

52:04.140 --> 52:11.580
We have three kinds of energy, kinetic energy, gradient energy, potential energy.

52:11.580 --> 52:16.740
To solve the equations for what the field does, you need to know all of these.

52:16.740 --> 52:20.660
You need to know what the field is doing at every point in space because what it's doing

52:20.660 --> 52:26.220
at a nearby point in space will affect what the field does at one point in space.

52:26.220 --> 52:31.940
So at just a simple, very basic, dirty technical level, it's kind of annoying to have these

52:31.940 --> 52:34.940
different kinds of energy floating around.

52:34.940 --> 52:39.700
Now remember the question we're trying to answer here, why do we bother thinking about

52:39.700 --> 52:40.860
Fourier transforms?

52:40.860 --> 52:47.060
Why do we bother thinking about the profile of the field as a sum of plane wave modes

52:47.060 --> 52:51.180
rather than as just values at each individual point in space?

52:51.180 --> 52:53.140
Well think about those energies.

52:53.140 --> 52:57.660
Think about the kinetic energy, the potential energy, the gradient energy.

52:57.660 --> 53:03.300
If you write the field as modes, if you take the Fourier transform, it still has a kinetic

53:03.300 --> 53:04.300
energy.

53:04.300 --> 53:05.300
It's the same kind of thing.

53:05.300 --> 53:10.700
It still has a potential energy, the same kind of thing, but the gradient energy is

53:10.700 --> 53:16.980
a different kind of thing now because by telling you that we're focusing in on one

53:16.980 --> 53:23.820
particular mode, one particular wave with fixed wavelength stretching throughout all

53:23.820 --> 53:29.620
of space, I've told you how the wave changes from place to place because it has a fixed

53:29.620 --> 53:31.220
wavelength, right?

53:31.220 --> 53:32.860
I've given you that information.

53:32.860 --> 53:36.660
I don't need to separately give you that information at every point.

53:36.660 --> 53:44.260
If I'm just looking at one mode of the field, then I have the gradient energy sussed.

53:44.260 --> 53:45.500
I know what it is.

53:45.500 --> 53:49.740
I don't need to give you that extra information over and over again, okay?

53:49.740 --> 53:56.540
So it turns out that when we're solving the equations for the behavior of a field, it's

53:56.540 --> 54:02.460
much easier to write down the solutions if we look at a mode of the field or if we look

54:02.460 --> 54:09.460
at modes of the field one at a time rather than looking at positions in space and values

54:09.460 --> 54:13.340
of the fields at positions in space, okay?

54:13.340 --> 54:16.500
So that may or may not have been a convincing explanation.

54:16.500 --> 54:20.580
In this audio podcast, I cannot show you the equations, but the equations make it super

54:20.580 --> 54:21.580
duper clear.

54:21.580 --> 54:22.580
I promise you.

54:22.580 --> 54:23.860
And it is possible to follow them.

54:23.860 --> 54:25.940
Do not get intimidated by the equations.

54:25.940 --> 54:27.340
It's just an alien language.

54:27.340 --> 54:31.260
You can learn it, and once you learn it, you have a good warm feeling of accomplishment,

54:31.260 --> 54:33.220
so it's worth doing.

54:33.220 --> 54:41.820
So the lesson, the upshot of all this digression is take a particular kind of field configuration,

54:41.820 --> 54:45.260
even with a absolutely fixed wavelength.

54:45.260 --> 54:51.980
I happen to know that I can write any field configuration as a sum of many such things,

54:51.980 --> 54:55.500
but let's keep that in the back of your mind and focus on one of them.

54:55.500 --> 55:00.780
Pick a mode, pick a wave that has a wavelength, a definite, very, very specific frequency

55:00.780 --> 55:04.260
it's vibrating at, ask what it is doing.

55:04.260 --> 55:11.380
So in other words, when I quantize this, instead of assigning a complex number, complex

55:11.380 --> 55:17.500
valued wave function to every field configuration, let me focus in on this one mode of the field

55:17.500 --> 55:23.180
and assign a complex number to every possible value of the mode.

55:23.180 --> 55:24.620
What does it mean value of the mode?

55:24.620 --> 55:28.020
The wavelength is fixed, but the amplitude is not.

55:28.020 --> 55:32.660
So it might be a wave of a certain wavelength that is very gently vibrating, just very slightly

55:32.660 --> 55:35.420
up and down, or it could be vibrating by a lot.

55:35.420 --> 55:41.740
Those are different ways that this mode could be vibrating, and to each different amplitude,

55:41.740 --> 55:46.300
to each different height of the wave that it goes up and down, I will assign a complex

55:46.300 --> 55:47.380
number.

55:47.380 --> 55:52.460
That is the wave function of this particular mode.

55:52.460 --> 55:58.300
And you can kind of see how this would be easier to make sense of.

55:58.300 --> 56:01.100
Modes that are vibrating by a lot, right?

56:01.100 --> 56:04.140
Modes that are, again, the wavelength is fixed.

56:04.140 --> 56:08.220
So through space, we imagine, you know, from point A to point B, it goes up and down with

56:08.220 --> 56:13.380
a certain wavelength, but the amount by which it goes up and down in between where it's

56:13.380 --> 56:19.300
zero, one wavelength away, the amount by which it goes up and down is arbitrary.

56:19.300 --> 56:23.460
And there's more energy when it goes up by a lot than when it goes up by just a little

56:23.460 --> 56:25.100
bit.

56:25.100 --> 56:27.140
And here's where the miracle occurs, okay?

56:27.140 --> 56:29.820
You might have thought this was a little bit dry and technical, and why are we bothering

56:29.820 --> 56:30.820
with this?

56:30.820 --> 56:35.380
But a miracle is about to occur, I promise you.

56:35.380 --> 56:42.820
We're thinking of the wave function of a single mode of a vibrating quantum field.

56:42.820 --> 56:49.180
And the mode itself, that we're assigning a wave function to, is now that we've told

56:49.180 --> 56:55.140
you its wavelength is just characterized by a single number, the height, call it H, okay?

56:55.140 --> 56:58.420
The height of the wave that is vibrating up and down.

56:58.420 --> 57:04.340
So instead of psi of X for a particle being a wave function, we're going to have psi of

57:04.340 --> 57:09.660
H, the wave function of the height of the vibrating mode.

57:09.660 --> 57:15.460
And the exact thing that happened to the electron in the hydrogen atom, where we said the wave

57:15.460 --> 57:18.740
function's going to have to taper off at zero, and you're going to get a set of discrete

57:18.740 --> 57:23.380
solutions on the inside that look like orbitals and explain the different energy levels of

57:23.380 --> 57:29.940
atoms, that exact same thing is going to happen to our mode of the quantum field.

57:29.940 --> 57:36.420
At very, very large height functions, very, very large amplitudes of the wave, shaking

57:36.420 --> 57:41.340
up and down, the wave function is going to have to go to zero, because it can only be

57:41.340 --> 57:45.060
sort of localized in some particular set of values.

57:45.060 --> 57:51.980
And therefore, when we solve the equation, we will get a discrete set of solutions.

57:51.980 --> 57:59.620
A discrete set of possible wave functions for this one mode of this one field.

57:59.620 --> 58:05.460
There will be a lowest energy wave function, and there will be a simple separate next highest

58:05.460 --> 58:09.620
energy wave function, and there will be one higher than that, and there'll be a discrete

58:09.620 --> 58:18.860
tower of wave functions for this one particular wave with one particular wavelength.

58:18.860 --> 58:19.860
Why do you care about that?

58:19.860 --> 58:20.860
Okay.

58:20.860 --> 58:26.700
Maybe you're with me this far, and you say, okay, I've taken my wave, I've decided to

58:26.700 --> 58:32.860
think about my wave as a sum of modes of fixed wavelength, I've focused in on one particular

58:32.860 --> 58:37.700
mode, I have assigned a wave function to it, and I've found that the wave function of that

58:37.700 --> 58:40.220
mode has a discrete set of solutions.

58:40.220 --> 58:43.900
Well, we're going to poke around, and this is something that's going to be hard to,

58:43.900 --> 58:47.980
I can't explain it really over words, but you can check out the book.

58:47.980 --> 58:52.180
But I'm going to tell you some facts, and you can choose to believe me or not.

58:52.180 --> 58:55.900
So look at that lowest energy wave function.

58:55.900 --> 58:56.900
It's lowest energy.

58:56.900 --> 59:00.140
We're going to say it's the vacuum, as we call it, okay?

59:00.140 --> 59:01.740
There's sort of nothing there.

59:01.740 --> 59:06.220
And then there's the next highest energy wave function.

59:06.220 --> 59:07.320
It has an energy.

59:07.320 --> 59:13.300
Let's call it M, the letter M, and it turns out that it's not unique.

59:13.300 --> 59:17.260
The vacuum, the lowest energy mode, the lowest energy wave function is unique.

59:17.260 --> 59:19.140
There's only one such thing.

59:19.140 --> 59:24.340
But there's an infinite collection of next highest energy modes, which basically correspond

59:24.340 --> 59:29.660
to looking at the same kind of behavior, but in different reference frames, with different

59:29.660 --> 59:31.500
velocities, if you like.

59:31.500 --> 59:36.580
And you can calculate the energy of all of these different modes, basically the same,

59:36.580 --> 59:41.300
sorry, of all of these different wave functions, basically the same kind of wave function just

59:41.300 --> 59:44.340
looked at from different reference frames.

59:44.340 --> 59:49.380
And they get more and more energy, the more velocity you have with respect to the rest

59:49.380 --> 59:51.860
frame, okay?

59:51.860 --> 59:57.220
And then you look at the next highest energy wave functions, and if the first one had the

59:57.220 --> 01:00:03.980
lowest energy of 2M, so you have a vacuum state with energy 0, a next highest one with

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:09.540
energy M, or higher, depending on if you have velocity with respect to it, and the one after

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:14.220
that has an energy 2 times M.

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:15.100
So what's going on?

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:20.820
It's going to be one with 3 times M, 4 times M, etc., absolutely uniform growth of energies

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:23.140
of these different particular wave functions.

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:26.620
Well, I'm not going to keep you in suspense much longer.

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:33.700
The vacuum state is what we interpret as a quantum state with no particles.

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:35.460
It's empty space.

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:43.420
That first excited state, as we call it, with energy M, I should say, yeah, I'm sorry,

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:46.300
this is back in my mind, and it certainly will be in your mind if you're reading the

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.620
book, but I didn't say it out loud.

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:54.620
We always, in particle physics, use units where the speed of light is set equal to 1.

01:00:54.620 --> 01:01:00.820
So C, the speed of light equals 1 to me, and so when I say it has energy M, what I really

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:04.620
mean is it has energy MC squared.

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:05.620
What is that?

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.940
Where have we ever heard that before?

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:09.140
The energy of something is MC squared.

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:16.980
Yeah, that is the energy of a single particle with mass M in its rest frame.

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:20.500
If you move to another rest frame, the energy will go up, because it will also have a little

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:24.860
bit of kinetic energy, as well as the rest energy.

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:28.700
What about this wave function that has an energy of 2 times M?

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.900
Well, that's really 2 times MC squared.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:33.580
What is that the energy of?

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:40.580
It's the energy of 2 particles with mass M, and then you have a set of other related

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:44.500
wave functions where the particles are moving with respect to each other, and then you have

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:51.820
a vibrational wave function with energy 3 times MC squared, etc.

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:57.140
And they are all related to each other by exactly the ways that you would expect a set

01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:03.540
of particles and their energies to be related to each other.

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:04.740
That was a lot.

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:09.860
In the book, I go through this super explicitly, and I know that the actual manipulations are

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:16.140
kind of boring and tedious, but the result is so important.

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:20.460
It's one of the most important things, literally, in all of human knowledge, this particular

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:27.220
result, because the result that we got here through talking about Fourier transforms and

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:32.820
thinking about quantum fields in terms of modes, with different wavelengths, and then

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:36.660
the different ways that you could get a wave function for that mode.

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:43.180
The result we got here is saying that when you take a field, which by itself is continuous

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:49.180
and smooth and nothing discreet about it, and you assign a wave function to the field,

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:54.900
which is also by itself continuous and smooth and nothing discreet about it, the solutions

01:02:54.900 --> 01:03:02.220
to the equations, the different kinds of behavior that that wave function of the field can exhibit

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:05.060
come in a discreet set.

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:11.740
They look like particles, and you can go much further than this in explicating the fact that

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.660
they behave like particles.

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:19.420
These are what particles are according to quantum field theory.

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:23.140
According to quantum field theory, the world is not made of particles.

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:25.420
The world is not made of discrete lumps of energy.

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:28.940
The world is made of fields that have wave functions.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:33.060
If you want to, you can just say the world is made of the wave function of the fields.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:36.860
That's a that's a foundations of physics question that we're not going to get into right now.

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:41.300
But the point is, there's nothing discreet or lumpy about what the world is made of.

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:47.300
The discreteness comes in how the world behaves, and it comes because we have quantized our

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:49.220
fields.

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:54.180
This is a slightly more mathematically careful and sophisticated way of saying something you

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:57.620
may have heard me say before in other contexts.

01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:00.980
Particles are vibrations in quantum fields.

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.660
That's what particles are.

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:08.020
When you apply the rules of quantum mechanics to fields, you get a set of solutions that

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:14.100
look like particles in exactly the same way that when you solve the Schrodinger equation

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:20.060
for an electron in an atom, you get a set of discrete orbitals with discrete energies.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:24.860
Or for that matter, when you pluck a guitar string, you get a set of discrete frequencies

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.900
at which it vibrates.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.260
All the discreteness is emergent.

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:33.620
That's where particles come from out of quantum field theory.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.420
And you get literally everything that you expect from particles.

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:41.460
Many different particles will have different energies going in exactly the same way, etc.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.820
Good.

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:44.620
So I hope that was convincing.

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:47.940
I hope that you see a little bit now.

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:51.620
When you start with fields, they can look like particles.

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.780
This means two things.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:05:00.580
It means that putting yourself in the mindset of a physicist in the 1920s when quantum mechanics

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:02.460
was being invented.

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:08.220
One is I can take the electromagnetic field, which I know and love since the time of Maxwell

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:11.620
in the 1800s, and I can quantize it.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.020
I can do all this.

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:17.340
I can treat it in terms of modes, and I can assign wave functions, and I can get lumps

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:23.740
of energy, which I interpret as particles, which we will call photons.

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:25.900
That's what photons are.

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:30.780
The other thing is that these other things we had lying around, the electrons, the protons,

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:38.100
etc., the things we thought of as particles, we can now say, well, maybe those are vibrations

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.140
in quantum fields.

01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:45.940
So secretly, without even trying very hard, we have stumbled on an enormously powerful

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:50.500
unification of different kinds of physics.

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:58.620
In the late 1800s, we might have thought that the universe is made of fields and particles,

01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:03.020
particles being the matter in the universe and fields being the forces.

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:07.700
But now we're getting a glimpse of the idea, thanks to quantum mechanics, that it's actually

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:10.540
all just fields.

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:16.780
And the fields show up, both as big classical fields under the right circumstances and also

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:21.620
as discrete individual particles under other circumstances.

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:27.980
And so one challenge that we're faced with right away is why do electrons and photons

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:31.740
seem to behave so differently from each other?

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:35.660
And the answer basically comes down to symmetry.

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:41.300
The idea of symmetry, as I say in the book, it's very helpful in classical physics, super

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:49.100
helpful in particle-based quantum mechanics, but it becomes absolutely central in quantum

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.100
field theory.

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:54.540
So much so, there's a whole chapter in the book devoted to symmetry where I teach you

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.940
group theory.

01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:59.660
You will learn what SU2 and SU3 and all those things are.

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:03.540
This is one of the chapters that I actually wrote a lot more than appears in the book.

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:08.740
I wrote a lot, and then I'm trying to, even though we're doing the equations, I don't

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.700
want it to be overwhelming.

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:11.700
So I pared it down.

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:15.060
There was a lot that I had put in the original version of the chapter that was a little bit

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:18.660
more than you need to just do quantum field theory.

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:24.940
But the specific symmetries we're talking about right now are spacetime symmetries.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.660
So there's two different kinds of symmetries you can get in quantum field theory.

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:32.980
There are symmetries of spacetime itself.

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.500
There is translation invariance.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.860
It doesn't matter where you do the experiment.

01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:39.260
There's time translation invariance.

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.460
It doesn't matter when you do the experiment.

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:43.460
Rotational invariance.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.460
Boost invariance.

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.020
It doesn't matter how fast you're moving in space.

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:52.100
But then there's also what we call internal symmetries, where you don't change where

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.980
you are or how you're oriented in spacetime.

01:07:54.980 --> 01:08:00.220
You just rotate fields into each other, and both of those are going to be very important.

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:06.100
So for the question at hand right now, the difference between photons and electrons,

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:12.580
one of the differences, comes down to how these fields change when you do a rotation

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:13.580
in space.

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:16.580
We're dealing here with relativistic quantum field theory.

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:19.380
That's sort of implicit when we say quantum field theory.

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:24.460
But it's not necessarily that you need to be relativistic, that you need to be thinking

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:27.740
about relativity when you do field theory.

01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:33.220
Relativity in this case, in this sense, means that everything is relative, including the

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:37.140
velocity of two different objects with respect to each other.

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:40.580
There's no such thing as the velocity of an object.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:44.100
There's just the relative velocity of two different kinds of objects.

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:50.380
Now you can have circumstances where it's appropriate to do non-relativistic field theory.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:53.700
So if you're a condensed matter physicist, so you're not a particle physicist thinking

01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:58.300
about smashing two particles together in otherwise empty space, but you have a chunk

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:04.420
of material here, and maybe there's some vibrational modes of the material, right?

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:09.700
We were talking about modes before, ways that a field can vibrate with a definite wavelength.

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:15.420
Well when you have a crystal or a metal or something like that, there are ways that the

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:20.580
material can vibrate, and you can separate that into modes, and you can quantize them.

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:26.100
And you're basically dealing with a non-relativistic quantum field theory, because there is a rest

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:30.660
frame that is well defined in that case, the rest frame of the material that you're looking

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:31.660
at.

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:32.980
But anyway, we're not doing that.

01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:36.180
We are doing relativistic quantum field theory.

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:39.740
But for this question, we really care about rotations in space.

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:45.180
How do fields change as you rotate in space?

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:50.140
And really we're dealing with the wave function of a field, as we said, and that makes things

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:54.580
a wee bit more complicated, but I'm going to, again, try to distill it down to the basic

01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:56.380
essences.

01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:00.420
Imagine you have some wave function for some field.

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:06.140
In fact, imagine that the state of the field is such that it looks like there's one particle

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:07.140
there.

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:14.020
Remember, we said that there are quantum states of the field, and an arbitrary quantum state

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:19.300
of a field is basically a superposition of different kinds of particles, different numbers

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.580
of particles.

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:25.820
There is a particular wave function in the field that could have representing zero particles,

01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:28.740
and different other ones representing one or two or more.

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:32.140
In general, you could be a superposition of all sorts of different kinds.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.380
That's quantum mechanics for you, right?

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:42.860
That is what let's quantum field theory describe changes between the number of particles, because

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:48.780
a single wave function for a single field implicitly includes zero particle states,

01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:53.220
one particle states, two particle states, and so on upward.

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:57.780
Let's zoom in on a wave function representing a single particle.

01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.460
I want to emphasize this.

01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:05.200
Even though what is really going on is a quantum field, there are certain circumstances in

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:08.460
which it's perfectly sensible to think of a single particle.

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:12.820
That is a kind of excitation of a single quantum field.

01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:13.820
It's not incompatible.

01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:18.060
We're not cheating when we say let's think of one particle within the context of quantum

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.180
field theory.

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:23.220
You can talk about what an electron is doing in the context of quantum field theory.

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:24.220
Let's do that.

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:28.780
Let's talk about a single electron, and let's ask what happens when you rotate your frame

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:33.420
of reference for that wave function of a single electron.

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:36.820
In fact, let's not rotate by like 90 degrees.

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:43.700
Let's rotate all the way around 360 degrees, two pi radians we scientists would say.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:50.180
Well, your naive expectation is that if you just do a whole rotation by 360 degrees, the

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.620
wave function is going to come back to where it started, right?

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:56.380
That's a reflection of the symmetry of rotations.

01:11:56.380 --> 01:12:01.580
But if you think about it a little bit more carefully, there's another possibility.

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:09.220
What if the wave function gets multiplied by minus one when you rotate by 360 degrees?

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:14.260
That's interesting because it leaves all of the predictions unchanged because the predictions

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:20.060
in quantum mechanics, quantum field theory included, come from squaring the wave function.

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.820
Now there's a philosophical question that arises here.

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:26.500
Is it true that all we care about are the observational outcomes or should we care about

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:27.500
other things?

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:28.500
Good.

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.060
Go ahead and contemplate those things.

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:35.300
But for these books, for this book series, we're not dwelling on those philosophical

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:36.300
questions.

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:37.300
We're thinking like hard-nosed physicists.

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:41.220
And the physicists will just say, look, I care about the observations.

01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:47.100
It's just as good if a wave function picks up a minus sign when I rotate by 360 degrees

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:51.380
as it is if it remains completely unchanged.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.980
And this, in fact, there's more subtle things you can say.

01:12:54.980 --> 01:13:00.180
What happens when you do rotate by 180 degrees or by 90 degrees, et cetera?

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:04.620
And long story short, you get all different possible kinds of fields.

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:11.980
Every individual kind of field will give rise to a single kind of particle that has a definite

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:15.380
property when it's rotated in space.

01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:19.940
And the properties might be that the wave function remains the same under 360 degrees

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:22.460
or that it picks up a minus one.

01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:28.540
And that corresponds to what we call the spin of the particle.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:36.780
This fact that the transformation properties of wave functions under rotations is related

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:42.660
to the spin of the particle is the quantum mechanical version of a statement that we

01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:45.980
know in classical physics from Neurter's theorem.

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:53.620
Neurter's theorem says that conserved quantities arise from symmetries of the theory.

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:57.900
And one such symmetry is rotations in classical mechanics and the conserved quantity that

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:02.260
arises from that is angular momentum, of which spin is one kind.

01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:06.780
So the quantum version of this is that the transformation of the wave functions under

01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:10.060
rotations tells us the spin of the particle.

01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:16.780
And basically, again, very long stories being made very short here, the kinds of particles

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:22.580
that arise from fields in such a way that their wave function is unchanged under a rotation

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:30.100
by 360 degrees have spins that are an integer value, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:34.940
Secretly, just like we said the speed of light equal to 1 before, now we're setting Planck's

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:38.060
constant equal to 1.

01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:44.100
Planck's constant h bar is the fundamental unit of quantum mechanics and it turns out

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:46.700
to have the same units as angular momentum.

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:51.260
So the spin of a particle is actually measured in units of h bar.

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:57.300
So we set h bar equal to 1, so rather than saying spin 0, spin h bar, spin 2 h bar, we

01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:59.940
just say spin 0, spin 1, spin 2.

01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:03.820
Those are all different kinds of particles that come back, their wave function comes

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:07.420
back to the same value when you do a 360 degree rotation.

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:13.060
If it picks up a minus 1, then it turns out that the spin is a half integer value.

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:18.500
So it's spin 1 half, spin 3 halves, spin 5 halves, etc.

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:24.660
There's a long mathematically intricate conversation to have about representations of the symmetry

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:27.420
groups of spacetime on quantum fields.

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:34.100
And the mathematical object that tells us, that lets us describe these spin 1 half, 3

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:44.460
half particles are called spinners, S-P-I-N-O-R-S, it's a coinage that comes from tensors which

01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:46.460
are other kinds of objects.

01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:50.900
So spinners are these spin 1 half, spin 3 half fields.

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:53.500
So keep that in mind, okay?

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:57.660
There are kinds of particles like electrons, like neutrinos, like quarks, lots of different

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:04.740
particles that have a wave function that picks up a minus sign when we rotate by 360 degrees.

01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:09.980
Now think about something that is highly analogous to that but different.

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:16.100
Instead of thinking of one particle and what happens when we rotate it by 360 degrees, think

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:21.380
about two particles, in fact think about two identical particles.

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:26.580
As a footnote here, I will mention, you might have heard of this story that John Wheeler

01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:31.860
and Richard Feynman were talking about, why do all electrons have the same mass and the

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:33.020
same charge?

01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:35.340
Maybe because they're all the same electron.

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:39.420
Because an electron going backward in time is kind of like a positron and maybe there's

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:43.540
only one electron that just bounces forever and ever backward and forward in time.

01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:49.820
That is false, it did not work, it was a nice idea and it led Feynman to think about Feynman

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:53.620
diagrams and things like that but it's just a pretty story.

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:58.940
The actual reason why all electrons have the same mass and charge is because they are all

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:03.500
vibrations in the same underlying electron field.

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:08.740
So what that means is that two electrons are absolutely identical to each other and this

01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:13.940
is a technical term in quantum field theory, they are identical particles.

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:19.460
So if I have a state of two electrons and there is a position of one particle of one

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:25.780
electron x1 and the position of the other electron x2, not again, they don't have definite

01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:29.060
positions, they have positions we could observe them to be at.

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:33.740
But there's no difference between x1 and x2, there's a symmetry there, there's no way

01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:39.780
you can say oh it's this electron who I named Alice who was at position x1 and electron

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.140
Bob is at x2.

01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:45.860
All you know is that there's one electron at one position and one electron at the other.

01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:51.780
So we can ask what happens when we take two identical particles, that is to say the wave

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:57.740
function corresponding to a quantum state representing two identical particles and we

01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:59.780
interchange them.

01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:04.540
So we're not rotating, we're not changing our physical coordinate system or anything

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:08.460
like that, we're physically taking these two particles and exchanging one for the other

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:11.480
by moving them through space.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.500
But again, they're identical particles, so you might think well if I exchange one for

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:19.620
the other the wave function doesn't change, but by exactly the same argument the wave

01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:24.820
function could also pick up a minus sign overall and guess what, both possibilities

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:27.740
are realized in the real world.

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:32.540
There are particles who when they get interchanged, identical particles, when they get interchanged

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:38.140
their wave function is unchanged and we call those bosons and there are other particles

01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:44.440
whose wave functions when we interchange them pick up a minus sign and we call those fermions.

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:48.920
And the physical behavior of these kinds of particles is very different.

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:52.100
Think about fermions because that's the really interesting case here.

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:57.300
A fermion set of fermion particles have the property that when you take these two particles

01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:03.300
and you interchange them, then the overall wave function picks up a minus sign.

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:09.460
So what happens if you try to take two fermions and put them in the same exact quantum state?

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:14.420
You could imagine trying to do that, two electrons with exactly the same wave function just overlapping

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:20.780
each other, but then interchanging them doesn't do anything.

01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:24.460
They're literally already in the same state, you didn't do anything to it when you interchange

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:29.900
them, but we have a rule that says the wave function has to pick up a minus sign.

01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:33.620
How is it possible for a wave function to pick up a minus sign when you didn't change

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:34.940
the wave function at all?

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:36.580
And the answer is it's not.

01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:39.420
That wave function would have to be strictly zero.

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:43.900
So these fermions, these particles that pick up a minus sign under interchange of identical

01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:50.300
particles have a property that they cannot be in the same quantum state.

01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:55.340
For any quantum state, there can only be one fermion in it at a time.

01:19:55.340 --> 01:20:00.820
Or more informally, fermions take up space.

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:01.820
Bosons are the opposite.

01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:05.900
Bosons, if you have two identical particles in the same quantum state, that's great because

01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:08.820
when you interchange them, nothing happens, and indeed, if they're already in the same

01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:10.900
quantum state, nothing would happen.

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:14.700
So physically, this corresponds to very different behavior.

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:19.900
The fact that fermions cannot be in the same quantum state is the Pauli exclusion principle,

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:24.660
which Pauli actually meant before we really understood fermions and bosons.

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:27.500
But it's why atoms are interesting.

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:35.100
It's why matter has the shapes and configurations that it does because you can't put electrons

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:39.620
over and over in the same quantum state orbiting an atom.

01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:40.620
Electrons have spins.

01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:42.020
They can be spin up and spin down.

01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:48.100
So in any one spatially definite wave function, you can put two different electrons in there

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:50.900
because their spins can be absolutely aligned.

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:52.660
But then that's all you can do.

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:56.100
Then you got to go into more complicated looking spatial wave functions, and that is the origin

01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:57.740
of all of chemistry.

01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:03.620
So the Pauli exclusion principle, which can be derived in quantum field theory from the

01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:10.180
properties of identical particles that get a minus sign under their interchange, is really,

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:11.620
really super-duper important.

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:16.380
Whereas for bosons, they like to pile up on top of each other.

01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:18.180
They actually prefer it.

01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:24.820
So bosons, like photons, for example, very naturally pile on top of each other, and that's

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:28.740
what gives rise to classical-looking force fields.

01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:33.660
That's why the electric field, the magnetic field, the gravitational field, these are

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:40.940
all fields that we absolutely come into contact with in the ordinary classical macroscopic

01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:41.940
world.

01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:42.940
Why?

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:48.580
Because they are boson excitations that have piled on top of each other by a huge amount

01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:50.060
until they look classical.

01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:51.740
That's perfectly allowed.

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:55.660
Whereas fermions take up space, that's why matter is solid.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:59.300
That's why the table in front of me right now doesn't collapse because the electrons

01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:03.620
have definite shapes, the wave functions of the electrons.

01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:08.460
I won't go into it right now, but one thing I've rant about at a brief period in the

01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:12.340
book is this idea that atoms are mostly empty space.

01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.780
No, they're not.

01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:17.580
Atoms are mostly wave function, and those wave functions take up space, and that fact

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:19.260
is not merely philosophical.

01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:20.620
It's crucially important.

01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:22.580
It's why matter is solid.

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:25.820
Don't listen to people who tell you that atoms are mostly empty space.

01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:30.300
Anyway, you might have noticed, if you hang around in the wrong street corners and know

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:36.020
a little bit about particle physics and quantum field theory, that I defined the fermion-boson

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:41.380
distinction as what happens under the interchange of two particles.

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:48.740
I defined the spin distinction, the distinction between particles of spin 0, 1, 2, etc., versus

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:55.380
particles with spin 1, 1, 3, halves, etc., as what happens under the rotation of a single

01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:57.180
particle.

01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:01.740
You might be confused because you might be remembering that people told you that bosons

01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:07.580
are particles of spin 0, 1, 2, fermions are particles of spin 1, 1, 3, halves, 5, halves,

01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:08.580
etc.

01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:11.020
Why did that connection not get made?

01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:15.220
The answer is that connection exists, but it's not a definition.

01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:17.540
It's a theorem that you can prove.

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:25.500
You can relate using techniques from relativistic quantum field theory, the transformation properties

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:32.740
of a single particle wave function under rotation to the transformation properties of a two-particle

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:38.860
wave function under interchange, and those minus signs that we talked about in both cases

01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:41.140
cancel each other out.

01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:47.460
So there's a theorem, the spin statistics theorem, that says that the particles that

01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:53.620
pick up a minus sign under a 360-degree rotation are exactly identical, are the same as the

01:23:53.660 --> 01:24:00.220
particles who pick up a minus sign under the interchange of two particles in the wave function.

01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:05.740
So therefore you can prove that fermions, which are defined as particles that can't

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:11.420
be in the same quantum state, particles that take up space, must have half integer spins,

01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:18.540
1, 1, 1, 3, halves, etc., electrons are fermions, neutrinos, quarks, etc., bosons, the particles

01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:24.300
whose wave function are unchanged under a rotation are exactly, nope, sorry, I said

01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:29.700
that exactly wrong, didn't I, bosons, the particles whose wave function are unchanged

01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:35.780
under the interchange of two identical particles coincide exactly with those particles who

01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:39.940
pick up whose wave functions are unchanged when you do a 360-degree rotation.

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:41.580
That's the spin statistics theorem.

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:43.460
We didn't just prove it right there.

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:48.520
In fact, there's like controversy in the literature about who really has proven the spin statistics

01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:54.540
theorem, because there's a lot of hand-wavy arguments that kind of sound like a proof,

01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:58.340
but really don't rely on relativistic quantum field theory, and therefore they can't be

01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:03.440
right because the theorem itself actually does rely on relativistic quantum field theory.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:08.220
But what we're trying to do here is give you a feeling for why there is this relationship

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:10.340
between spin and statistics.

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:16.820
The statistics being the question about whether or not the field particle excitations act

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.920
like fermions or bosons.

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:19.920
Okay.

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:26.800
So, that's an example of how you start from this single unified idea.

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:30.800
Everything is fields subject to the rules of quantum mechanics, and you ask yourself,

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:34.160
okay, so what kinds of fields could there be?

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.680
And the answer are, you know, fields whose wave functions change in different ways under

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:42.320
rotations, and you invent bosons and fermions.

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:47.660
Naturally comes out of the combination of relativity with quantum field theory, which

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:49.820
is really quite fun.

01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:56.620
Now of course, the real fun comes when you let these particles, or these fields, interact

01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.380
with each other, okay?

01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:03.340
And that's where you get into Feynman diagrams, and renormalization, and infinity, and effective

01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:05.380
field theory, and the whole bit.

01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:10.060
If you want to know what a virtual particle really is, read the book.

01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:14.120
It's a way of talking about the behavior of quantum fields.

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.960
Virtual particles are not real particles, but they are useful ways of talking about the

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:22.840
behavior of quantum fields when other particles scatter off of each other.

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:30.240
Now, I will confess, when I was thinking about this solo podcast to advertise the book,

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:34.640
I was overwhelmed with the number of things I could possibly talk about.

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.160
And really, the thing that I think is the most important thing that I talk about in

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:42.340
the book is the idea of effective field theory.

01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:47.780
An effective field theory comes from thinking about the fact that when you scatter particles

01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:53.300
off of each other, and you use Feynman diagrams to calculate the likelihood of that scattering

01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:56.980
event happening, very frequently the answer is infinity, right?

01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:59.740
The famous infinities of quantum field theory.

01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:04.180
And Feynman and Schwinger and Tomonaga and others figured out ways to subtract off the

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:07.860
infinities and get finite answers, and it all works very, very well.

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.080
But it was never very satisfying.

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:15.000
So effective field theory is an idea that came along in the 60s and 70s, and is the

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.640
way that modern physicists think, and you were never told this, and this is very frustrating

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:25.280
to me that the popular discussions of quantum field theory never mentioned this central

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:30.360
organizing principle of the field, the effective field theory paradigm.

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:36.640
And basically Ken Wilson said, look, the reason why you get infinities when you scatter these

01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:41.820
particles off of each other is because you're summing up contributions from virtual particles

01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:44.820
with arbitrarily high energies.

01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:48.460
And in quantum field theory, high energy means short wavelength, okay?

01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:49.460
There's a relationship.

01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:51.460
Short of the wavelength, the higher the energy.

01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:54.020
Same thing is true in ordinary light, right?

01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:58.500
A photon with a short wavelength corresponds to a higher energy particle.

01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:02.940
And Wilson says, you don't know what's going on at these short distances and high energies.

01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:04.820
So you should just be honest.

01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:06.840
You should admit you don't know it.

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:13.000
And he figured out a mathematical procedure for putting on a cutoff on your theory and

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.680
saying, here is the energy below which I think I understand physics and above which I don't

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.240
understand physics.

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:26.640
So I can use my quantum field theory knowledge to write down a theory that only is supposed

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:32.440
to apply in those regimes with energies below the cutoff.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.860
That is to say, only in the regime I understand.

01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:42.360
I'm ignoring things that go on at higher energies that I don't understand except for the effects

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.820
that they have on lower energy, longer wavelength particles and fields.

01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:49.620
That's the effective field theory paradigm.

01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:50.620
It works super well.

01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:53.540
It's the most important thing, but I will confess.

01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:56.140
So I did a, you know, I want to give the people what they want.

01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:57.140
You know me.

01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:58.380
I'm here to serve.

01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:04.960
And so I went on to Patreon where I'm the Minescape podcast has a Patreon page with

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:07.160
wonderful supporters.

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:11.880
And so you could be a supporter by the way, patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll.

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:15.320
And I asked, I said, like, what are the things in quantum field theory you most want to hear

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:19.720
about in the solo podcast effective field theory did not get a lot of votes.

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:24.080
I got to say the votes were for, you know, where do particles come from symmetries, things

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.080
like that.

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:26.340
What are you talking about?

01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:31.460
If you want more on the beauty and elegance and power of effective field theory, read the

01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:32.460
book.

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:33.620
I promise you that it is there.

01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:38.740
A lot is hiding at short distances and high energies, but we know how to deal with it.

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:45.740
So giving the people what they want, let's instead turn to the completing this picture

01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:47.820
of what kinds of fields are there.

01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:49.220
I said there are bosons and fermions.

01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:51.500
These are two different kinds of fields.

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:55.080
They're related to the spins of the particles that you get when you look at the quantum

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.080
wave functions.

01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:00.520
Okay, but we know that there's more to it than that.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:07.280
We know that photons and other force carrying particles have special properties.

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.280
They're bosons.

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:12.040
They're spin one bosons, except for the graviton, which is spin two.

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:13.840
But they're a little bit different.

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:14.840
There's something going on there.

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.240
What is going on there?

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:20.160
And the answer is once again, a question of symmetry.

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:25.300
And now it's an internal symmetry question rather than a spacetime symmetry question.

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:30.700
So spacetime symmetry is, like I said, rotations, translations in space, boosts, changing the

01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:32.500
velocity and so forth.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:36.700
But we can also, in quantum field theory, there's a new thing that can happen.

01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:43.940
We have a set of fields, and rather than rotating in space, we simply rotate the fields into

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:46.540
each other at each point in space.

01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:47.540
Okay?

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:52.440
So if we have two fields, phi one and phi two, the Greek letter phi is the simplest thing

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:58.440
that we use for a spin zero scalar bosonic field in quantum field theory.

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:02.040
We always call it phi ever since, I don't know, ever since the day.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:07.240
And so if we have two fields with exactly the same masses and the same interactions,

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:10.720
phi one and phi two, we could transform them into each other.

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:15.160
We could exchange phi one for phi two, or we could even think of phi one and phi two

01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:20.940
as defining a little two-dimensional vector space and rotating them by some arbitrary

01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:23.300
angle into each other.

01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:27.840
And if they're truly identical, if they're truly the same kind of field, we would have

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:30.180
no way of knowing that we had done that rotation.

01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:33.780
It would be a symmetry of the theory.

01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:35.340
That's really what a symmetry is.

01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:40.940
A symmetry is just a way of saying there's something we can do that doesn't matter, that

01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:42.440
has no physical effects.

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:47.900
When we were talking about rotations or spatial translations, we said it doesn't matter how

01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:50.700
you rotate your experiment.

01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:54.380
Time translations say it doesn't matter when you do your experiment.

01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:58.220
Spatial translations say it doesn't matter where you do your experiment.

01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:02.600
Boosts say it doesn't matter how fast you're moving when you do your experiment, right?

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:08.220
So these internal symmetries are saying it doesn't matter how we rotate these fields

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:10.060
into each other.

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:12.600
So naturally, this is something that could happen.

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:13.920
It turns out it does happen.

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:17.320
It's going to happen a lot in quantum field theory.

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:22.360
And so we need to think carefully about the mathematics of these symmetry transformations.

01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:26.720
And so group theory is the mathematical structure for thinking about that.

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:31.120
And we talk in the whole chapter on symmetries a lot about group theory.

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:33.840
But let's simplify it here down to the bare bones.

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:39.360
Let's imagine we have three fields, let's say, three fields that are more or less identical

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.660
to each other, okay?

01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:43.940
But we can rotate them into each other.

01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:48.020
So what is the set of possible ways to rotate three fields into each other?

01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:49.620
It's just like space.

01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:51.340
Like space is three-dimensional.

01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:52.740
We have x, y, and z axes.

01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:54.740
We can rotate those together.

01:32:54.740 --> 01:33:01.340
And the set of all possible transformations in a three-dimensional space, rotating things

01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:06.180
and not doing anything else and not stretching them, just rotating them into each other,

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:08.740
is called SO3.

01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:12.680
It's a special orthogonal group in three dimensions.

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:18.520
If you had eight fields that were identical to each other, but there were eight different

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:24.000
ones, and you could rotate them into each other, you would say they had an SO8 symmetry

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000
and so forth.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.800
It's just a number of fields that matters.

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:35.120
More often in quantum field theory, you will come across the group SU3 or SU2 or SU8 or

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:41.900
whatever, and that change from SO to SU reflects the fact that very often our quantum fields

01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:45.180
are complex valued fields.

01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:50.120
So each field is not a number at each point in space, but a complex number at each point

01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:51.380
in space.

01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:54.580
So this is all to say, don't be intimidated.

01:33:54.580 --> 01:34:01.280
When you hear people say, the standard model of particle physics has a gauge group SU2 cross

01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.720
U1.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:07.780
That's just a way of saying there are three fields that are complex valued that get rotated

01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:09.620
into each other.

01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:13.280
There's a separate set of two fields that are also complex valued that get rotated into

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:14.280
each other.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:15.640
That's SU2.

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:21.980
And then you could have a single complex valued field that can still in some sense rotate

01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:27.540
into itself because a complex valued field has a real part and an imaginary part.

01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:30.820
There is something called the complex plane where we have a complex number.

01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:36.160
We write the real value of the number on the horizontal axis, the imaginary value on the

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:37.160
vertical axis.

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:42.280
Well, you can rotate the complex plane, and that rotation is called U1.

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:49.400
So these are all just fancy ways of talking about rotating fields into each other.

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:50.560
And it doesn't matter.

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:55.760
It doesn't matter what rotation you do, the same physical predictions will be made.

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.560
That's what makes it asymmetry.

01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:03.140
Indeed, this idea of having three fields that we rotate into each other is a very simple

01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:04.140
example.

01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:05.140
They are called quarks.

01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:06.140
Okay.

01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:09.460
You may have heard that quarks come in three colors.

01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:13.580
There are red quarks, green quarks, and blue quarks.

01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:14.860
That's not quite right.

01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:18.180
Like so many things that you've been told.

01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:22.260
You've been told something that is not quite right, but good enough.

01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:24.100
And now you're ready for the real stuff.

01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:29.360
The real stuff is not that there are three different quarks, but there is a three-dimensional

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.160
space of quarks.

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:36.440
So the subtle difference I'm pointing to here is it's not that there are red quarks,

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.280
green quarks, and blue quarks.

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:43.920
There are quarks that every quark, I should say, should be thought of as a combination

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:47.480
of a bit of red, a bit of green, and a bit of blue.

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:48.640
And you can choose.

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:50.320
You can rotate your axes.

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.880
So you define what you mean by red, green, or blue.

01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:54.900
There's no actual reality to it.

01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:56.380
It has nothing to do with the real colors.

01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:57.380
Okay.

01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:00.060
You're not looking at a blue quark and it looks blue or anything like that.

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:01.860
This is just a label.

01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:05.300
R, G, and B are completely equivalent to each other.

01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:09.220
These three-dimensional vector space of quark colors.

01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:14.140
And the real statement is not there are three different colors of quarks, but that quarks,

01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:19.420
every quark field is an element at every point in space of this three-dimensional, three-complex

01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:22.260
dimensional, I should say, vector space.

01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:30.880
There is an SU3 symmetry rotating the red, green, and blue axes into each other.

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:32.200
Three different kinds of quarks.

01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:34.040
We conventionally labeled them by color.

01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:37.280
There's a symmetry where we can rotate them into each other, SU3.

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.280
Very, very nice.

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:42.000
And then we'll talk about in the book what that means, SU3, et cetera, et cetera, how

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000
to implement it.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Great.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.640
So what?

01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:47.200
What difference does that make, really?

01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:52.020
Well, you instantly know there is a conserved quantity, because there is a symmetry.

01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:55.820
In Neurthus Theorem tells you there's always a conserved quantity when there's a symmetry.

01:36:55.820 --> 01:37:00.700
So that's nice, but it isn't quite the punch line.

01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:02.420
The punch line comes from this.

01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:05.720
Let's imagine we have an even better symmetry.

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:11.100
So we have these three fields we can rotate into each other, call that rotation SU3.

01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:12.260
That's nice.

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:18.840
But what if I want to rotate the axes of my red, green, blue space in one way at some

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:23.240
point and in a completely different way at some other point?

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.040
I didn't say that I could do that.

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.040
I'm just asking whether it would be possible.

01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:33.280
So there is something called a global symmetry transformation where we take what we've defined

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:40.000
to be red, green, and blue, and we rotate them everywhere all at once in some particular

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000
way.

01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:45.020
It's a global transformation of what we mean by red, green, and blue.

01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:46.020
That's fine.

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:48.900
No one really is bothered by that.

01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:55.060
But if you want, if you have the aspiration of saying, I would like to separately define

01:37:55.060 --> 01:38:02.260
what I mean by red, green, and blue independently at every point in space, can I do that?

01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:07.740
That would be an enormously bigger symmetry, because I'm separately able to define what

01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:10.980
I mean by red, green, and blue all throughout space.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.760
That's a lot going on.

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:18.880
And the answer is you can do that, but you have to sort of figure, you have to make sure

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:22.120
that you're allowed to, that it's a well-defined thing.

01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:26.240
Because whether we call a quark at any one point in space a quark field, whether we call

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:31.640
it red, green, or blue, or some combination thereof, that's completely arbitrary, right?

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:33.520
That makes no physical difference.

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:39.280
But if we have two different points in space, and we have the same quark field, remember

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.460
the quark field will take values at every point in space.

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:45.540
And let's ask the following question.

01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:50.380
At these two different points in space, does the quark field have the same color?

01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:51.900
Or does it have some different colors?

01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.340
Is it rotated by 90 degrees or whatever?

01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:56.300
That should be a well-defined question, right?

01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:58.780
Is it the same color or a different color?

01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:04.260
Well, if I'm allowed to rotate my axes separately at every point in space, it seems like I can't

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:09.560
answer that question, because I could have some quark field that I am just simply defining

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:15.760
to be red at one point in space by appropriately rotating my little red, green, blue axes.

01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:19.760
And again, these axes are completely imaginary, like not imaginary in the imaginary number

01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:21.280
sense, but conceptual.

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:25.320
They're not axes of literal space, they're in quark space, okay?

01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:29.320
There's three different directions the quark field can be vibrating, the red direction,

01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:31.960
the green direction, the blue direction.

01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:36.340
And likewise, okay, so I have a red quark at one point in space, and I rotate my axes

01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:40.340
so that at some other point in space, it's also a red quark.

01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:41.340
But is that legit?

01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:45.540
I mean, I could have rotated it, so it was a blue quark, and there's a physical difference

01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:46.540
there.

01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:53.340
So what I'm getting at is, if you want to be able to have this mega-symmetry that lets

01:39:53.340 --> 01:40:00.060
you rotate in red, green, blue space independently at every point in space, you also need some

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:02.240
way to compare.

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:06.720
You need some way to answer the question, what is the value, let's put it this way,

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:13.360
how does the value of the color of the quark change as I travel along some path, okay?

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:19.720
I can connect these two points in space with some path, and I can ask how the axes that

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:24.080
define red, green, and blue are changing as I move down the path.

01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:28.440
So I need some information that lets me answer that question.

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:31.220
How do these axes change as I go down the path?

01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:34.940
How does the definition of red, green, and blue change?

01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:39.500
It's not a rigid structure like it would have been if I just had that global symmetry.

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:44.500
Now I'm able to change what I mean by red, green, and blue independently everywhere.

01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:48.540
Something needs to absorb the information of how I did that.

01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:49.540
What would do that?

01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:53.500
What would carry that information about how I defined red, green, and blue at every point

01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:54.700
in space?

01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:57.140
The answer is a field.

01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:58.560
I need another kind of field.

01:40:58.560 --> 01:40:59.880
I already have the quark field.

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.720
In fact, I have this sort of three different kinds of quark field, the red, green, and

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:06.680
blue, three different directions in which the quark can rotate.

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:13.080
But now I need an entirely new kind of field to carry the information that tells me how

01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:18.680
to relate the red, green, and blue axes at different points in space.

01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:20.960
And the mathematicians know how to do this.

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:26.360
This is called a connection field, and the mathematical subject that studies these things

01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:27.820
is called fiber bundles.

01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:31.900
It's a subject within differential geometry.

01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:32.820
You can read all about it.

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:35.540
Again, we're not going to go into all those details.

01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:39.780
But the point, and this is a big point, and it's another one of those miraculous points

01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:46.340
that is very, very important, is that you can do these independent symmetry transformations

01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:51.700
at different points, but only if you introduce a new field that lets you keep track of the

01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:55.700
information relating what's going on at different points.

01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:01.160
So these symmetries that can happen independently at every different point are called gauge

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:06.520
symmetries, or simply local symmetries in contrast with the global symmetries that

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.880
we were talking about.

01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:14.760
To start, gauge symmetries, unlike global symmetries, come along with the new field,

01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:17.400
the gauge field, aka the connection.

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:21.400
Those are the same thing, the gauge field, the connection field, the field that keeps

01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:26.860
track of how your axes are changing from point to point in space, okay?

01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:32.740
It's much like in space time, if you go back to book one of the biggest ideas, in space

01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:37.780
time, just to compare the question, what direction is a vector pointing in?

01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:41.420
You need to be able to parallel transport vectors from one point to another, and you

01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:43.660
need a connection field to be able to do that.

01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:47.180
That connection depends on the metric, in general relativity.

01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:50.300
Here, in gauge theories of particle physics, there's no metric.

01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.400
There just is the connection.

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:55.280
That's a field that shows up as the gauge field.

01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:58.080
And so, what does that field do?

01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.320
What are its dynamics?

01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.320
How does it behave?

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.040
How does it interact with other fields?

01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:03.720
There's a whole bunch of questions.

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:06.920
You're going to read the book, so you're going to know the answer to these questions.

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:14.720
But the punchline is that field, that connection field, you need to implement the gauge symmetry

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:16.640
is the force field.

01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:22.980
It is the electromagnetic field for electromagnetism, or the gravitational field for gravity.

01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:28.740
And it gives rise to particles, photons for electromagnetism, gravitons for gravity.

01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:33.020
And there's also the nuclear forces, the strong and weak nuclear forces.

01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:37.620
Mathematically, they are boson fields, and you can derive that.

01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:43.820
And there are interactions with other fields, the way that the force carrying fields interact

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:49.160
with the non-force carrying fields, the electrons and neutrinos and quarks and so forth, is entirely

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:53.440
determined by the demands of this symmetry, okay?

01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:58.120
Given the fact that you want this symmetry to exist, not only do you need this gauge

01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:02.440
field, but you know how the gauge field interacts with other fields.

01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.840
And you know more than that, the symmetry is super powerful.

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:08.920
This is why physicists sort of start jumping up and down when they talk about symmetry.

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:12.840
They get very excited, because it really is a very powerful concept.

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:19.500
You can derive features of the dynamics of the gauge fields all by itself.

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:23.980
So in particular, there's one very, very important feature that kind of puzzled people for a

01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:24.980
long time.

01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:27.100
Let me back up to just mention.

01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:31.580
The idea of a gauge field was kind of understood by Maxwell.

01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:35.540
He understood that his electric field and magnetic field could be derived from a more

01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:40.020
fundamental single thing that we would now call the gauge field.

01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:47.080
It wasn't until the 1950s that Yang and Mills suggested generalizing this idea of the electromagnetic

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:51.040
gauge field to more complicated gauge fields, SU2, SU3, etc.

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:55.760
And it took a while, it took until the 70s, really, for us to figure out how to make that

01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:57.720
happen, okay?

01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:02.800
But it turns out that that symmetry, this SU2 or SU3 symmetry or whatever it is, has

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:08.120
a very direct implication for the particles that arise from these gauge fields.

01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:13.620
The implication is, the particles have to have zero mass.

01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:17.020
And again, this is something where you will be delighted when you read the book, because

01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:22.740
you will see why that's true, because it comes right out of the equations.

01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:28.780
Given what you mean by mass, mass is a particular kind of potential energy that the fields

01:45:28.780 --> 01:45:34.420
can have, and there's no way to have that kind of potential energy and respect the symmetry

01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:35.420
at the same time.

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:39.800
So there's a direct line from saying, there's a gauge symmetry to saying, and there's a

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.520
massless particle.

01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:45.920
And that's beautiful and lovely, because we have the photon, which is a massless particle.

01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:48.440
We have the graviton, which is a massless particle.

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:52.520
I know we haven't detected gravitons yet, and people get fussy about it, but if you

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:57.920
believe the basic features of general relativity and quantum mechanics, gravitons will exist.

01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:01.040
They're just too weakly interacting to ever be detected.

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:04.800
I would not have any skepticism that they really exist.

01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:11.340
But the problem is that those are the only two massless gauge bosons that we know about,

01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:15.300
the photon and the graviton, right, at least that we knew about back in the day.

01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:20.060
So when we're thinking about this back in the 50s and 60s, people were like, wait a minute,

01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:22.260
this is a problem.

01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:27.140
We would love it if this beautiful mathematical structure of gauge symmetry and the associated

01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:33.460
fields could somehow help us understand not only electromagnetism and gravity, but also

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.440
the nuclear forces.

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:39.440
There are two nuclear forces, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force, not the

01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:42.160
most romantic names I know, but that's what we're stuck with, okay?

01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:44.640
The weak force and the strong force.

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:47.360
Both of them are short-range forces.

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:49.560
That's why you don't notice them in our everyday lives.

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:55.000
In our everyday lives, we really only notice electricity, magnetism, or gravity, as far

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.200
as bosonic force fields are concerned.

01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:04.700
So if Yang and Mills have this idea about gauge symmetries, but gauge symmetries imply

01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:10.180
that the force-carrying particles are massless, and there's this little mathematical trick

01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:15.340
you can do to show that massless particles always give rise to long-range forces, which

01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:18.980
it seems that you can, then we're stuck, right?

01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:22.540
Because the things that we want to explain experimentally are short-range forces and

01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:25.860
it seems like the idea doesn't work.

01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:33.880
Of course, physicists are not as easily dissuaded as that.

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:37.080
They will keep trying, and they should keep trying.

01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:40.920
This is also true for modern theories where we're thinking about the multiverse or string

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:43.000
theory or loop quantum gravity or whatever.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:48.000
You will very often say, okay, if my theory works in a certain way, I predict X, X is

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.840
not true, right?

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:51.080
But you don't give up.

01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:54.800
You say, well, maybe I didn't think hard enough about what my theory really predicts.

01:47:54.820 --> 01:48:00.140
It's absolutely the situation they were in in the 50s and 60s, thinking about gauge symmetries.

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:05.780
The idea was so incredibly attractive, they wanted to make it work, even though it predicted

01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:08.260
massless bosons that were not observed.

01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:09.820
So what is going on?

01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:15.420
Well, it turns out there are several different ways to get rid of these massless bosons,

01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:16.820
and nature uses all of them.

01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:21.500
Well, there's two very, very straightforward ways, and nature uses both of them.

01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:22.940
Let's put it that way.

01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:27.680
So we can think about this in terms of phases of our gauge symmetry.

01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:34.600
Just like water can be in the liquid-solid or gas phase, a gauge field can appear in

01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:35.680
different phases.

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:39.200
Not really depending on temperature, although that's also true, but it really depends on

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:46.400
other fundamental variables, fundamental properties of the underlying physical equations of motion.

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:49.800
So one phase is the so-called Coulomb phase.

01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:54.820
Coulomb's law is just the electromagnetic version of Newton's inverse square law for gravity.

01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:57.660
So you could call it the Newton phase, if you wanted to.

01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:05.220
The Coulomb phase is the phase where the gauge bosons are massless and can easily travel

01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:06.980
throughout the universe.

01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:13.500
Photons and gravitons both qualify for that, and in that case, you have long-range forces

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:18.060
with an inverse square law, and indeed, for both electricity, magnetism, and gravity,

01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:21.440
you have long-range forces with an inverse square law.

01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:27.720
It's fun and amusing to see the fact that Coulomb's law and Newton's law of gravity

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:33.680
are both inverse square laws coming out of an underlying gauge symmetry for the forces

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:36.200
that give rise to them.

01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:40.400
But there are other phases these gauge symmetries can be in.

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:44.200
So one phase happens when you have the symmetry.

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:52.820
You have this gauge symmetry that would and does give rise to gauge bosons, but the symmetry

01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:56.060
is broken spontaneously.

01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:58.220
What does that mean?

01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:02.660
Spontaneous breaking of a symmetry means when the symmetry is broken, not because the fundamental

01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:08.340
deep-down equations of motion violate the symmetry, but because the specific configuration

01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:11.140
of the world violates the symmetry.

01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:19.280
For example, rotations in three-dimensional space are a symmetry of the laws of physics,

01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:22.840
but here on Earth, there's a difference between up and down.

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:28.840
There's an arrow of space in a very, very direct kind of way, and that is not surprising

01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:29.840
to us.

01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:31.760
No one thinks that's because of the fundamental laws of physics.

01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:34.200
Maybe Aristotle did, but now we know better.

01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:36.840
We know it's because we have the Earth underneath our feet.

01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:43.020
The actual configuration of matter is breaking the symmetry between up and down, even though

01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:45.460
the laws of physics do not.

01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:49.980
Now strictly speaking, that's not a great example of what we're calling spontaneous symmetry

01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:56.780
breaking because spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theory happens, again, because

01:50:56.780 --> 01:51:02.180
the configuration of the world breaks the symmetry, but even in the vacuum, that's the

01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:03.340
new thing.

01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:05.020
So the Earth is not the vacuum.

01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:10.360
The Earth is a big pile of energy, pile of matter and particles and so forth, so that

01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:12.000
can break the symmetry.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.400
But what if empty space itself could break a symmetry?

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:19.280
That would be a whole different kind of thing.

01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:24.240
And this was studied, I forget whether it was the 50s or 60s where they started studying

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:29.520
it, but Yoshiro Nambu, my former colleague at the University of Chicago, and Jeffrey

01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:34.720
Goldstone and others, studied how you could break a symmetry.

01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:36.740
And the idea is actually quite simple.

01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:39.740
You have yet another field, right?

01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:40.740
And guess what?

01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:43.740
This is going to grow up into what we now call the Higgs field.

01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:47.780
So the Higgs field is an example of this kind of field, but we'll get there in a second.

01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:53.020
If you have another field, not a fermion, not like a quark or an electron or something

01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:59.700
like that, but a scalar field, a bosonic field that transforms under the symmetry, okay?

01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:04.100
So let's say you have an SU2 symmetry because you kind of do in the weak interactions, which

01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:05.960
is what we're going to get to.

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:07.880
So you have an SU2 symmetry.

01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:14.760
So for this scalar field, you have two directions in which the scalar field can vibrate, and

01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:19.400
there's an SU2 rotation that rotates them into each other, okay?

01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:27.520
But if the value of the field in empty space were zero, then not only would the field's

01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:33.920
plural be invariant under the symmetry, but the configuration of these fields in the vacuum

01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:37.420
would be invariant under this symmetry because the configuration would be centered around

01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:43.260
zero, and if you rotate a plane around the origin, nothing seems to happen.

01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:48.180
But what if in empty space, the field was at a non-zero value?

01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:52.940
What if the energy of the field were lower when it had some non-zero value than when

01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:55.540
it were at zero, when it was at zero?

01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:56.540
You could do that.

01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:58.780
You can easily write down equations that make that happen.

01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:02.740
If you want to look up the details, it's the Mexican hat potential that you might have

01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:10.040
seen under discussions of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and when that happens, the specific

01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:17.280
value that the field takes in empty space is not invariant under the symmetry.

01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:22.680
So the equations are invariant, but the value the field has is not invariant.

01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:26.600
That is what is called spontaneous symmetry breaking because it kind of doesn't matter

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:28.840
what direction the field is pointing in.

01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:35.700
It's pointing in some direction, even in empty space, and so now there's an answer to the

01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:40.620
question when some other thing, like a quark or an electron, vibrates, you can ask the

01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:45.540
question, is it vibrating in the same direction as the scalar field that's breaking the symmetry

01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:47.820
or perpendicularly to it or whatever?

01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:52.780
The symmetry has been broken in a way that it wasn't before, okay?

01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:58.580
Sadly, this has not immediately solved the problems because Goldstone proved a theorem,

01:53:58.580 --> 01:54:03.720
Goldstone's theorem, that says that when you have spontaneous symmetry breaking, you

01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:06.600
will have a new kind of massless particle.

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:10.520
The scalar field will turn into a massless particle, and again, those particles were

01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:15.120
not observed, and so people were still a little flummoxed.

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:20.640
But what they soon realized is that there's a big important difference between the global

01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:25.080
symmetries that we talked about originally, where the symmetry has to be done everywhere

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:30.660
uniformly, versus the gauge symmetries where you have this connection field that keeps track

01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:32.900
of what direction you're pointing in.

01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:38.980
The Goldstone's theorem analysis that predicted the existence of a new kind of massless particle

01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:41.020
was only for global symmetries.

01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:47.180
When you do the same thing for gauge symmetries, you do not get a massless particle.

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:53.260
Not only is the scalar field not giving you an extra massless particle, but your gauge

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:58.720
fields, like the photon or the equivalent of the photon, get heavy.

01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:03.560
They go from being massless to being massive, and in every single quantum field theory textbook

01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:09.840
in the world, what you're told is that the gauge bosons eat the scalar bosons, the Higgs

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:13.920
bosons, and they become massive by doing that.

01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:19.160
So you go from a theory with a lot of massless particles to a theory with no massless particles

01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:23.240
through spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry.

01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:29.460
And that is the origin in the standard model of particle physics of the W and Z bosons.

01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:38.220
You have the Higgs boson, which is a spin-zero boson that is, as we say, charged under the

01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:40.420
SU2 symmetry.

01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:43.300
It rotates under the SU2 symmetry.

01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:47.860
And so do all the other particles of the standard model, the electrons and the quarks, etc.

01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:54.320
But that Higgs boson gets an expectation value that is not zero in empty space, and that

01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:59.640
gives mass to the gauge bosons, which we observe at the end of the day as the W and

01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:02.120
Z bosons, and they are indeed massive.

01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:07.800
And it is because those particles are massive that the force they give rise to is a short-range

01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:10.720
force rather than a long-range force.

01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:16.920
So that is one way that we can have our cake needed to, that we can have massless particles

01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:21.660
because of the gauge symmetry, but they don't appear to us at the end of the day because

01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:26.060
they have gained mass because of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

01:56:26.060 --> 01:56:31.620
There turns out to be a whole other way to hide the massless particles from us, and nature

01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:37.100
takes advantage of that way in the SU3 part of the standard model.

01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:43.100
SU3 is the gauge group, the group of symmetries for the quarks, the red, green and blue quarks,

01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:48.680
the three dimensions of quark space that get rotated into each other by this SU3 symmetry.

01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:55.120
And because those are colors, we call this quantum chromodynamics, or QCD, in analogy

01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:58.600
with QED, coined from Murray-Gelman.

01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:05.480
So QCD is a theory of the gauge symmetry in the associated force that comes from invariance

01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:11.540
under rotations in red, green, blue internal space that the quarks live in.

01:57:11.540 --> 01:57:13.920
And there, there's no spontaneous symmetry breaking.

01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:20.920
The SU3 symmetry is unbroken in empty space, so the gluons, which are the gauge bosons

01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:27.960
of that force, what we call the strong force, are massless.

01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:29.800
Gluons are still massless.

01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:35.640
Why then do they not give rise to a long range one over R squared force?

01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:39.840
The answer is because of the difference between SU3 and U1.

01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:42.980
And again, some details, we're gliding over.

01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:46.620
The buzzwords are abelian versus non-abelian.

01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:50.380
These are different kinds of symmetry groups that you can have.

01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:57.620
And the SU3 symmetry group is just more complicated than the U1 symmetry group.

01:57:57.620 --> 01:58:00.700
Electromagnetism has a very simple symmetry group, U1.

01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:03.340
It's just rotations in a complex plane.

01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:07.700
The SU3 symmetry group has more things going on.

01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:13.040
And at the level of the fields, that has a crucially important implication, namely the

01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:19.240
fields, the gluon fields, interact with each other directly in a way that photons don't

01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:20.800
interact with each other.

01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:24.640
Photons are the particles of the U1 gauge symmetry.

01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:27.880
Gluons are the particles of the SU3 gauge symmetry.

01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:32.240
But photons interact with charged particles like electrons and quarks.

01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:37.360
They don't directly interact with other photons, indirectly they can do because of electrons

01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:39.620
at center, but not directly.

01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:46.940
Whereas the gluons can interact directly with other gluons because gluons also carry color

01:58:46.940 --> 01:58:51.020
in a way that photons do not carry electric charge.

01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:56.980
And what that means is it opens up a possibility that nature, in fact, takes advantage of,

01:58:56.980 --> 01:58:59.740
which is what we call confinement.

01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:05.340
You might think that since the gluons are massless, like electrical fields around an

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:10.640
electron, they should spread out in an inverse square kind of potential.

01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:14.880
But in fact, the gluons keep interacting with each other.

01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:21.560
They acquire energy by their mutual interaction with other gluons, as well as with the quarks.

01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:28.080
And that energy dramatically changes the way that the gluon field arranges itself around

01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:29.320
individual quarks.

01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:31.960
It is not an inverse square law.

01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:39.420
The force between two gluons or between two quarks mediated by gluons grows with distance,

01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:43.300
rather than decreasing with distance as 1 over r squared.

01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:48.380
So if you take two quarks and they're pulled together by gluons, if you try to pull them

01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:53.700
apart, it takes more and more and more energy to get the quarks to pull apart.

01:59:53.700 --> 02:00:00.420
And so much energy that at some point it makes more sense just to make more quarks or a quark-anti-quark

02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:03.160
pair to be a little bit more precise.

02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:08.400
So you just snap the string, if you like, that is connecting the flux tube, as we call

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:11.640
it, that is connecting the two quarks to each other.

02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:15.440
Because of this, you can never see one quark all by itself.

02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:20.360
Every quark is connected to other quarks held together by these gluons.

02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:25.480
And that's why the particles we see are protons, neutrons, mesons, things like that, not the

02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:28.140
individual quarks.

02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:34.840
As I am recording this, and after I wrote my book, there has been an experimental claim

02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:40.640
that we have experimentally detected what are called gluballs, which are particle-like

02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:44.960
excitations made of nothing but gluons, no quarks at all.

02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:47.880
So that's very exciting, it's too bad for me because I said in the book that we haven't

02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:51.360
detected gluballs yet, but apparently we have.

02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:58.120
Anyway, this is why the strong force is short-ranged, not because of spontaneous symmetry breaking,

02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:03.860
but because of confinement, because the gluons interact with each other so strongly that

02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:08.780
you can't separate individual particles from each other, and they completely distort the

02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:16.580
shape of the gluon field away from being a long-range 1 over r squared force.

02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:18.380
So there's a lot going on.

02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:23.580
This is why when you take general relativity as a graduate student in physics, different

02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:25.500
people react differently to different courses.

02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:27.680
But general relativity is beautiful.

02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:33.040
When you take that one semester course, you start from simple geometric postulates, and

02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:38.040
you derive the equation of Einstein, and then you derive all these consequences, black holes

02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:41.680
and everything, and it's so pristine and logical and lovely.

02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:46.440
Then when you take your quantum field theory course, not only is it at least two semesters,

02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:52.640
often three or four semesters of quantum field theory, but it's not beautiful really, not

02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:53.640
in the same way.

02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:54.640
It's a mess.

02:01:54.780 --> 02:01:59.220
There's a lot going on with all these different forces, all these different symmetries, and

02:01:59.220 --> 02:02:01.300
the field itself is just complicated.

02:02:01.300 --> 02:02:06.620
You can easily take quantum field theory courses again and again, hopefully from different

02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:09.720
instructors with different textbooks, and learn more and more every time.

02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:12.820
No one would ever take general relativity more than once if they learned it correctly

02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:13.820
the first time.

02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:17.180
There's so much we didn't even get to talk about.

02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:22.520
Parity violation is very, very important in the standard model of particle physics.

02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:26.460
There are families of particles.

02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:30.260
There are different ways that neutrinos and electrons hook up with each other versus how

02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:34.300
quarks hook up with each other.

02:02:34.300 --> 02:02:40.020
Let me hint at one kind of thing that I haven't been able to tell you about.

02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:49.020
This gauge group of the strong force, SU3, like I said, it's more complex.

02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:54.560
It's not super-duper complex, but it's a little bit more going on there, a little more structure

02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:59.400
than the U1 gauge symmetry of electromagnetism.

02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:01.520
The SU2 is much like SU3.

02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:06.800
They're very similar, but because SU2 is spontaneously broken, it's a different conversation

02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:07.800
that we have about it.

02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:12.640
SU3 is not spontaneously broken, but it's confined.

02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:17.120
One of the things that can happen because SU3 is a slightly different gauge group than

02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:24.900
U1 is that you can have different vacuum configurations of the gauge fields.

02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:25.900
What do I mean by that?

02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:31.340
A vacuum configuration of the fields is a configuration that has zero energy, right?

02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:36.140
But when I say a field configuration, you now know, since you've listened to this podcast,

02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:40.700
you now know that a field configuration is a specific arrangement of the field at every

02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:46.220
point in space, but you also know that there is a symmetry, the gauge symmetry.

02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:52.960
I can rotate what I mean by red, green, and blue of SU3 separately at each point in space.

02:03:52.960 --> 02:04:01.640
So really what I mean by the vacuum configuration of the field is one particular reference configuration

02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:06.240
of the field plus any gauge transformation I want to do on it.

02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:08.180
A gauge transformation is a symmetry.

02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:11.520
It doesn't really change the actual field, right?

02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:12.520
Okay.

02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:17.380
That's just a, it sounds like a mathematical detail that I don't need to think too hard.

02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:21.980
I should just be careful when I say what I mean by a field configuration to say, really

02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:26.700
what I mean is a field configuration up to a possible symmetry transformation that you

02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:28.780
might want to do.

02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:35.860
But it turns out that in SU3, in the strong interactions, there are what we call small

02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:40.180
gauge transformations and large gauge transformations.

02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:41.180
And what does that mean?

02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:42.500
What does small and large mean?

02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:48.880
It means that there is a topology to the possible gauge transformations we can do.

02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:55.800
It's exactly once again, this is an example of an underlying smooth thing, the gauge fields

02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:02.120
of SU3 quantum chromodynamics, but having a discrete set of possible arrangements of

02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:03.520
those fields.

02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:07.680
So it's kind of like wrapping a circle around another circle.

02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:09.760
It's actually very analogous to that.

02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:16.060
If I have one circle, if I think like a topologist now, and I'm going to map a different circle

02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:20.900
to my first circle, I can just take the first circle and I can map it the whole thing to

02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:26.780
a point, or I could wrap it once around the other circle, or I could wrap it once around

02:05:26.780 --> 02:05:30.660
the other way, or I could wrap it twice around, et cetera, right?

02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:35.980
Even though the circles themselves are smooth manifolds, there's a discrete set of ways

02:05:35.980 --> 02:05:38.460
that I can wrap one circle around another one.

02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:42.280
These are called the winding numbers of these different maps.

02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:45.480
Turns out, and again, you don't need to understand this because this is just like hinting at

02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:52.000
some fascinating work that happened in quantum field theory in the course of the 1970s, turns

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:59.520
out that there are topologically non-trivial gauge transformations in SU3 that wrap the

02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:03.080
gauge field around itself and they're associated with a winding number.

02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:07.880
Okay, so once again, you say, all right, there's still all, it's all empty space, just empty

02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:12.820
space and increasingly complicated configurations because they're all equivalent to each other

02:06:12.820 --> 02:06:20.460
under the symmetry transformation, but it turns out the field can dynamically flip from

02:06:20.460 --> 02:06:27.420
one topological configuration to another, and that is not just the vacuum.

02:06:27.420 --> 02:06:32.100
That is, it can sort of pop out of the vacuum for a second as it winds around itself and

02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:35.260
then settle down into a different winding number.

02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:40.160
So you start with empty space, the vacuum, you end with empty space, the vacuum, but

02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:45.800
through some quantum fluctuation called an instanton, you change dynamically the winding

02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:47.640
number of the field.

02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:51.960
And this is all, you know, this is a whole conversation that could only be had because

02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:53.920
we're doing quantum field theory, right?

02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:56.800
Because the fields are what the universe is made of.

02:06:56.800 --> 02:07:00.880
They have these mathematical properties, things can happen.

02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:07.620
And the kicker is that these instantons that are quantum transitions that change the winding

02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:11.940
numbers of the gauge fields have a physical effect.

02:07:11.940 --> 02:07:16.860
They give rise to masses for different mesons in different ways.

02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:22.740
And this is called the ADA problem in QCD that is solved by thinking carefully about the

02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:28.840
structure of the vacuum and the existence of topologically non-trivial gauge transformations.

02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:33.220
All of which, I hope that everything before the last five minutes was completely crystal

02:07:33.220 --> 02:07:36.500
clear and you understood everything, the last five minutes was just to make you sort of

02:07:36.500 --> 02:07:37.500
intrigued.

02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:41.140
There's not enough detail to possibly be completely understandable.

02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:46.340
The point is, there's a lot going on in the standard model of particle physics.

02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:53.340
It is an amazing structure that I didn't even mention, but of course the real punchline

02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:55.500
is it fits the data.

02:07:55.500 --> 02:07:57.780
It fits so much data.

02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:02.920
When we turned on the Large Hadron Collider, of course eventually, we turned it on like

02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:07.160
2006, blew up, fixed it, turned it on in 2008 again.

02:08:07.160 --> 02:08:10.560
By 2012, we discovered the Higgs boson.

02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:14.800
But before we discovered the Higgs boson, we rediscovered the entire rest of the standard

02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:15.800
model.

02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:19.960
All the other particles that had been discovered before, all the different quarks and the W

02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:26.200
and the Z bosons and so forth, the LHC sees them in exactly where they should be doing

02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:29.320
exactly the things they should do.

02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:35.420
There's no more rich and quantitatively accurate theory in the history of physics than the

02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:37.820
standard model of particle physics.

02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:39.660
So it's very messy.

02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:42.620
It's very, it does a little bit of everything.

02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:47.140
It's not like one beautiful principle just continues on as a line that gives you the

02:08:47.140 --> 02:08:48.580
entire theory.

02:08:48.580 --> 02:08:54.020
Many, many ideas come in from seemingly different corners of physics and mathematics, etc.,

02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:58.700
and combine to give us the standard model and it works beautifully.

02:08:58.700 --> 02:09:01.500
It explains all the data that we have so far.

02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:05.340
Good news, bad news situation, of course, for reasons that we get into in other podcast

02:09:05.340 --> 02:09:06.940
conversations.

02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:12.140
And the final thing to say is, and it's probably not the final answer, right?

02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:16.880
I mean, the standard model of particle physics, even if you include gravity, you can include

02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:21.300
gravity in the standard model as long as the gravitational fields are weak.

02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:26.220
And we call that the core theory dubbed by Frank Wilczek.

02:09:26.220 --> 02:09:28.740
But we don't understand a whole bunch of things.

02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:31.020
We don't understand the Big Bang or black holes, right?

02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:35.400
We don't understand conditions where black, where gravity is strong.

02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:37.060
We don't know what the dark matter is.

02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:42.180
That's some other kind of energy that is apparently not there in the standard model.

02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:46.340
And there's things about the standard model that are just puzzling.

02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:50.300
There's both sort of mildly puzzling things and deeply puzzling things.

02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:53.780
There are numerical unnatural numbers, right?

02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:58.140
The cosmological constant, of course, is a famous unnatural number.

02:09:58.140 --> 02:10:02.540
The mass of the Higgs boson, even though we can measure it, et cetera, it's very different

02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:07.060
from what we would expect it to be, according to the logic of effective field theory that

02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:08.380
we mentioned earlier.

02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:12.260
So these are apparent fine tunings in the standard model.

02:10:12.260 --> 02:10:15.620
There's also the fact that that you won part of the standard model, right?

02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:19.300
The standard model is SU3 cross U2 cross U1.

02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:22.580
The SU3 symmetry is quantum chromodynamics.

02:10:22.580 --> 02:10:28.820
The SU2 and U1 parts are the electroweak unified theory, the theory that gives us both electromagnetism

02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:30.460
and the weak force.

02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:35.220
But the U1 part is really not well behaved at high energies.

02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:39.060
There's something called a Landau pole that we're not going to get into here.

02:10:39.060 --> 02:10:45.060
But the U1 part of the standard model apparently doesn't make sense at arbitrarily high energy

02:10:45.060 --> 02:10:46.060
scales.

02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:47.060
It shouldn't.

02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:50.380
This doesn't bother people because gravity is going to be important at ultra-high energy

02:10:50.380 --> 02:10:51.380
scales.

02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:55.580
At low energies where you and I live, gravity is a very weak force, but at high energies

02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:57.580
it should become important.

02:10:57.580 --> 02:10:59.580
So there are gaps.

02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:03.420
There are things the standard model is not up to the task of accounting for, even if they're

02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:07.300
mostly kind of conceptual things rather than experimental things.

02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:13.820
So not only the standard model itself, but probably even quantum field theory as an overall

02:11:13.820 --> 02:11:21.460
picture is probably not up to the task of being the final complete theory of everything

02:11:21.460 --> 02:11:22.820
in physics.

02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:27.260
So the reason why I've been wanting to write this book for 20 years, and I'm very excited

02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:33.140
to finally have done it, is both to impress upon you how wonderful quantum field theory

02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:38.340
is, how amazing it is that it fits all the data in so many intricate and weird and fun

02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:44.340
ways, but also to prepare you for the fact that we might do better someday, whether it's

02:11:44.340 --> 02:11:48.460
emergent spacetime or string theory or whatever it happens to be.

02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:49.700
Physics isn't done yet.

02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:50.700
We're still moving on.

02:11:50.700 --> 02:11:52.660
We understand a lot.

02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:54.540
We don't understand everything.

02:11:54.540 --> 02:11:59.940
We have to accept and celebrate both of those features of our knowledge and try to increase

02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:01.780
the amount that we understand.

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:03.300
Let's get back to work then.

02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:03.700
Thanks.
