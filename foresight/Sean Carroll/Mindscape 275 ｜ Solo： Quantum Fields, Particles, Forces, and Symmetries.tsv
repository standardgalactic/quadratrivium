0	4280	Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast, I'm your host Sean Carroll.
4280	9200	And we're very excited these days here at Mindscape World International Headquarters
9200	11720	for Book Publication Week.
11720	17240	As some of you know, on Tuesday, I guess May 14th, here in the United States anyway, we're
17240	21040	going to have the publication of Quanta and Fields.
21040	25000	This is Volume 2 in the Biggest Ideas in the Universe series.
25000	31440	The series will be a three-part series that aims to explain modern physics, the part of
31440	33080	modern physics that we know.
33080	36120	Not the speculative stuff, we're not going to be talking about the multiverse or quantum
36120	37960	gravity or anything like that.
37960	44560	The kinds that ideas in modern physics that we think will last for a very, very long time.
44560	49720	And the gimmick is, we're explaining them in a way that involves the equations.
49720	52080	So we're going to show you the equations.
52080	55800	And that means it's not for everybody, but it's very much for some people.
55800	59360	If you've ever read descriptions of physics where you thought that there was something
59360	64080	going on, but there's a bunch of metaphors and stories and analogies and you weren't
64080	69240	quite sure why things were working out the way they were working out, these are the books
69240	70240	for you.
70240	76280	In the Biggest Ideas, you'll really get to see why, for example, the Higgs mechanism
76280	80120	gives mass to particles and things like that.
80120	83120	You don't need to just wave your hands in any way.
83120	86800	And the general theme of the book is quanta and fields.
86800	92120	That's the name of the book, as opposed to the first volume called space, time and motion,
92120	94360	which was really classical physics.
94360	96040	This book is about quantum physics.
96040	102200	The third book on complexity and emergence, both is a collection of the things that didn't
102200	107360	fit into the first two books, but also is about larger scale things, right?
107360	110800	Biggest dynamics, complex systems, stuff like that.
110800	116920	And it's kind of a appetizer, main course dessert kind of thing.
116920	123240	This book, volume two, quanta and fields is a book I've been wanting to write for decades.
123240	128200	This is a book that I really have thought for a very long time would be super duper
128200	133840	useful for a lot of people, because quantum field theory in particular is a part of modern
133840	140880	physics that is absolutely central and gets very, very little air time in popular discussions.
140880	143400	We talk about quantum mechanics a lot.
143400	148080	We talk about entanglement and the measurement problem and all these weird things, bell inequalities
148080	149480	and so forth.
149480	154080	And then we skip to speculative stuff about string theory or quantum gravity or the multiverse
154080	155760	or inflation.
155760	161280	But the actual physicists doing their jobs are thinking about quantum field theory all
161360	162360	the time.
162360	167080	And you rarely get a very full discussion of that in popular media.
167080	171840	We recently did talk to Matt Strassler, who wrote a wonderful book Waves in an Impossible
171840	178240	Sea that talks about quantum field theory, but it is the opposite level of mathematical
178240	179240	explicitness.
179240	184680	It's all about trying to explain in words as carefully as you can how quantum fields
184680	189920	work, whereas quanta and fields, the book that I've written, is a short action packed
189920	195000	introduction to both quantum mechanics and to its specific implementation in the context
195000	199040	of field theory, which is where modern physics lives.
199040	200600	That's what we're really thinking about.
200600	208080	So we need to understand why in the world you could take a field, quantize it and have
208080	209760	it look like particles.
209760	213840	That's the big mystery of quantum field theory, but that one, you know, historically was figured
213840	217760	out relatively early on and it opens the floodgates.
217800	222880	Once you understand that, once you understand that you can quantize fields and get particles
222880	228200	out of them without putting particles in explicitly, there's a whole bunch of things that can
228200	233480	happen, ways that fields can interact with each other and influence each other that leads
233480	237840	to interactions that we measure with Feynman diagrams.
237840	241360	I should say that we predict using Feynman diagrams, that we measure in experiments,
241360	247200	of course, all sorts of conceptual questions with infinities and renormalization, but also
247240	252440	new phenomena that can happen like gauge symmetries giving rise to forces, breaking those symmetries
252440	259640	with the Higgs mechanism, confining things inside nucleons and violating parody conservation
259640	260640	and things like that.
260640	266120	So it's a whole wonderful zoo of things that we've spent the whole 20th century and beyond
266120	267280	trying to understand.
267280	270440	So there's a lot to discuss in a short solo podcast.
270440	271680	I'm not going to cover it all.
271680	273200	Sorry about that.
273200	274200	You can read the book.
274200	276880	I did do the audio book version of the book.
276880	279400	It's about 10 hours of me talking.
279400	283440	If you don't get enough from the podcast, you can download that and I just read the
283440	288600	book and I try to explain what's in the pictures and the equations and everything like that.
288600	290160	So here I'm just going to hit some highlights.
290160	295720	I really do want to focus on that idea of why quantum fields, how you get particles out
295720	298520	of that and the door that it opens to other things.
298520	302200	So we'll be very explicit about where the particles come from, be a little bit more
302240	309080	hand wavy and gestural about where all these other symmetries and how they get involved.
309080	310080	But it's important stuff.
310080	314400	It'll give you, I think, a feeling for the kind of thing that we're going to be talking
314400	317880	about in the book if you are so inclined to go more deeply.
317880	319080	So with that, let's go.
333200	339600	I think it's useful to get one thing straight right away.
339600	345720	Sometimes you will hear quantum mechanics came first and then we invented quantum field
345720	347120	theory.
347120	350960	It's fine to say that because these are words that we make up definitions of, right?
350960	353760	You know, you're always allowed to define the words however you want.
353760	357680	It's not the best way of thinking about things.
357680	364160	Quantum mechanics is a broad framework that includes quantum field theory as part of it.
364160	369800	It is literally the quantum theory of fields, quantum mechanics applied to fields.
369800	370800	That's what it is.
370800	375520	And it's a very simple statement, obviously, but I remember literally taking quantum field
375520	381360	theory in graduate school and it took me a while to figure out, you know, oh, it's just
381360	382360	quantum mechanics.
382360	387200	It's the same quantum mechanics we had before just applied to a different system.
387200	390080	It's a subset of quantum mechanics.
390080	396840	The thing that we usually call quantum mechanics is the quantum mechanics of particles and
396840	400560	quantum field theory is the quantum mechanics of fields.
400560	405280	So the very first thing we need to understand to wrap our brains around the idea of quantum
405280	408480	field theory is the word of.
408480	414000	Now this is in some sort of Bill Clinton-esque parsing of language at a very deep level.
414000	417800	We're really trying to understand, you know, what do you mean when you say you have a quantum
417800	425040	theory of some thing like particles or fields or for that matter, strings or loops or whatever.
425040	430040	What does it mean to have a quantum theory theory of some thing?
430040	435480	And the answer to that is that when we do quantum mechanics, whether it's particles or fields
435480	443400	or whatever, the usual way we start, not always, but usually we start with a classical theory
443400	445240	and then we have a cookbook.
445240	451760	We have a set of procedures for converting a classical theory into a quantum theory.
451760	458200	We call this quantization, surprisingly enough, and there's a lot hidden in that word quantization
458200	460320	or to quantize.
460320	465240	We don't really have a well-defined map from the space of all classical theories to quantum
465240	466240	theories.
466240	473280	So think of it as a way to find quantum mechanical theories starting from a classical theory.
474160	476480	And usually we start from particles.
476480	482840	That's what we do when we first learn quantum mechanics, and it makes sense when we developed
482840	487960	quantum mechanics in the early 1900s, people were more focused on the particles.
487960	492000	The fields were always there, they were thinking about them, but they wanted to get the particles
492000	493600	right first.
493600	499400	So when you say you have a classical theory of something, you know the vague idea of classical
499520	505120	physics, a la Isaac Newton, you have some particles and they have positions and they
505120	506480	have velocities.
506480	510280	Or equally well, if the mass of the particle is a fixed number, you can talk about the
510280	512560	momentum of the particle.
512560	514600	Momentum is just mass times velocity.
514600	520800	For technical reasons that Professor Hamilton figured out, it's actually better to think
520800	523520	about momentum than velocity, but it really doesn't matter.
523520	525680	They're completely convertible back and forth.
525680	530080	And the point is that for any one particle, once you know those two things, position and
530080	533560	momentum, you can figure out what's going to happen to it, right?
533560	538360	You can plug into Newton's laws of motion or Hamilton's equations or Lagrange's equations.
538360	544000	There's many different mathematically equivalent ways to do classical physics.
544000	549680	These are all explained in volume one of the biggest ideas, space, time and motion.
549680	554680	And the thing that is the same in all of these different ways of thinking about classical
554680	559560	physics is the amount of information you need to say what's going to happen next.
559560	564480	If you were Laplace's demon, if you were able to predict exactly what was implied by
564480	569800	the laws of physics, the data you'd need to be given is the position and momentum of
569800	571480	all the particles.
571480	572960	And then it's deterministic, right?
572960	576560	The wonderful thing about classical mechanics is it says what's going to happen.
576560	578480	It's not ambiguous about it.
578480	583440	So quantum mechanics says, okay, think about this one particle just to start.
583440	585200	We have position and momentum.
585200	586200	Throw away the momentum.
586200	589320	Forget about the momentum just for a minute, okay?
589320	596480	And quantum mechanics says instead of having a position, we now describe the particle by
596480	600400	having a wave function psi of x.
600400	605480	If x were the position, psi, the Greek letter psi is the wave function which assigns a number
605480	608520	to every possible position.
608520	609520	That's the wave function.
609520	614280	Usually that number will be zero or very, very close to zero, almost everywhere.
614280	619080	And then in some little blob-like region of space, that number will not be zero.
619080	620080	That's the wave function.
620080	626000	For any possible place you might see the particle were you to look for it, there's going to
626000	628760	be a number, a complex number in particular.
628760	634520	And what the wave function tells you is the probability of observing the particle to have
634520	635800	that position.
635800	640120	So in particular, you calculate the probability by squaring the wave function.
640120	644560	Or since it's a complex number, you take the modulus squared of the wave function.
644560	650640	And in the new book, Quantum and Fields, we go through quantum mechanics really quickly.
650640	652520	First three chapters, we do it.
652520	656640	Wave functions, measurement, entanglement, and then we're moving on and devoting most
656640	662320	of the book to quantum field theory because that's a very rich and very complicated set
662320	664080	of ideas.
664200	667840	So where did momentum go is one obvious question.
667840	674320	And the answer is, you know, when I said that the wave function varies with space, how fast
674320	675320	is varying?
675320	679800	How fast the wave function is wiggling up and down basically tells you the momentum.
679800	686080	Or more accurately, you can turn it into a prediction for measuring the momentum to
686080	691760	have any particular value in exactly the same way wave function squared kind of procedure.
691760	695800	So the point is, the thing I don't want to get lost, the thing you need to understand
695800	700960	for the rest of the discussion is, when you go from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics,
700960	707280	you start with some object with a definite state, position and momentum, and you switch
707280	712280	to a wave function that will tell you the probability of getting different observational
712280	713480	outcomes.
713480	719480	That's the evolution or the transformation from a classical theory to a quantum theory.
719480	723360	And in that case, we were talking about particles, and it's natural to talk about particles because
723360	727280	if you think about the development of quantum mechanics, what were they thinking about?
727280	735840	We often attribute the birth of quantum mechanics to Planck and Einstein in 1900, Planck understood
735840	741800	black body radiation in terms of chunks of energy being given off by vibrating electrons
741800	742800	and atoms.
742800	748200	In 1905, Einstein really said, you know, all electromagnetic radiation can be thought of
748200	753480	as coming out in these particle-like quanta, which we now call photons.
753480	759280	But subsequent to that, the work by people like Niels Bohr and Louis de Broglie and Werner
759280	766200	Heisenberg, etc., was more focused on particles, in particular on the electrons orbiting atoms.
766200	772400	So they were trying to understand the structure of atoms, how atoms would give off radiation,
772400	773400	things like that.
773400	776880	So it was the particles that were really front and center.
776880	781720	And then therefore, it makes sense, when you're an undergraduate physics student, you learn
781720	783720	about the quantum mechanics of particles.
783720	791080	I should say, vis-a-vis the book that is coming out, the reason why I can pack a whole discussion
791080	795720	of both quantum mechanics and quantum field theory into a relatively short book, even
795720	800600	though I do include all the equations, is because you're not trying to solve the equations.
800600	804840	You're not going to come out of reading this book, being able to calculate the scattering
804840	809520	probability of two particles or the decay rate of the Higgs boson or anything like that.
809520	813560	You will understand what those words mean, and you will have an idea what the equations
813560	819080	are behind them, but I'm not training you to be a practicing physicist.
819080	823120	And that philosophy is remarkably liberating.
823120	831440	So just to be super clear here, a very small percentage of people who get bachelor's degrees
831440	835000	in physics ever learn quantum field theory.
835000	841520	In fact, plenty of people get PhDs in physics without ever learning quantum field theory.
841520	845880	Just like in volume one, we did Einstein's equation for general relativity, that's still
845880	851400	a classical theory, Einstein's theory of gravity, many, many people get a physics education
851400	854160	and do not learn general relativity.
854160	859200	So part of the reason why I'm writing these books is because I want more people to be
859200	864640	able to grasp these ideas, even physics majors, plenty of physics majors don't get to learn
864640	866520	about these things.
866520	868560	And they're not that inaccessible, honestly.
868560	870040	You can learn them, I promise.
870040	873680	You'll get a feeling for here in the podcast.
873680	880480	So I'm going to keep referring back to what we study as physics students, even though
880480	885280	I don't expect you to grow up to be necessarily a physics student or a working physicist.
885280	886280	That's the idea.
886280	891040	Okay, so the first thing we would learn if we were an undergraduate sometime in your
891040	897480	sophomore year or your junior year maybe, sometimes the universities will split it up.
897480	901600	So you'll sort of get like a little hint even in your very first year about quantum mechanics
901600	907440	and you'll do it seriously later on in your junior or sophomore years.
907440	911400	And you'll be mostly taught the quantum theory of particles.
911400	916120	So you're imagining that the system you're studying is an electron or something like
916120	919400	that, okay, orbiting in an atom.
919400	924320	And you have this wave function and you have an equation that tells you how the wave function
924320	926720	behaves and that's the short of your equation.
926720	930520	There's different, again, mathematically equivalent ways of thinking about it, but that's the
930520	931960	basic idea.
931960	937200	And from that you can predict things like the spectrum of radiation being absorbed or
937200	938960	emitted from the atoms.
939000	945640	So the general idea is, as we said, start with particles, make wave functions, and then
945640	948760	give you a set of rules for how the wave functions behave.
948760	953440	They evolve according to the Schrodinger equation when you're not measuring them.
953440	958920	When you are measuring them, they collapse and you get a probability of observing something.
958920	961800	Then you discovered that there's this thing called entanglement.
961800	968000	To be very honest, you could possibly take an entire one semester intro to quantum course
968040	970800	as an undergraduate and never hear about entanglement.
970800	974760	I know that's weird because if you hear the popular level discussions, they'll talk about
974760	976560	entanglement all the time.
976560	982120	But you can easily spend a semester just solving the Schrodinger equation for different kinds
982120	985560	of potential energies that the electron could be moving in.
985560	990280	So let me tell you, taking that undergraduate course is not necessarily as sexy as you might
990280	995000	imagine that it is if you just heard popular level discussions of quantum mechanics.
995000	998560	In all this stuff you learn about the particles, about the wave functions, about the Schrodinger
998560	1005960	equation, it gives you a wonderfully precise, quantitative, and experimentally testable
1005960	1011320	understanding of what happens in atoms, of the ways that there are different energy levels,
1011320	1015000	different orbitals, and so forth, and how they show up experimentally.
1015000	1019240	And let me emphasize that bit about different energy levels, because this is absolutely
1019280	1025240	crucial to the essence of quantum mechanics in a way that I think is misunderstood by
1025240	1028960	a lot of people who don't study it professionally.
1028960	1035400	Which is the word quantum is a little bit misleading, I would say.
1035400	1036760	What does quantum mean?
1036760	1039320	Before you knew about quantum mechanics, the word quantum was still around.
1039320	1044320	It meant a discrete amount of something, one chunk of something, right?
1044320	1052560	The idea of a quantum, or many quanta, would be the plural, is rather than having a smooth
1052560	1058080	distribution of things, you have individual pieces, discrete elements, those are the quanta.
1058080	1063320	So particulate, particle-like, pixelated, or whatever you want to call it, that's the
1063320	1067720	sort of philosophy behind the word, quanta, or quantum.
1067720	1074800	And calling this theory that we're discussing, quantum mechanics, or quantum field theory,
1074800	1083040	makes you think, informally, that maybe the world is divided up into chunks, right?
1083040	1088160	Into pieces, into discrete bits, that the world is not fundamentally smooth, but rather
1088160	1090920	fundamentally discrete.
1090920	1096560	Maybe this inspires you to think that once you include gravity in the game, space, and
1096600	1102880	maybe space-time will be divided up into chunks, into a little lattice, little pixels, or something
1102880	1103880	like that.
1103880	1109680	This is a fundamental, deep, terrible, awful, no-good understanding of what quantum mechanics
1109680	1111800	actually says.
1111800	1116480	Because if you think about what I just said, if we take the idea of a particle, replace
1116480	1122200	it by the idea of a wave function, and that wave function obeys the Schrodinger equation,
1122200	1126800	nowhere there is the idea of chunks of anything.
1126800	1132920	Nowhere there is the idea that the world is broken up into discrete bits of matter or
1132920	1133920	energy.
1133920	1136680	It's as smooth as it could possibly be.
1136680	1138000	Everything is continuous and smooth.
1138000	1141400	The wave function is a function that spreads out all over the place.
1141400	1145400	The Schrodinger equation smoothly evolves that wave function, right?
1145400	1149400	Where does this idea of quanta come from?
1149400	1156400	And the answer is that, well, it's exactly analogous to the very well-known analogy that
1157720	1160440	we use of plucking a guitar string.
1160440	1164760	So if you have a guitar string that is tied down at two ends and you pluck it, there's
1164760	1171440	a fundamental wavelength at which it vibrates, which leads to a fundamental frequency of sound
1171440	1172800	being given off.
1172800	1175640	But there are also harmonics, right?
1175640	1179440	If you imagine, if you can visualize in your head, I know this is an audio podcast, but
1179440	1185800	visualize in your head a string being held down at both ends and vibrating sort of uniformly
1185800	1188680	smoothly up and down, except at the ends.
1188680	1192840	So in the middle, it's vibrating up and down, tied down at the ends, so the amplitude of
1192840	1197880	the vibration kind of goes down to zero at both ends where it's tied down.
1197880	1201480	That is the fundamental frequency at which it's vibrating.
1201480	1207960	And then the first harmonic frequency is, it looks kind of like an up and down wave-like
1207960	1208960	shape.
1208960	1213520	So it starts at one tied down end, goes up halfway through the string, it comes back
1213520	1217800	down to zero again, and in the other half of the string, it's going down on the right
1217800	1221520	hand side where, as it was going up on the left hand side.
1221520	1225360	And so the wavelength is half of what it was.
1225360	1228360	And therefore, the frequency is twice what it was.
1228360	1233480	And these are two different things that can happen to the same string.
1233480	1238040	And then, of course, you have even higher harmonics, where the wave goes up, down, up
1238040	1246040	again, and all the way up for higher and higher frequencies, shorter and shorter wavelengths.
1246040	1250040	The reason why I'm talking about this guitar string analogy, and if you're a talented
1250040	1254600	guitar player, you can actually play the harmonics, get them to come out of your guitar, even
1254600	1258580	without getting the fundamental note to come out of your guitar.
1258580	1261640	But that's a different podcast discussion entirely.
1261640	1268480	The point is, the string that you're plucking has nothing discreet about it.
1268480	1272280	It's not that the string is only allowed to do certain things.
1272280	1277360	The string could have any shape that it wants to, as long as it's tied down at both ends.
1277360	1285160	But it naturally has a set of ways of vibrating that are sort of easiest to make it vibrate
1285160	1288880	at, that are very natural and direct.
1288880	1292880	In fact, at the technical level, we would say these are the ones that have a definite
1292880	1296040	energy in their vibrations.
1296040	1302240	And so the discreteness comes not because the string itself is discreet, but because
1302240	1307160	its behavior falls into a discrete set of possibilities.
1307160	1311800	The fundamental frequency, the first harmonic, second harmonic, et cetera.
1311800	1316000	And you can calculate exactly what the frequencies are and so forth.
1316000	1320280	So there's kind of an emergent nature to the discreteness.
1320280	1323120	The discreteness is not built into the system.
1323120	1327960	It is a feature of the solutions to the equations that govern the system in some high level
1327960	1328960	way.
1328960	1329960	But you can just see it pictorially.
1329960	1331320	You can tell why.
1331320	1335800	You can understand that it makes sense that there is, you know, the lowest note, a little
1335800	1340000	bit higher note, a little bit higher note than that and so forth.
1340000	1348120	That phenomenon is exactly why, in quantum mechanics, we see discrete behavior for things
1348120	1353740	like the energy of radiation being given off by one of these atoms.
1353740	1359840	So instead of thinking of the guitar string being tied down at both ends, think of the
1359840	1362920	wave function of an electron in an atom.
1362920	1363920	Let's make our lives easier.
1363920	1365400	Let's make it a hydrogen atom.
1365400	1368800	So there's only one electron and there's only one particle in the nucleus, a single
1368800	1369800	proton.
1369800	1370800	Okay.
1370800	1374360	Well, the electron wave function is not tied down.
1374360	1378560	It can extend very gradually out to infinity, right?
1378560	1383720	But the wave function has to go to zero at infinity as it gets very, very, very far away
1383720	1386040	from the proton.
1386040	1390240	It's going to go to zero because there's only, you can only have a finite amount of
1390240	1391240	wave function.
1391240	1394400	The wave function can't spread uniformly over all of space.
1394400	1398040	It has to be sort of concentrated somewhere and we're imagining that it's concentrated
1398040	1400360	near the proton in the atom.
1400360	1405360	So even though the electrons wave function is not literally tied down, effectively it
1405360	1406360	is.
1406360	1412360	It goes to zero as you get far away from the atom and you can play exactly the same game
1412360	1417200	with the electron wave function that you play with the plucked guitar string.
1417200	1422500	There are technical differences because the energy is a little bit different and also
1422500	1426720	because it's a three-dimensional thing, the electron wave function rather than the single
1426720	1428900	one-dimensional guitar string.
1428900	1431100	But the essence of the issue is the same.
1431100	1436500	There will be a lowest energy state of the electron, which is analogous to the fundamental
1436500	1441500	frequency of the guitar string and that's the lowest energy the electron can have in
1441500	1443000	a hydrogen atom.
1443000	1449840	And then there is a next highest energy level state that has some discrete extra amount
1449840	1451420	of energy.
1451420	1456500	It is not the case that the electron's wave function can't do anything at once.
1456500	1458920	It can vibrate in whatever way it wants.
1458920	1463980	But there's a natural set of ways that it can vibrate or ways that it can sort of arrange
1463980	1469260	itself around the proton and these are the ways that have definite energies and these
1469260	1475500	are the natural places for the electron to settle down into and what we actually observe.
1475500	1481340	So the discreteness of the energy levels of an electron, which by the way you learn
1481340	1485220	about in chemistry class, we learn about the orbitals of an electron around an atom, that's
1485220	1487340	exactly what's going on.
1487340	1494060	These are not because you've put in any fundamental discreteness into the nature of the reality
1494060	1495500	that you're talking about.
1495500	1498620	The reality is a smooth function obeying a smooth equation.
1498620	1504220	It's the behavior of the solutions to that equation that has a discrete character and
1504220	1508140	I'm really sort of dwelling on this and emphasizing it because it's going to become super-duper
1508140	1511260	important when we get to quantum field theory.
1511260	1518380	So the lesson here is you start with a completely smooth, continuous, arbitrarily varying thing,
1518380	1523940	the wave function of the electron and then you examine its behavior under very certain
1523940	1531180	special circumstances, namely it's sitting there glued to a proton in a hydrogen atom
1531340	1536100	and you find that the possible places you could find, the possible states you could find the
1536100	1539980	electron wave function in, come in a discrete set.
1539980	1545660	So again that discreteness is emergent because it's a property of the different solutions
1545660	1551020	to the equation, in this case the Schrodinger equation rather than the equation for a string
1551020	1553060	in a guitar.
1553060	1556620	So that's where quanta come from.
1556620	1562060	It's not because you pixelated the universe, it's because you solved an equation and the
1562060	1565420	solutions come in a discrete set.
1565420	1571220	And historically this was all done in the 1910s and 20s and we figured this out, quantum
1571220	1574300	mechanics was a great success, great.
1574300	1580420	But we always knew, even back in the 20s, that the world was not simply made of particles.
1580420	1586100	As we said, the very first glimmers of quantum mechanics came from thinking about fields,
1586100	1587860	thought about particles.
1587860	1594900	In the 19th century we had figured out that electricity and magnetism were two sets of
1594900	1600500	phenomena that were unified in a description that involved two different fields, the electric
1600500	1602860	field and the magnetic field.
1602860	1608460	And in fact, once Einstein and Minkowski came along with special relativity, we realized
1608460	1613300	that the electric field, the magnetic field were literally two different aspects of the
1613300	1614860	same underlying field.
1614860	1618980	So at some point we just call it the electromagnetic field.
1618980	1620980	And a field is a very different thing than a particle.
1620980	1624500	A particle, classically, let's just think classically now, we haven't quantized anything
1624500	1627220	yet, a particle has a location.
1627220	1632380	As we said, it has a position, it has a velocity, that's what a particle is basically.
1632380	1638620	Whereas a field is everywhere, okay, and I need to be very, very careful here, as careful
1638620	1645740	as I can be, to distinguish the different conceptual things that sound very, very similar
1645740	1646740	to each other.
1646740	1654740	In this case, a classical field is very, very different from a quantum wave function, okay.
1654740	1659020	They seem similar because a classical field has a value at every point in space.
1659020	1663620	The electric field has a value at every point in space.
1663620	1667140	It's a little vector because the electric field is not just a number, it's a little
1667140	1671420	arrow with a direction and a magnitude at every point in space.
1671420	1674700	You can't see it, it's invisible, it's all around you.
1674700	1679660	The magnetic field, likewise, you know, you can detect it, if you put iron filings on
1679660	1684380	a piece of paper near a magnet, they will line up with the magnetic field, showing the
1684380	1688780	influence of the magnetic field around you, a compass that you can carry around will point
1688780	1692340	toward the north pole for exactly that same reason.
1692340	1696620	And you can detect the electric field likewise, but they're there, they're around you at every
1696620	1701260	point in space around you right now, including inside you for that matter, and also, you
1701260	1703380	know, out in interstellar space.
1703380	1707940	Every point in space has a value for the electric field and the magnetic field.
1707940	1709540	That's what a field is.
1709540	1714940	A field is an entity that takes a value at every point in space.
1714940	1717860	You're very tempted to say, well, what are the fields made of?
1717860	1719220	That would be a bad question to ask.
1719220	1722700	I mean, you're welcome to ask it, but the answer is there isn't anything that the fields
1722700	1723900	are made of.
1723900	1726260	The world is going to be made of the fields, okay.
1726260	1730740	The fields are the bottom layer of reality, according to quantum field theory.
1730740	1732580	Now quantum field theory might not be the final answer.
1732580	1737420	I'll leave it in gesture at the very end toward the idea that it's not the final answer.
1737420	1741780	But according to quantum field theory, the rules are that we start with fields and we
1741780	1744740	build everything else out of them.
1744740	1750300	Now that idea that there is a number, a quantity, something like that at every point in spacetime
1750300	1753980	sounds very similar to the wave function of an electron, right?
1753980	1758300	And I told you that the wave function of an electron assigns a complex number to every
1758300	1760060	point in space.
1760060	1764660	And that number squared will give you the probability of observing the electron there.
1764660	1767740	But what if you had two electrons, right?
1767740	1772900	You do know that there is this thing that we talk about in chapter three of the new book
1772900	1774740	called Entanglement.
1774740	1778820	And Entanglement says that when you have two electrons, and let's say if you were actually
1778820	1782140	even better, let's make it more clear because electrons are identical particles and that's
1782140	1786180	going to get in the way of being correct sometimes here.
1786180	1788220	Let's say we have an electron and a proton.
1788220	1790900	So two particles, but very distinguishable.
1790900	1793420	You know which is the electron, which is the proton.
1793420	1800300	And call the position that you might observe the electron at x1 and the position you might
1800300	1802660	observe the proton at x2.
1802660	1805940	You know if you looked for these particles, whether you found the electron or proton, they're
1805940	1808380	very different looking particles.
1808380	1814860	When the phenomenon of entanglement tells you that the combined state of both particles
1814860	1821700	is not a wave function for the electron and a wave function for the proton, it is a single
1821700	1828500	wave function for the system that is made of the electron and the proton.
1828500	1831060	In other words, there is only one wave function.
1831060	1834500	Ultimately, it will be called the wave function of the universe because it actually includes
1834500	1836340	the whole universe, not just these two particles.
1836340	1841260	But for right now, it is a wave function of these two particles and it is a function
1841260	1843940	of x1 and x2.
1843940	1849020	For every possible position you could find the electron at and position you can find
1849020	1852700	the proton at, there will be a complex number.
1852700	1858140	And you ask the question, where are these two particles simultaneously?
1858140	1862780	And the wave function tells you a complex number that you square to get the probability
1862780	1865980	of seeing those two particles at that place.
1865980	1872100	So this seems like a little detail that might not be very important, but it's actually super
1872100	1878740	duper crucial here, namely that the wave function doesn't depend on space.
1878740	1882900	In this case, in the case of the electron and the proton, the wave function depends on two
1882900	1885100	copies of space.
1885100	1889460	One copy saying where is the electron, one copy saying where is the proton.
1889460	1893860	So in a very real sense, even though it sounds like a technicality, the wave function is
1893860	1895580	not a field.
1895580	1898740	The wave function of the universe, the wave function of the real world, the wave function
1898740	1903860	that we care about when we do quantum mechanics is not a field in the same sense that the
1903860	1906700	electric field or the magnetic field is.
1906700	1910980	The magnetic field doesn't care how many particles you have, it still has a value at
1910980	1912880	every point in space.
1912880	1917220	The wave function of a two particle system doesn't have a unique value at some point
1917220	1919220	in space.
1919220	1924580	The thing it depends on is the configuration space of all the particles, and for that matter
1924580	1928060	as we will see all the fields in the universe.
1928060	1929780	So it's a different kind of thing.
1929780	1937780	There is sort of an accidental coincidental resemblance of the wave function of one particle
1937780	1944020	to a field, but the idea, the conceptual notion of a wave function is a very different kind
1944020	1947140	of thing than a classical field, okay?
1947140	1951980	Classical fields really literally honestly are things that have values at each point
1951980	1953100	in space.
1953100	1958180	The electric field, the magnetic field, also the gravitational potential field and other
1958180	1960620	such kinds of fields.
1960620	1964180	Gravity was always thought to be a little bit trickier even before general relativity
1964180	1969820	came along, so most of the attention in the early 20th century was being focused on the
1969820	1971780	electromagnetic field.
1971780	1979500	So there was this vague idea near the turn of that century that matter was made of particles,
1979500	1985020	electrons, protons, and we eventually discovered neutrons and other things like that, whereas
1985020	1990580	forces were being carried by fields because we knew about gravity, we knew about electromagnetism,
1990580	1991580	etc.
1991580	1997620	So we thought, roughly speaking, even though it was not completely laid down explicitly,
1997620	2002380	that the world was going to consist of these two kinds of things, particles and fields,
2002380	2004900	matter and forces, right?
2004900	2007860	Matter from the particles, forces from the fields.
2007860	2014300	And so once quantum mechanics came along in its more robust form in the 1920s, and you
2014300	2020340	understood the quantum mechanics of particles, it was very, very natural to say, okay, now
2020340	2024140	we will turn to the quantum mechanics of fields.
2024140	2027860	And that's what the word of means, this is where we started this digression, understanding
2027860	2029100	the word of.
2029100	2035500	The word of means we're starting with a classical theory of something, particles to start, now
2035940	2038620	fields, and we're going to construct a quantum theory of it.
2038620	2039740	What does that mean?
2039740	2046060	It means take the classical theory, take the thing that plays the role of a position for
2046060	2047340	a particle, right?
2047340	2050540	For a field, fields don't have a position.
2050540	2051540	Fields are everywhere.
2051540	2056180	You can't just say what the position of a field is, but the role of position is basically
2056180	2060540	played by the value of the field at every point in space.
2060540	2063900	And then you're saying, well, okay, what's the, what's the role of the momentum or the
2063900	2064900	velocity?
2064900	2067060	Well, it is the rate of change.
2067060	2070700	It's the time derivative of the field at every point in space.
2070700	2074540	But again, happily, we don't need to think about that too deeply because what happens
2074540	2078900	when you quantize a particle is you temporarily forget about the momentum and just focus on
2078900	2079900	position.
2079900	2086900	When we quantize a field, we're going to start by thinking hard about the space of all possible
2086900	2090020	profiles of the field.
2090020	2097160	That is to say at every point in space, we imagine the field has a value and conceptually
2097160	2102540	we can ask, you know, so what is the space, what is the set of all possible values that
2102540	2105580	can have it all at once?
2105580	2109860	So I'm not asking, you know, what is the value at this point X and this point Y and this
2109860	2111420	point Z, et cetera, et cetera.
2111420	2116620	I'm saying all throughout space, all at once, the field sort of has a shape, right?
2116620	2121980	The field has an individual value at every point, so an infinite number of values, one
2121980	2123720	value at every point.
2123720	2126800	That is a profile of the field, okay?
2126800	2130140	That is a possible answer to the question.
2130140	2137380	If I could imagine measuring the field instantaneously all throughout the universe, what would it
2137380	2138460	look like?
2138460	2140820	That is a profile of the field.
2141220	2147060	That is the idea that plays the analogous role to the position of a single particle.
2147060	2153500	So you can see that, you know, mathematically, conceptually, this is a little bit more intimidating
2153500	2154660	than particles.
2154660	2157860	For a particle, you just had a position, you set a location, here it is, I can give you
2157860	2160980	three numbers, X, Y, Z, that's where it is.
2160980	2164980	For the field, you have to tell me what it's doing at every point throughout an infinitely
2164980	2165980	big universe.
2165980	2168900	That seems much harder to do.
2168900	2170060	But fields existed.
2170300	2172820	So we have to try to deal with them.
2172820	2179140	In fact, I should also mention that beyond the existence of the electromagnetic field,
2179140	2183420	there is also the phenomenon of radioactivity, okay?
2183420	2190140	There was the experimental discovery that particles could turn into other kinds of particles.
2190140	2192300	Particles could decay and give off particles.
2192300	2194860	Particles could be created and destroyed, right?
2194860	2196700	Even at the level of particles.
2196700	2202300	And the reason why I'm mentioning this is because if you take the Schrodinger equation
2202300	2209020	for a system of one electron or two electrons or three electrons or whatever, the number
2209020	2212780	of electrons never changes according to the Schrodinger equation.
2212780	2218100	If you just do particle quantum mechanics, you're going to be stuck with the same number
2218100	2220820	of particles that you always had.
2220820	2224900	You need to sort of generalize it a little bit, give it, you can do this.
2224900	2228060	You can sort of say, all right, I'm going to imagine ways that the number of particles
2228060	2229300	can change.
2229300	2235860	But as we'll see, or as we'll become natural at some point, basically what you're doing
2235860	2238220	is inventing field theory when you do that.
2238220	2244060	Field theory is a very natural way of accounting for the fact that the number of particles in
2244060	2246300	a system can change over time.
2246300	2247300	Okay, that was just an aside.
2247300	2250900	I want to get back to the electromagnetic field just for a second.
2250900	2254220	So we knew about the electromagnetic field.
2254220	2258100	We knew that we would have to incorporate it into quantum mechanics at some point.
2258100	2261980	And people tried to do it very early on in the development of quantum mechanics.
2261980	2267580	People like Paul Dirac, Heisenberg, and others tried to quantize the electromagnetic field.
2267580	2271860	People like Enrico Fermi wrote down theories where numbers of particles could change using
2271860	2274420	the idea of fields.
2274420	2280180	So the question became, what does it mean to take something that is already a field
2280180	2286900	like the electromagnetic field and to quantize it, to give it a wave function of some sort?
2286900	2291420	So I can tell you the answer, and it's the correct answer, it's just sort of presented
2291420	2294420	in a way that doesn't seem very helpful.
2294420	2299620	To every possible profile of the field, that is to say to every possible configuration
2299620	2304980	of the field all throughout space, we will attach a number, a complex number.
2304980	2308500	That is the wave function of the field.
2308500	2312460	And were we to imagine observing the field everywhere throughout space simultaneously
2312460	2317900	all at once, we would take that wave function and square it to get the probability we would
2317900	2322020	observe the field to be in that configuration.
2322020	2326340	So I hope that that made a little bit of sense, but I also hope that it's a little intimidating
2326340	2330820	and a little baffling as to how we would actually make any progress at a practical level with
2330820	2331820	that.
2331820	2336740	It was relatively easy to handle the idea of a wave function of a particle, but the wave
2336740	2343700	function of a field just seems like a completely, you know, impossible to wrestle mathematical
2343700	2345460	beast, right?
2345460	2349860	To every possible field configuration, we assign a number that just seems impractical
2349860	2351180	to write it down.
2351180	2354420	What would that wave function really ever look like?
2354420	2359380	And indeed, were you to take a quantum field theory class at a university somewhere or
2359380	2364500	pick up a real quantum field theory textbook, they almost never do this thing that I just
2364540	2368740	told you, assigning a complex number to every possible field configuration.
2368740	2374340	That is a perfectly valid way of thinking about quantum field theory, but it's not really
2374340	2376260	the practical way.
2376260	2380340	And so that's the reason why I could take a quantum field theory course as a graduate
2380340	2384860	student and have it remain hidden to me for a long time that really what we were doing
2384860	2389620	was just quantum mechanics because it's presented in a very different way using very different
2389620	2391380	mathematical tools.
2391380	2395940	But I think that it's conceptually easier if we try to stick as close as possible to
2395940	2401780	the same notion of quantization and converting a classical theory into a quantum theory in
2401780	2406220	the field context that we usually use in the particle context.
2406220	2412340	So the continuity of the ideas remains as explicit as it can be.
2412340	2419140	So what are we supposed to do with the fact that we're imagining profiles of fields stretching
2419180	2424460	all throughout space and attaching complex numbers to every possible profile, squaring
2424460	2428700	those complex numbers to get the probability that we would observe the field to look like
2428700	2429860	that?
2429860	2433220	The answer is Fourier transforms.
2433220	2434620	That's honestly the answer.
2434620	2439140	If you look online, if you look at the web page that I have for quantum fields, you look
2439140	2445540	at the table of contents that I published there, you will see an appendix.
2445660	2452420	There's like 12 chapters plus an appendix and the chapters all have punchy titles like
2452420	2460820	atoms and interactions and effective field theory and matter or whatever.
2460820	2468060	So there's a lot of basic ideas that are pretty obviously big important ideas.
2468060	2473460	And then the appendix is Fourier transforms, which seems like a little bit of an ugly duckling
2473460	2474460	in the collection.
2474460	2478740	It's like some specific mathy-sounding idea that hopefully I didn't have anything to
2478740	2479740	do with.
2479740	2484380	Indeed, I tell the story that when I was an undergraduate myself and I first learned
2484380	2489660	Fourier transforms, I literally was thinking like this is a quintessential example of a
2489660	2493540	mathematical technique I will never actually use in real life.
2493540	2497580	And then you discover once you take quantum field theory as well as other parts of physics
2497580	2502660	that Fourier transforms are the single most important thing in lots of areas of theoretical
2502660	2503660	physics.
2503660	2506060	So that is a Fourier transform.
2506060	2510380	It's just another way of thinking about the value of a field.
2510380	2514420	We said the value of field, the profile, the configuration of a field, whatever you want
2514420	2520060	to call it, is basically a function of space or a function of space time.
2520060	2521060	Let's just think space.
2521060	2525540	We don't need to worry about evolution right now, although we will evolve through time
2525540	2526980	at some point.
2526980	2531540	So at every point in space, there's a value of the field, that's the field profile.
2531540	2538420	So to give you the information about what the field profile is, requires in principle
2538420	2540860	an infinite amount of data, right?
2540860	2545500	I have to list every point in space, that's an infinite number of points, and at each
2545500	2548340	point I tell you what the field is doing.
2548340	2554460	Now realistically for fields that we might care about, maybe there's some simple ways
2554460	2559100	of compressing all that information into a compact notation or whatever, but in principle
2559100	2561180	that's what I have to give you.
2561180	2567300	The idea of a Fourier transform is, I can represent that information in a much more
2567300	2572820	convenient way, the information about what is the field doing at every point in space.
2572820	2581380	Think of a simple kind of field configuration, namely a pure wave, a pure sine function
2581380	2587100	or cosine function, a sinusoidal wave, that is just a fancy wave saying a wave that literally
2587100	2592460	just goes up and down with an absolutely fixed wavelength and an absolutely fixed amplitude,
2592460	2593460	okay?
2593460	2598580	The typical idea of a wave, a plane wave that stretches all throughout space that you might
2598580	2603340	see in a picture, you know, a very wave-like thing, not complicated ripples and going in
2603340	2609060	different directions, just a very smooth regular wave stretching all throughout space.
2609060	2615780	That's an example of a simple wave, a wave that a configuration of the field, waves are
2615780	2620780	just configurations of fields, by the way, there's almost no difference between the word
2620780	2626460	wave and the word field, except sadly we have attached the word wave to wave functions which
2626460	2630460	are different kinds of things, I know, that's very annoying, sorry about that, I wasn't
2630460	2632100	to blame for that.
2632100	2638140	Anyway, this particular kind of simple wave, a sinusoidal wave, a wave with a definite wave
2638140	2645140	length that remains absolutely constant all throughout infinitely big space, that is a
2645140	2650380	plane wave, it is something we can represent mathematically using sines and cosines, okay,
2650380	2654200	if you know a little bit about your trigonometry functions.
2654200	2662220	And we call a wave of a definite wavelength a mode of the field, and of course, most field
2662220	2667660	configurations aren't going to be that simple, right, they are going to be more unpredictable
2667660	2672420	as you go from place to place, but we're choosing just for a moment to focus on very,
2672420	2677720	very simple, very, very regular configurations of the fields, ones that look like absolutely
2677720	2681520	uniform sine waves all throughout space.
2681520	2689080	So back in, I don't know, but I think it was the 1800s, Professor Fourier noticed that
2689080	2696420	if I took different waves, that is to say waves of different wavelengths, right, so waves
2697180	2701980	of each wave has a definite wavelength, I'm imagining a mode is what we call it, a mode
2701980	2707540	is a wave of definite wavelength, so I'm imagining different modes, and he says if I add them
2707540	2712780	together, I can get something that is not a mode, right, because if I add two waves
2712780	2717420	together with different wavelengths, I will not get a simple sine wave, I'll get something
2717420	2719340	that looks more complicated than that.
2719340	2724540	And if I add three or a hundred billion waves together, then I can get things that look
2724540	2727940	more complicated than just a simple sine wave.
2727940	2731060	And I don't know what his actual thought process was, it was probably a little bit more systematic
2731060	2738860	than that, but Fourier asked himself, is it possible that if I add an infinite number
2738860	2744780	of waves together, I can get any shape of the field I want?
2744780	2748260	And the answer is yes, otherwise we wouldn't be going through this, right?
2748260	2755900	The answer is I can express any field I want, any configuration of the field, any increase
2755900	2760860	and decrease and change in direction of a field all throughout space, you give that
2760860	2769300	to me, I'm going to express it as a sum of these nice simple modes, modes with a definite
2769300	2772900	wavelength, I add up different wavelengths together, I get something that doesn't look
2772900	2778220	like it has a wavelength at all, it's an arbitrary mess, literally any profile of the field,
2778220	2781940	can be written as a sum of modes.
2781940	2787700	And the point is, that's the Fourier transform, rather than giving you the information about
2787700	2794380	what the field value is at every point in space, I give you how much of each mode contributes
2794380	2795380	to the field.
2795380	2802140	I guess I should be super-duper careful here, say not only can you take any profile, any
2802140	2807660	configuration of the field you want and express it as a sum of modes of fixed wavelength,
2807660	2812820	but that expression is unique, that is to say given a profile, there is one and only
2812820	2818380	one way of expressing it as a sum of modes of fixed wavelength, that's what the Fourier
2818380	2825220	transform does, it tells you what that way is, that way of expressing some wildly varying
2825220	2831100	function as a sum of nice sine waves and cosines, okay?
2831100	2837020	And the information is now been transformed, the information that used to be at every point
2837020	2842700	in space, I tell you the value of the field, now the information is, I tell you how much
2842700	2849540	of a contribution the field gets from each mode, from each sine wave with a definite
2849540	2850540	wavelength.
2850540	2855540	You know, some of them, some wavelengths might be very important, so there's a big contribution,
2855540	2859660	so there's a big number times the sine wave in the sum of all this infinite number of
2859660	2862300	them, some might not be that important.
2862300	2866620	And this fact is kind of amazing, you know, this fact is not at all intuitive, right?
2866620	2871460	You take a bunch of perfectly regular up and down waves, and in principle you can add them
2871460	2876260	together to get any behavior you want, you might not have guessed that you could do that,
2876260	2878980	but you can mathematically show that it's true.
2878980	2882980	So in some sense that's nice, it's cute, right?
2882980	2888140	It's a mathematical fact, but have we really learned anything useful by doing this?
2888140	2892540	The Fourier transform is a way of saying I can start with whatever field profile I want,
2892540	2899060	I can turn it into an infinite sum over waves of different definite wavelengths.
2899060	2906500	Well, yes, it turns out to be super duper important for the following reasons.
2906500	2913100	If I think about the energy of a field, okay, the very first thing we're going to think
2913100	2918580	about when we quantize our fields is think about what energy the field has, and we're
2918580	2921900	going to look at solutions of definite energy, right?
2921900	2924860	So what is the essence of the energy of a field?
2924860	2928660	A particle has two kinds of energy.
2928660	2933340	It has kinetic energy, so a particle has an energy that depends on its velocity squared,
2933340	2938140	one half mv squared in terms of the mass and the velocity of the particle, and it might
2938140	2939900	also have a potential energy.
2939900	2944500	So if the particle is moving in an electric field or something like that, the value of
2944500	2948860	the electric field in charge of the particle will contribute to the potential energy of
2948860	2949860	the field.
2950100	2954340	Sorry, the potential energy of the particle will get a contribution from the electric
2954340	2955840	field.
2955840	2959700	The field itself has three kinds of energy.
2959700	2964320	It has a kinetic energy, just like a particle does, but it means something different.
2964320	2969380	We call it a kinetic energy, but it's not the field is moving, it's that at each point
2969380	2971420	the field is changing its value, okay?
2971420	2973820	The field has a value at each point.
2973820	2978740	If that field is just constant, then the kinetic constant with time, then the kinetic
2978740	2982380	energy of the field is zero at that point, but if it's sort of vibrating up and down,
2982380	2985660	for example, then it has a non-zero kinetic energy.
2985660	2990900	A field can also have a potential energy, but it means a slightly different thing, because
2990900	2996620	for the particle, the potential energy means how it's sort of moving through space and
2996620	3001580	feeling different values of the electric field or the gravitational field or whatever.
3001580	3005380	For a field, what we call the potential energy, I know it's very annoying.
3005380	3009620	We use exactly the same words to mean different things, but mathematically they look the same.
3009620	3012180	That's why it's useful to look at the equations.
3012180	3017580	For the field, we think about the field interacting with itself.
3017580	3021820	So an electron gets a potential energy from interacting with the gravitational field or
3021820	3024340	the electric field or the magnetic field.
3024340	3028740	The fields get potential energy from interacting with themselves, and different fields will
3028740	3033260	interact with themselves in different ways, but all that matters for that is the value
3033260	3034260	of the field.
3034260	3039620	The kinetic energy depends on the derivative, the time rate of change of the field, whereas
3039620	3043060	the potential energy only matters, only depends on the value of the field.
3043060	3047060	It does not matter how fast things are changing.
3047060	3050140	And you might guess what the third kind of energy is.
3050140	3053180	First kind was kinetic, second time was potential.
3053180	3057220	There's something that is new for fields that doesn't exist for particles, which is the
3057220	3059740	gradient energy.
3059740	3065060	The idea is that not only can the value at each point in space of the field change with
3065060	3071700	time, but as you go to a nearby point in space, there can be differences in the values of
3071700	3072700	the fields.
3072700	3076460	The fields can be stretched a little bit or distorted a little bit from point to point.
3076460	3081900	If the field was exactly constant through space, then there wouldn't be any stretching
3081900	3087060	or distortion energy, what we call the gradient energy, but usually the field is changing from
3087060	3090780	place to place that will contribute to the energy of the field.
3090780	3095420	Indeed, those of you who have read volume one, space, time and motion, know about relativity
3095420	3100140	and you know that the difference between space and time will change depending on your point
3100140	3105940	of view and therefore you will not be surprised to learn that for fields, which I didn't say
3105940	3112820	this explicitly yet, but these fields are deeply embedded in the context of relativity.
3112900	3117220	There's a relationship between the kinetic energy, the rate of change with respect to
3117220	3121860	time, and the gradient energy, the rate of change with respect to space, because space
3121860	3124140	and time are related to each other.
3124140	3131580	We have three kinds of energy, kinetic energy, gradient energy, potential energy.
3131580	3136740	To solve the equations for what the field does, you need to know all of these.
3136740	3140660	You need to know what the field is doing at every point in space because what it's doing
3140660	3146220	at a nearby point in space will affect what the field does at one point in space.
3146220	3151940	So at just a simple, very basic, dirty technical level, it's kind of annoying to have these
3151940	3154940	different kinds of energy floating around.
3154940	3159700	Now remember the question we're trying to answer here, why do we bother thinking about
3159700	3160860	Fourier transforms?
3160860	3167060	Why do we bother thinking about the profile of the field as a sum of plane wave modes
3167060	3171180	rather than as just values at each individual point in space?
3171180	3173140	Well think about those energies.
3173140	3177660	Think about the kinetic energy, the potential energy, the gradient energy.
3177660	3183300	If you write the field as modes, if you take the Fourier transform, it still has a kinetic
3183300	3184300	energy.
3184300	3185300	It's the same kind of thing.
3185300	3190700	It still has a potential energy, the same kind of thing, but the gradient energy is
3190700	3196980	a different kind of thing now because by telling you that we're focusing in on one
3196980	3203820	particular mode, one particular wave with fixed wavelength stretching throughout all
3203820	3209620	of space, I've told you how the wave changes from place to place because it has a fixed
3209620	3211220	wavelength, right?
3211220	3212860	I've given you that information.
3212860	3216660	I don't need to separately give you that information at every point.
3216660	3224260	If I'm just looking at one mode of the field, then I have the gradient energy sussed.
3224260	3225500	I know what it is.
3225500	3229740	I don't need to give you that extra information over and over again, okay?
3229740	3236540	So it turns out that when we're solving the equations for the behavior of a field, it's
3236540	3242460	much easier to write down the solutions if we look at a mode of the field or if we look
3242460	3249460	at modes of the field one at a time rather than looking at positions in space and values
3249460	3253340	of the fields at positions in space, okay?
3253340	3256500	So that may or may not have been a convincing explanation.
3256500	3260580	In this audio podcast, I cannot show you the equations, but the equations make it super
3260580	3261580	duper clear.
3261580	3262580	I promise you.
3262580	3263860	And it is possible to follow them.
3263860	3265940	Do not get intimidated by the equations.
3265940	3267340	It's just an alien language.
3267340	3271260	You can learn it, and once you learn it, you have a good warm feeling of accomplishment,
3271260	3273220	so it's worth doing.
3273220	3281820	So the lesson, the upshot of all this digression is take a particular kind of field configuration,
3281820	3285260	even with a absolutely fixed wavelength.
3285260	3291980	I happen to know that I can write any field configuration as a sum of many such things,
3291980	3295500	but let's keep that in the back of your mind and focus on one of them.
3295500	3300780	Pick a mode, pick a wave that has a wavelength, a definite, very, very specific frequency
3300780	3304260	it's vibrating at, ask what it is doing.
3304260	3311380	So in other words, when I quantize this, instead of assigning a complex number, complex
3311380	3317500	valued wave function to every field configuration, let me focus in on this one mode of the field
3317500	3323180	and assign a complex number to every possible value of the mode.
3323180	3324620	What does it mean value of the mode?
3324620	3328020	The wavelength is fixed, but the amplitude is not.
3328020	3332660	So it might be a wave of a certain wavelength that is very gently vibrating, just very slightly
3332660	3335420	up and down, or it could be vibrating by a lot.
3335420	3341740	Those are different ways that this mode could be vibrating, and to each different amplitude,
3341740	3346300	to each different height of the wave that it goes up and down, I will assign a complex
3346300	3347380	number.
3347380	3352460	That is the wave function of this particular mode.
3352460	3358300	And you can kind of see how this would be easier to make sense of.
3358300	3361100	Modes that are vibrating by a lot, right?
3361100	3364140	Modes that are, again, the wavelength is fixed.
3364140	3368220	So through space, we imagine, you know, from point A to point B, it goes up and down with
3368220	3373380	a certain wavelength, but the amount by which it goes up and down in between where it's
3373380	3379300	zero, one wavelength away, the amount by which it goes up and down is arbitrary.
3379300	3383460	And there's more energy when it goes up by a lot than when it goes up by just a little
3383460	3385100	bit.
3385100	3387140	And here's where the miracle occurs, okay?
3387140	3389820	You might have thought this was a little bit dry and technical, and why are we bothering
3389820	3390820	with this?
3390820	3395380	But a miracle is about to occur, I promise you.
3395380	3402820	We're thinking of the wave function of a single mode of a vibrating quantum field.
3402820	3409180	And the mode itself, that we're assigning a wave function to, is now that we've told
3409180	3415140	you its wavelength is just characterized by a single number, the height, call it H, okay?
3415140	3418420	The height of the wave that is vibrating up and down.
3418420	3424340	So instead of psi of X for a particle being a wave function, we're going to have psi of
3424340	3429660	H, the wave function of the height of the vibrating mode.
3429660	3435460	And the exact thing that happened to the electron in the hydrogen atom, where we said the wave
3435460	3438740	function's going to have to taper off at zero, and you're going to get a set of discrete
3438740	3443380	solutions on the inside that look like orbitals and explain the different energy levels of
3443380	3449940	atoms, that exact same thing is going to happen to our mode of the quantum field.
3449940	3456420	At very, very large height functions, very, very large amplitudes of the wave, shaking
3456420	3461340	up and down, the wave function is going to have to go to zero, because it can only be
3461340	3465060	sort of localized in some particular set of values.
3465060	3471980	And therefore, when we solve the equation, we will get a discrete set of solutions.
3471980	3479620	A discrete set of possible wave functions for this one mode of this one field.
3479620	3485460	There will be a lowest energy wave function, and there will be a simple separate next highest
3485460	3489620	energy wave function, and there will be one higher than that, and there'll be a discrete
3489620	3498860	tower of wave functions for this one particular wave with one particular wavelength.
3498860	3499860	Why do you care about that?
3499860	3500860	Okay.
3500860	3506700	Maybe you're with me this far, and you say, okay, I've taken my wave, I've decided to
3506700	3512860	think about my wave as a sum of modes of fixed wavelength, I've focused in on one particular
3512860	3517700	mode, I have assigned a wave function to it, and I've found that the wave function of that
3517700	3520220	mode has a discrete set of solutions.
3520220	3523900	Well, we're going to poke around, and this is something that's going to be hard to,
3523900	3527980	I can't explain it really over words, but you can check out the book.
3527980	3532180	But I'm going to tell you some facts, and you can choose to believe me or not.
3532180	3535900	So look at that lowest energy wave function.
3535900	3536900	It's lowest energy.
3536900	3540140	We're going to say it's the vacuum, as we call it, okay?
3540140	3541740	There's sort of nothing there.
3541740	3546220	And then there's the next highest energy wave function.
3546220	3547320	It has an energy.
3547320	3553300	Let's call it M, the letter M, and it turns out that it's not unique.
3553300	3557260	The vacuum, the lowest energy mode, the lowest energy wave function is unique.
3557260	3559140	There's only one such thing.
3559140	3564340	But there's an infinite collection of next highest energy modes, which basically correspond
3564340	3569660	to looking at the same kind of behavior, but in different reference frames, with different
3569660	3571500	velocities, if you like.
3571500	3576580	And you can calculate the energy of all of these different modes, basically the same,
3576580	3581300	sorry, of all of these different wave functions, basically the same kind of wave function just
3581300	3584340	looked at from different reference frames.
3584340	3589380	And they get more and more energy, the more velocity you have with respect to the rest
3589380	3591860	frame, okay?
3591860	3597220	And then you look at the next highest energy wave functions, and if the first one had the
3597220	3603980	lowest energy of 2M, so you have a vacuum state with energy 0, a next highest one with
3603980	3609540	energy M, or higher, depending on if you have velocity with respect to it, and the one after
3609540	3614220	that has an energy 2 times M.
3614220	3615100	So what's going on?
3615100	3620820	It's going to be one with 3 times M, 4 times M, etc., absolutely uniform growth of energies
3620820	3623140	of these different particular wave functions.
3623140	3626620	Well, I'm not going to keep you in suspense much longer.
3626620	3633700	The vacuum state is what we interpret as a quantum state with no particles.
3633700	3635460	It's empty space.
3635460	3643420	That first excited state, as we call it, with energy M, I should say, yeah, I'm sorry,
3643420	3646300	this is back in my mind, and it certainly will be in your mind if you're reading the
3646300	3648620	book, but I didn't say it out loud.
3648620	3654620	We always, in particle physics, use units where the speed of light is set equal to 1.
3654620	3660820	So C, the speed of light equals 1 to me, and so when I say it has energy M, what I really
3660820	3664620	mean is it has energy MC squared.
3664620	3665620	What is that?
3665620	3666940	Where have we ever heard that before?
3666940	3669140	The energy of something is MC squared.
3669140	3676980	Yeah, that is the energy of a single particle with mass M in its rest frame.
3676980	3680500	If you move to another rest frame, the energy will go up, because it will also have a little
3680500	3684860	bit of kinetic energy, as well as the rest energy.
3684860	3688700	What about this wave function that has an energy of 2 times M?
3688700	3691900	Well, that's really 2 times MC squared.
3691900	3693580	What is that the energy of?
3693580	3700580	It's the energy of 2 particles with mass M, and then you have a set of other related
3700580	3704500	wave functions where the particles are moving with respect to each other, and then you have
3704500	3711820	a vibrational wave function with energy 3 times MC squared, etc.
3711820	3717140	And they are all related to each other by exactly the ways that you would expect a set
3717140	3723540	of particles and their energies to be related to each other.
3723540	3724740	That was a lot.
3724740	3729860	In the book, I go through this super explicitly, and I know that the actual manipulations are
3729860	3736140	kind of boring and tedious, but the result is so important.
3736140	3740460	It's one of the most important things, literally, in all of human knowledge, this particular
3740460	3747220	result, because the result that we got here through talking about Fourier transforms and
3747220	3752820	thinking about quantum fields in terms of modes, with different wavelengths, and then
3752820	3756660	the different ways that you could get a wave function for that mode.
3756660	3763180	The result we got here is saying that when you take a field, which by itself is continuous
3763180	3769180	and smooth and nothing discreet about it, and you assign a wave function to the field,
3769180	3774900	which is also by itself continuous and smooth and nothing discreet about it, the solutions
3774900	3782220	to the equations, the different kinds of behavior that that wave function of the field can exhibit
3782220	3785060	come in a discreet set.
3785060	3791740	They look like particles, and you can go much further than this in explicating the fact that
3791740	3794660	they behave like particles.
3794660	3799420	These are what particles are according to quantum field theory.
3799420	3803140	According to quantum field theory, the world is not made of particles.
3803140	3805420	The world is not made of discrete lumps of energy.
3805420	3808940	The world is made of fields that have wave functions.
3808940	3813060	If you want to, you can just say the world is made of the wave function of the fields.
3813060	3816860	That's a that's a foundations of physics question that we're not going to get into right now.
3816860	3821300	But the point is, there's nothing discreet or lumpy about what the world is made of.
3821300	3827300	The discreteness comes in how the world behaves, and it comes because we have quantized our
3827300	3829220	fields.
3829220	3834180	This is a slightly more mathematically careful and sophisticated way of saying something you
3834180	3837620	may have heard me say before in other contexts.
3837620	3840980	Particles are vibrations in quantum fields.
3840980	3842660	That's what particles are.
3842660	3848020	When you apply the rules of quantum mechanics to fields, you get a set of solutions that
3848020	3854100	look like particles in exactly the same way that when you solve the Schrodinger equation
3854100	3860060	for an electron in an atom, you get a set of discrete orbitals with discrete energies.
3860060	3864860	Or for that matter, when you pluck a guitar string, you get a set of discrete frequencies
3864860	3866900	at which it vibrates.
3866900	3869260	All the discreteness is emergent.
3869260	3873620	That's where particles come from out of quantum field theory.
3873620	3876420	And you get literally everything that you expect from particles.
3876420	3881460	Many different particles will have different energies going in exactly the same way, etc.
3881460	3882820	Good.
3882820	3884620	So I hope that was convincing.
3884620	3887940	I hope that you see a little bit now.
3887940	3891620	When you start with fields, they can look like particles.
3891620	3894780	This means two things.
3894780	3900580	It means that putting yourself in the mindset of a physicist in the 1920s when quantum mechanics
3900580	3902460	was being invented.
3902460	3908220	One is I can take the electromagnetic field, which I know and love since the time of Maxwell
3908220	3911620	in the 1800s, and I can quantize it.
3911620	3913020	I can do all this.
3913020	3917340	I can treat it in terms of modes, and I can assign wave functions, and I can get lumps
3917340	3923740	of energy, which I interpret as particles, which we will call photons.
3923740	3925900	That's what photons are.
3925900	3930780	The other thing is that these other things we had lying around, the electrons, the protons,
3930780	3938100	etc., the things we thought of as particles, we can now say, well, maybe those are vibrations
3938100	3940140	in quantum fields.
3940140	3945940	So secretly, without even trying very hard, we have stumbled on an enormously powerful
3945940	3950500	unification of different kinds of physics.
3950500	3958620	In the late 1800s, we might have thought that the universe is made of fields and particles,
3958620	3963020	particles being the matter in the universe and fields being the forces.
3963020	3967700	But now we're getting a glimpse of the idea, thanks to quantum mechanics, that it's actually
3967700	3970540	all just fields.
3970540	3976780	And the fields show up, both as big classical fields under the right circumstances and also
3976780	3981620	as discrete individual particles under other circumstances.
3981620	3987980	And so one challenge that we're faced with right away is why do electrons and photons
3987980	3991740	seem to behave so differently from each other?
3991740	3995660	And the answer basically comes down to symmetry.
3995660	4001300	The idea of symmetry, as I say in the book, it's very helpful in classical physics, super
4001300	4009100	helpful in particle-based quantum mechanics, but it becomes absolutely central in quantum
4009100	4010100	field theory.
4010100	4014540	So much so, there's a whole chapter in the book devoted to symmetry where I teach you
4014540	4015940	group theory.
4015940	4019660	You will learn what SU2 and SU3 and all those things are.
4019660	4023540	This is one of the chapters that I actually wrote a lot more than appears in the book.
4023540	4028740	I wrote a lot, and then I'm trying to, even though we're doing the equations, I don't
4028740	4030700	want it to be overwhelming.
4030700	4031700	So I pared it down.
4031700	4035060	There was a lot that I had put in the original version of the chapter that was a little bit
4035060	4038660	more than you need to just do quantum field theory.
4038660	4044940	But the specific symmetries we're talking about right now are spacetime symmetries.
4044940	4048660	So there's two different kinds of symmetries you can get in quantum field theory.
4048660	4052980	There are symmetries of spacetime itself.
4052980	4054500	There is translation invariance.
4054500	4057860	It doesn't matter where you do the experiment.
4057860	4059260	There's time translation invariance.
4059260	4061460	It doesn't matter when you do the experiment.
4061460	4063460	Rotational invariance.
4063460	4064460	Boost invariance.
4064460	4067020	It doesn't matter how fast you're moving in space.
4067020	4072100	But then there's also what we call internal symmetries, where you don't change where
4072100	4074980	you are or how you're oriented in spacetime.
4074980	4080220	You just rotate fields into each other, and both of those are going to be very important.
4080220	4086100	So for the question at hand right now, the difference between photons and electrons,
4086100	4092580	one of the differences, comes down to how these fields change when you do a rotation
4092580	4093580	in space.
4093580	4096580	We're dealing here with relativistic quantum field theory.
4096580	4099380	That's sort of implicit when we say quantum field theory.
4099380	4104460	But it's not necessarily that you need to be relativistic, that you need to be thinking
4104460	4107740	about relativity when you do field theory.
4107780	4113220	Relativity in this case, in this sense, means that everything is relative, including the
4113220	4117140	velocity of two different objects with respect to each other.
4117140	4120580	There's no such thing as the velocity of an object.
4120580	4124100	There's just the relative velocity of two different kinds of objects.
4124100	4130380	Now you can have circumstances where it's appropriate to do non-relativistic field theory.
4130380	4133700	So if you're a condensed matter physicist, so you're not a particle physicist thinking
4133700	4138300	about smashing two particles together in otherwise empty space, but you have a chunk
4138300	4144420	of material here, and maybe there's some vibrational modes of the material, right?
4144420	4149700	We were talking about modes before, ways that a field can vibrate with a definite wavelength.
4149700	4155420	Well when you have a crystal or a metal or something like that, there are ways that the
4155420	4160580	material can vibrate, and you can separate that into modes, and you can quantize them.
4160580	4166100	And you're basically dealing with a non-relativistic quantum field theory, because there is a rest
4166100	4170660	frame that is well defined in that case, the rest frame of the material that you're looking
4170660	4171660	at.
4171660	4172980	But anyway, we're not doing that.
4172980	4176180	We are doing relativistic quantum field theory.
4176180	4179740	But for this question, we really care about rotations in space.
4179740	4185180	How do fields change as you rotate in space?
4185180	4190140	And really we're dealing with the wave function of a field, as we said, and that makes things
4190140	4194580	a wee bit more complicated, but I'm going to, again, try to distill it down to the basic
4194580	4196380	essences.
4196380	4200420	Imagine you have some wave function for some field.
4200420	4206140	In fact, imagine that the state of the field is such that it looks like there's one particle
4206140	4207140	there.
4207140	4214020	Remember, we said that there are quantum states of the field, and an arbitrary quantum state
4214020	4219300	of a field is basically a superposition of different kinds of particles, different numbers
4219300	4220580	of particles.
4220580	4225820	There is a particular wave function in the field that could have representing zero particles,
4225820	4228740	and different other ones representing one or two or more.
4228740	4232140	In general, you could be a superposition of all sorts of different kinds.
4232140	4235380	That's quantum mechanics for you, right?
4235380	4242860	That is what let's quantum field theory describe changes between the number of particles, because
4242860	4248780	a single wave function for a single field implicitly includes zero particle states,
4248780	4253220	one particle states, two particle states, and so on upward.
4253220	4257780	Let's zoom in on a wave function representing a single particle.
4257780	4259460	I want to emphasize this.
4259460	4265200	Even though what is really going on is a quantum field, there are certain circumstances in
4265200	4268460	which it's perfectly sensible to think of a single particle.
4268460	4272820	That is a kind of excitation of a single quantum field.
4272820	4273820	It's not incompatible.
4273820	4278060	We're not cheating when we say let's think of one particle within the context of quantum
4278060	4279180	field theory.
4279180	4283220	You can talk about what an electron is doing in the context of quantum field theory.
4283220	4284220	Let's do that.
4284220	4288780	Let's talk about a single electron, and let's ask what happens when you rotate your frame
4288780	4293420	of reference for that wave function of a single electron.
4293420	4296820	In fact, let's not rotate by like 90 degrees.
4296820	4303700	Let's rotate all the way around 360 degrees, two pi radians we scientists would say.
4303700	4310180	Well, your naive expectation is that if you just do a whole rotation by 360 degrees, the
4310180	4312620	wave function is going to come back to where it started, right?
4312620	4316380	That's a reflection of the symmetry of rotations.
4316380	4321580	But if you think about it a little bit more carefully, there's another possibility.
4321580	4329220	What if the wave function gets multiplied by minus one when you rotate by 360 degrees?
4329220	4334260	That's interesting because it leaves all of the predictions unchanged because the predictions
4334260	4340060	in quantum mechanics, quantum field theory included, come from squaring the wave function.
4340060	4342820	Now there's a philosophical question that arises here.
4342820	4346500	Is it true that all we care about are the observational outcomes or should we care about
4346500	4347500	other things?
4347500	4348500	Good.
4348500	4350060	Go ahead and contemplate those things.
4350060	4355300	But for these books, for this book series, we're not dwelling on those philosophical
4355300	4356300	questions.
4356300	4357300	We're thinking like hard-nosed physicists.
4357380	4361220	And the physicists will just say, look, I care about the observations.
4361220	4367100	It's just as good if a wave function picks up a minus sign when I rotate by 360 degrees
4367100	4371380	as it is if it remains completely unchanged.
4371380	4374980	And this, in fact, there's more subtle things you can say.
4374980	4380180	What happens when you do rotate by 180 degrees or by 90 degrees, et cetera?
4380180	4384620	And long story short, you get all different possible kinds of fields.
4384620	4391980	Every individual kind of field will give rise to a single kind of particle that has a definite
4391980	4395380	property when it's rotated in space.
4395380	4399940	And the properties might be that the wave function remains the same under 360 degrees
4399940	4402460	or that it picks up a minus one.
4402460	4408540	And that corresponds to what we call the spin of the particle.
4408540	4416780	This fact that the transformation properties of wave functions under rotations is related
4416780	4422660	to the spin of the particle is the quantum mechanical version of a statement that we
4422660	4425980	know in classical physics from Neurter's theorem.
4425980	4433620	Neurter's theorem says that conserved quantities arise from symmetries of the theory.
4433620	4437900	And one such symmetry is rotations in classical mechanics and the conserved quantity that
4437900	4442260	arises from that is angular momentum, of which spin is one kind.
4442260	4446780	So the quantum version of this is that the transformation of the wave functions under
4446780	4450060	rotations tells us the spin of the particle.
4450060	4456780	And basically, again, very long stories being made very short here, the kinds of particles
4456780	4462580	that arise from fields in such a way that their wave function is unchanged under a rotation
4462580	4470100	by 360 degrees have spins that are an integer value, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.
4470100	4474940	Secretly, just like we said the speed of light equal to 1 before, now we're setting Planck's
4474940	4478060	constant equal to 1.
4478060	4484100	Planck's constant h bar is the fundamental unit of quantum mechanics and it turns out
4484100	4486700	to have the same units as angular momentum.
4486700	4491260	So the spin of a particle is actually measured in units of h bar.
4491260	4497300	So we set h bar equal to 1, so rather than saying spin 0, spin h bar, spin 2 h bar, we
4497300	4499940	just say spin 0, spin 1, spin 2.
4499940	4503820	Those are all different kinds of particles that come back, their wave function comes
4503820	4507420	back to the same value when you do a 360 degree rotation.
4507420	4513060	If it picks up a minus 1, then it turns out that the spin is a half integer value.
4513060	4518500	So it's spin 1 half, spin 3 halves, spin 5 halves, etc.
4518500	4524660	There's a long mathematically intricate conversation to have about representations of the symmetry
4524660	4527420	groups of spacetime on quantum fields.
4527420	4534100	And the mathematical object that tells us, that lets us describe these spin 1 half, 3
4534100	4544460	half particles are called spinners, S-P-I-N-O-R-S, it's a coinage that comes from tensors which
4544460	4546460	are other kinds of objects.
4546460	4550900	So spinners are these spin 1 half, spin 3 half fields.
4550900	4553500	So keep that in mind, okay?
4553500	4557660	There are kinds of particles like electrons, like neutrinos, like quarks, lots of different
4557660	4564740	particles that have a wave function that picks up a minus sign when we rotate by 360 degrees.
4564740	4569980	Now think about something that is highly analogous to that but different.
4569980	4576100	Instead of thinking of one particle and what happens when we rotate it by 360 degrees, think
4576100	4581380	about two particles, in fact think about two identical particles.
4581380	4586580	As a footnote here, I will mention, you might have heard of this story that John Wheeler
4586580	4591860	and Richard Feynman were talking about, why do all electrons have the same mass and the
4591860	4593020	same charge?
4593020	4595340	Maybe because they're all the same electron.
4595340	4599420	Because an electron going backward in time is kind of like a positron and maybe there's
4599420	4603540	only one electron that just bounces forever and ever backward and forward in time.
4603540	4609820	That is false, it did not work, it was a nice idea and it led Feynman to think about Feynman
4609820	4613620	diagrams and things like that but it's just a pretty story.
4613620	4618940	The actual reason why all electrons have the same mass and charge is because they are all
4618940	4623500	vibrations in the same underlying electron field.
4623500	4628740	So what that means is that two electrons are absolutely identical to each other and this
4628740	4633940	is a technical term in quantum field theory, they are identical particles.
4633940	4639460	So if I have a state of two electrons and there is a position of one particle of one
4639460	4645780	electron x1 and the position of the other electron x2, not again, they don't have definite
4645780	4649060	positions, they have positions we could observe them to be at.
4649060	4653740	But there's no difference between x1 and x2, there's a symmetry there, there's no way
4653740	4659780	you can say oh it's this electron who I named Alice who was at position x1 and electron
4659780	4661140	Bob is at x2.
4661140	4665860	All you know is that there's one electron at one position and one electron at the other.
4665860	4671780	So we can ask what happens when we take two identical particles, that is to say the wave
4671780	4677740	function corresponding to a quantum state representing two identical particles and we
4677740	4679780	interchange them.
4679780	4684540	So we're not rotating, we're not changing our physical coordinate system or anything
4684540	4688460	like that, we're physically taking these two particles and exchanging one for the other
4688460	4691480	by moving them through space.
4691480	4695500	But again, they're identical particles, so you might think well if I exchange one for
4695500	4699620	the other the wave function doesn't change, but by exactly the same argument the wave
4699620	4704820	function could also pick up a minus sign overall and guess what, both possibilities
4704820	4707740	are realized in the real world.
4707740	4712540	There are particles who when they get interchanged, identical particles, when they get interchanged
4712540	4718140	their wave function is unchanged and we call those bosons and there are other particles
4718140	4724440	whose wave functions when we interchange them pick up a minus sign and we call those fermions.
4724440	4728920	And the physical behavior of these kinds of particles is very different.
4728920	4732100	Think about fermions because that's the really interesting case here.
4732100	4737300	A fermion set of fermion particles have the property that when you take these two particles
4737300	4743300	and you interchange them, then the overall wave function picks up a minus sign.
4743300	4749460	So what happens if you try to take two fermions and put them in the same exact quantum state?
4749460	4754420	You could imagine trying to do that, two electrons with exactly the same wave function just overlapping
4754420	4760780	each other, but then interchanging them doesn't do anything.
4760780	4764460	They're literally already in the same state, you didn't do anything to it when you interchange
4764460	4769900	them, but we have a rule that says the wave function has to pick up a minus sign.
4769900	4773620	How is it possible for a wave function to pick up a minus sign when you didn't change
4773620	4774940	the wave function at all?
4774940	4776580	And the answer is it's not.
4776580	4779420	That wave function would have to be strictly zero.
4779420	4783900	So these fermions, these particles that pick up a minus sign under interchange of identical
4783900	4790300	particles have a property that they cannot be in the same quantum state.
4790300	4795340	For any quantum state, there can only be one fermion in it at a time.
4795340	4800820	Or more informally, fermions take up space.
4800820	4801820	Bosons are the opposite.
4801820	4805900	Bosons, if you have two identical particles in the same quantum state, that's great because
4805900	4808820	when you interchange them, nothing happens, and indeed, if they're already in the same
4808820	4810900	quantum state, nothing would happen.
4810900	4814700	So physically, this corresponds to very different behavior.
4814700	4819900	The fact that fermions cannot be in the same quantum state is the Pauli exclusion principle,
4819900	4824660	which Pauli actually meant before we really understood fermions and bosons.
4824660	4827500	But it's why atoms are interesting.
4827500	4835100	It's why matter has the shapes and configurations that it does because you can't put electrons
4835100	4839620	over and over in the same quantum state orbiting an atom.
4839620	4840620	Electrons have spins.
4840620	4842020	They can be spin up and spin down.
4842020	4848100	So in any one spatially definite wave function, you can put two different electrons in there
4848100	4850900	because their spins can be absolutely aligned.
4850900	4852660	But then that's all you can do.
4852660	4856100	Then you got to go into more complicated looking spatial wave functions, and that is the origin
4856100	4857740	of all of chemistry.
4857740	4863620	So the Pauli exclusion principle, which can be derived in quantum field theory from the
4863620	4870180	properties of identical particles that get a minus sign under their interchange, is really,
4870180	4871620	really super-duper important.
4871620	4876380	Whereas for bosons, they like to pile up on top of each other.
4876380	4878180	They actually prefer it.
4878180	4884820	So bosons, like photons, for example, very naturally pile on top of each other, and that's
4884820	4888740	what gives rise to classical-looking force fields.
4888740	4893660	That's why the electric field, the magnetic field, the gravitational field, these are
4893660	4900940	all fields that we absolutely come into contact with in the ordinary classical macroscopic
4900940	4901940	world.
4901940	4902940	Why?
4902940	4908580	Because they are boson excitations that have piled on top of each other by a huge amount
4908580	4910060	until they look classical.
4910060	4911740	That's perfectly allowed.
4911740	4915660	Whereas fermions take up space, that's why matter is solid.
4915660	4919300	That's why the table in front of me right now doesn't collapse because the electrons
4919300	4923620	have definite shapes, the wave functions of the electrons.
4923620	4928460	I won't go into it right now, but one thing I've rant about at a brief period in the
4928460	4932340	book is this idea that atoms are mostly empty space.
4932340	4933780	No, they're not.
4933780	4937580	Atoms are mostly wave function, and those wave functions take up space, and that fact
4937580	4939260	is not merely philosophical.
4939260	4940620	It's crucially important.
4940620	4942580	It's why matter is solid.
4942580	4945820	Don't listen to people who tell you that atoms are mostly empty space.
4945820	4950300	Anyway, you might have noticed, if you hang around in the wrong street corners and know
4950300	4956020	a little bit about particle physics and quantum field theory, that I defined the fermion-boson
4956060	4961380	distinction as what happens under the interchange of two particles.
4961380	4968740	I defined the spin distinction, the distinction between particles of spin 0, 1, 2, etc., versus
4968740	4975380	particles with spin 1, 1, 3, halves, etc., as what happens under the rotation of a single
4975380	4977180	particle.
4977180	4981740	You might be confused because you might be remembering that people told you that bosons
4981740	4987580	are particles of spin 0, 1, 2, fermions are particles of spin 1, 1, 3, halves, 5, halves,
4987580	4988580	etc.
4988580	4991020	Why did that connection not get made?
4991020	4995220	The answer is that connection exists, but it's not a definition.
4995220	4997540	It's a theorem that you can prove.
4997540	5005500	You can relate using techniques from relativistic quantum field theory, the transformation properties
5005500	5012740	of a single particle wave function under rotation to the transformation properties of a two-particle
5012740	5018860	wave function under interchange, and those minus signs that we talked about in both cases
5018860	5021140	cancel each other out.
5021140	5027460	So there's a theorem, the spin statistics theorem, that says that the particles that
5027460	5033620	pick up a minus sign under a 360-degree rotation are exactly identical, are the same as the
5033660	5040220	particles who pick up a minus sign under the interchange of two particles in the wave function.
5040220	5045740	So therefore you can prove that fermions, which are defined as particles that can't
5045740	5051420	be in the same quantum state, particles that take up space, must have half integer spins,
5051420	5058540	1, 1, 1, 3, halves, etc., electrons are fermions, neutrinos, quarks, etc., bosons, the particles
5058540	5064300	whose wave function are unchanged under a rotation are exactly, nope, sorry, I said
5064300	5069700	that exactly wrong, didn't I, bosons, the particles whose wave function are unchanged
5069700	5075780	under the interchange of two identical particles coincide exactly with those particles who
5075780	5079940	pick up whose wave functions are unchanged when you do a 360-degree rotation.
5079940	5081580	That's the spin statistics theorem.
5081580	5083460	We didn't just prove it right there.
5083460	5088520	In fact, there's like controversy in the literature about who really has proven the spin statistics
5088540	5094540	theorem, because there's a lot of hand-wavy arguments that kind of sound like a proof,
5094540	5098340	but really don't rely on relativistic quantum field theory, and therefore they can't be
5098340	5103440	right because the theorem itself actually does rely on relativistic quantum field theory.
5103440	5108220	But what we're trying to do here is give you a feeling for why there is this relationship
5108220	5110340	between spin and statistics.
5110340	5116820	The statistics being the question about whether or not the field particle excitations act
5116920	5118920	like fermions or bosons.
5118920	5119920	Okay.
5119920	5126800	So, that's an example of how you start from this single unified idea.
5126800	5130800	Everything is fields subject to the rules of quantum mechanics, and you ask yourself,
5130800	5134160	okay, so what kinds of fields could there be?
5134160	5138680	And the answer are, you know, fields whose wave functions change in different ways under
5138680	5142320	rotations, and you invent bosons and fermions.
5142820	5147660	Naturally comes out of the combination of relativity with quantum field theory, which
5147660	5149820	is really quite fun.
5149820	5156620	Now of course, the real fun comes when you let these particles, or these fields, interact
5156620	5158380	with each other, okay?
5158380	5163340	And that's where you get into Feynman diagrams, and renormalization, and infinity, and effective
5163340	5165380	field theory, and the whole bit.
5165380	5170060	If you want to know what a virtual particle really is, read the book.
5170060	5174120	It's a way of talking about the behavior of quantum fields.
5174120	5178960	Virtual particles are not real particles, but they are useful ways of talking about the
5178960	5182840	behavior of quantum fields when other particles scatter off of each other.
5182840	5190240	Now, I will confess, when I was thinking about this solo podcast to advertise the book,
5190240	5194640	I was overwhelmed with the number of things I could possibly talk about.
5194640	5199160	And really, the thing that I think is the most important thing that I talk about in
5199160	5202340	the book is the idea of effective field theory.
5202340	5207780	An effective field theory comes from thinking about the fact that when you scatter particles
5207780	5213300	off of each other, and you use Feynman diagrams to calculate the likelihood of that scattering
5213300	5216980	event happening, very frequently the answer is infinity, right?
5216980	5219740	The famous infinities of quantum field theory.
5219740	5224180	And Feynman and Schwinger and Tomonaga and others figured out ways to subtract off the
5224180	5227860	infinities and get finite answers, and it all works very, very well.
5227880	5230080	But it was never very satisfying.
5230080	5235000	So effective field theory is an idea that came along in the 60s and 70s, and is the
5235000	5239640	way that modern physicists think, and you were never told this, and this is very frustrating
5239640	5245280	to me that the popular discussions of quantum field theory never mentioned this central
5245280	5250360	organizing principle of the field, the effective field theory paradigm.
5250360	5256640	And basically Ken Wilson said, look, the reason why you get infinities when you scatter these
5256660	5261820	particles off of each other is because you're summing up contributions from virtual particles
5261820	5264820	with arbitrarily high energies.
5264820	5268460	And in quantum field theory, high energy means short wavelength, okay?
5268460	5269460	There's a relationship.
5269460	5271460	Short of the wavelength, the higher the energy.
5271460	5274020	Same thing is true in ordinary light, right?
5274020	5278500	A photon with a short wavelength corresponds to a higher energy particle.
5278500	5282940	And Wilson says, you don't know what's going on at these short distances and high energies.
5282940	5284820	So you should just be honest.
5284820	5286840	You should admit you don't know it.
5286840	5293000	And he figured out a mathematical procedure for putting on a cutoff on your theory and
5293000	5298680	saying, here is the energy below which I think I understand physics and above which I don't
5298680	5300240	understand physics.
5300240	5306640	So I can use my quantum field theory knowledge to write down a theory that only is supposed
5306640	5312440	to apply in those regimes with energies below the cutoff.
5312440	5314860	That is to say, only in the regime I understand.
5314860	5322360	I'm ignoring things that go on at higher energies that I don't understand except for the effects
5322360	5327820	that they have on lower energy, longer wavelength particles and fields.
5327820	5329620	That's the effective field theory paradigm.
5329620	5330620	It works super well.
5330620	5333540	It's the most important thing, but I will confess.
5333540	5336140	So I did a, you know, I want to give the people what they want.
5336140	5337140	You know me.
5337140	5338380	I'm here to serve.
5338380	5344960	And so I went on to Patreon where I'm the Minescape podcast has a Patreon page with
5344960	5347160	wonderful supporters.
5347160	5351880	And so you could be a supporter by the way, patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll.
5351880	5355320	And I asked, I said, like, what are the things in quantum field theory you most want to hear
5355320	5359720	about in the solo podcast effective field theory did not get a lot of votes.
5359720	5364080	I got to say the votes were for, you know, where do particles come from symmetries, things
5364080	5365080	like that.
5365080	5366340	What are you talking about?
5366340	5371460	If you want more on the beauty and elegance and power of effective field theory, read the
5371460	5372460	book.
5372460	5373620	I promise you that it is there.
5373620	5378740	A lot is hiding at short distances and high energies, but we know how to deal with it.
5378740	5385740	So giving the people what they want, let's instead turn to the completing this picture
5385740	5387820	of what kinds of fields are there.
5387820	5389220	I said there are bosons and fermions.
5389220	5391500	These are two different kinds of fields.
5391520	5395080	They're related to the spins of the particles that you get when you look at the quantum
5395080	5396080	wave functions.
5396080	5400520	Okay, but we know that there's more to it than that.
5400520	5407280	We know that photons and other force carrying particles have special properties.
5407280	5408280	They're bosons.
5408280	5412040	They're spin one bosons, except for the graviton, which is spin two.
5412040	5413840	But they're a little bit different.
5413840	5414840	There's something going on there.
5414840	5416240	What is going on there?
5416240	5420160	And the answer is once again, a question of symmetry.
5420160	5425300	And now it's an internal symmetry question rather than a spacetime symmetry question.
5425300	5430700	So spacetime symmetry is, like I said, rotations, translations in space, boosts, changing the
5430700	5432500	velocity and so forth.
5432500	5436700	But we can also, in quantum field theory, there's a new thing that can happen.
5436700	5443940	We have a set of fields, and rather than rotating in space, we simply rotate the fields into
5443940	5446540	each other at each point in space.
5446540	5447540	Okay?
5447540	5452440	So if we have two fields, phi one and phi two, the Greek letter phi is the simplest thing
5452440	5458440	that we use for a spin zero scalar bosonic field in quantum field theory.
5458440	5462040	We always call it phi ever since, I don't know, ever since the day.
5462040	5467240	And so if we have two fields with exactly the same masses and the same interactions,
5467240	5470720	phi one and phi two, we could transform them into each other.
5470720	5475160	We could exchange phi one for phi two, or we could even think of phi one and phi two
5475180	5480940	as defining a little two-dimensional vector space and rotating them by some arbitrary
5480940	5483300	angle into each other.
5483300	5487840	And if they're truly identical, if they're truly the same kind of field, we would have
5487840	5490180	no way of knowing that we had done that rotation.
5490180	5493780	It would be a symmetry of the theory.
5493780	5495340	That's really what a symmetry is.
5495340	5500940	A symmetry is just a way of saying there's something we can do that doesn't matter, that
5500940	5502440	has no physical effects.
5503020	5507900	When we were talking about rotations or spatial translations, we said it doesn't matter how
5507900	5510700	you rotate your experiment.
5510700	5514380	Time translations say it doesn't matter when you do your experiment.
5514380	5518220	Spatial translations say it doesn't matter where you do your experiment.
5518220	5522600	Boosts say it doesn't matter how fast you're moving when you do your experiment, right?
5522600	5528220	So these internal symmetries are saying it doesn't matter how we rotate these fields
5528220	5530060	into each other.
5530060	5532600	So naturally, this is something that could happen.
5532600	5533920	It turns out it does happen.
5533920	5537320	It's going to happen a lot in quantum field theory.
5537320	5542360	And so we need to think carefully about the mathematics of these symmetry transformations.
5542360	5546720	And so group theory is the mathematical structure for thinking about that.
5546720	5551120	And we talk in the whole chapter on symmetries a lot about group theory.
5551120	5553840	But let's simplify it here down to the bare bones.
5553840	5559360	Let's imagine we have three fields, let's say, three fields that are more or less identical
5559380	5561660	to each other, okay?
5561660	5563940	But we can rotate them into each other.
5563940	5568020	So what is the set of possible ways to rotate three fields into each other?
5568020	5569620	It's just like space.
5569620	5571340	Like space is three-dimensional.
5571340	5572740	We have x, y, and z axes.
5572740	5574740	We can rotate those together.
5574740	5581340	And the set of all possible transformations in a three-dimensional space, rotating things
5581340	5586180	and not doing anything else and not stretching them, just rotating them into each other,
5586180	5588740	is called SO3.
5588740	5592680	It's a special orthogonal group in three dimensions.
5592680	5598520	If you had eight fields that were identical to each other, but there were eight different
5598520	5604000	ones, and you could rotate them into each other, you would say they had an SO8 symmetry
5604000	5605000	and so forth.
5605000	5607800	It's just a number of fields that matters.
5607800	5615120	More often in quantum field theory, you will come across the group SU3 or SU2 or SU8 or
5615120	5621900	whatever, and that change from SO to SU reflects the fact that very often our quantum fields
5621900	5625180	are complex valued fields.
5625180	5630120	So each field is not a number at each point in space, but a complex number at each point
5630120	5631380	in space.
5631380	5634580	So this is all to say, don't be intimidated.
5634580	5641280	When you hear people say, the standard model of particle physics has a gauge group SU2 cross
5641280	5642720	U1.
5642720	5647780	That's just a way of saying there are three fields that are complex valued that get rotated
5647780	5649620	into each other.
5649620	5653280	There's a separate set of two fields that are also complex valued that get rotated into
5653280	5654280	each other.
5654280	5655640	That's SU2.
5655640	5661980	And then you could have a single complex valued field that can still in some sense rotate
5661980	5667540	into itself because a complex valued field has a real part and an imaginary part.
5667540	5670820	There is something called the complex plane where we have a complex number.
5670840	5676160	We write the real value of the number on the horizontal axis, the imaginary value on the
5676160	5677160	vertical axis.
5677160	5682280	Well, you can rotate the complex plane, and that rotation is called U1.
5682280	5689400	So these are all just fancy ways of talking about rotating fields into each other.
5689400	5690560	And it doesn't matter.
5690560	5695760	It doesn't matter what rotation you do, the same physical predictions will be made.
5695760	5697560	That's what makes it asymmetry.
5697900	5703140	Indeed, this idea of having three fields that we rotate into each other is a very simple
5703140	5704140	example.
5704140	5705140	They are called quarks.
5705140	5706140	Okay.
5706140	5709460	You may have heard that quarks come in three colors.
5709460	5713580	There are red quarks, green quarks, and blue quarks.
5713580	5714860	That's not quite right.
5714860	5718180	Like so many things that you've been told.
5718180	5722260	You've been told something that is not quite right, but good enough.
5722260	5724100	And now you're ready for the real stuff.
5724100	5729360	The real stuff is not that there are three different quarks, but there is a three-dimensional
5729360	5732160	space of quarks.
5732160	5736440	So the subtle difference I'm pointing to here is it's not that there are red quarks,
5736440	5738280	green quarks, and blue quarks.
5738280	5743920	There are quarks that every quark, I should say, should be thought of as a combination
5743920	5747480	of a bit of red, a bit of green, and a bit of blue.
5747480	5748640	And you can choose.
5748640	5750320	You can rotate your axes.
5750320	5752880	So you define what you mean by red, green, or blue.
5752900	5754900	There's no actual reality to it.
5754900	5756380	It has nothing to do with the real colors.
5756380	5757380	Okay.
5757380	5760060	You're not looking at a blue quark and it looks blue or anything like that.
5760060	5761860	This is just a label.
5761860	5765300	R, G, and B are completely equivalent to each other.
5765300	5769220	These three-dimensional vector space of quark colors.
5769220	5774140	And the real statement is not there are three different colors of quarks, but that quarks,
5774140	5779420	every quark field is an element at every point in space of this three-dimensional, three-complex
5779420	5782260	dimensional, I should say, vector space.
5782260	5790880	There is an SU3 symmetry rotating the red, green, and blue axes into each other.
5790880	5792200	Three different kinds of quarks.
5792200	5794040	We conventionally labeled them by color.
5794040	5797280	There's a symmetry where we can rotate them into each other, SU3.
5797280	5798280	Very, very nice.
5798280	5802000	And then we'll talk about in the book what that means, SU3, et cetera, et cetera, how
5802000	5803000	to implement it.
5803000	5804000	Great.
5804000	5805640	So what?
5805640	5807200	What difference does that make, really?
5807220	5812020	Well, you instantly know there is a conserved quantity, because there is a symmetry.
5812020	5815820	In Neurthus Theorem tells you there's always a conserved quantity when there's a symmetry.
5815820	5820700	So that's nice, but it isn't quite the punch line.
5820700	5822420	The punch line comes from this.
5822420	5825720	Let's imagine we have an even better symmetry.
5825720	5831100	So we have these three fields we can rotate into each other, call that rotation SU3.
5831100	5832260	That's nice.
5832280	5838840	But what if I want to rotate the axes of my red, green, blue space in one way at some
5838840	5843240	point and in a completely different way at some other point?
5843240	5845040	I didn't say that I could do that.
5845040	5848040	I'm just asking whether it would be possible.
5848040	5853280	So there is something called a global symmetry transformation where we take what we've defined
5853280	5860000	to be red, green, and blue, and we rotate them everywhere all at once in some particular
5860000	5861000	way.
5861020	5865020	It's a global transformation of what we mean by red, green, and blue.
5865020	5866020	That's fine.
5866020	5868900	No one really is bothered by that.
5868900	5875060	But if you want, if you have the aspiration of saying, I would like to separately define
5875060	5882260	what I mean by red, green, and blue independently at every point in space, can I do that?
5882260	5887740	That would be an enormously bigger symmetry, because I'm separately able to define what
5887740	5890980	I mean by red, green, and blue all throughout space.
5891000	5893760	That's a lot going on.
5893760	5898880	And the answer is you can do that, but you have to sort of figure, you have to make sure
5898880	5902120	that you're allowed to, that it's a well-defined thing.
5902120	5906240	Because whether we call a quark at any one point in space a quark field, whether we call
5906240	5911640	it red, green, or blue, or some combination thereof, that's completely arbitrary, right?
5911640	5913520	That makes no physical difference.
5913520	5919280	But if we have two different points in space, and we have the same quark field, remember
5919280	5923460	the quark field will take values at every point in space.
5923460	5925540	And let's ask the following question.
5925540	5930380	At these two different points in space, does the quark field have the same color?
5930380	5931900	Or does it have some different colors?
5931900	5934340	Is it rotated by 90 degrees or whatever?
5934340	5936300	That should be a well-defined question, right?
5936300	5938780	Is it the same color or a different color?
5938780	5944260	Well, if I'm allowed to rotate my axes separately at every point in space, it seems like I can't
5944280	5949560	answer that question, because I could have some quark field that I am just simply defining
5949560	5955760	to be red at one point in space by appropriately rotating my little red, green, blue axes.
5955760	5959760	And again, these axes are completely imaginary, like not imaginary in the imaginary number
5959760	5961280	sense, but conceptual.
5961280	5965320	They're not axes of literal space, they're in quark space, okay?
5965320	5969320	There's three different directions the quark field can be vibrating, the red direction,
5969320	5971960	the green direction, the blue direction.
5971980	5976340	And likewise, okay, so I have a red quark at one point in space, and I rotate my axes
5976340	5980340	so that at some other point in space, it's also a red quark.
5980340	5981340	But is that legit?
5981340	5985540	I mean, I could have rotated it, so it was a blue quark, and there's a physical difference
5985540	5986540	there.
5986540	5993340	So what I'm getting at is, if you want to be able to have this mega-symmetry that lets
5993340	6000060	you rotate in red, green, blue space independently at every point in space, you also need some
6000080	6002240	way to compare.
6002240	6006720	You need some way to answer the question, what is the value, let's put it this way,
6006720	6013360	how does the value of the color of the quark change as I travel along some path, okay?
6013360	6019720	I can connect these two points in space with some path, and I can ask how the axes that
6019720	6024080	define red, green, and blue are changing as I move down the path.
6024080	6028440	So I need some information that lets me answer that question.
6028460	6031220	How do these axes change as I go down the path?
6031220	6034940	How does the definition of red, green, and blue change?
6034940	6039500	It's not a rigid structure like it would have been if I just had that global symmetry.
6039500	6044500	Now I'm able to change what I mean by red, green, and blue independently everywhere.
6044500	6048540	Something needs to absorb the information of how I did that.
6048540	6049540	What would do that?
6049540	6053500	What would carry that information about how I defined red, green, and blue at every point
6053500	6054700	in space?
6054700	6057140	The answer is a field.
6057160	6058560	I need another kind of field.
6058560	6059880	I already have the quark field.
6059880	6063720	In fact, I have this sort of three different kinds of quark field, the red, green, and
6063720	6066680	blue, three different directions in which the quark can rotate.
6066680	6073080	But now I need an entirely new kind of field to carry the information that tells me how
6073080	6078680	to relate the red, green, and blue axes at different points in space.
6078680	6080960	And the mathematicians know how to do this.
6080960	6086360	This is called a connection field, and the mathematical subject that studies these things
6086420	6087820	is called fiber bundles.
6087820	6091900	It's a subject within differential geometry.
6091900	6092820	You can read all about it.
6092820	6095540	Again, we're not going to go into all those details.
6095540	6099780	But the point, and this is a big point, and it's another one of those miraculous points
6099780	6106340	that is very, very important, is that you can do these independent symmetry transformations
6106340	6111700	at different points, but only if you introduce a new field that lets you keep track of the
6111700	6115700	information relating what's going on at different points.
6115800	6121160	So these symmetries that can happen independently at every different point are called gauge
6121160	6126520	symmetries, or simply local symmetries in contrast with the global symmetries that
6126520	6127880	we were talking about.
6127880	6134760	To start, gauge symmetries, unlike global symmetries, come along with the new field,
6134760	6137400	the gauge field, aka the connection.
6137400	6141400	Those are the same thing, the gauge field, the connection field, the field that keeps
6141420	6146860	track of how your axes are changing from point to point in space, okay?
6146860	6152740	It's much like in space time, if you go back to book one of the biggest ideas, in space
6152740	6157780	time, just to compare the question, what direction is a vector pointing in?
6157780	6161420	You need to be able to parallel transport vectors from one point to another, and you
6161420	6163660	need a connection field to be able to do that.
6163660	6167180	That connection depends on the metric, in general relativity.
6167180	6170300	Here, in gauge theories of particle physics, there's no metric.
6170360	6172400	There just is the connection.
6172400	6175280	That's a field that shows up as the gauge field.
6175280	6178080	And so, what does that field do?
6178080	6179320	What are its dynamics?
6179320	6180320	How does it behave?
6180320	6182040	How does it interact with other fields?
6182040	6183720	There's a whole bunch of questions.
6183720	6186920	You're going to read the book, so you're going to know the answer to these questions.
6186920	6194720	But the punchline is that field, that connection field, you need to implement the gauge symmetry
6194720	6196640	is the force field.
6196660	6202980	It is the electromagnetic field for electromagnetism, or the gravitational field for gravity.
6202980	6208740	And it gives rise to particles, photons for electromagnetism, gravitons for gravity.
6208740	6213020	And there's also the nuclear forces, the strong and weak nuclear forces.
6213020	6217620	Mathematically, they are boson fields, and you can derive that.
6217620	6223820	And there are interactions with other fields, the way that the force carrying fields interact
6223840	6229160	with the non-force carrying fields, the electrons and neutrinos and quarks and so forth, is entirely
6229160	6233440	determined by the demands of this symmetry, okay?
6233440	6238120	Given the fact that you want this symmetry to exist, not only do you need this gauge
6238120	6242440	field, but you know how the gauge field interacts with other fields.
6242440	6244840	And you know more than that, the symmetry is super powerful.
6244840	6248920	This is why physicists sort of start jumping up and down when they talk about symmetry.
6248920	6252840	They get very excited, because it really is a very powerful concept.
6252840	6259500	You can derive features of the dynamics of the gauge fields all by itself.
6259500	6263980	So in particular, there's one very, very important feature that kind of puzzled people for a
6263980	6264980	long time.
6264980	6267100	Let me back up to just mention.
6267100	6271580	The idea of a gauge field was kind of understood by Maxwell.
6271580	6275540	He understood that his electric field and magnetic field could be derived from a more
6275540	6280020	fundamental single thing that we would now call the gauge field.
6280020	6287080	It wasn't until the 1950s that Yang and Mills suggested generalizing this idea of the electromagnetic
6287080	6291040	gauge field to more complicated gauge fields, SU2, SU3, etc.
6291040	6295760	And it took a while, it took until the 70s, really, for us to figure out how to make that
6295760	6297720	happen, okay?
6297720	6302800	But it turns out that that symmetry, this SU2 or SU3 symmetry or whatever it is, has
6302800	6308120	a very direct implication for the particles that arise from these gauge fields.
6308620	6313620	The implication is, the particles have to have zero mass.
6313620	6317020	And again, this is something where you will be delighted when you read the book, because
6317020	6322740	you will see why that's true, because it comes right out of the equations.
6322740	6328780	Given what you mean by mass, mass is a particular kind of potential energy that the fields
6328780	6334420	can have, and there's no way to have that kind of potential energy and respect the symmetry
6334420	6335420	at the same time.
6335720	6339800	So there's a direct line from saying, there's a gauge symmetry to saying, and there's a
6339800	6341520	massless particle.
6341520	6345920	And that's beautiful and lovely, because we have the photon, which is a massless particle.
6345920	6348440	We have the graviton, which is a massless particle.
6348440	6352520	I know we haven't detected gravitons yet, and people get fussy about it, but if you
6352520	6357920	believe the basic features of general relativity and quantum mechanics, gravitons will exist.
6357920	6361040	They're just too weakly interacting to ever be detected.
6361040	6364800	I would not have any skepticism that they really exist.
6364800	6371340	But the problem is that those are the only two massless gauge bosons that we know about,
6371340	6375300	the photon and the graviton, right, at least that we knew about back in the day.
6375300	6380060	So when we're thinking about this back in the 50s and 60s, people were like, wait a minute,
6380060	6382260	this is a problem.
6382260	6387140	We would love it if this beautiful mathematical structure of gauge symmetry and the associated
6387140	6393460	fields could somehow help us understand not only electromagnetism and gravity, but also
6393600	6395440	the nuclear forces.
6395440	6399440	There are two nuclear forces, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force, not the
6399440	6402160	most romantic names I know, but that's what we're stuck with, okay?
6402160	6404640	The weak force and the strong force.
6404640	6407360	Both of them are short-range forces.
6407360	6409560	That's why you don't notice them in our everyday lives.
6409560	6415000	In our everyday lives, we really only notice electricity, magnetism, or gravity, as far
6415000	6418200	as bosonic force fields are concerned.
6418200	6424700	So if Yang and Mills have this idea about gauge symmetries, but gauge symmetries imply
6424700	6430180	that the force-carrying particles are massless, and there's this little mathematical trick
6430180	6435340	you can do to show that massless particles always give rise to long-range forces, which
6435340	6438980	it seems that you can, then we're stuck, right?
6438980	6442540	Because the things that we want to explain experimentally are short-range forces and
6442540	6445860	it seems like the idea doesn't work.
6445880	6453880	Of course, physicists are not as easily dissuaded as that.
6453880	6457080	They will keep trying, and they should keep trying.
6457080	6460920	This is also true for modern theories where we're thinking about the multiverse or string
6460920	6463000	theory or loop quantum gravity or whatever.
6463000	6468000	You will very often say, okay, if my theory works in a certain way, I predict X, X is
6468000	6469840	not true, right?
6469840	6471080	But you don't give up.
6471080	6474800	You say, well, maybe I didn't think hard enough about what my theory really predicts.
6474820	6480140	It's absolutely the situation they were in in the 50s and 60s, thinking about gauge symmetries.
6480140	6485780	The idea was so incredibly attractive, they wanted to make it work, even though it predicted
6485780	6488260	massless bosons that were not observed.
6488260	6489820	So what is going on?
6489820	6495420	Well, it turns out there are several different ways to get rid of these massless bosons,
6495420	6496820	and nature uses all of them.
6496820	6501500	Well, there's two very, very straightforward ways, and nature uses both of them.
6501500	6502940	Let's put it that way.
6502960	6507680	So we can think about this in terms of phases of our gauge symmetry.
6507680	6514600	Just like water can be in the liquid-solid or gas phase, a gauge field can appear in
6514600	6515680	different phases.
6515680	6519200	Not really depending on temperature, although that's also true, but it really depends on
6519200	6526400	other fundamental variables, fundamental properties of the underlying physical equations of motion.
6526400	6529800	So one phase is the so-called Coulomb phase.
6529820	6534820	Coulomb's law is just the electromagnetic version of Newton's inverse square law for gravity.
6534820	6537660	So you could call it the Newton phase, if you wanted to.
6537660	6545220	The Coulomb phase is the phase where the gauge bosons are massless and can easily travel
6545220	6546980	throughout the universe.
6546980	6553500	Photons and gravitons both qualify for that, and in that case, you have long-range forces
6553500	6558060	with an inverse square law, and indeed, for both electricity, magnetism, and gravity,
6558080	6561440	you have long-range forces with an inverse square law.
6561440	6567720	It's fun and amusing to see the fact that Coulomb's law and Newton's law of gravity
6567720	6573680	are both inverse square laws coming out of an underlying gauge symmetry for the forces
6573680	6576200	that give rise to them.
6576200	6580400	But there are other phases these gauge symmetries can be in.
6580400	6584200	So one phase happens when you have the symmetry.
6584200	6592820	You have this gauge symmetry that would and does give rise to gauge bosons, but the symmetry
6592820	6596060	is broken spontaneously.
6596060	6598220	What does that mean?
6598220	6602660	Spontaneous breaking of a symmetry means when the symmetry is broken, not because the fundamental
6602660	6608340	deep-down equations of motion violate the symmetry, but because the specific configuration
6608340	6611140	of the world violates the symmetry.
6611160	6619280	For example, rotations in three-dimensional space are a symmetry of the laws of physics,
6619280	6622840	but here on Earth, there's a difference between up and down.
6622840	6628840	There's an arrow of space in a very, very direct kind of way, and that is not surprising
6628840	6629840	to us.
6629840	6631760	No one thinks that's because of the fundamental laws of physics.
6631760	6634200	Maybe Aristotle did, but now we know better.
6634200	6636840	We know it's because we have the Earth underneath our feet.
6636860	6643020	The actual configuration of matter is breaking the symmetry between up and down, even though
6643020	6645460	the laws of physics do not.
6645460	6649980	Now strictly speaking, that's not a great example of what we're calling spontaneous symmetry
6649980	6656780	breaking because spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theory happens, again, because
6656780	6662180	the configuration of the world breaks the symmetry, but even in the vacuum, that's the
6662180	6663340	new thing.
6663340	6665020	So the Earth is not the vacuum.
6665040	6670360	The Earth is a big pile of energy, pile of matter and particles and so forth, so that
6670360	6672000	can break the symmetry.
6672000	6676400	But what if empty space itself could break a symmetry?
6676400	6679280	That would be a whole different kind of thing.
6679280	6684240	And this was studied, I forget whether it was the 50s or 60s where they started studying
6684240	6689520	it, but Yoshiro Nambu, my former colleague at the University of Chicago, and Jeffrey
6689520	6694720	Goldstone and others, studied how you could break a symmetry.
6694740	6696740	And the idea is actually quite simple.
6696740	6699740	You have yet another field, right?
6699740	6700740	And guess what?
6700740	6703740	This is going to grow up into what we now call the Higgs field.
6703740	6707780	So the Higgs field is an example of this kind of field, but we'll get there in a second.
6707780	6713020	If you have another field, not a fermion, not like a quark or an electron or something
6713020	6719700	like that, but a scalar field, a bosonic field that transforms under the symmetry, okay?
6719700	6724100	So let's say you have an SU2 symmetry because you kind of do in the weak interactions, which
6724120	6725960	is what we're going to get to.
6725960	6727880	So you have an SU2 symmetry.
6727880	6734760	So for this scalar field, you have two directions in which the scalar field can vibrate, and
6734760	6739400	there's an SU2 rotation that rotates them into each other, okay?
6739400	6747520	But if the value of the field in empty space were zero, then not only would the field's
6747520	6753920	plural be invariant under the symmetry, but the configuration of these fields in the vacuum
6753940	6757420	would be invariant under this symmetry because the configuration would be centered around
6757420	6763260	zero, and if you rotate a plane around the origin, nothing seems to happen.
6763260	6768180	But what if in empty space, the field was at a non-zero value?
6768180	6772940	What if the energy of the field were lower when it had some non-zero value than when
6772940	6775540	it were at zero, when it was at zero?
6775540	6776540	You could do that.
6776540	6778780	You can easily write down equations that make that happen.
6778780	6782740	If you want to look up the details, it's the Mexican hat potential that you might have
6782760	6790040	seen under discussions of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and when that happens, the specific
6790040	6797280	value that the field takes in empty space is not invariant under the symmetry.
6797280	6802680	So the equations are invariant, but the value the field has is not invariant.
6802680	6806600	That is what is called spontaneous symmetry breaking because it kind of doesn't matter
6806600	6808840	what direction the field is pointing in.
6808860	6815700	It's pointing in some direction, even in empty space, and so now there's an answer to the
6815700	6820620	question when some other thing, like a quark or an electron, vibrates, you can ask the
6820620	6825540	question, is it vibrating in the same direction as the scalar field that's breaking the symmetry
6825540	6827820	or perpendicularly to it or whatever?
6827820	6832780	The symmetry has been broken in a way that it wasn't before, okay?
6832780	6838580	Sadly, this has not immediately solved the problems because Goldstone proved a theorem,
6838580	6843720	Goldstone's theorem, that says that when you have spontaneous symmetry breaking, you
6843720	6846600	will have a new kind of massless particle.
6846600	6850520	The scalar field will turn into a massless particle, and again, those particles were
6850520	6855120	not observed, and so people were still a little flummoxed.
6855120	6860640	But what they soon realized is that there's a big important difference between the global
6860640	6865080	symmetries that we talked about originally, where the symmetry has to be done everywhere
6865100	6870660	uniformly, versus the gauge symmetries where you have this connection field that keeps track
6870660	6872900	of what direction you're pointing in.
6872900	6878980	The Goldstone's theorem analysis that predicted the existence of a new kind of massless particle
6878980	6881020	was only for global symmetries.
6881020	6887180	When you do the same thing for gauge symmetries, you do not get a massless particle.
6887180	6893260	Not only is the scalar field not giving you an extra massless particle, but your gauge
6893280	6898720	fields, like the photon or the equivalent of the photon, get heavy.
6898720	6903560	They go from being massless to being massive, and in every single quantum field theory textbook
6903560	6909840	in the world, what you're told is that the gauge bosons eat the scalar bosons, the Higgs
6909840	6913920	bosons, and they become massive by doing that.
6913920	6919160	So you go from a theory with a lot of massless particles to a theory with no massless particles
6919160	6923240	through spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry.
6923240	6929460	And that is the origin in the standard model of particle physics of the W and Z bosons.
6929460	6938220	You have the Higgs boson, which is a spin-zero boson that is, as we say, charged under the
6938220	6940420	SU2 symmetry.
6940420	6943300	It rotates under the SU2 symmetry.
6943300	6947860	And so do all the other particles of the standard model, the electrons and the quarks, etc.
6947880	6954320	But that Higgs boson gets an expectation value that is not zero in empty space, and that
6954320	6959640	gives mass to the gauge bosons, which we observe at the end of the day as the W and
6959640	6962120	Z bosons, and they are indeed massive.
6962120	6967800	And it is because those particles are massive that the force they give rise to is a short-range
6967800	6970720	force rather than a long-range force.
6970720	6976920	So that is one way that we can have our cake needed to, that we can have massless particles
6976980	6981660	because of the gauge symmetry, but they don't appear to us at the end of the day because
6981660	6986060	they have gained mass because of spontaneous symmetry breaking.
6986060	6991620	There turns out to be a whole other way to hide the massless particles from us, and nature
6991620	6997100	takes advantage of that way in the SU3 part of the standard model.
6997100	7003100	SU3 is the gauge group, the group of symmetries for the quarks, the red, green and blue quarks,
7003120	7008680	the three dimensions of quark space that get rotated into each other by this SU3 symmetry.
7008680	7015120	And because those are colors, we call this quantum chromodynamics, or QCD, in analogy
7015120	7018600	with QED, coined from Murray-Gelman.
7018600	7025480	So QCD is a theory of the gauge symmetry in the associated force that comes from invariance
7025480	7031540	under rotations in red, green, blue internal space that the quarks live in.
7031540	7033920	And there, there's no spontaneous symmetry breaking.
7033920	7040920	The SU3 symmetry is unbroken in empty space, so the gluons, which are the gauge bosons
7042920	7047960	of that force, what we call the strong force, are massless.
7047960	7049800	Gluons are still massless.
7049800	7055640	Why then do they not give rise to a long range one over R squared force?
7055640	7059840	The answer is because of the difference between SU3 and U1.
7059840	7062980	And again, some details, we're gliding over.
7062980	7066620	The buzzwords are abelian versus non-abelian.
7066620	7070380	These are different kinds of symmetry groups that you can have.
7070380	7077620	And the SU3 symmetry group is just more complicated than the U1 symmetry group.
7077620	7080700	Electromagnetism has a very simple symmetry group, U1.
7080700	7083340	It's just rotations in a complex plane.
7083340	7087700	The SU3 symmetry group has more things going on.
7087720	7093040	And at the level of the fields, that has a crucially important implication, namely the
7093040	7099240	fields, the gluon fields, interact with each other directly in a way that photons don't
7099240	7100800	interact with each other.
7100800	7104640	Photons are the particles of the U1 gauge symmetry.
7104640	7107880	Gluons are the particles of the SU3 gauge symmetry.
7107880	7112240	But photons interact with charged particles like electrons and quarks.
7112240	7117360	They don't directly interact with other photons, indirectly they can do because of electrons
7117380	7119620	at center, but not directly.
7119620	7126940	Whereas the gluons can interact directly with other gluons because gluons also carry color
7126940	7131020	in a way that photons do not carry electric charge.
7131020	7136980	And what that means is it opens up a possibility that nature, in fact, takes advantage of,
7136980	7139740	which is what we call confinement.
7139740	7145340	You might think that since the gluons are massless, like electrical fields around an
7145360	7150640	electron, they should spread out in an inverse square kind of potential.
7150640	7154880	But in fact, the gluons keep interacting with each other.
7154880	7161560	They acquire energy by their mutual interaction with other gluons, as well as with the quarks.
7161560	7168080	And that energy dramatically changes the way that the gluon field arranges itself around
7168080	7169320	individual quarks.
7169320	7171960	It is not an inverse square law.
7171960	7179420	The force between two gluons or between two quarks mediated by gluons grows with distance,
7179420	7183300	rather than decreasing with distance as 1 over r squared.
7183300	7188380	So if you take two quarks and they're pulled together by gluons, if you try to pull them
7188380	7193700	apart, it takes more and more and more energy to get the quarks to pull apart.
7193700	7200420	And so much energy that at some point it makes more sense just to make more quarks or a quark-anti-quark
7200480	7203160	pair to be a little bit more precise.
7203160	7208400	So you just snap the string, if you like, that is connecting the flux tube, as we call
7208400	7211640	it, that is connecting the two quarks to each other.
7211640	7215440	Because of this, you can never see one quark all by itself.
7215440	7220360	Every quark is connected to other quarks held together by these gluons.
7220360	7225480	And that's why the particles we see are protons, neutrons, mesons, things like that, not the
7225480	7228140	individual quarks.
7228160	7234840	As I am recording this, and after I wrote my book, there has been an experimental claim
7234840	7240640	that we have experimentally detected what are called gluballs, which are particle-like
7240640	7244960	excitations made of nothing but gluons, no quarks at all.
7244960	7247880	So that's very exciting, it's too bad for me because I said in the book that we haven't
7247880	7251360	detected gluballs yet, but apparently we have.
7251360	7258120	Anyway, this is why the strong force is short-ranged, not because of spontaneous symmetry breaking,
7258120	7263860	but because of confinement, because the gluons interact with each other so strongly that
7263860	7268780	you can't separate individual particles from each other, and they completely distort the
7268780	7276580	shape of the gluon field away from being a long-range 1 over r squared force.
7276580	7278380	So there's a lot going on.
7278380	7283580	This is why when you take general relativity as a graduate student in physics, different
7283580	7285500	people react differently to different courses.
7285500	7287680	But general relativity is beautiful.
7287680	7293040	When you take that one semester course, you start from simple geometric postulates, and
7293040	7298040	you derive the equation of Einstein, and then you derive all these consequences, black holes
7298040	7301680	and everything, and it's so pristine and logical and lovely.
7301680	7306440	Then when you take your quantum field theory course, not only is it at least two semesters,
7306440	7312640	often three or four semesters of quantum field theory, but it's not beautiful really, not
7312640	7313640	in the same way.
7313640	7314640	It's a mess.
7314780	7319220	There's a lot going on with all these different forces, all these different symmetries, and
7319220	7321300	the field itself is just complicated.
7321300	7326620	You can easily take quantum field theory courses again and again, hopefully from different
7326620	7329720	instructors with different textbooks, and learn more and more every time.
7329720	7332820	No one would ever take general relativity more than once if they learned it correctly
7332820	7333820	the first time.
7333820	7337180	There's so much we didn't even get to talk about.
7337180	7342520	Parity violation is very, very important in the standard model of particle physics.
7342520	7346460	There are families of particles.
7346460	7350260	There are different ways that neutrinos and electrons hook up with each other versus how
7350260	7354300	quarks hook up with each other.
7354300	7360020	Let me hint at one kind of thing that I haven't been able to tell you about.
7360020	7369020	This gauge group of the strong force, SU3, like I said, it's more complex.
7369040	7374560	It's not super-duper complex, but it's a little bit more going on there, a little more structure
7374560	7379400	than the U1 gauge symmetry of electromagnetism.
7379400	7381520	The SU2 is much like SU3.
7381520	7386800	They're very similar, but because SU2 is spontaneously broken, it's a different conversation
7386800	7387800	that we have about it.
7387800	7392640	SU3 is not spontaneously broken, but it's confined.
7392640	7397120	One of the things that can happen because SU3 is a slightly different gauge group than
7397120	7404900	U1 is that you can have different vacuum configurations of the gauge fields.
7404900	7405900	What do I mean by that?
7405900	7411340	A vacuum configuration of the fields is a configuration that has zero energy, right?
7411340	7416140	But when I say a field configuration, you now know, since you've listened to this podcast,
7416140	7420700	you now know that a field configuration is a specific arrangement of the field at every
7420700	7426220	point in space, but you also know that there is a symmetry, the gauge symmetry.
7426220	7432960	I can rotate what I mean by red, green, and blue of SU3 separately at each point in space.
7432960	7441640	So really what I mean by the vacuum configuration of the field is one particular reference configuration
7441640	7446240	of the field plus any gauge transformation I want to do on it.
7446240	7448180	A gauge transformation is a symmetry.
7448180	7451520	It doesn't really change the actual field, right?
7451520	7452520	Okay.
7452520	7457380	That's just a, it sounds like a mathematical detail that I don't need to think too hard.
7457380	7461980	I should just be careful when I say what I mean by a field configuration to say, really
7461980	7466700	what I mean is a field configuration up to a possible symmetry transformation that you
7466700	7468780	might want to do.
7468780	7475860	But it turns out that in SU3, in the strong interactions, there are what we call small
7475860	7480180	gauge transformations and large gauge transformations.
7480180	7481180	And what does that mean?
7481180	7482500	What does small and large mean?
7482500	7488880	It means that there is a topology to the possible gauge transformations we can do.
7488880	7495800	It's exactly once again, this is an example of an underlying smooth thing, the gauge fields
7495800	7502120	of SU3 quantum chromodynamics, but having a discrete set of possible arrangements of
7502120	7503520	those fields.
7503520	7507680	So it's kind of like wrapping a circle around another circle.
7507680	7509760	It's actually very analogous to that.
7509760	7516060	If I have one circle, if I think like a topologist now, and I'm going to map a different circle
7516060	7520900	to my first circle, I can just take the first circle and I can map it the whole thing to
7520900	7526780	a point, or I could wrap it once around the other circle, or I could wrap it once around
7526780	7530660	the other way, or I could wrap it twice around, et cetera, right?
7530660	7535980	Even though the circles themselves are smooth manifolds, there's a discrete set of ways
7535980	7538460	that I can wrap one circle around another one.
7538460	7542280	These are called the winding numbers of these different maps.
7542280	7545480	Turns out, and again, you don't need to understand this because this is just like hinting at
7545480	7552000	some fascinating work that happened in quantum field theory in the course of the 1970s, turns
7552000	7559520	out that there are topologically non-trivial gauge transformations in SU3 that wrap the
7559520	7563080	gauge field around itself and they're associated with a winding number.
7563080	7567880	Okay, so once again, you say, all right, there's still all, it's all empty space, just empty
7567900	7572820	space and increasingly complicated configurations because they're all equivalent to each other
7572820	7580460	under the symmetry transformation, but it turns out the field can dynamically flip from
7580460	7587420	one topological configuration to another, and that is not just the vacuum.
7587420	7592100	That is, it can sort of pop out of the vacuum for a second as it winds around itself and
7592100	7595260	then settle down into a different winding number.
7595280	7600160	So you start with empty space, the vacuum, you end with empty space, the vacuum, but
7600160	7605800	through some quantum fluctuation called an instanton, you change dynamically the winding
7605800	7607640	number of the field.
7607640	7611960	And this is all, you know, this is a whole conversation that could only be had because
7611960	7613920	we're doing quantum field theory, right?
7613920	7616800	Because the fields are what the universe is made of.
7616800	7620880	They have these mathematical properties, things can happen.
7620880	7627620	And the kicker is that these instantons that are quantum transitions that change the winding
7627620	7631940	numbers of the gauge fields have a physical effect.
7631940	7636860	They give rise to masses for different mesons in different ways.
7636860	7642740	And this is called the ADA problem in QCD that is solved by thinking carefully about the
7642740	7648840	structure of the vacuum and the existence of topologically non-trivial gauge transformations.
7648840	7653220	All of which, I hope that everything before the last five minutes was completely crystal
7653220	7656500	clear and you understood everything, the last five minutes was just to make you sort of
7656500	7657500	intrigued.
7657500	7661140	There's not enough detail to possibly be completely understandable.
7661140	7666340	The point is, there's a lot going on in the standard model of particle physics.
7666340	7673340	It is an amazing structure that I didn't even mention, but of course the real punchline
7673340	7675500	is it fits the data.
7675500	7677780	It fits so much data.
7678040	7682920	When we turned on the Large Hadron Collider, of course eventually, we turned it on like
7682920	7687160	2006, blew up, fixed it, turned it on in 2008 again.
7687160	7690560	By 2012, we discovered the Higgs boson.
7690560	7694800	But before we discovered the Higgs boson, we rediscovered the entire rest of the standard
7694800	7695800	model.
7695800	7699960	All the other particles that had been discovered before, all the different quarks and the W
7699960	7706200	and the Z bosons and so forth, the LHC sees them in exactly where they should be doing
7706220	7709320	exactly the things they should do.
7709320	7715420	There's no more rich and quantitatively accurate theory in the history of physics than the
7715420	7717820	standard model of particle physics.
7717820	7719660	So it's very messy.
7719660	7722620	It's very, it does a little bit of everything.
7722620	7727140	It's not like one beautiful principle just continues on as a line that gives you the
7727140	7728580	entire theory.
7728580	7734020	Many, many ideas come in from seemingly different corners of physics and mathematics, etc.,
7734020	7738700	and combine to give us the standard model and it works beautifully.
7738700	7741500	It explains all the data that we have so far.
7741500	7745340	Good news, bad news situation, of course, for reasons that we get into in other podcast
7745340	7746940	conversations.
7746940	7752140	And the final thing to say is, and it's probably not the final answer, right?
7752140	7756880	I mean, the standard model of particle physics, even if you include gravity, you can include
7756880	7761300	gravity in the standard model as long as the gravitational fields are weak.
7761300	7766220	And we call that the core theory dubbed by Frank Wilczek.
7766220	7768740	But we don't understand a whole bunch of things.
7768740	7771020	We don't understand the Big Bang or black holes, right?
7771020	7775400	We don't understand conditions where black, where gravity is strong.
7775400	7777060	We don't know what the dark matter is.
7777060	7782180	That's some other kind of energy that is apparently not there in the standard model.
7782180	7786340	And there's things about the standard model that are just puzzling.
7786340	7790300	There's both sort of mildly puzzling things and deeply puzzling things.
7790300	7793780	There are numerical unnatural numbers, right?
7793780	7798140	The cosmological constant, of course, is a famous unnatural number.
7798140	7802540	The mass of the Higgs boson, even though we can measure it, et cetera, it's very different
7802540	7807060	from what we would expect it to be, according to the logic of effective field theory that
7807060	7808380	we mentioned earlier.
7808380	7812260	So these are apparent fine tunings in the standard model.
7812260	7815620	There's also the fact that that you won part of the standard model, right?
7815620	7819300	The standard model is SU3 cross U2 cross U1.
7819300	7822580	The SU3 symmetry is quantum chromodynamics.
7822580	7828820	The SU2 and U1 parts are the electroweak unified theory, the theory that gives us both electromagnetism
7828820	7830460	and the weak force.
7830460	7835220	But the U1 part is really not well behaved at high energies.
7835220	7839060	There's something called a Landau pole that we're not going to get into here.
7839060	7845060	But the U1 part of the standard model apparently doesn't make sense at arbitrarily high energy
7845060	7846060	scales.
7846060	7847060	It shouldn't.
7847060	7850380	This doesn't bother people because gravity is going to be important at ultra-high energy
7850380	7851380	scales.
7851380	7855580	At low energies where you and I live, gravity is a very weak force, but at high energies
7855580	7857580	it should become important.
7857580	7859580	So there are gaps.
7859580	7863420	There are things the standard model is not up to the task of accounting for, even if they're
7863420	7867300	mostly kind of conceptual things rather than experimental things.
7867300	7873820	So not only the standard model itself, but probably even quantum field theory as an overall
7873820	7881460	picture is probably not up to the task of being the final complete theory of everything
7881460	7882820	in physics.
7882820	7887260	So the reason why I've been wanting to write this book for 20 years, and I'm very excited
7887260	7893140	to finally have done it, is both to impress upon you how wonderful quantum field theory
7893140	7898340	is, how amazing it is that it fits all the data in so many intricate and weird and fun
7898340	7904340	ways, but also to prepare you for the fact that we might do better someday, whether it's
7904340	7908460	emergent spacetime or string theory or whatever it happens to be.
7908460	7909700	Physics isn't done yet.
7909700	7910700	We're still moving on.
7910700	7912660	We understand a lot.
7912660	7914540	We don't understand everything.
7914540	7919940	We have to accept and celebrate both of those features of our knowledge and try to increase
7919940	7921780	the amount that we understand.
7921780	7923300	Let's get back to work then.
7923300	7923700	Thanks.
