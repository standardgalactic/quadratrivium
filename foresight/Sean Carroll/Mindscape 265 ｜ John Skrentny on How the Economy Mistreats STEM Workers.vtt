Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll. Here's a classic question

00:06.480 --> 00:12.400
What is the use of education? What is the value of being educated?

00:12.400 --> 00:18.520
I'm thinking particularly here of post secondary post high school education college university

00:18.800 --> 00:24.440
Even graduate school and so on. Why do this? Why get that much schooling into you?

00:24.760 --> 00:27.120
There are you know lofty

00:27.520 --> 00:31.400
Answers to this question about becoming a more well-rounded human being

00:31.960 --> 00:37.920
Understanding the human condition picking up reasoning skills and learning skills. There's also

00:38.640 --> 00:43.240
Socialization issues right meeting people getting to know the world in a certain way

00:43.240 --> 00:46.480
That's absolutely an important function of going to college

00:46.720 --> 00:51.440
But there's also a lot of down-to-earth practical issues, right? You're being trained

00:52.240 --> 00:57.480
Perhaps for a trade for a job to become employable. That's an absolutely valid

00:58.200 --> 01:06.160
reason to get an education in the modern world, especially we point toward science and technology as

01:07.080 --> 01:13.160
Skills or fields for which we would like it if people had good training in these fields, right?

01:13.160 --> 01:15.800
We invent the acronym of STEM

01:16.400 --> 01:23.120
Science technology engineering and mathematics. This is government speak or education speak for

01:23.520 --> 01:27.880
the kinds of sciencey techy kinds of areas that

01:28.320 --> 01:34.400
Both governments and also employers place a lot of emphasis on so if you're not within academia right now

01:34.400 --> 01:40.880
You might not know that there's a lot of hand-wringing and angst about the decline of the humanities and you know the more

01:41.480 --> 01:49.640
classic parts of the broad-based humanistic education that we purport to care about and too much emphasis maybe is being put on

01:50.160 --> 01:52.160
science degrees and

01:52.160 --> 01:55.920
Related areas, but there are good reasons economic reasons

01:55.920 --> 02:00.960
You know you want people to get a good job that's able to pay them and you give them a fulfilling life after

02:01.280 --> 02:06.220
College so maybe it's fine to have a bunch of people specializing in STEM areas

02:06.700 --> 02:13.460
Today's guest is John Screntany. He's a sociologist at UC San Diego and actually someone I've known for a long time

02:13.460 --> 02:20.460
We went to graduate school at the same time together and used to play basketball together as you'll find out if you hang out for the very end here

02:20.660 --> 02:26.940
But he's written an interesting book called wasted education how we fail our graduates in science technology

02:27.500 --> 02:30.940
engineering and math the idea behind John's book is

02:31.780 --> 02:35.460
sure employers and governments want

02:36.220 --> 02:38.900
healthy and rapidly growing

02:40.140 --> 02:48.940
Scientifically and technologically educated workforce, but does that mean that once created that workforce is actually fulfilled?

02:48.940 --> 02:56.020
Is are they happy do you get a science degree and are you there for able to get a good job that keeps you?

02:56.740 --> 02:58.740
Having a good kind of life and the answer

02:59.140 --> 03:03.780
Not always certainly, but in a growing number of cases the answer is no

03:04.300 --> 03:07.140
So it's a it's a very interesting argument

03:07.140 --> 03:12.420
I mean we have to say over and over again and John will say very explicitly in the podcast of course

03:12.940 --> 03:14.580
certain individuals

03:14.580 --> 03:17.660
Get very rewarding careers out of science education

03:18.420 --> 03:24.940
But we also have to take into account those that don't and we're not primarily talking here about people who go into academia

03:24.940 --> 03:27.980
We even want to go into academia. We're talking about tech workers

03:27.980 --> 03:34.420
Which is a huge fraction of the people who go from STEM degrees into the workforce. They work for

03:35.140 --> 03:36.500
computing

03:36.500 --> 03:38.740
technology software engineering kind of

03:39.820 --> 03:41.300
corporations and

03:41.300 --> 03:44.140
It can be a tough road to hoe as a matter of fact

03:45.060 --> 03:49.180
For one thing novelty and innovation is of course

03:50.060 --> 03:55.740
valued it turns out for various reasons that we'll discuss that it can be easier to just

03:56.220 --> 03:59.380
Get rid of your workers and hire newer younger ones

03:59.980 --> 04:05.860
Rather than retraining the existing workers the new workers already have the skills, right?

04:05.860 --> 04:10.460
They just learn them they're fresh in their minds that they're cheaper and then a decade or two later

04:10.500 --> 04:15.760
They can be fired and they can be replaced. It might not actually be a

04:16.260 --> 04:22.060
Sustainable way to think about our workforce or what it means to be a scientist or what it means for

04:22.460 --> 04:28.740
Colleges and universities to do their students a good service by providing them with an education

04:29.380 --> 04:34.940
Harder to come up with solutions to this issue than to diagnose it

04:35.540 --> 04:42.420
Certainly very deep features of capitalism and our economic and political system are involved here

04:42.420 --> 04:45.820
But it's an important issue to highlight one way or the other

04:45.820 --> 04:48.860
We need to know what we're doing when we're training people in these

04:49.540 --> 04:52.460
Different areas that I personally value very much

04:52.700 --> 04:58.980
But we have to be explicit what to be conscious of what's happening. We can't just say oh science is good

04:58.980 --> 05:02.780
Therefore do it we have to look into what happens when we try to do that

05:02.780 --> 05:07.620
So I think it's not exactly what we usually talk about here on Minescape. It's sociology

05:07.620 --> 05:11.940
It's an important part of the liberal arts spectrum. So let's go

05:15.820 --> 05:17.820
I

05:29.780 --> 05:31.780
Don scrappney welcome to the Minescape podcast

05:32.540 --> 05:36.980
Happy to be here. I'm excited to talk to you Sean, you know since we're old friends

05:36.980 --> 05:41.180
I thought I would start you off with a couple of soft balls to get the ball rolling here as it were

05:41.700 --> 05:45.820
So what is this stem acronym and why is it a terrible acronym?

05:48.220 --> 05:52.600
Actually compared to the alternatives, it's it's pretty awesome

05:53.100 --> 06:00.100
So do you prefer stem over smet? I prefer not using an acronym. Oh, okay

06:00.100 --> 06:06.140
Well, I gotta tell you the government has been searching for an acronym for quite a while

06:06.300 --> 06:12.380
And and that's because they've been trying to count people in these fields for quite a while

06:13.140 --> 06:17.540
Really since the Cold War. Yeah, I in the book. I include a

06:18.900 --> 06:23.260
A New York Times story in which there's this panicky headline in the New York Times

06:23.860 --> 06:28.860
About how the United States is falling behind the Soviet Union in the number of technicians

06:29.780 --> 06:35.020
Would you would you prefer that probably not probably not they were talking about scientists and engineers

06:35.380 --> 06:43.820
The National Science Foundation has scientists and engineers or s and e s ampersand e so not exactly that

06:44.740 --> 06:46.740
that

06:46.860 --> 06:47.660
Euphonious

06:47.660 --> 06:49.860
one might say but it appears so often in the

06:50.500 --> 06:54.980
Educational context and like no one majors in technology. That's not a thing, right?

06:54.980 --> 06:58.340
You can major in science engineering or math. They're very different from each other

06:58.340 --> 07:04.460
So I don't like lumping right together. So I kind of like using words rather than acronyms. Yeah. Yeah, so the technology

07:05.020 --> 07:09.940
I saw a government report that used the acronym set science engineering and technology

07:09.940 --> 07:17.300
So people really like technology. Sorry. They might know that and then there was and then there was some use of smet science math

07:18.140 --> 07:25.140
Engineering and technology and that had a rationale to it where science and math are the foundations of engineering and technology

07:25.260 --> 07:27.820
so it you know by putting them first that's sort of

07:28.140 --> 07:29.420
kind of a

07:29.420 --> 07:34.420
Temporal ordering of what comes first you do the basic science you understand the math and then you develop

07:34.460 --> 07:40.660
The technology, but smet sounds like not I'm on a Pia, right? Yes, it's not bad

07:41.660 --> 07:44.180
Yeah, oh my god a smet

07:44.700 --> 07:48.180
so it didn't really catch on and then a

07:49.620 --> 07:55.260
Judith Romley is her name. She was one of the higher-ups at the National Science Foundation

07:56.060 --> 08:00.100
She apparently is the one who coined the stem acronym

08:00.700 --> 08:04.220
just changing the order a little bit making it sound a little bit better and

08:05.340 --> 08:11.860
Then it just took off. I I had a graduate student kind of look who's doing research assistance for me and

08:12.380 --> 08:18.100
She looked at the rise of the stem acronym and it just started to appear in

08:19.300 --> 08:26.020
bills in Congress and it just took off and so you may not like stem but a

08:26.500 --> 08:28.620
lot of other people like it that is and

08:29.380 --> 08:32.700
It's a much more detailed and serious answer than I was hoping for so

08:33.380 --> 08:36.300
we're kind of stuck with it and and

08:36.980 --> 08:44.580
What exactly it means? That's it. That's a different question, but but stem seems to have taken off internationally people use that acronym

08:44.580 --> 08:47.220
They seem to understand when I talk to them about stem

08:47.700 --> 08:52.540
So it's stem seems to be here to stay does it include the social sciences

08:53.340 --> 08:55.340
That's a good question

08:55.460 --> 09:01.260
The National Science Foundation officially includes social scientists in its

09:01.900 --> 09:07.580
understandings of SNE science and engineering and then they also talk about stem we could go down a very tedious

09:08.220 --> 09:10.460
rabbit hole about some of this but they

09:11.300 --> 09:18.820
idiosyncratically I would say include social scientists because when most of the government policy makers are talking about

09:19.820 --> 09:24.020
Stem they're not thinking about me. Yeah, they're thinking about you

09:24.260 --> 09:33.100
They're thinking about a lot of other folks and and I can explain why that is and and people might protest that that

09:34.300 --> 09:37.500
Sociologists economists demographers can be highly quantitative

09:38.500 --> 09:40.500
political scientists as well and

09:40.660 --> 09:45.220
You know really use advanced statistical computational methods

09:45.220 --> 09:48.980
So why aren't they included in stem and I think that I

09:49.860 --> 09:53.940
Think that that has a lot to do with what the government wants with its

09:54.460 --> 10:02.540
Investments in stem education and they don't really want more of me. I arguably don't be offended. They probably don't want more cosmologists. Oh my god

10:06.700 --> 10:13.620
Experts on general relativity, they're not saying we need more of those give us more of those they are looking for people to

10:14.620 --> 10:21.140
You first of all fulfill employers demands and and these employers have been crying shortages

10:21.660 --> 10:29.140
For quite a while. They want people to innovate. They want people, you know that technology that T that you were so skeptical of that's really what

10:29.140 --> 10:33.340
That's what they care. Oh, I know that's yes, I think they're riding on my coattails. Honestly

10:34.260 --> 10:39.620
they are they are and and they they have this hope that

10:40.420 --> 10:46.940
By cranking out more experts in stem fields, they will innovate and

10:47.740 --> 10:53.980
They will create new technologies that will boost American competitiveness and boost American national security

10:54.260 --> 10:58.300
And grow the economy and provide jobs for everybody. I

10:58.940 --> 11:00.420
wrote this

11:00.420 --> 11:05.380
book chapter a few years ago in which I kind of traced the

11:06.420 --> 11:08.420
the history of

11:08.820 --> 11:11.300
American policymakers and what they wanted

11:11.700 --> 11:16.060
I'm using the acronym anachronistically now what they wanted stem workers to do

11:16.540 --> 11:20.900
Obviously, they weren't talking they weren't using the stem acronym during the progressive era

11:21.420 --> 11:26.540
But during the progressive era is really when you saw the government trying to think about hey

11:26.540 --> 11:31.980
We've got these experts in these science and engineering fields. We should deploy their expertise

11:32.140 --> 11:38.380
And so the interesting thing about the progressive era was that they wanted to deploy the

11:39.220 --> 11:44.660
Existing expertise if we can use existing in relation to expertise what people already knew

11:44.660 --> 11:48.460
Uh-huh and and so like pure food the pure food act

11:49.020 --> 11:54.620
Wow, we know why food spoils now. We know how to prevent food from spoiling. We know how to keep

11:55.500 --> 11:56.860
Meat safe

11:56.860 --> 12:02.820
Let's keep those let's use let's deploy that expertise and make sure that we can make food better

12:03.580 --> 12:10.860
Progressives were real excited about, you know, all the new knowledge being generated and and they wanted to just deploy

12:10.860 --> 12:12.860
to strategically as possible

12:13.020 --> 12:15.020
then you had a

12:16.260 --> 12:22.020
Sort of a change that happened during World War two which I'm sure you're familiar with with you know

12:22.020 --> 12:26.420
the Manhattan Project and developing the nuclear bomb developing radar and

12:27.500 --> 12:32.780
That was a little bit different in the sense that the government really wanted to deploy

12:33.620 --> 12:39.180
Scientific and engineering expertise to create specific technologies that they really wanted

12:39.460 --> 12:46.380
So they brought together a lot of experts and said hey, we want you to develop a system that can detect enemy aircraft

12:46.380 --> 12:49.860
Or hey, we want you to come and develop a system that can produce a

12:50.620 --> 12:53.700
Weapon that could potentially end this war the nuclear bomb

12:54.060 --> 12:58.380
So it was very targeted use of expertise even though they didn't yet have the expertise

12:58.500 --> 13:01.140
So you can see we're one step away from the progressive era

13:01.300 --> 13:04.660
but by the Cold War we started to get into a

13:05.500 --> 13:11.780
phrase that I I kind of called it alchemy because it suggested this sort of this hope that by putting stuff together

13:11.900 --> 13:15.500
Something amazing would happen. It wasn't as rational and

13:16.220 --> 13:22.540
And they didn't the government really didn't even have an idea of which fields we're gonna create the most innovations or the most

13:23.060 --> 13:30.140
The most innovations that would create the most jobs or the innovations that would boost national competitiveness the most economic competitiveness

13:30.140 --> 13:35.020
I'm talking about here. It was just the sense that by creating more people with STEM

13:35.260 --> 13:36.460
educations

13:36.460 --> 13:38.460
amazing things were gonna happen and

13:38.660 --> 13:40.180
We don't know what

13:40.180 --> 13:43.860
But amazing things are gonna happen just get them together kind of like Bell Labs

13:43.900 --> 13:48.140
Maybe it was a little bit like that bring them together and amazing things are gonna happen and

13:49.020 --> 13:51.020
in this in this

13:52.460 --> 13:57.260
This kind of understanding of STEM education and STEM expertise it was

13:57.780 --> 14:01.580
There was a lot of hope and faith kind of the faith and I like that

14:02.220 --> 14:07.580
Use of the word faith. We normally connect that with religion, but it was almost like that

14:07.580 --> 14:09.780
it was like wow these people are gonna save us and

14:10.540 --> 14:15.380
Let's invest in them and let's make them go so techno optimism at an early

14:15.900 --> 14:20.840
Yeah, yeah, that's yeah, that's a phrase that that's that's bounced around a lot in this

14:21.660 --> 14:26.420
So so you've already implicitly answered this question a little bit

14:26.420 --> 14:30.860
But I'm wondering since we're gonna be talking about STEM education and what happens to people who get STEM degrees

14:31.500 --> 14:38.400
It to in what sense is this a job for sociologists to think about we haven't had that many

14:38.600 --> 14:43.720
Sociologists on the show. We had a great talk with brokerington about offshore wealth management

14:43.840 --> 14:50.360
But you know, we haven't really gone into you know enough to for the listeners who you know

14:50.360 --> 14:55.440
I assume listen to nothing but the Minescape podcast to really get an idea about what sociologists do

14:55.440 --> 15:00.080
So is this is are you doing mainstream sociology? Are you kind of branching out a little bit with this topic?

15:01.520 --> 15:03.520
That's a great question

15:04.240 --> 15:08.480
One of the reasons I went into sociology was that I see it as

15:09.680 --> 15:14.440
The big picture social science. I I think that

15:15.200 --> 15:20.040
Economists produce a lot of great knowledge. I think political scientists produce a lot of great knowledge

15:20.680 --> 15:22.680
but I tend to

15:22.840 --> 15:31.080
Think of the knowledge they produce especially economists as kind of looking through the world through a rolled-up piece of paper

15:31.120 --> 15:32.360
You know, yeah

15:32.360 --> 15:39.760
Creating that right now in my with my with my hands here and and you can see something you can focus on something really clearly

15:40.560 --> 15:42.560
but you

15:42.600 --> 15:49.640
Don't necessarily see all the different things that might be connected to that thing that you're really really focusing on right so

15:49.840 --> 15:51.320
economists can

15:51.320 --> 15:59.960
Can lead us astray sometimes in ways that I think if sociologists will more inclined to study some of the issues that economists focus on

16:01.120 --> 16:03.280
You know, they might have provided a little bit of a corrective

16:03.280 --> 16:04.640
so for example

16:04.640 --> 16:12.320
The world is is filled right now with a lot of folks who are upset about free trade and how free trade

16:13.040 --> 16:19.440
Produced a lot of economic dislocation people running losing their jobs people who used to work in manufacturing

16:19.760 --> 16:23.440
Not having those jobs anymore those jobs have gone abroad

16:26.200 --> 16:30.840
This should have been obvious and and and I think that the

16:31.320 --> 16:36.640
Economists tend toward and sorry for any in the audience. I think they tend toward a kind of

16:37.360 --> 16:43.720
really basic sort of utilitarianism and so, you know, they might think well, we might lose some

16:44.520 --> 16:49.420
Manufacturing jobs, but overall we're gonna be happier because you can produce

16:50.080 --> 16:55.280
televisions more cheaply in Mexico or China now these are gonna be cheaper for us to buy and

16:55.800 --> 16:58.320
And and these workers can move like water

16:58.320 --> 17:03.800
They'll just flow around to the places where the economic opportunities are and everyone's gonna be better off

17:04.720 --> 17:10.920
But what they don't understand is that people have identities their identities are often linked to their jobs and

17:11.680 --> 17:13.360
and so

17:13.360 --> 17:14.440
they

17:14.440 --> 17:16.720
They struggle with economic dislocation

17:17.640 --> 17:19.040
so

17:19.040 --> 17:24.640
Sociologists, I think can look at this big picture see all these things going on and that's kind of what I

17:24.880 --> 17:31.880
Love to do. I often think of the knowledge that I do compared to the knowledge that you do or that you generate

17:31.880 --> 17:39.640
I think of the kind of science that you do Sean is like vertically integrated like it's really really

17:40.280 --> 17:42.280
deep and

17:42.280 --> 17:47.920
And like if you are focused on a problem of general relativity, I just keep reading that up because I know you wrote the textbook on it

17:48.800 --> 17:52.600
But and someone knocks on the door and like Sean we got to talk to you

17:52.880 --> 17:54.880
Like you lose your concentration

17:55.480 --> 18:00.040
The whole thing falls down. You're annoying and and then you got to get back into it

18:00.600 --> 18:06.120
Whereas the stuff that I do and why it's hard to do this podcast just to give you a heads up

18:06.640 --> 18:13.680
It's like horizontally integrated knowledge. It's a lot of stuff at a more superficial level, but really broad, right?

18:13.960 --> 18:17.920
so I'm trying to understand, you know, investments and

18:18.840 --> 18:21.600
education and what what employers in

18:22.560 --> 18:30.880
Software and oil and gas and chemicals and biopharmaceuticals like all this stuff. It's just it's kind of at a superficial level

18:31.800 --> 18:35.480
But there's a lot of it. Yeah, and and I I love that though

18:35.480 --> 18:38.880
And I think it fits more with my undiagnosed

18:39.280 --> 18:44.480
ADD, you know that it's easier for me to get back into it if someone knocks on the door because you know

18:44.480 --> 18:47.800
There's a lot of different footholds I can grab on to rather than that really narrow one

18:47.880 --> 18:51.880
Does that make sense to you and I'm talking about we did have herp gintis on the podcast

18:51.880 --> 18:57.160
I don't know if you know his work. Yeah, it reminds me very much of that even though he self-identified as an economist

18:57.160 --> 19:01.200
But game theory evolution physics it all came in and I absolutely

19:01.880 --> 19:06.760
See the appeal of that. That's why I do a podcast rather than just sitting in my office writing papers

19:07.280 --> 19:11.920
Right, right, right exactly. So the sociology when I when I when I looked at this issue

19:11.920 --> 19:16.560
I got a little pushback from some some STEM workers themselves like who are you?

19:16.600 --> 19:19.280
What are you doing? You're a sociologist. Why are you looking at this? I?

19:20.200 --> 19:24.240
Would like to think I'm the guy yeah who can look at the big picture here

19:24.240 --> 19:28.520
I can see things that you can't see I can bring together different

19:29.360 --> 19:35.480
Different ideas different systems of thought that maybe you're not aware of and use those things to illuminate social reality

19:35.920 --> 19:40.600
In in a unique way that actually adds some value that makes a contribution. All right

19:40.600 --> 19:42.600
Well, we'll see over the next hour whether we do that

19:43.520 --> 19:45.520
I

19:46.080 --> 19:50.760
Put a lot of pressure on yeah, I know you really just set yourself up there better be amazing

19:51.520 --> 19:58.040
So let's for people who are not professional sociologists are hanging out there with let's set the stage

19:58.040 --> 20:03.320
You know we have people who get degrees in the stem and I guess the two questions

20:03.320 --> 20:05.600
I want to ask you can address them in whatever order is

20:06.280 --> 20:07.520
one

20:07.520 --> 20:11.640
What kinds of jobs do they go into right like you know within academia?

20:11.640 --> 20:15.760
We love it when people go into academic jobs and we imagine getting a PhD becoming professor

20:15.760 --> 20:20.320
But you and I also know that's a small fraction of all the people who get degrees in these fields

20:20.320 --> 20:22.800
And the other is you know, how does that compare to all the other?

20:23.160 --> 20:28.840
Jobs like how what is a fraction of people when they go in the jobs? They say oh, this is a stem job versus

20:29.400 --> 20:31.160
What management?

20:31.160 --> 20:33.160
Factory jobs. I don't even know what the categories are

20:33.760 --> 20:39.960
Right, so that's a good question the government talks about the policymakers in the US government

20:39.960 --> 20:46.120
I know your audience is international talks about stem and non-stem as a binary, okay?

20:46.120 --> 20:48.120
it's one or the other and

20:49.560 --> 20:55.720
There's a few people who go beyond that but in general they talk about stem and non-stem jobs

20:55.720 --> 21:03.160
And they do that because of that what I talked about before this this hope that by putting people into these stem occupations

21:03.880 --> 21:13.680
The sort of traditional stem occupations software developer chemist biologists, you know things that you knew in high school as as science and

21:14.560 --> 21:17.400
engineering electrical engineering mechanical engineering

21:18.640 --> 21:24.680
That by by getting people into those occupations these amazing things are going to happen

21:25.000 --> 21:31.360
In reality as I'm sure a lot of your listeners know stem and non-stem is more of a continuum

21:32.240 --> 21:38.080
I spent a lot of time thinking about that it ended up getting cut from the book for various reasons

21:38.480 --> 21:46.840
But it's definitely the case that there's a lot of there are a lot of jobs that in which stem expertise

21:47.600 --> 21:50.580
College level stem expertise is very very helpful

21:51.080 --> 21:55.280
So if you any of your listeners or listeners or software developers

21:55.480 --> 22:00.800
They would almost certainly prefer a manager who understands software development

22:02.080 --> 22:04.080
And so there's

22:04.640 --> 22:07.360
A lot of people who get stem degrees do go into management

22:09.120 --> 22:13.040
A lot of people who get stem degrees go into practicing medicine

22:13.600 --> 22:15.600
Now the government does not

22:15.680 --> 22:22.400
Consider practicing medicine to be a stem job. Really people might think yeah, they might think why is that what's going on?

22:23.360 --> 22:28.480
It's because of this thing about trying to create innovation. Okay, and practicing medicine

22:29.440 --> 22:32.800
Is does a lot of great things for people as obvious

22:33.440 --> 22:36.000
Obvious for anyone who's ever been to a competent physician

22:36.560 --> 22:41.360
But they typically do not innovate and create patents and jobs and things like that

22:41.440 --> 22:48.240
We've got stem we got md phd's who might do that for the most part practicing medicine is it's about deploying existing expertise

22:49.520 --> 22:58.000
And another area where where stem people with stem degrees will go that are not the traditional stem occupations is finance of various kinds

22:58.240 --> 23:00.880
Very much. Yeah. No, we're we're we are

23:01.600 --> 23:03.200
I know you're aware of

23:03.200 --> 23:07.760
People in physics who went into quantitative finance and do some very high powered things there

23:09.440 --> 23:15.520
The national science foundation data the national science foundation runs this great survey called the national survey of college graduates

23:15.520 --> 23:17.520
And I relied on it a lot for this book

23:18.240 --> 23:21.600
It shows that people go into this category of

23:22.320 --> 23:24.320
Of you know accountants

23:24.960 --> 23:30.320
Auditors financial specialists it tends to group them together. We don't know exactly what those folks are doing

23:30.560 --> 23:37.040
It's probably not a lot of black souls equations and some of the stuff that our friends in on wall street do

23:37.840 --> 23:44.160
But but so that's another area where folks go and then a lot of folks go into jobs that don't use stem expertise at all

23:44.960 --> 23:48.240
And there's just too many to mention. It's hard to make generalizations

23:49.120 --> 23:55.040
That it's a it's a very wide variety of potential occupations for people with with stem expertise

23:55.680 --> 24:02.320
But I want to emphasize and I do in the book that when the government invests in stem occupy in stem education

24:03.040 --> 24:05.040
They want people to go into

24:05.760 --> 24:07.760
stem occupations

24:07.920 --> 24:10.400
And I should say at the outset right here

24:11.040 --> 24:12.080
that

24:12.080 --> 24:14.960
About 50 percent of all stem workers in the united states

24:15.840 --> 24:22.240
Are in computers in some way right like that. That's like that's like the 800 pound gorilla of stem

24:23.600 --> 24:27.840
And we're talking software developers. That's one of the most in-demand in-demand jobs

24:28.960 --> 24:33.040
You know computer engineers of various types people web developers

24:33.200 --> 24:36.160
There's just a whole range of occupations that involve computers

24:36.640 --> 24:42.560
and one of the things that's really unique about that particular stem sector is that

24:43.520 --> 24:45.520
Whereas

24:45.600 --> 24:48.960
chemical firms like duPont hires chemists

24:50.800 --> 24:54.800
Trucking companies or shipping companies probably don't hire chemists

24:55.680 --> 24:56.960
but

24:56.960 --> 24:58.960
computer experts of various types

25:00.000 --> 25:03.760
They're their own silo where tech companies will hire these folks

25:04.160 --> 25:07.520
But then they're also yeah like a band across the economy

25:08.080 --> 25:15.440
Where just about everybody hires some computer experts to you know, do things run their payroll do their logistics

25:15.440 --> 25:18.560
I always think of trucking because we don't think of trucking as being very high tech

25:19.040 --> 25:24.320
But actually they hire a lot of data people and to manage this whole complicated system

25:25.040 --> 25:26.240
so

25:26.240 --> 25:32.480
That computer related fields information technology is a band across the whole economy retail

25:33.120 --> 25:36.560
You know all kinds of occupations or all kinds of sectors will use that

25:37.440 --> 25:43.600
Life sciences that'll be used in bio pharma. You know all that you know life science kinds of sectors

25:44.240 --> 25:45.520
so

25:45.520 --> 25:48.880
computer is really the 800 pound gorilla and and so

25:49.680 --> 25:51.680
when we talk about stem workers

25:51.920 --> 25:54.960
People have commented on the book a little bit like they're saying hey, man

25:54.960 --> 25:58.320
This book seems to be really about tech and really about computer workers

25:59.280 --> 26:01.280
And there's two reasons for that

26:01.520 --> 26:04.400
One is what I just told you that so many workers go into that field

26:04.880 --> 26:07.600
And the other reason is that those are the employers who

26:08.400 --> 26:10.320
argue

26:10.320 --> 26:18.080
And complain the loudest about shortages. They're the ones who are saying hey, man, we need more workers. Where are these workers?

26:18.800 --> 26:21.520
Where what what's wrong with your universities?

26:22.080 --> 26:27.760
What's wrong with you society for not giving us more more stem grads so that we can hire them?

26:27.920 --> 26:30.320
Well, that's good because that's exactly where I wanted to go next because

26:31.040 --> 26:35.760
Is the feeling that we get within academia that the humanities are on the decline?

26:36.800 --> 26:41.680
And stem majors are kind of taking over is that accurate and nevertheless?

26:41.760 --> 26:44.560
There's a lot of companies that are complaining. We don't produce enough stem majors

26:45.440 --> 26:50.960
Yeah, so I should say at the outset that you know, the book is really about this puzzle

26:51.040 --> 26:56.480
We we haven't we I've been talking for quite a while here already and I haven't even gotten to the puzzle

26:56.560 --> 27:03.920
We'll get there my apologies the puzzle the puzzle is that there's all these claims of the shortage of stem grads and

27:06.000 --> 27:12.080
Only according to some measures and this is the census bureau only 28 percent of stem grads work in stem jobs

27:13.280 --> 27:19.920
There's different ways of counting and different datasets. My counting is about 40 percent of stem grads work in stem jobs

27:20.720 --> 27:22.720
So it's a little bit higher, but still a minority

27:22.960 --> 27:26.720
So the puzzle is there's all these complaints about shortages what's going on

27:27.040 --> 27:32.480
You know, why aren't you producing enough and yet it's the data looks like we're producing a surplus

27:32.960 --> 27:34.960
So that's that's kind of the puzzle there

27:35.200 --> 27:39.200
And is that for that that figure those figures that you quote one way or the other are they sort of

27:39.680 --> 27:46.800
Lifetime like sometime 20 years ago 50 years ago. I got a stem degree and now I am or am not or is it right out of college

27:47.440 --> 27:49.440
so basically what they do

27:50.080 --> 27:57.520
Is the national survey of college graduates comes it comes out every couple years and they ask a sample of college graduates

27:57.760 --> 28:00.560
What did you get your degree in? What are you doing now?

28:01.360 --> 28:07.600
So it's a slice of people so it includes people right out of college and people who have been out for a while

28:07.840 --> 28:12.240
But that's a great question because I was really interested in whether people kind of

28:13.680 --> 28:18.240
Go in massive numbers into stem early on and then move on to something else

28:18.800 --> 28:23.760
But there's there's a lot of data that suggests even in high demand fields like electrical engineering

28:24.320 --> 28:25.440
that

28:25.440 --> 28:28.000
Some data suggests upwards is 50 percent

28:28.880 --> 28:34.080
Right out of college say nah, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna go the stem route. I'm gonna go do something else

28:34.720 --> 28:40.160
So really it's a it's a leaky pipeline. That's a metaphor that's often used. You've probably heard that metaphor

28:40.720 --> 28:44.000
It's a leaky pipeline that leaks at all stages

28:44.960 --> 28:47.920
If if we think about stem as something important

28:48.720 --> 28:51.200
In elementary school people lose interest there

28:51.760 --> 28:57.840
High school college and then right out of college and then throughout their work lives people can

28:58.560 --> 29:00.560
Exit this the stem pipeline

29:00.720 --> 29:08.400
That's one of the things I really wanted emphasizing this book is that too many people studying this focus on the stem pipeline is just about

29:09.200 --> 29:12.320
education from k through 16 k through college

29:13.280 --> 29:15.280
But really

29:15.440 --> 29:19.680
People have to keep and we can talk about this later. People have to keep their stem skills up to date

29:20.560 --> 29:21.680
and

29:21.680 --> 29:27.200
And stem education if if you want to be successful in stem you got to keep your skills up to date

29:27.200 --> 29:31.840
Your education doesn't end at college. It doesn't end at a phd. You got to constantly

29:32.960 --> 29:34.960
Re-up you got to constantly

29:36.000 --> 29:40.960
I call it the stem skills treadmill. I apologize for the transparent attempt to create jargon

29:42.560 --> 29:47.360
But I really wanted to capture something here, which is the idea of moving while standing in place

29:48.320 --> 29:53.760
Right stem workers really have to keep moving. They really have to keep learning just to be able to keep their job

29:54.720 --> 29:56.720
And um, I feel like I'm getting off

29:57.600 --> 30:00.240
No, this is what I mean that is ultimately where we want to go

30:00.320 --> 30:03.760
But that's okay because we can go back and forth. But just to like just to drive it home

30:03.760 --> 30:06.560
It's okay to get the point halfway through the podcast. Um,

30:06.880 --> 30:08.000
I

30:08.000 --> 30:11.200
One gets the impression that a successful

30:11.920 --> 30:16.080
undergraduate majoring in a stem field is going to come out of college thinking of themselves as

30:16.720 --> 30:19.120
elite and well-trained, etc

30:19.200 --> 30:26.720
But one of the messages of your book is it's exactly those people who the employers think of as basically cheap and disposable

30:26.800 --> 30:28.800
Right, they're going to use them for a little while

30:28.800 --> 30:32.160
Until their skills are not quite as cutting edge anymore

30:32.480 --> 30:36.160
And they're not going to really mind if they just fire them in higher new graduates

30:36.880 --> 30:41.040
Right. I I talked to a CEO of a of a stem

30:42.240 --> 30:44.080
an innovation economy

30:44.080 --> 30:46.160
sort of company and

30:46.160 --> 30:48.160
they hired a lot of stem workers and

30:48.800 --> 30:54.640
This CEO used the phrase that I title a chapter of the book burn and churn

30:55.440 --> 31:01.200
And it was striking. He he said just so matter of factly. Yeah, we burn and churn through them

31:01.760 --> 31:05.600
They have a lot of enthusiasm and we take advantage of that

31:06.320 --> 31:10.160
And when their skills fall out of date or when they get kind of burned out

31:10.400 --> 31:16.720
Then we hire some more and we there's other studies that show stem employers like to get new blood. They like to get

31:17.360 --> 31:19.840
New folks coming in there like they like this churn

31:20.720 --> 31:28.080
And so that's seen as as a positive and there's not that much concern about what happens to people who get burned out

31:28.640 --> 31:31.920
There's a lot of research. It's it's funny because for years

31:32.080 --> 31:34.640
I've advised students and maybe you have as well

31:35.360 --> 31:36.240
to

31:36.240 --> 31:41.200
To major in the field that you're passionate about, you know to choose a career that you think you can be passionate about

31:42.800 --> 31:46.480
But leave it to the social scientists to find something negative about that

31:47.840 --> 31:51.040
And there's there's new research mainly from my field in sociology

31:51.520 --> 32:00.000
About how employers exploit this passion. They think wow, we've got these workers who really love this and let's

32:00.880 --> 32:03.760
You know get them to work 60 70 hours a week

32:04.160 --> 32:07.040
We don't even have to pay them extra because they're so passionate

32:07.360 --> 32:12.080
They've had great teachers and professors who've fired their excitement about this field

32:12.640 --> 32:13.440
and

32:13.440 --> 32:20.080
Let's ride that wave until it crashes or peters out or something and and and maybe we can then hire the next

32:20.640 --> 32:22.400
group of passionate workers

32:22.400 --> 32:29.200
So what leads these companies to complain about a shortage? Is it just that they want even more cheap workers just out of college?

32:30.160 --> 32:32.160
so I

32:32.720 --> 32:36.080
I kind of played dumb in the book a little bit. I'm like, all right employers

32:36.720 --> 32:39.920
You say that there's a shortage. I'm going to take that at face value

32:40.560 --> 32:44.160
If there really is a shortage, are you behaving like there's a shortage?

32:44.240 --> 32:51.200
Are you acting like stem grads are scarce and valuable and can just produce magic that's going to benefit all of us

32:51.840 --> 32:54.560
Or are you treating these folks as?

32:55.360 --> 32:56.000
as

32:56.000 --> 32:57.520
as disposable

32:57.520 --> 32:58.640
I I

32:58.640 --> 33:00.640
There's a lot of good metaphors Sean that work here

33:00.640 --> 33:04.560
One of the ones I think about is squeezing an orange getting that juice out of it

33:05.360 --> 33:09.120
In my la times op-ed. I suddenly thought about fast fashion

33:09.600 --> 33:12.880
Something that kind of works or that's like really great for a short time

33:13.280 --> 33:15.840
But you don't expect it to last you move through it

33:16.800 --> 33:23.680
And so that's what they do and I just kept believing them pretending to believe them and saying, all right

33:24.160 --> 33:27.040
Let's see if your actions match your words

33:27.680 --> 33:34.080
And they just really it just really doesn't the new york times has a headline today

33:35.040 --> 33:38.400
It's I don't know if I can mention the date in in this but

33:39.040 --> 33:40.960
But it could be almost any day

33:40.960 --> 33:44.800
There's a there's a new round of layoffs at major major tech companies

33:45.440 --> 33:50.320
These are the firms they they created this lobbying group called forward us

33:50.880 --> 33:55.920
That their whole their whole reason for being is the idea of a stem shortage

33:56.640 --> 33:58.640
their whole reason for being is

33:58.640 --> 34:05.120
Lobbying the government for both more stem grads more stem education and also more stem migrants to come

34:06.080 --> 34:10.720
And a lot of these companies and it's part of the reason I talk about these tech companies

34:11.520 --> 34:13.120
they

34:13.120 --> 34:16.960
They're rich, you know, I mean some of these are are

34:18.320 --> 34:22.400
Are all near monopolies. We're talking google. We're talking amazon. We're talking

34:23.280 --> 34:31.280
Well alphabet, you know, google is tedious. They changed their names facebook's now meta, but huge, you know, two billion people have facebook

34:31.280 --> 34:33.280
They own instagram

34:33.600 --> 34:36.000
Apple has like a billion dollars in cash

34:36.480 --> 34:42.480
They're they layoff workers. Yeah, they you know, they just we're done with you guys. We don't know. We hired too many

34:42.480 --> 34:44.480
Sorry, we don't need you guys anymore

34:45.600 --> 34:49.680
I I met a guy who was a former

34:50.400 --> 34:53.040
HR expert at a major tech company

34:53.680 --> 34:58.720
And he had a brilliant idea and I'm not going to give him credit because he actually wanted to remain anonymous

34:59.520 --> 35:04.000
But he moved into the education field like elementary education and high school education

35:04.720 --> 35:09.760
And in that field for students with learning disabilities, there's this thing called the IEP

35:10.480 --> 35:15.600
Which stands for individual education program or individualized education

35:16.400 --> 35:18.960
Plan something like that, but the idea is

35:20.000 --> 35:23.840
You have a student with some kind of learning disability. You monitor their progress

35:24.080 --> 35:26.880
You figure out what their strengths are you figure out what they need to know

35:27.760 --> 35:31.760
And and he thought that was a great model for these really rich tech companies

35:31.760 --> 35:33.760
That are constantly complaining about shortages

35:34.240 --> 35:41.200
If if it looks like and who's going to know better than the employers themselves if it looks like some skills are about to be obsolete

35:41.920 --> 35:48.480
Why not tell these workers? Hey, you've already got this great foundation in STEM education

35:48.960 --> 35:52.000
Your specialty is kind of going

35:52.800 --> 35:57.120
Going down. We need something new. This looks like it's going to be the new thing

35:57.920 --> 36:02.800
We're going to put a little bit of money in there and we're going to train you and deploy you somewhere else in the firm

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
They they typically don't do that

36:06.560 --> 36:08.560
They they let you go

36:09.280 --> 36:11.680
Google, um, I think it was google was

36:12.400 --> 36:17.520
Basically told companies are told employees. You've got this many months to figure out

36:18.400 --> 36:22.000
What skill you want to develop you're on your own to figure that out. How do you know?

36:22.480 --> 36:24.640
How do you know what's going to be the next in-demand skill?

36:25.440 --> 36:31.680
And so they moved into that, you know, they they were given the opportunity to move into that but without guidance or without

36:32.000 --> 36:34.640
Without paid training. So that that's really tough

36:35.360 --> 36:38.880
I gotta lay another metaphor on you and this came from someone

36:39.840 --> 36:45.440
A STEM worker an engineer who emailed me after my my la times op-ed came out

36:45.920 --> 36:50.640
And I loved you know, I love to get the the voices from the field. It's so interesting to hear their stories

36:51.680 --> 36:56.640
This engineer told me that he thought stem work was was something like

36:57.440 --> 37:00.480
Prospect prospecting and mining in the 1800s

37:01.360 --> 37:05.840
And you've got these people who chase the chase the latest gold rush

37:06.640 --> 37:09.840
We're gonna go do that thing. It's gonna be really hot for a while

37:10.560 --> 37:14.960
Maybe some people are gonna get rich. Maybe some, you know, stem workers are gonna stock options

37:14.960 --> 37:18.880
There's gonna be a lot of stem people are gonna get rich, but then it's gonna peter out

37:19.840 --> 37:21.840
And then those folks got to find the next big thing

37:22.800 --> 37:26.480
And this engineer told me he didn't want his children to go into these fields because

37:26.960 --> 37:29.760
He said it gets tiring chasing these gold rushes

37:30.240 --> 37:32.240
Chasing these, you know, the the next

37:32.960 --> 37:37.440
The next mine to be exploited and and and just really really

37:38.000 --> 37:42.400
You know people really dig into it, you know, I can give your your readers can probably think of examples

37:42.400 --> 37:44.880
But blockchain was really huge for a while

37:46.320 --> 37:48.320
AI is now the huge one

37:49.120 --> 37:54.880
You know, it it goes up and down if you're in oil and gas, you know, the if the price of oil is super high

37:55.040 --> 37:57.760
They're like, wow, we need more look at we can pay them a lot

37:58.240 --> 38:01.680
And then suddenly that price plummets and then that goes down

38:02.560 --> 38:06.400
For people in the life sciences, there could be some promising new

38:07.680 --> 38:12.080
Technologies in life sciences like right now MRNA is really big

38:12.400 --> 38:15.600
Maybe there's gonna be some limitations there gene editing really big

38:16.320 --> 38:18.960
Might be some limitations there. We'll see but

38:19.680 --> 38:21.680
You get these fields that get super hot

38:21.920 --> 38:28.480
And then they try they hire a lot of folks if they don't get fda approval if the clinical trials don't work out

38:29.040 --> 38:30.240
See you later

38:30.240 --> 38:33.760
And and and life sciences will lay off a bunch of workers as well

38:34.000 --> 38:41.920
Is is it possible to oversimplify your argument by saying that there might possibly be downsides to capitalism?

38:47.040 --> 38:49.040
I would say

38:49.600 --> 38:56.640
That the problem isn't necessarily capitalism per se the problem really is

38:58.240 --> 39:05.360
And this is where I really put on my sociologist hat and I'm but I'm borrowing from some ideas that come from from economists as well

39:06.080 --> 39:08.080
There are cultural practices

39:08.960 --> 39:13.440
That characterize american capitalism, especially american capitalism

39:14.400 --> 39:19.680
Today and certainly over the last few decades, which are creating this problem

39:21.200 --> 39:22.560
and

39:22.560 --> 39:24.960
there's a lot of folks who've written about this but

39:25.440 --> 39:30.160
There's expectations that investors have that they didn't used to have

39:30.800 --> 39:32.800
And that is that they

39:32.800 --> 39:35.520
It they call it maximizing short-term

39:36.480 --> 39:38.480
shareholder value various

39:38.560 --> 39:41.040
permutations of that phrase various versions of that phrase

39:42.000 --> 39:48.640
But shareholders like there's there's a whole movement to create this thing that that that the stakeholders who really matter

39:49.120 --> 39:53.120
For a corporation are the shareholders not the employees

39:53.840 --> 39:55.840
The shareholders not the customers

39:56.160 --> 40:00.480
Not the customers as anyone who's tried to do customer service in almost any field

40:01.120 --> 40:06.080
Any sector not the people in the regional economy where the company might be based

40:06.400 --> 40:09.440
It's the shareholders and they should expect

40:09.840 --> 40:13.120
Value on their investment in the short term

40:14.240 --> 40:17.120
And there's a lot of complicated stuff about how this came about

40:17.840 --> 40:19.840
there used to be these massive

40:20.480 --> 40:22.480
conglomerates that are all these

40:22.720 --> 40:24.720
diverse sort of

40:24.880 --> 40:26.880
companies under one roof

40:26.960 --> 40:28.960
underwear and apple pie

40:29.360 --> 40:31.360
Sarah Lee owned Haynes

40:31.920 --> 40:35.280
The Sarah Lee company you know like under underwear company like all these crazy things

40:35.760 --> 40:37.680
Put together and they were doing that to hedge them

40:37.840 --> 40:42.880
You know kind of hedge their bets if the apple pie market collapsed at least they can make some money on t-shirts

40:43.600 --> 40:49.680
So, uh, but shareholders were like no no no we want you to do what you do find your core competency do that thing

40:50.400 --> 40:54.960
It was a massive redefinition of what corporations were really about

40:55.680 --> 41:00.560
And there was a redefinition of what workers were and workers became costs

41:01.280 --> 41:03.780
And investors began to applaud

41:04.880 --> 41:06.880
corporations that shed workers

41:07.760 --> 41:12.400
This was a big shift, you know, you would always have companies that would lay off workers when the economy was bad

41:13.120 --> 41:19.440
But by the 1980s as we got to shift to this maximizing short term shareholder value kind of approach to corporations

41:20.240 --> 41:22.720
You got companies that shed workers even in good times

41:23.680 --> 41:26.320
And and the stock price would go up

41:26.880 --> 41:28.320
I

41:28.320 --> 41:33.760
I give the example of Sarah Lee because it's just such a it's such a great example and and the and the ceo complained

41:33.920 --> 41:40.320
You know that like my god, you know what the investors just want us to get rid of workers. That's what they want and

41:41.040 --> 41:42.400
you know

41:42.400 --> 41:44.240
investors

41:44.240 --> 41:49.600
They don't like training in the united states, especially the europeans are better at investing in training than the american

41:50.160 --> 41:52.160
american corporations are why

41:52.720 --> 41:55.280
You know sociologists like to talk about training as investing

41:55.920 --> 41:58.480
But investors see that as spending money

41:59.120 --> 42:06.240
And why are you spending money on that when you should be maybe doing stock buybacks or something to boost the value of your stock?

42:06.800 --> 42:11.920
So I wouldn't say it's capitalism. I would say it's this version of capitalism that we have right now

42:12.880 --> 42:17.680
We have similar kinds of short-term expectations among venture venture capitalists

42:18.400 --> 42:19.920
Which I think are very important

42:20.000 --> 42:21.680
It drives them

42:21.680 --> 42:27.440
To put their money into software at the expense of other industries, which I think we need very badly

42:27.920 --> 42:32.080
In the book. I'm very transparent about what I want staff workers to do

42:32.640 --> 42:38.000
I want them to save the planet. I really want them to develop clean energy better plastics

42:38.720 --> 42:39.680
of

42:39.680 --> 42:43.520
Carbon capture technologies. There's so many things we badly need

42:44.160 --> 42:46.160
But investors want software

42:46.720 --> 42:48.720
They love software

42:49.120 --> 42:52.720
You know instagram was worth a billion dollars when it had 11

42:53.360 --> 42:55.360
employees

42:55.920 --> 43:02.160
Instagram was was software. Yeah, and and the reason investors love software is because

43:02.880 --> 43:07.200
That is a from the from the perspective of investor. That's a fantastic investment

43:07.680 --> 43:10.480
You can easily demonstrate the technology works

43:11.120 --> 43:12.400
unlike

43:12.400 --> 43:17.200
New battery technologies unlike things that we badly need like fusion energy

43:17.280 --> 43:20.800
You know, there's some startups doing fusion energy. But boy, when are we going to get that?

43:20.880 --> 43:22.880
Can we really demonstrate that that works?

43:23.440 --> 43:26.640
With software you can pretty much show that it works pretty quickly

43:27.600 --> 43:30.800
You don't need a factory to create it

43:31.280 --> 43:36.400
Which is a major advantage. Yeah, if you don't need a factory, you don't need employees

43:37.120 --> 43:39.280
You just need a few people to do the software

43:40.800 --> 43:42.480
and

43:42.480 --> 43:44.480
and and so

43:44.480 --> 43:48.560
And then you can make massive amounts of money that the return on software investments are like

43:50.960 --> 43:58.080
10 times much percentage higher than returns on clean energy, which is which is what I think we badly need

43:58.720 --> 44:01.680
And so investors, you know, if they just keep blockchain

44:02.640 --> 44:06.320
ai's the new ones that I mentioned but any kind of software fintech, you know

44:06.720 --> 44:09.840
technology related to to finance social media

44:10.560 --> 44:16.400
The surveillance capitalism, which is another very, you know, there's a term coined by shoshana zuboff

44:17.200 --> 44:21.440
You know tracking us on the internet. Wow, we can sell you more things

44:22.160 --> 44:25.280
And and not necessarily have to produce things. So we don't need factories

44:25.360 --> 44:31.120
We don't have what investors call the valley of death where you kind of go from the the innovation to the actual

44:31.760 --> 44:35.440
Manufacturing phase which can take a while making sure the prototype works and all that kind of stuff

44:36.080 --> 44:38.080
so that's a long way to say

44:38.560 --> 44:43.200
Capitalism is not the problem. I think it's the version of capitalism that we have right now

44:43.600 --> 44:45.280
Okay, and there's probably like a whole other podcast

44:45.280 --> 44:50.800
We could devote to how that version of capitalism came to be but I'll we'll stay a little bit focused here

44:51.600 --> 44:54.400
Uh, and I do want to give you a chance to mention that

44:55.040 --> 45:00.400
The fear of becoming obsolete and then getting fired is not the only thing that is

45:00.960 --> 45:04.080
Keeping STEM grads slightly unhappy. I mean, there's the

45:04.560 --> 45:05.920
Overwork

45:05.920 --> 45:11.440
aspect there's other things where the grass isn't quite as green as they hoped it would be once you've gotten your

45:12.000 --> 45:14.800
bachelors in electrical engineering and enter the job market

45:15.840 --> 45:17.840
Yeah, so I I tend to think

45:18.480 --> 45:24.720
Again taking at face value these employers that there are these dire shortages and it's a crisis and those are the words that they use

45:25.120 --> 45:30.640
Take that at face value. Well, what are they doing? How are they treating these these STEM workers?

45:31.040 --> 45:35.200
And one of the things that they do is they incentivize movements out of STEM

45:36.080 --> 45:38.080
and they do that by

45:38.080 --> 45:40.080
paying their managers more

45:40.480 --> 45:44.160
And I I know you're an NBA basketball fan. I know you love

45:45.120 --> 45:46.560
you love

45:46.560 --> 45:50.400
The Sixers you've got your passions there. Do you still love the Sixers?

45:50.400 --> 45:52.480
We had Daryl Mori as a guest on the podcast

45:53.360 --> 45:55.360
Okay

45:56.160 --> 45:57.840
uh, so

45:57.840 --> 46:00.400
It's interesting because in professional sports

46:00.960 --> 46:06.080
The players who have these scarce skills are paid more than the managers, right?

46:07.120 --> 46:07.840
in

46:07.840 --> 46:11.120
In STEM the managers are typically not always

46:11.680 --> 46:16.480
typically paid more than the folks who have the skills that are supposedly scarce. Yeah, and

46:17.440 --> 46:19.040
and

46:19.040 --> 46:21.040
employers control wages

46:21.360 --> 46:23.600
they can

46:23.680 --> 46:26.240
They decide how much to pay their workers

46:26.800 --> 46:30.960
This is an area where I I think sociologists have done a little bit better than the economists the

46:31.520 --> 46:33.040
the economists

46:33.040 --> 46:35.040
they have some theories about wages, but

46:35.600 --> 46:36.960
understanding

46:36.960 --> 46:40.000
The starting point of the wage. I don't think they've been very good at

46:40.640 --> 46:46.080
And I think sociologists are a little bit better at this. I talked to the co of a tech company

46:46.080 --> 46:48.000
I'm using an anecdote here

46:48.000 --> 46:49.600
And he was telling me

46:49.600 --> 46:55.600
We need more we need more user experience designers the folks who design the interface of the software that we're using right now

46:56.400 --> 46:57.840
and

46:57.840 --> 47:00.080
And I don't want to pay them what they're demanding

47:01.280 --> 47:07.280
And and he showed me there's these there's these services that kind of do surveys of how much people are paying

47:07.760 --> 47:13.520
People in different fields including user experience designers and he's saying look at how much they make

47:13.520 --> 47:17.440
I don't want to pay them more than this. That's a sociological kind of dynamic

47:17.440 --> 47:20.080
It's called it's you know isomorphism is the jargony thing

47:20.080 --> 47:22.720
But you know, we want to look like we're doing what other folks are doing

47:22.720 --> 47:26.800
We don't want to be someone who pays their user experience designer too much

47:27.680 --> 47:29.040
this this

47:29.040 --> 47:34.240
This uh, this guy decided I can't find people here to do it. I'm going to outsource this job

47:35.360 --> 47:37.360
So he went around the world

47:37.760 --> 47:40.160
Eastern Europe, China, Mexico

47:40.960 --> 47:44.560
India looking for cheaper user experience designers

47:45.520 --> 47:49.520
Until he found some that he thought were competent and he could pay them less so

47:51.360 --> 47:53.840
And then that's you know, the more that kind of thing takes off the

47:54.480 --> 47:59.840
The less you incentivize people to move into that field in the united states and the more you become dependent on outsourcing that thing

47:59.840 --> 48:03.280
but but a big argument that I make in the book is that

48:04.480 --> 48:12.800
There's a lot of self-inflicted wounds here if indeed there is there is scarcity and the decision to pay your stem workers less than their managers

48:13.760 --> 48:18.560
And to incentivize movements out of stem which not every firm does but it's very common

48:19.440 --> 48:21.680
It's one of it's one of the problems in this area

48:22.560 --> 48:23.680
well and

48:23.680 --> 48:25.680
there is also the idea that

48:27.040 --> 48:31.520
Because there truly are so many stem graduates that these employers can hire

48:31.920 --> 48:37.520
That they can kind of abuse them once they're there, right that they can kind of give them overtime. Uh, there's these

48:38.160 --> 48:42.000
Schedules that are invented to hit targets and really crush people

48:42.320 --> 48:48.480
And it can be it can be kind of uh, soul-destroying to just toil away this job for a few years before you get outdated

48:49.600 --> 48:54.320
I I think that that's exactly right. Sean and I I rely

48:55.120 --> 48:57.120
pretty heavily on

48:57.360 --> 48:59.360
to kind of explore the detail of this a

49:00.240 --> 49:03.680
ethnography an ethnography by a sociologist named ofer charon

49:03.760 --> 49:08.480
I want to give him a shout out because I think he did such great work where he spent some time at a

49:09.920 --> 49:11.840
big tech company he had to keep it anonymous

49:11.920 --> 49:15.840
but it's a it's a major tech company that that folks know and that is

49:16.720 --> 49:20.080
you know has deep pockets it has a lot of money and

49:21.360 --> 49:27.040
Boy, they work their workers really hard and and he he kind of captured this thing and I

49:27.360 --> 49:32.240
I actually use this for my in my intro to sociology class to kind of in my sociology of work to talk about

49:33.040 --> 49:36.000
Again, the sort of social scientists making everything seem bad

49:36.080 --> 49:41.200
But even these jobs that are supposedly great even these jobs that looks that look fun

49:41.680 --> 49:44.080
And the media image of some of these STEM jobs is

49:44.640 --> 49:48.720
people playing foosball people playing ping pong

49:49.360 --> 49:54.080
There was a STEM employer here in san diego that had this big swirly slide in the atrium

49:54.720 --> 49:56.720
of their of their workplace

49:57.440 --> 49:59.440
Uh

49:59.760 --> 50:04.560
This ofer charon went to this company and saw that people didn't really use this stuff

50:05.360 --> 50:12.160
That it looked like a lot of fun stuff was around but people didn't use it and that was because for much of the year

50:12.960 --> 50:16.160
These workers were in what they call crunch mode or crunch time

50:16.880 --> 50:21.680
And that is the time when they're racing to deliver a product that has been

50:22.240 --> 50:26.400
promised at a for for a delivery date at a particular time

50:27.120 --> 50:29.440
And they've got to make sure that it works

50:30.080 --> 50:31.840
and they've

50:31.840 --> 50:33.840
They've start working

50:33.840 --> 50:37.120
He found workers worked an average of 67 hours a week

50:37.680 --> 50:39.680
That's a long time. Yeah

50:39.840 --> 50:41.840
And and they and they did it

50:42.480 --> 50:47.680
Sort of voluntarily the the managers have these clever ways of managing workers to

50:48.080 --> 50:54.560
If they didn't come with the passion to sort of coax the passion out of them or make them behave as if they're passionate

50:55.840 --> 50:58.960
It's these pretty bruising performance reviews

50:59.520 --> 51:04.640
Where every worker is ranked. It's it's called stacked ranking or forced ranking

51:05.520 --> 51:06.960
Sometimes it's called

51:06.960 --> 51:08.960
cynically rank and yank

51:08.960 --> 51:14.000
Where you rank up the workers and you yank out the ones that are ranked in a low in a low position

51:14.720 --> 51:19.360
But the workers themselves choose their hours and they choose the hours

51:20.080 --> 51:22.800
Based on this idea that they want to impress their manager

51:23.360 --> 51:29.760
So the manager might go to them and say hey, we got us this product. We want to deliver. We want it to have this and that capability

51:30.960 --> 51:34.560
We need someone to do this particular aspect of this software for example

51:35.440 --> 51:36.480
and

51:36.480 --> 51:39.600
Do you think you could do it and how long do you think it'll take you?

51:40.400 --> 51:44.800
And they want a high ranking. They want a high evaluation for their performance evaluation

51:45.440 --> 51:51.040
So they kind of over promise or they certainly promise very ambitiously

51:52.640 --> 51:56.240
Because if they say uh, that looks hard. Oh, I don't know about that

51:56.720 --> 51:58.720
Maybe you should dial down your expectations

52:00.000 --> 52:02.640
That manager is going to think I don't know if I want this guy

52:02.720 --> 52:08.160
I mean the obvious analogies to graduate school cannot have missed your notice

52:09.120 --> 52:11.120
Yes, yeah, there's

52:11.200 --> 52:12.400
There's

52:12.400 --> 52:17.040
There's definitely a lot of analogies to to graduate school. You were absolutely right

52:17.680 --> 52:21.840
My mind is racing right now with some of them, but trying to stay focused here. So

52:22.480 --> 52:24.480
So what you have is workers

52:25.120 --> 52:30.080
seemingly voluntarily taking on these excessive hours and then

52:31.600 --> 52:33.840
Working themselves very very hard

52:34.720 --> 52:38.320
One one software developer compared it to drinking out of a fire hose

52:38.400 --> 52:40.880
Just trying to keep up with all the stuff that's going on

52:41.680 --> 52:44.560
And and developing the skills that they need

52:45.200 --> 52:48.480
Maybe they promise something that involves a skill that they don't have yet

52:48.880 --> 52:54.160
So they got to work to develop that and and that stuff is very difficult and one of the things that

52:54.800 --> 53:00.560
Maybe some of your listeners are familiar with. I know some of the some of the stem workers with whom I've spoken are familiar with this

53:00.800 --> 53:08.320
It's often a young person's game and and part of that there's there's reasons for that one of them is that

53:09.920 --> 53:14.480
Some young people kind of realize wow, I'm going to have to keep my skills up to date all the time

53:14.560 --> 53:17.440
That's going to be hard and I can do this for a little while

53:17.520 --> 53:20.160
But I kind of burn out and then I move on to something else

53:21.120 --> 53:26.560
The other thing is that older workers often have families and if you have families

53:27.440 --> 53:29.440
They take time unfortunately

53:30.720 --> 53:33.840
Maybe that's fortunate. That's okay. It's not it's not

53:34.880 --> 53:38.000
It's it's something it's a job that you have to do

53:38.720 --> 53:39.600
and

53:39.600 --> 53:42.240
And it doesn't go away and and these workers

53:43.360 --> 53:45.360
They have a they have a second shift at home

53:46.080 --> 53:48.640
if they're not shunting that off onto a spouse

53:49.360 --> 53:53.600
And and it gets harder and harder to self-train in your in your in your own

53:54.480 --> 53:57.840
Your own time and so it just create it creates more and more stress

53:58.560 --> 54:06.320
So these these deadlines happen and and and it does put a lot of pressure on on workers. And again, this might sound very

54:07.440 --> 54:11.520
Softwarey very tech focused, but but those are the employers who

54:12.400 --> 54:18.800
Say their shortages those are the employers who often are the richest those are the employers getting all this investment from investors

54:19.280 --> 54:23.360
And if there's any place where we would expect STEM workers to be treated really great

54:24.000 --> 54:30.960
It should be these employers and and I don't think we see that and there is there's a point you make in the book

54:31.040 --> 54:33.040
and I wasn't sure whether this was

54:33.120 --> 54:36.080
in your mind more aspirational or factual but the

54:36.720 --> 54:41.280
Idea that a lot of there's some idealism in the young STEM workers

54:41.360 --> 54:44.000
They want to or they should want to I'm not sure

54:44.560 --> 54:46.560
make the world a better place and

54:46.720 --> 54:52.160
That turns out not to be the most lucrative job opportunity the making a world a better place kind of fields

54:53.520 --> 54:55.920
Yeah, so this is where I was able to

54:56.800 --> 55:01.120
Explore some of the issues. I was a double major in sociology and philosophy

55:01.520 --> 55:06.640
And I've always been interested like you in the meaning of life. What is this all for?

55:07.360 --> 55:09.360
I don't get much

55:09.600 --> 55:13.040
Opportunity to really study that but in the last chapter of the book

55:13.120 --> 55:17.280
I wanted to really explore this question of STEM education for what?

55:17.920 --> 55:19.360
what are we

55:19.360 --> 55:21.360
what are we

55:21.760 --> 55:27.200
What are we as a society hoping to get with these innovations that STEM workers are producing

55:28.240 --> 55:32.880
And I think that some STEM workers and and I want to be really clear about this

55:32.960 --> 55:36.800
I'm sure there's some very very happy STEM workers who are listening to this right now

55:36.880 --> 55:42.560
I hope they're still listening and they're thinking I love my job. I'm not working 70 hours a week

55:43.040 --> 55:48.800
This is fantastic. I'm making tons of money. I can retire early. There are those folks. I'm talking about the aggregate

55:49.760 --> 55:55.360
And there are folks who are really excited to be working on interesting STEM problems

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Regardless of what it is

55:58.320 --> 56:00.320
Some some STEM workers are

56:01.200 --> 56:04.560
And I admire them. They're kind of pure scientists in a way. They love

56:05.200 --> 56:10.080
particular ways of thinking and so they could move from

56:11.040 --> 56:17.520
cosmology or astrophysics into data science and predictive algorithms and things like that thinking

56:17.920 --> 56:19.520
I

56:19.520 --> 56:21.920
There's a guy I I don't know if he ended up in the book

56:22.000 --> 56:23.120
I may have

56:23.120 --> 56:25.040
I may have had him in there. I may have cut him out

56:25.120 --> 56:30.400
But he was an astrophysics major who couldn't get a job or decided not to get a job in academia

56:30.800 --> 56:32.960
And then he worked for a clothing retailer

56:34.320 --> 56:40.960
That needed experts in AI and machine learning and that sort of thing so that they could

56:41.680 --> 56:43.040
Give

56:43.040 --> 56:44.560
customers

56:44.560 --> 56:46.560
Suggestions of new clothes to buy

56:47.360 --> 56:50.000
Okay, now very I would find that to be

56:50.560 --> 56:58.160
Kind of soul-destroying to go from thinking about general relativity to be thinking about how can I get someone to buy things that they don't need

56:59.120 --> 57:04.000
Yeah, but but from a pure science standpoint from the pure complexity of problem standpoint

57:04.400 --> 57:06.400
Some folks can make that transition

57:07.360 --> 57:10.800
But not everybody right and so there's a literature in

57:11.680 --> 57:14.000
sociology and management and psychology

57:14.560 --> 57:20.000
About how some jobs can produce moral stresses or even moral injuries

57:20.880 --> 57:24.720
Anyone who's seen at at their workplace workplace bullying

57:25.280 --> 57:27.280
That you know, they might have felt a moral stress

57:27.760 --> 57:33.600
If they've known that their employer is someone at their job is embezzling that could create create a moral stress

57:34.320 --> 57:38.880
But what I was interested in the last chapter of the book asking stem education for what?

57:39.840 --> 57:43.520
Are the stem workers who are uncomfortable morally?

57:44.080 --> 57:47.360
with the business model of their of their firm

57:48.320 --> 57:51.280
And it's it's easy to pick on social media

57:51.360 --> 57:58.000
But it's easy to pick on social media because there's a lot of evidence that social media produces a lot of social harms

57:59.120 --> 58:04.240
And so I quote some workers at at facebook

58:05.040 --> 58:07.360
Who've said facebook is hurting?

58:08.080 --> 58:10.080
people at scale

58:10.320 --> 58:12.880
another worker another worker more

58:14.320 --> 58:15.440
more

58:15.440 --> 58:19.040
Graphically said I feel like I have blood on my hands

58:19.760 --> 58:27.200
For facebook's role in promoting disinformation and promoting political conflict in societies other than the united states

58:27.760 --> 58:31.200
Other people have said well to actually promote conflict in the united states

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
there's new research coming out

58:34.160 --> 58:35.440
about

58:35.440 --> 58:40.560
Rises in depression, especially teen depression, especially teen girls pretty effective and

58:41.360 --> 58:43.360
And there's studies are convincing. Yeah

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
there's there's evidence that

58:46.080 --> 58:47.440
suggests

58:47.440 --> 58:51.600
Hard to prove these things definitively causal inferences are very difficult in social science

58:52.080 --> 58:56.320
But there's evidence that suggests social media use is part of the reason we're seeing

58:57.920 --> 59:00.880
Very alarming rises in teen depression

59:02.000 --> 59:06.400
So, you know, some stem workers can think oh, we're doing interesting things

59:07.120 --> 59:12.400
Analytically these are exciting problems to solve. I'm working with smart people. They can get really jazzed about that

59:13.120 --> 59:15.120
Other workers can kind of think

59:15.440 --> 59:21.120
When I go home at night, I don't feel good about what I'm doing here. Yeah, um, you know, they're even like

59:22.560 --> 59:24.320
I don't know if any

59:24.320 --> 59:29.120
I don't know if any of your you or any of your listeners have kind of gone on these youtube rabbit holes

59:29.120 --> 59:33.040
Where you start watching a video and then youtube saying what about this one? What about this one?

59:33.040 --> 59:35.520
How about that one you like that check out this one?

59:36.320 --> 59:38.640
and they they tend to

59:39.600 --> 59:43.360
Lead you into more extreme content or more

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
shocking or emotionally

59:46.560 --> 59:48.400
provocative content

59:48.400 --> 59:50.400
there's a phrase

59:50.960 --> 59:56.400
Engagement equals enragment or maybe you could reverse it enragment equals engagement, but the idea is

59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.720
getting this emotional hook into the users by

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.200
outraging them

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.600
Is a way to get them to use the app longer?

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.080
and so

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.440
you know

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.440
Google the google owns

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.920
Alphabet owns google google owns youtube

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.640
They're involved in this stuff as well

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:20.480
Very rich company using using different technologies to get people

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:26.240
Very upset and you could imagine workers not being happy with this. Well before you

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:33.280
Defended capitalism a little bit saying that there's a particular type of capitalism which we've evolved to and and I

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:39.200
I appreciate the benefits of capitalism in in certain circumstances markets are good at solving certain problems

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.240
But a lot of what you're describing really just sounds like

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:46.400
Capitalism that's gotten better at being efficiently

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:53.280
Capitalistic because of faster information flows and faster decisions and more scales and

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.880
wider labor markets and things like that whereas

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:03.200
As a globe as a species we produce a lot. We produce abundance

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:06.640
And and do we need to think radically it's late in the podcast

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.880
This is where we let to you know get to speculate a little bit

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:13.120
So do we need to think more radically about the system that lets this all happen?

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:18.720
I actually don't think we need to think more radically about it. I think that

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.320
we have the tools available now to

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:27.600
Get more out of our investments in STEM education than we are getting now

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:33.120
One of the things we could do is create more incentives for

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.360
Innovators in the fields that we desperately need

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:44.000
I often think, you know, if if we're all made extinct by climate change or something like that

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.720
And you know when alien civilization comes down and they look at us and they think well

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.720
What were you guys investing in

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.680
When the planet was falling apart and there were pandemics and the signs were all around you that you were in big trouble

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.800
And if we say cryptocurrency blockchain AI

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.600
surveillance economy, you know

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.480
It's going to look a little silly

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:05.920
so

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.720
I think some intervention is needed, but not a radical change

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:14.480
So one of the things we could do is create more government incentives in investment in clean energy

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.760
Better plastics that don't

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.560
To don't create micro nanoplastics that are in our bodies and human breast milk

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.560
incredibly

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.320
Forever chemicals that we don't know what are doing with us. We can create

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.680
We can create incentives through tax

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:37.600
rebates or tax incentives to make these movements happen the inflation reduction act

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:44.560
Which is a very general name for a very big bill did create these incentives and it's created stakeholders who are are

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:50.480
Moving into the clean energy space. So one thing you can do is create incentives for more of the investments we need

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:56.080
That'll produce more opportunities for stem workers to deploy their skills in ways that might feel morally

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.720
resonant with them

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.200
And another thing you can do is simply

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.240
Make illegal

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:10.800
Some uses of stem skills. There's there's a lot of debate in among legal experts about whether

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.840
Targeted advertising should just be banned

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:19.760
So that you remove the incentive for these companies to endlessly find ways to

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:26.160
To surveil their all of us on the internet because if they can't do this targeted advertising

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.640
Then they don't have an incentive to do that anymore. So you can legislate things away

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.120
and then

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.120
another thing you could do is just think about

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:41.440
Moral limits on investors and and business models, you know

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:46.160
Cannabis is legal in my state of cal of california

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:53.680
But my understanding is the cannabis business is a little shaky because banks are a little nervous working with those folks

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:59.600
There's there's this kind of sense that they're sort of cordoned off like whoa, you guys are a little bit different

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.600
um

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:06.000
I hesitate to use this word, but pornography is a very lucrative field

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.600
That's also kind of like, whoa, we don't want to invest in that, you know, we don't really want to be a part of that

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:19.920
So we already have moral limits that shape investor behavior and and what people are willing to

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.720
spend their time on in terms of business practices and investing

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.360
but for some reason

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.360
it's okay to

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:36.080
Take away people's privacy to stoke division and conflict to encourage

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.560
Disinformation the spread of disinformation in society

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.880
A lot of things that you might argue are more harmful than cannabis

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:52.160
You know are okay for investors to invest in you know mass layoffs, which disrupt families

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.960
There's a lot of things that investors tolerate right now

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.000
Which perhaps they shouldn't perhaps a little more moral education

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:07.280
Could could go a ways here as well, you know, I'm not a cannabis guy, but I was an online poker player

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:15.920
And uh, it it used to be done by many many people and the government swooped in one friday and seized all their assets

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.120
And uh, really basically can't play poker online now

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.360
Certain states you can but it used to just be all over and and I agree

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.400
That's a lot less harmful than some of the things you just mentioned

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.240
Yeah, so there's there's research that suggests that

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.160
you can

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:37.920
You can tweak capitalism. You can you can fix it and which in ways that will generate

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:45.520
The productive energies the innovation the riches the capitalism that can produce and minimize some of the harms that we that we see

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.640
Well, I don't quite so the thing that I'm still missing though is

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.200
The innovation disrupting

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.000
The kinds of jobs that people grew up having you know if if if as is plausible

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.760
The rate of innovation and and which skills are relevant is

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.560
Increasing the rate so it's faster now

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:12.000
We're always going to have a an issue where people who hit 50 are no longer valued and that that does seem a bit harder to solve

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I'm not quite sure how to do it

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.600
Yeah, so

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:22.080
The the national survey of college graduates. They they asked this broad range of of of college graduates

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:27.440
Did they take skills related training in the past year or two and

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.360
and

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:35.920
We looked at the time since their degree and about 60 percent have taken skills related training in stem

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.880
Up to 30 years after their degree

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:44.320
So we're getting into the 50s. It starts to go down when we're getting into getting into people's 60s

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:49.440
So you're absolutely right that that is an issue. So one of the things that we need to do is

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.120
I don't like this phrase Sean because it sounds so 1970s

01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.240
The lifelong learning we we have this model of education

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.880
That you graduate

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.360
in your early 20s, and then you're gone

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.920
and

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:12.560
And I really think we need to change that we're in a different era now

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:18.800
And we need a model where we think of college as a place you return to

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.040
periodically

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.040
for skills updating or

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:28.480
A rescaling something in a different area altogether when your skills become obsolete

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.480
Maybe something like a subscription model or something where you can go back to your alma mater or a different university

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:41.040
But this expectation that we have of college is something you do when you're young and then you move on

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.080
Maybe needs to be changed a little bit

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:48.880
I I still think that college education is absolutely essential for creating

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:54.800
But I would I like to think of as foundational skills the basic skills that a college graduate has

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.280
One of the things is to learn how to learn

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.640
PhD training really makes you good at that

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.440
But even with the bachelor's you kind of learn how to learn you can discern good knowledge from bad knowledge

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.440
You learn how to sort of sort through

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.760
what's what's good and bad and in in

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.040
Trying to find the skills that you might need or the knowledge you might need

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
But you'll have that core foundation

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:21.760
But then on top of that the skills that you actually deploy at work might change many times throughout your career

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:26.160
So I would argue and I'm working on a book on this with a colleague right now

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.800
College education is great for that foundation

01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:31.280
But circling back to

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.560
College to get a skills updating not for another degree

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.440
but kind of a short-term certificate

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.120
kind of

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:44.480
Very specific narrow kind of skill that can be deployed now might be something that many people will have to do

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:50.880
Repeatedly throughout their careers. I mean I am course of course. I'm very much in favor of lifelong learning

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.840
I do wonder though about the model because

01:08:54.640 --> 01:09:00.400
What is that a very different life stage at age 40 than age 20 right when you're 20 not only you're learning it for the first time

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:05.680
But there's a certain freedom to fail because your obligations are relatively low

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.560
But once you have a kid and mortgages and things like that

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:15.200
And also you've been happy for the last 20 years doing some job. I mean I I'm in favor of efficiency

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:21.600
But I feel the human cost of having to say I need to do something different than what I've been doing before

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.320
Yeah, I agree with that. But the reality is

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:32.240
The reality is upon us. You are gonna have to do something different. There was a great study that was done

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.960
You know, social scientists love a natural experiment where something happens and you can

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.440
Something happens that's rare and you could

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.480
examine how human beings respond to it

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.120
so Steve Jobs decided that the

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:50.800
iPhone was no longer going to support adobe flash software right said, you know what?

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.680
We're not going to do adobe flash anymore. We're going to use something else

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.240
And there were a lot of software experts

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.600
On adobe flash not necessarily employed by adobe, but that was what they did

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:08.400
Suddenly that was gone. Yeah, they had to respond. So that reality is already there

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.880
Where the where a skill that

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.840
Has maybe been developed over a few years

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.200
It's just no longer needed

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.880
and

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.440
So that reality is already there. So how are we as a society gonna gonna deal with the

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:28.480
the regular obsolescing of technical skills and

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.200
You're right. It's definitely hard

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.080
People's identities get wrapped up in their jobs

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.920
and

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.040
And they their their skill sets get get, you know

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:44.560
More and more fine-tuned and then to lose that can be really tragic, especially as you say if they have a family

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.880
So that's going to be difficult. I think if

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.640
If shareholders don't punish companies for investing in the training of their workers, especially the richest companies

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.960
And for investing in their workers, that should be something that's encouraged and applauded

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.800
I got to tell you I don't want to go off the subject too much here

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:05.120
But google invests a lot of money in schools

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.560
They they give away chromebooks to students

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:15.200
They do a lot of things to get to train the next generation of software developers at that stage

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:19.200
But they could do more for their incumbent workers. Yeah

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.960
You know, that that's the odd thing and so social scientists

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:28.880
They they talk about corporate social responsibility and some things are done kind of as corporate branding, you know

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:33.840
Like look how good we are. We give away this money. Some of it's done to kind of create market share

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:37.520
Let's get a bunch of people using chromebooks and they're gonna love google

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.800
So there's there's money that's being spent in this area

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:45.680
But I would argue they could do more for their incumbent workers to manage these sometimes

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.240
Sometimes very difficult to navigate

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:52.960
Uh career changes or job skill changes later in life

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:58.080
Maybe maybe as a final thought we can be more idealistic ourselves because uh, of course

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.720
We want people to get

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.880
lucrative

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.120
Rewarding jobs that they can have in some level of security throughout their career

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.920
But that's not the only reason to get an education, right?

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:14.400
When people ask me about applying to graduate school in physics

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:20.960
My line is typically that you probably you will probably go in hoping to be a professor

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.440
You probably will not succeed at being a professor

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.240
But getting a phd in physics is actually an intrinsically good thing. You'll you'll be able to do something else

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.920
You'll learn a lot of skills, etc

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.680
I don't feel the same way about being a postdoc, but that's a different conversation

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.880
But you know, where does that fit in to this conversation?

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:41.840
Just the idea that getting a degree in STEM or related fields, you know has some value

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.040
Whatever your future life trajectory turns out to be

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.760
So I've seen that argument and

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.360
I appreciate your honesty when you tell people that the odds are

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:59.040
The odds are they will end up doing something different, right?

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.920
Then I think that's an important message to give them

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.240
Say yes, this is a great thing to do. You're going to get some very important skills

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:09.040
But keep an open mind for developing

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:14.480
Keep an open mind toward career trajectories that don't look like physics, right? So one of the

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:21.120
One of the disturbing findings I had in some research with a colleague when we looked at the national survey of college graduates

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.200
And we looked at people with STEM degrees who went into non-stem jobs

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:31.280
Is they were significantly less likely to report being satisfied with their jobs

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.200
overall

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.200
and interestingly

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:41.200
They were significantly less likely to be satisfied with the intellectual challenge of their jobs

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:42.800
interesting

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.800
so

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:50.720
A little bit less or they're less satisfied. They seem to be a little bit more likely to be bored

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.840
I don't feel so great about that

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.680
and

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.960
and so

01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:02.400
You know being honest with people and telling them. Hey, there's a good chance. You'll be doing something else

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:06.720
I would encourage folks to develop a broad range of skills through

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:13.040
We've got this I call it STEM mania in the book at my university Sean University, California, San Diego

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:18.160
It's it's sort of like a public caltech. I always thought of it as that it's it's really STEM focused

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.840
It was born

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:25.360
It's it isn't send you because that's where the script since student oceanography was and that sort of stem tone

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
really kind of dominates the university

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:34.240
And the students who major in the humanities and social scientists are social sciences other than economics

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.960
regularly have to defend themselves to the

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:43.280
They're they're the stem the stem majors who are like, what are you going to do with that? What's wrong with you?

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.440
This is crazy

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.920
And so this will sound self-serving

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
But I tell my stem majors who do take sociology classes

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.840
It is important to get a broad range of skills skills related to

01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:01.200
communication written oral critical thinking outside of technical skills

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.360
because

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:08.560
Chances are you're going to move into something outside of stem or sort of stem adjacent

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:13.840
And and and college is a time to really develop that that broad range of skills

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:19.920
I mean you always had that I mean you really always stood out your double major in philosophy and astronomy as I recall

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.480
Yeah, so you always had that message, but that's not typical

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:31.280
And so you could segue into this whole podcast thing and you know this this whole range of

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:34.640
Stuff that you do because of that undergraduate training

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:38.960
I'm trying to make a world of little miniature Sean Carroll's

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.680
So that they will have that

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:47.200
Flexibility to plug into different places in the economy stem expertise is great to have

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:53.840
I I would think the best thing that you could have to prepare yourself for the workplace of tomorrow is stem skills and

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:58.480
non-stem skills foundational sorts of skills like like like you have

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:02.240
Yeah, I mean you're not going to get any argument from me that the broad base is important

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.080
But if it's true that people who get stem degrees

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.320
report

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.120
dissatisfaction with their jobs once they get them

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:15.840
What are the data about humanities degrees or social science degrees?

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:23.440
No one cares about them. So I I didn't have a grant to look at them. I didn't really look at those folks

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.520
There are I I initially wanted to explore this there are

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.400
Pretty significant percentage

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:37.680
Different studies have different percentages, but a good 15 percent, you know of stem workers don't have stem degrees

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.560
and so you have folks

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:41.600
excuse me

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:47.520
You have folks who majored in humanities sort of subjects and they moved into technical fields

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:52.800
One of the great things about software development is it's a field that's pretty porous

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:56.800
You don't it's not like electrical engineering. It's hard to break into electrical engineering

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.880
Life sciences without those degrees

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:09.680
But software is is wonderfully porous you can you can be this sort of kid who worked on a computer in high school

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:14.720
Went and got I actually have a friend of mine who was a creative writing major

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:19.440
But he tinkered with computers in high school. He developed some some software

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.120
Sold it to a major software company did really well

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Even though his major was creative writing

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:29.440
So software is is is really welcoming to people

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:35.280
You can do these boot camps where you get your foundational skills in writing and communication

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:39.200
Then you do a boot camp encoding or data data analytics or something

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.160
Then you can plug into the stem economy that way

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.920
So that's definitely something that that you that you can do

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:51.360
So I I applaud those folks, but for the most part people are not

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:55.200
Worried or valorizing our humanities majors

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.880
And so

01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:02.720
And and I don't want to say we need to treat our stem majors and our stem our stem grads better than the other grads

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:04.560
but

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:10.320
If we say that there's shortages of stem grads if we say that stem grads are so important for the economy

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:14.320
We should at least treat these weeks these folks really well

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:22.160
And and hopefully treat everybody really well, but at least these folks who were constantly saying are so important and in such

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:28.880
Short supply. Well, okay. I like your final message, which is everyone should major in creative writing. I think that's a very

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.680
Wonderful world going forward. So it's John Scranton. Thanks so much for being on the mindscape podcast

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:40.160
Thanks, Sean. It was great to be here and you know, I just want to end with one thing

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:44.960
I've listened to podcasts before where people know the interviewer the host of the podcast

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:48.960
And they tediously kind of say, oh, we had also many great times in the past

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.360
You can cut this out my friend

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:57.360
But probably not many listeners know that you were a double threat on the basketball court

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:02.800
Not another no that you had an a sweet jump shot from the outside

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:08.480
I still remember the sound of the ball going through the net and nothing but the sound of that

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.160
And you had a you had a pretty good drive to the to the hoop as well

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:16.000
If someone covered you too close to the three-point line, you could blow by him

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.520
So not many not many of your listeners may know that about you

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:25.440
But that's definitely you were a multifaceted skilled guy and still are sorry to use the past tense

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:30.160
You must remember that that lefty hookshot was so annoying to everyone else yours

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:37.120
That like so many people, you know complained about it that you started complaining about them complaining about it because they weren't used to a lefty

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.920
That's that's right. But if everyone expects a right-handed jump shot

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:48.160
Then the left-handed hook is gonna is gonna is gonna keep me keep me going for quite a while something to remember

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.640
Thanks very much, John. Okay. Thanks, Sean

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.160
You
