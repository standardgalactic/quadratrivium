0	4000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.
4000	9200	One thing we do a lot here on Mindscape, or for that matter, I do in my life, otherwise,
9200	15840	even off the podcast, is to try to explain difficult concepts in physics to a broad audience,
15840	21520	right? Whether it's quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, relativity, cosmology, what have you,
21520	26720	taking these ideas that have been developed by lots of smart people over many years and bringing
26720	31840	them to a broader audience, which I think is very important and is absolutely doable if you put
31840	37040	the effort into it. But many people try to do this. We're not the only ones who try to do this.
37040	43680	And there are a couple of patterns which are kind of bad that many physicists or scientists more
43680	50320	broadly fall into when they're trying to explain their concepts to a broader audience. One is,
50320	54800	just from the fact that scientists, physicists, but also other kinds of scientists or other
54880	60480	kinds of academics, for that matter, are typically professors. They are college professors. And they've
60480	67760	developed a pretty good set of techniques for teaching students who are going to major in that
67760	74000	area, right? So physics professors, as part of their job, will teach young undergraduates,
74000	79840	and then up to graduate students, how to be a physicist. So they know what steps they have
79840	83680	to go through. They've taken the courses themselves. They've taught the course or they've read the
83680	89120	textbook or whatever. There's a set of ideas you have to march through. And one failure mode,
89120	95680	I would say, for reaching out to the public is people try to take that way of teaching physics,
95680	100800	the way that we teach our undergraduates, and just water it down, right? Teach exactly the same
100800	106400	stuff, the exactly the same concepts in the same order, but try to remove some of the equations
106400	112000	or something like that. And that's not always the right way to reach a different kind of audience.
112000	117120	I've come across this, of course, in my recent attempts to write the biggest ideas in the universe
117120	123200	where I'm trying to reach a broad audience with equations, but without any prior exposure to
123200	128880	those equations or those ideas. It's even harder if you're trying to explain without any equations
128880	133680	at all. It's really weird when you just take the usual steps that you would go through in an
133680	139360	undergraduate physics education and demathify them and expect people to understand. Another
139360	146800	failure mode is that sometimes we do search for analogies, stories, metaphors, allegories,
146800	154240	pictures, ways of getting across the basic idea without going into the equations. And it's a
154240	160560	little bit easy to forget that people take these analogies seriously, maybe more seriously than
160560	168480	they should, right? When a physicist presents an analogy for a deep physical concept, they know
168480	174160	which aspects of the analogy actually apply and which do not apply to this situation,
174160	179120	and the poor person listening doesn't know that. So they just take the analogy at face value.
179120	185520	So because of these failure modes, there's an enormous value to be placed on actually stepping
185520	191280	back, thinking deeply about the ideas we want to convey, forgetting about how we teach our
191280	197120	undergraduates, to really think about how we should just talk to people who are not going to become
197760	203920	physicists down the line, but want to understand the ideas. And today's guest, Matt Strassler,
204720	209840	is really, really good at exactly that. Matt is an accomplished physicist, someone I've known for a
209840	215360	long time, but he's put an enormous amount of work. I can vouch for this. I've been talking to
215360	221120	Matt for years about this book that is about to come out called Waves in an Impossible Sea,
221120	227040	How Everyday Life Emerges from the Cosmic Ocean. And the cheap way of saying what the book is about
227520	232880	is it's about quantum field theory and modern physics. But the real charm of the book is that
232880	240480	he really takes seriously the challenge of talking about these ideas in a way that is
241120	250640	as honest and true to the material as possible without just watering down the usual years-long
250640	256240	physics curriculum or relying on analogies that give you some good ideas and some bad ideas at
256240	261200	the same time. So it's a novel take on trying to understand these ideas. And we're going to go from
262000	268400	basic ideas like relativity and quantum field theory to maybe some fun research level things,
268400	273760	because Matt's a very good explainer of these things. So it's physics. It's the kind of stuff
273760	279040	we talk about all the time, but maybe with a slightly fresh take on it. So let's go.
286240	298320	Matt Straster, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
299120	301120	Thank you, Sean. It's a pleasure to be here.
301120	307200	So you know, like I do, that a bit over a decade ago we discovered The Higgs Boson,
307200	312800	and I wrote a whole book about The Higgs Boson. I remember this famous story, and apparently there
312800	320640	was a competition, you know, it was inspired by some British government official who didn't
320640	324240	understand The Higgs Boson. And so the physicist said, you know, who'd come up with the best
324240	329600	metaphor for what it is? And they came up with this metaphor of people of different levels of fame
329600	336640	walking through a party. I would start by asking you, like, what was that metaphor? Is it any good,
336640	343760	or does it do more harm than good? Well, the image that was brought to mind
344400	351280	by the winner of this competition has some, you know, it has some general merit to it,
351280	358720	and that it gives a sense of perhaps what things might be like in that a person who is totally
358720	363120	unknown can just make their way through the party. Nobody pays any attention. They just have to
363440	367440	shove their way through. The people are in their way, and that's all there is to it.
368240	372320	So that would be your experience in mind. But if Margaret Thatcher walks into the room,
372320	377200	suddenly everybody wants to talk to her, and so she makes it in a meter or so, and then she finds
377200	382560	herself stopped, and then she tries to go another few meters, and she stopped again. And so it just
382560	389920	takes her a very long time. She's slowed down by all the people in the room. And so the image that
390720	396240	this particular metaphor is trying to convey is that the Higgs field is like this substance
396240	401920	that fills the room, and those things that interact with that substance are slowed down,
401920	407120	and that has to do with why they have mass. And is that good?
408480	416880	Well, no. It's pretty bad, actually. And again, this is not to criticize the inventors
416880	422640	of this metaphor, because they were supposed to come up with something that fits in a paragraph.
423440	428800	And the fact of the matter is that some aspects of the universe don't fit in a paragraph,
428800	436800	and this is one of them. But what's unfortunate about this particular metaphor is not merely
436800	443680	that it doesn't really capture the essence of what's going on, but it actually flies in the face
443680	450160	of an even more important principle of nature. And that is the relationship between
451360	460080	mass and motion. And if, as this metaphor suggests, you get the idea that, oh, mass has to do with
460080	467120	slowing things down, with obstruction, with obstructing motion, then your conception of
467120	472640	the world ends up back in the Middle Ages. And you really don't want to end up there.
472640	477680	I mean, they were smart people, but they were very confused, and we would prefer to avoid
477680	483360	that confusion. Now, what am I talking about here? What is going wrong with this metaphor
483360	490320	is that it contradicts the principle of relativity, which if you even don't know much physics,
490320	494400	you've never taken a class on it, you've never heard much about it, violating the principle
494400	501840	of relativity sounds like a pretty bad idea, and it is. And the reason it's such an important
501840	509360	principle is that it explains many of the fundamentally counterintuitive aspects of the
509360	518000	basics of being in this world. For example, why it is that we're all, you know, I'm sitting down,
518000	522720	you're sitting down, both of us feel like we're not going anywhere. But of course, we are. The
522720	527680	earth is spinning, the earth is going around the sun, the sun is going around the galaxy,
528400	533680	and the speeds involved are enormous. I mean, the earth is going, the earth and sun are going
533680	544080	around the galaxy at 150 miles per second. Now, why don't we feel that? And why if the earth has
544080	552000	so much mass and this metaphor we're right, why isn't it slowing down? This picture of Margaret
552000	556320	Thatcher having a lot of mass because she's being slowed down by the crowd. Well, I mean,
556320	561280	the earth has a lot more mass than she does. Why isn't the Higgs field slowing the earth down?
562720	568320	Well, the answer is that the metaphor doesn't work. And you therefore have to try to find a way
569200	574400	back to the principle of relativity to start the process of explaining what the Higgs field
574400	579920	really does. And so that's why the book I've recently written starts at that place.
579920	584960	I do like the fact that you can date the origin of the metaphor so precisely just by the fact that
584960	588800	it was Margaret Thatcher who they picked as the famous person who would have trouble walking
588800	595680	through the party. Yes. And you can imagine that today it would be Elon Musk, but
597440	602160	he would certainly have trouble. But he's very wealthy, but his mass is not that big.
603680	609040	Well, this is what I like about your book because, of course, quantum field theory is a mutual
609040	614320	interest of ours. And I think that we both agree that it would be nice if everyone in the world
614320	618880	understood quantum field theory a little bit better than they do. If I were to explain it,
618880	623360	I would probably start with quantum mechanics and then say, OK, what if you do fields to it?
624000	630080	And you take a very different approach, really starting with relativity and spacetime and mass
630080	637040	and how those things work. So tell us what relativity is. It didn't come from Einstein originally.
637040	646400	It did not. And indeed, Einstein, in a way, saved it more than created it as we understand it today.
646400	651440	And the person who was perhaps most responsible, although clearly there were other people who were
651440	660960	thinking about it, historically was Galileo. In the 1630s, Galileo wrote a famous passage into one
660960	668640	of his texts in which he explained that if you're on a boat and you're inside the boat,
668640	674160	so the wind isn't blowing in your hair, you're just inside in one of the rooms,
674160	680160	and the boat is moving really steadily. It's not a wavy day. The boat is just smoothly moving
680160	686320	through the water. You will have no idea that the boat is in motion. You will not be able to tell
686320	691280	how fast it's going or which direction it's going. And he gives lots of examples of things
691280	696960	that you could do to try to check it. You might think that, well, if I drop something and the
696960	702640	boat is moving, then as I drop it, it will move towards the back of the boat. But that's not true.
703920	708240	Maybe you might think the flies in the room will be all pushed to the back of the room.
709120	715520	But that's not true. And when you think it through, he argued, you realize that there's
715520	720080	nothing, absolutely nothing you can do, which would show that you are in motion as long as that
720080	729840	motion is steady. And he infers from this that the laws of nature do not depend in any way on
729840	736000	whether you are moving if that motion is steady. And when you think about it, that's the thin end
736000	742400	of the wedge on the question of why you and I don't feel our motion. And so we go from
743120	750800	a situation where even in 1600, 50 years after Copernicus, really great thinkers like Tycho Brahe,
751840	759120	Kepler's boss, could write things down saying that it's just not possible that the earth is spinning
759920	765040	and moving around the sun. That makes no sense. We would feel it. A heavy body like the earth
765040	771280	shouldn't be moving. To the modern day where we realize that the earth, in fact, is flying
771280	776720	through the heavens at extraordinary speed and doing all sorts of gyrations, and yet we are
776720	782560	completely unaware of it here on earth. And the explanation for that is Galileo's realization
782560	790240	about how motion is a relative thing. There is no such thing as absolute motion. You can't say
791360	797520	in this universe whether you are moving or not. You can only say how fast you're moving relative
797520	803440	to another object. You and I had a longer than it should have been conversation once about whether
803440	810400	the earth goes around the sun. Or the sun around the earth. Well, or is it up to you because you
810400	815200	can choose coordinate systems? Did you ever personally come down to the right answer in your
815200	821600	mind there? I did. And this is a wonderful question, although it's a question fundamentally about
822480	825600	Einstein's general notion of relativity. I know, skipping ahead, but that's okay. It's just a
825600	831680	podcast. It's all right. But I'll give you the short answer. And of course, I wrote about this
831680	837200	extensively on my blog because I thought, this is such an interesting question. And here there are
837200	842320	professors at significant universities who actually argue that, no, you really can't say whether the
842320	848400	earth goes around the sun or vice versa. And the reason that's a mistake, I believe, is that
849040	854480	it's not just about two objects, one orbiting the other. You really are asking the question,
855280	860960	is the earth orbiting the sun subject to gravity? In other words, it's not just a matter about what
860960	868800	its path is, but why its path is the way it is. And you can easily tell that the earth is going
868800	874960	around the sun in sun's gravity and not the other way around as simply as looking, but by simply
874960	885040	looking at Kepler's third law of mechanics, which tells you that the planets have a rule by which
885680	891760	their orbital times are related to their orbital distances from the sun. And the earth satisfies
891760	898480	Kepler's law for the sun, whereas the earth also has a Kepler's like law. The moon satisfies it,
898480	905120	the space station satisfies it, but the sun does not. And so, in a way, it's as simple as that.
905120	911440	Now, you can go into more detail and talk about the fact that orbits are an entire class of motions
911440	916720	and not just the earth's motion alone, and come up with all sorts of ways of saying this in more
916720	922320	technical detail. But in the end, fundamentally, it's not true that the sun goes around the earth
922320	926640	gravitationally. And that's really what's at stake here. The earth goes around the sun
926640	930080	gravitationally and not the other way around. Yeah. And so, I am one of the people who would
930080	935760	disagree with you about this. But of course, it's interesting precisely because you and I
935760	941680	100% agree on the physics, right? It's just a matter of how to match up the words in the
941680	947360	English language to the physics that we understand. And that's going to be a theme throughout your
947360	952480	book and your attempts to discuss relativity and quantum mechanics and so forth. Yeah. I mean,
952480	958080	I think just in the sense there's an even larger issue, which is the fact that scientists could
958080	964000	agree on the physics and disagree on the way to talk about the physics, even colleagues like you
964000	973280	and you and I, is a clear problem for a person who is not an expert trying to understand what
973280	981840	scientists do know and what scientists are still disagreeing about. And so, I think,
981920	987120	for both you and I and for other people who spend a lot of time trying to convey
987840	994720	how science works, the important thing to do is be very clear about what it is we know
995360	1001120	and about why it is we are explaining it in the way that we are, so that a non-expert could
1001120	1006320	read what I write about it and could read what you write about it and come away with a correct
1006320	1011520	impression, namely, we're not disagreeing about the math. We're disagreeing about the way to look
1011600	1018320	at the math, but that's not in the end what physics is. Physics is about prediction based
1018320	1023520	on mathematics and the fact that you want to talk about it in a different way does not make it a
1023520	1029040	contradiction. It simply makes it a different perspective on the same thing. Good. We'll see
1029040	1034720	how that shows up as we go, but I don't want to leave Galileo behind entirely because I've made
1034720	1045120	the case most clearly in my book, The Big Picture. To me, the specific idea that motion just continues
1045120	1049840	on by itself, right, that the natural state of things is for things to keep moving at a constant
1049840	1054960	velocity. If you want to promote that to conservation of momentum or something like that, you can,
1054960	1061840	but to me, that is maybe the single biggest realization in the history of science because
1061920	1069600	it removes the need for explaining why things are moving, right? In the middle ages point of view,
1069600	1076080	it was weird when things were moving and you needed a force or a mover to do it and post Galileo
1076080	1081680	and his other predecessors, like Ibn Sina, who set this up, now we can just think of the universe
1081680	1088880	as kind of a mechanism following patterns. That's right. And there's a very close tie between
1089680	1098480	the law of inertia or whatever, what comes up in physics classes as Newton's first law of motion,
1098480	1103200	although he wasn't the first person to write it down by any means, and Galileo's principle,
1103200	1110960	that these two are in some sense two sides of the same coin because what Galileo says is you
1110960	1117200	can't tell the difference between steady motion and no motion. And so if you believe that if you
1117280	1120960	are stationary, you will remain stationary unless something does something to you,
1120960	1125200	then it must also be true that if you're in steady motion, you will remain in steady motion
1125200	1131360	until somebody does something to you. So they are very closely tied together, these notions.
1131360	1136160	Did either Galileo or Newton say those words that you just said, make that argument?
1137760	1142880	That's a great question. I don't know the history enough to know of a precise point at which either
1142960	1148240	one might have said that. It's something I should maybe look into. It's an interesting question.
1150000	1153760	Of course, the way we learn history is we learn the history of the great thinkers,
1153760	1160320	but there are always smaller personalities who have certain insights and write certain things
1160320	1166000	down. And so to trace that back and find out which one or which set of people first have
1166000	1171040	these insights would be a real challenge even for a historian of science since we're talking
1171040	1175200	several hundred years ago. But it's probably known to the experts in that field.
1175200	1181760	So we're already coming up across something even at this pretty easy to understand level of what
1181760	1187760	Galileo was talking about, but something that's nevertheless pretty non-intuitive. The idea that
1187760	1194240	there is no universal standard of rest. There is no way to just say, here is the speed of something
1194240	1198000	full stop. This is going to be something we got to continue to fight against all the way up through
1198240	1206160	modern physics, right? Absolutely. It's a fascinating thing that we teach physics to
1206160	1214160	college students. And this is almost the first thing we teach them. And in the classes where I
1214160	1219440	was taught and in the classes where I've been expected to teach, the idea is you teach Newton's
1219440	1224080	first law maybe in the first week or maybe in the second week, and then you move on without
1224880	1230000	grappling with the fact that this is a remarkably counterintuitive notion. We never
1230800	1237120	see this, experience this in ordinary life. Anything that we want to move, we typically
1237120	1243680	have to keep it moving. Cars need engines, planes need engines. We have to keep pushing,
1243680	1249040	walking tires us out. We can't just sort of glide down a highway without doing anything.
1249520	1257840	And that's because friction and other forms of drag are ubiquitous on the earth.
1258880	1267600	And so we grow up in an environment and we have an intuition that motion requires
1267600	1273520	activity. But it's only by understanding that motion does not require activity that we can
1273520	1278160	understand astronomy, that we can understand why the earth does what it does and the moon does what
1278160	1283600	it does. And so again, this is why astronomy was so counterintuitive. It took so many
1284480	1292080	hundreds, thousands of years to understand. So yes, this is a profoundly counterintuitive notion
1292560	1301200	and we don't fundamentally know why it should be true, why it has to be true. We just have
1301200	1306480	experimental evidence that makes it seem that it appears that it's true throughout the universe.
1306480	1311280	And yet, and this is in some sense where we get into the really interesting aspects of modern
1311280	1318640	physics, it almost broke down. It was on the verge of breaking down when people tried to understand
1318640	1328240	what light is. And we're going to get to that. Okay, good. Yeah, no, that's, it's always a back
1328240	1334320	and forth, right? Like one generation's precious principle that we can't violate is another one's
1334320	1340480	antiquated relic that we have to overcome. Absolutely. And speaking of which, a topic
1340480	1346160	that you go into great detail in the book, you've mentioned Newton's first law, then there's,
1346160	1349680	which says that we're going to go in straight lines if you don't act on us with a force,
1349680	1355520	but the second law, that's where Newton really made his money, right? That's f equals ma, that's
1355520	1361920	what made modern physics possible. And there's all three of those symbols, f and m and a,
1361920	1367280	are kind of interesting. But let's talk about m. What is that parameter that appears in Newton's
1367280	1375600	law? Was he the first to talk about that? Where did it come from? Well, in a way, it has a long
1375600	1384880	complex history like most concepts, but the original confusion about what we now call mass
1385120	1394400	is it's a conflation with the concept of weight. Yeah. And before Newton, people assumed these
1394400	1398960	two concepts were essentially the same, as far as I understand. And Newton was the first to
1398960	1405680	realize no, you have to separate them. And to talk about it in modern language, rather than try to
1405680	1411920	confuse ourselves with the way people used to think about it. Mass is a property that tells
1411920	1417680	you how hard it is to change an object's motion. Now, again, this is in contrast to that Higgs
1417680	1422640	metaphor and Margaret Thatcher that we started with, which suggests that mass is about how quickly
1422640	1428000	things slow down. It's quite the reverse. Things will continue in a straight line unless you do
1428000	1434080	something to them. And mass is how hard it is to change something's direction or slow something
1434080	1441440	down or speed it up. And so that is a that is a an aspect of an object which reflects
1442480	1447680	not its motion, but it's in some sense, it's stubbornness that prevents change in motion.
1448320	1455120	Now, what is weight? Weight is how heavy an object is literally how hard it is to hold an
1455120	1462160	object up against the pull of gravity. And on earth, these two things are completely connected
1462160	1470560	to each other. The more mass an object has, the more weight it has. But and so it was natural for
1470560	1473760	people living on earth and never having gone anywhere else and never really having thought
1473760	1479200	that hard about any place else to imagine these with the same thing. But Newton's key recognition
1479200	1489360	was this couldn't be true. If there was some way to understand the moon's motion in terms of gravity
1489360	1495600	or the planets in terms of gravity, it had to be that weight for something that's far enough away
1495600	1501600	would be smaller, even though its mass remained the same. So the moon has an enormous mass,
1502320	1507520	but its weight, that is to say, it's the degree to which it is pulled by the earth's gravity
1507520	1511440	is much smaller than you would imagine if you thought mass and weight were the same thing.
1512240	1518800	So and you know, we carry this conflation of mass and weight with us wherever we go.
1518800	1523200	That's why we're always interested in, you know, watching our weight and keeping our weight under
1523200	1527840	control. Whereas in fact, if you just wanted to lose weight, you could go to the moon. But I don't
1527840	1532880	think your body shape would change at all. So one should keep in mind that one really wants to lose
1532880	1538320	his mass. And I'm kind of surprised that physics teachers don't sort of teach this right at the
1538400	1544560	beginning of the section on gravity. But it seems an obvious point to make that we conflate these
1544560	1550560	two ideas. But to understand modern physics, even to understand Newtonian physics, you have to first
1550560	1556000	pull these ideas apart. And what's interesting about that is that you need to bring in gravity
1556000	1560720	into the discussion. And I think that, you know, from the Ask Me Anything questions I get for the
1560720	1567680	podcast, etc. I think that this is a very natural confusion that people have, like is mass somehow
1567680	1572560	intrinsically linked to the idea of gravity, or is it something separate? And the answer is implicit
1572560	1579040	in what you said, but let's make it explicit. Well, it's even, it is, but it's a little subtle too,
1579040	1585840	which is that when we get to Einstein, we're even going to have to keep track of the fact that what
1585840	1593200	you mean by mass is ambiguous if you're not careful. But at the time of Newton, the idea was that
1593840	1598800	mass has to do with motion, as we just described, has to do with preventing changes or getting in
1598800	1603680	the way of changes of motion. But it also, for some reason that Newton did not understand,
1603680	1609840	has to do with gravity in that the force between two objects involves the multiplying their two
1609840	1615840	masses together. And the more mass things have, the more gravity they inflict on other things.
1616800	1623360	What we know today is that the chain of logic, linking those different types of,
1623360	1630240	those different aspects of mass is more complicated. And that in fact, gravity comes from energy and
1630240	1638640	momentum, and not directly from what we would call rest mass, which is the type of mass that I've,
1638640	1644160	that affects motion in the simplest sense. And also, most importantly, it's the type of mass
1644160	1650320	called rest mass is what appears in Einstein's most famous formula, E equals mc squared, interpreted
1650320	1656960	as saying that the mass of an object that's at rest, that's stationary, has to do with the amount
1656960	1664480	of energy that's inside it. So what Einstein does, he says, well, look, mass, at least rest mass,
1664480	1671920	the mass of a stationary object comes from its energy. And separately, gravity is an effect
1671920	1678000	that comes from energy. So when you put those two things together in simple situations, you get
1678000	1684720	Newton's notion that gravity comes from mass, because gravity comes from energy and mass is a
1684720	1689120	form of energy. But when you pull them apart, you get the much more varied and much richer
1689760	1695920	notion of what gravity can do that you know better than I in the context of general relativity and
1695920	1702640	Einstein's theory of gravity. And speaking of, you know, Einstein's theory of gravity, he was
1702640	1707920	led to his insights in part because of the principle of equivalence, which people give
1707920	1713120	credit to Einstein for. But Newton noticed a version of the principle of equivalence, right?
1714800	1719600	Sure. In the sense that all objects already just from the start, all objects fall to the
1719600	1724400	earth at the same rate in a way, even Galileo knew this, and Newton in a way gave it an explanation.
1724960	1730320	Because he noted that the acceleration of an object is related to the force on it divided
1730320	1738480	by its mass. And in gravity, the force on it is proportional to its mass. And so in the acceleration,
1738480	1742800	the mass cancels out. There's a mass in the numerator, there's a mass in the denominator,
1742800	1750720	and so acceleration is the same for all objects falling on the earth. And so that means that if
1750720	1755200	I take a little paperclip and I take a heavy book and I drop them at the same time, they land at
1755200	1760240	the same time. And if you haven't ever seen this yourself, try it. It's amazing how many people
1760240	1764960	sort of know this, but have never actually tried to drop something really light and something really
1764960	1770080	heavy, making sure that that very light thing isn't affected by air resistance. And in that case,
1770080	1776000	you'll really see it's as though it looks like magic. And it is in a way a sort of magic because
1776080	1782960	it's what leads to Einstein's conception that gravity could be an aspect of the geometry of space
1782960	1789680	and time rather than some just generalized force. It has some very special properties.
1790160	1797840	Well, I think that's why Newton maybe didn't explain it as completely as Einstein did, right?
1797840	1803200	I mean, yes, Newton noticed that the parameter mass that appears in his second law and the
1803280	1808480	parameter mass that appears in the law of gravity are the same parameter. But why are they the same
1808480	1815360	parameter? It was a little bit unclear and that was kind of mysterious. I'm not sure that Einstein
1815360	1820000	does completely explain it. He accounts for it. It is a true fact in general relativity,
1820000	1824880	but if someone just sat back and said, did it have to be that way? I'm not even sure what the
1824880	1832240	right answer is. Well, that's a really good question because in a way, there is an explanation
1832240	1842880	that comes out of quantum field theory if you accept that gravity comes from a gravitational
1842880	1848320	field that is associated with what a particle physicist would call a particle of spin 2.
1849520	1856720	And what's interesting about that is in Einstein's theory, yes, there is an association of
1857520	1864640	gravity with a field with certain properties such that its particles have spin 2 and then
1864640	1871680	it does follow from mathematical consistency that you must be able to interpret space and time
1872720	1877040	in terms of interpret gravity in terms of the geometry of space and time.
1877040	1882800	But one thing that's often forgotten, although I'm again, people like you know this very well,
1882800	1887520	is that there was a competing theory of gravity at that time by a fellow named Nordstrom.
1888480	1895760	And in Nordstrom's theory, instead of spin 2, there was a spin zero object and it was a perfectly
1895760	1904960	good theory. But in retrospect, the mathematics would not have required it to have the properties
1904960	1912000	that Einstein wanted it to have. Whereas with the spin 2 field, you are sort of forced into it by
1912000	1916640	the math. That's not something Einstein knew at the time. That was something that was learned later.
1916640	1921200	So in a way, Einstein got lucky. He had some principles. They led to a particular theory.
1922560	1927520	It turns out that there weren't many options beyond the one he came up with that would be
1927520	1936400	mathematically consistent. But at the time, you know, like any good theorist, he had some
1936400	1941360	principles he was working with and it led him to an answer. But it wasn't obvious that it was
1941360	1947920	the correct answer. That depended on experiment. I think that the idea of thinking of gravity
1947920	1953600	is arising from a spin 2 particle is a really fun and important one. And we should talk about it
1953600	1959360	again. But we have to eat our vegetables a little bit first and work our way up. So let's just remind
1959360	1964560	ourselves what happened to the poor principle of relativity. I mean, Galileo put it out there.
1965360	1971520	Newton had a theory that embodied it. But then something happened with electricity and
1971520	1979600	magnetism and the world was never the same. Yes. In a way, we could certainly talk about
1979600	1984800	electricity and magnetism in their details. But in a way, the problem is even deeper,
1984800	1991840	which is the simple observation that light somehow makes it across the universe.
1991920	1999040	Light can travel a very long distance, and it doesn't lose its oomph. It clearly maintains its
1999040	2005040	color, its frequency as it goes. Somehow, you know, it has this property that somehow it can
2005040	2011040	travel through the universe itself. And if you think light is just a bunch of particles, as Newton
2011040	2019040	did, that might not be so surprising. If that if the universe is mostly empty, and you're sending
2019040	2022560	bullets through it, well, the bullets will just keep going according to Newton's first law,
2022560	2028160	nothing there to stop them or slow them down. But there was a debate for two centuries as to
2028160	2035520	whether light was a wave or made of particles. And then around 1800, there was definitive evidence
2035520	2041920	from interference effects that no, light is really a wave. And now we hit a puzzle,
2042880	2049760	a very serious puzzle. Because, you know, sound waves are waves in air, they don't go through
2049760	2056160	the universe. Why not? Because there's no air there. A sound wave is a vibration of the air.
2056160	2060400	If there's no air, there's no sound waves. Same idea if you go to the beach, right,
2060400	2064880	the ocean waves come to the beach, and they stop, they don't keep going because there's no war.
2065760	2071520	So if light waves can go through the universe, there must be something out there. There must
2071520	2078080	be a thing that you would naturally think that is vibrating that in which the waves are a vibration.
2078080	2083280	So what is this thing? And why doesn't it slow the earth down?
2085840	2090000	So we hit a puzzle. Don't keep us hanging here, Matt. Tell us what the answer is.
2091920	2098240	Well, I mean, at a certain level, we don't entirely know the answer. What Einstein did was
2098240	2107440	point out that, well, let me back up one step. The point that seems obvious is even if you're
2107440	2115120	confused about what this stuff is, you should be able to measure whether you're moving through it or
2115120	2121760	not. For example, if you're in a boat, you can easily tell if you're moving through the water
2121760	2127760	or not. If you turn off your engine, if you're moving through the water, you will very quickly
2127840	2133840	slow down. And although Galileo says you can't measure whether you're moving in a steady motion,
2133840	2143200	if you're slowing down, you certainly feel that. So same thing for a plane that's flying through
2143200	2147680	the air. If it were stationary, it would be doing one thing. And if it's flying through the air without
2147680	2152480	an engine, it's going to slow down and so forth. So you can tell whether you are in motion and
2152480	2156960	how you are in motion with respect to ordinary substances. So the basic idea was we ought to
2156960	2162000	be able to tell if we're moving through this magical substance, which was called the luminiferous
2162000	2166720	ether name, which has got lovely resonances to it. It's a great name compared to a lot of other
2166720	2170800	dumb names physicists came up with. It's such a shame. It's too bad it doesn't exist. I know.
2170800	2176000	Or maybe it is. We'll come back to that. But in any case, the idea was, all right,
2176000	2181120	there should be some measurement we can make that can tell us something about this substance
2181200	2188960	in which light is a wave. And in the 1880s, the right technology came along. And that was invented
2188960	2198400	by Albert Michelson, who along with Edmund Morley, built a machine, a device, that could very
2199680	2205840	accurately measure the speed of light in different directions. And if you think about it, if you're
2205840	2210480	moving through the water and you're looking at ocean waves, ocean waves that are going in the
2210480	2216240	same direction that you're going will seem relative to your boat to move more slowly than ocean waves
2216240	2223040	going the other direction. And so it was a similar idea that Michelson had in mind that you should
2223040	2227440	be able to tell that light moves at different speeds relative to this medium, depending on how
2227440	2230960	fast the earth is going through the medium. And of course, the earth goes in different directions
2230960	2235280	every, you know, as it goes around the sun. So if you measure this a few times a year, you measure
2235280	2239360	this in different directions, you should be able to tell a difference. And famously, Michelson and
2239360	2244160	Morley saw no difference at all. Speed of light seemed to be the same from all directions at all
2244160	2250000	times. And that seems to be in contradiction with the idea that there's a substance in which light
2250000	2260000	is a wave. Now, this is where we come back to Galileo, because if it had been true that Michelson's
2260000	2266080	experiment had worked, if it were possible to tell how fast the earth were moving through this
2266160	2272480	luminiferous ether, then it would not be true that all types of steady motion are the same.
2272480	2279360	There would be experiments that you could do even in a closed room, even under the deck of a ship,
2279360	2284320	as Galileo suggested, there would be experiments you could do. You could do Michelson's experiment
2284320	2290640	and tell how fast you are moving through the ether. But since the ether apparently is everywhere in
2290640	2296000	space after where, after all, light goes through the universe from all directions and from many
2296000	2301520	places, then you would conclude that Galileo's idea, although it might apply to some things,
2301520	2310080	is not fundamentally correct. And so Michelson's experiment, had it shown a difference in the
2310080	2314240	speeds of light from different directions, would have been the death knell for Galileo's
2314240	2322160	relativity. So now came a brief period of 25 years where people tried to explain what does
2322160	2327120	Michelson's experiment mean? Why can't we detect this thing? And there were various ideas which
2327120	2332320	we don't have to go into, but all of them would still have violated Galileo's relativity.
2333760	2342880	And then Einstein pointed out, as a 26-year-old student, that actually if you insist that Galileo's
2342880	2348960	relativity is correct, and you relinquish your notions of space and time as you always thought
2348960	2357120	they worked, you can write down math that can both explain why light travels as a wave,
2358320	2364560	particular a wave of the electromagnetic fields, and yet can travel from your perspective at the
2364560	2370160	same speed from all directions independently of how you are moving or the object that's
2370160	2377920	emitting the light is moving. And that was an extraordinary thing to point out. That's obviously
2377920	2386800	one of the great ideas in scientific history, because it showed that the only way to reconcile
2386800	2392400	light's amazing ability to travel the universe is to give up your notions of how space and time work.
2392560	2396000	It seems like a big ask, but it paid off.
2396960	2403520	It's a huge ask, and needless to say, people were curious, interested, but very skeptical.
2404400	2408400	But in the end, it doesn't matter what people think. It matters what experiment says.
2409280	2412640	Experiments said these ideas are correct.
2412640	2419120	You make the case very nicely that Einstein's insight here really wasn't the word
2419120	2425120	relativity in any sense at all. Relativity was already there, and then there was this
2425120	2429440	experimental idea that the speed of light was constant to everyone. He figured out how to
2429440	2435600	reconcile those two amazing facts that sound innocuous together, but have tension between them.
2436720	2441040	Yeah, that's right. Einstein's theory of relativity is not the invention of the idea of
2441040	2447040	relativity. It is a revision of the idea of relativity as Galileo had it, because Galileo
2447040	2451920	didn't worry about time. Galileo just worried about how things move, but he assumed time is just
2451920	2459520	time. And Einstein is now already, even before general relativity, starting to make us wonder
2460640	2465200	how we should think about time and what it means if everybody who's moving around has a different
2465200	2472000	clock than the notion of simultaneity and the notion of synchronized clocks. It's all starting
2472000	2476480	to come at risk. And general relativity tears it all apart.
2476480	2483840	Well, I got a question recently. Why don't people consider special relativity as one of the great
2483840	2489360	triumphs of unification of physics, because it unified space and time together? And my result,
2489360	2493840	my answer was, like, what do you mean? I always talk about it that way. That's exactly what it was.
2494400	2499920	And many other unifications came with it. This is where we can now finally talk about
2499920	2503760	E equals mc squared and how mass and energy are related to each other.
2504640	2511040	Even in some sense, the unification of electricity and magnetism, which I think fairly can be
2511040	2518480	attributed to Maxwell, there is a way in which that unification becomes not only true but necessary
2519120	2524160	once you have Einstein's understanding of how it works. You simply can't talk about one without
2524160	2529200	the other, because what is electric from one person's point of view can be part electric,
2529200	2532960	part magnetic from another person's point of view. And that's deeply integrated into the
2532960	2539200	math of the theory. And we're left with a picture where, I mean, eventually Einstein
2539200	2545120	events general relativity, we don't need to go into great details about that. But it leaves
2545120	2550320	us hanging a little bit with this issue of whether space or space time, if you want,
2550880	2557120	is a medium by itself, right? It's not the ether, we can't measure our velocity with respect to it,
2557120	2562320	but it's something, it has a geometry, et cetera. How are we supposed to think about space and
2562320	2567120	space time? Well, I think that remains one of the great questions of modern physics today,
2568080	2572640	in the sense that as you just to say what you said, but in a slightly different way,
2574240	2581440	there is a fundamental tension that still remains conceptually. It's not a tension in
2581440	2588240	the mathematics, but it's tension in how we think about it, in that we know today that,
2588240	2595680	thanks to Einstein, that space and time somehow thought of together, they're kind of like a
2595680	2600960	fabric in that they can stretch in the expanding universe, that's what's happening, they can warp,
2600960	2605440	that's what gives us gravity, they can ripple, that's what gives us gravitational waves,
2606160	2612320	which are the subject of a Nobel Prize just in the last few years. And yet,
2614160	2621200	this fact that we can't measure this substance, whatever it is, we can't measure whether we're
2621200	2626240	moving through it or not, because that would violate Galileo's principle. So to say it again,
2626240	2631680	space is sort of a thing, it does stuff, but we are not able to measure whether we are moving
2631680	2637520	through it. And more generally, we're not able to measure its presence, or we can see some of the
2637520	2642800	things it does, and yet we can't see kind of what it is, we can't grab hold of it or bottle it,
2642800	2647520	it's not like a substance the way water is a substance, or like any other substance we're
2647520	2655360	used to. And so this conflict between a substance-like thing, which acts like it's there, and this
2655360	2660320	thing which sometimes acts like it's nothingness, that fundamental conflict is a deep conceptual
2660320	2668480	conflict for our brains, the math is okay with it, but it's such a deep problem that it might even
2668480	2677120	make you wonder whether space is real. Good. Go ahead. And so, and physicists do really wonder
2677120	2681280	about this. I mean, this is an active area of research, there are various reasons for that,
2681280	2688160	which are kind of another discussion. But certainly, we live in a universe whose basic
2688160	2693040	fundamental properties are very strange. Strange enough that we should certainly worry
2693600	2699360	that maybe there's another level of understanding behind them that we have yet to encounter.
2699360	2703840	I'm really glad that you put it that way, because it's very honest. You weren't trying to claim more
2703840	2710560	certainty than we have, which some people will sometimes try to do. And also, I personally,
2710560	2715920	at the research level, am increasingly sympathetic to notions where
2717520	2723040	this lack of a rest frame, what we call Lorentz invariance in the technical lingo,
2723040	2728960	is only an approximation. That in fact, it comes out in the wash at long wavelengths, low energies,
2728960	2734000	things like that, like many other things do, but maybe it's actually not a fundamental feature
2734000	2738560	of the universe. I'm not wedded to that idea, but I think it's absolutely on the table as a
2738560	2741920	possibility and a very exciting one, both theoretically and experimentally.
2746000	2750480	I've written this book as though we're sure about Galileo's principle of relativity. But of
2750480	2755520	course, there are no principles about which we are sure. They're always subject to experimental
2756240	2762400	verification at more and more precise levels as our technology improves. And it's always possible
2762400	2770640	that something we have held as almost certainly true for hundreds of years may fall apart at some
2770640	2775680	point, just as Newton's law of gravity did after more than 200 years. So we have to be humble about
2775680	2783200	what we do and don't understand. But there is also the possibility that even the notion of space
2783760	2790800	is an approximation to something far stranger. And those people who think about quantum of gravity
2792480	2799280	along certain modern lines face that because we have found equations that not necessarily the
2799280	2806000	equations that describe our universe, but we have found equations in which space is an epiphenomenon,
2806000	2812560	an emergent concept. And the basic thing you start with is just a very large collection of
2812560	2819760	objects that don't have any notion of space at all. So we know there's a lot we don't know,
2819760	2826160	and any particular way of looking at the world that we have now has to be viewed as a
2826160	2830560	progress report, a very successful progress report at the moment, but one which has plenty of holes
2830560	2837200	in it that could turn out to be quite large in the end. Good. But this question of the realness
2837200	2842800	of space, the thinginess of space, I don't know if you know, do you know about the Clark Leibniz
2842800	2847680	correspondence? Have you heard these words before? Yes. You and I have spoken about this,
2847680	2851520	and I recall it. Clark, you read about that in my book because you are a reader. Leibniz and
2851520	2856320	Newton arguing for Clark, yes. Is space relational or a substantive title? Is it a thing or is it
2856320	2862080	just a collection of relations? And we still don't know. Like in Einstein's world, it was a substance,
2862080	2867760	but maybe we're post-Einstein now. But another fact to keep in the back of our minds when we're
2867760	2875200	contemplating that question is that space isn't really empty or it's not featureless anyway,
2875200	2880960	because it's filled with all of these fields like the electromagnetic field. So you do a great
2880960	2885520	job in your book talking about what a field is, the idea of the fundamentality of fields,
2885520	2889440	which is very bizarre to people. They always want to know what the fields are made of,
2889440	2893120	and I gotta say, no, no, no. The things are made of fields, not the other way around.
2896480	2902320	Part of the problem with talking about fields and what they are is that fundamentally we don't
2902320	2908000	know. It's always harder to explain something you don't really understand. We understand what
2908000	2914080	fields do with remarkable precision in many cases. We have math that describes what they
2914080	2918640	will do in all sorts of circumstances we can predict, all sorts of wonderful details,
2918640	2922640	but just because you can predict what something does doesn't mean you really understand fundamentally
2922640	2930320	what it is. An analogy I like to use that I think is reflective of the right way to think about
2930320	2936960	fields is that if you think about the atmosphere, just think about the air of the earth. It has all
2936960	2944560	sorts of features that you can measure. It has pressure, it has temperature, it has wind, wind
2944560	2950000	meaning how fast it's flowing in a particular location, and these things, pressure, temperature,
2950000	2954240	wind, humidity, these are properties of the air that you can measure anywhere. There's some machine
2954240	2961600	you can use for measuring the wind speed and direction, etc. But imagine that you didn't
2961600	2967600	know what air was, and all you had was these measuring devices. You could measure this thing
2967600	2971840	which you call pressure, but you don't have the conception that it is literally the pressure of
2971840	2976560	a gas. You just call it P, and you measure this thing called T, it's temperature, but you don't
2976560	2981760	know that, and something called W which is wind, but you don't know that. You have these things
2981760	2986720	you can measure, and you can figure out equations which describe how they work,
2987360	2992240	and you can even predict the weather if you're clever enough to figure out the right equations,
2992240	2996240	because the equations stand on their own. They tell you how these things you can measure change
2996240	3004640	over time and how they relate to each other, but if you don't know what air is, or even
3004640	3010000	necessarily that it exists, then you don't know what pressure, how to think about pressure. You
3010000	3015840	don't know what property of air it's referring to, and since you don't even know what air is,
3015840	3022080	you can't even sort of talk about what property it might be. And this may be our situation with
3022080	3026560	the fields of the universe, where the vast majority of the fields, with one interesting
3026560	3031760	exception that I'll come back to, they seem to be properties of the universe the way pressure
3031760	3038000	is a property of air. That might be the right way to think about them, but we have no idea which
3038000	3042240	properties, and we have no idea what the substance of the universe is, and the one interesting
3042240	3047600	exception is gravity, which is ironic, because in many ways gravity is the one we understand the
3047600	3055040	least from the point of view of quantum physics, but in the case of gravity, the gravitational field
3055040	3061440	is telling you about the property of space, which we call curvature, the degree to which it's worked.
3062000	3071840	So it is possible that the electromagnetic field is telling us some property of space and time
3071840	3078560	that is not obvious, some sort of hidden property that we have yet to learn. In string theory,
3078560	3085120	for example, that's a common situation, not to say anything pro or con against string theory,
3085120	3092480	but it is an example of a context in which the luminiferous ether does exist, it's a part of
3092480	3102480	spacetime, and so it may be that this notion that space and time are a substance that has many
3102480	3107680	properties and those properties are the fields of nature, that may be a perspective which
3107680	3112880	is at least useful and maybe even somewhat fundamental, but we still have to deal with
3112880	3116160	the fact that space is very strange because you can't measure your motion with respect to it,
3116160	3119200	so if it's like a material, it's not like anything we've ever seen.
3119840	3125520	I just want to be sure, because the audience has different levels of understanding here,
3125520	3131040	if we put aside for the moment our desires to be super duper careful and clear and correct,
3131760	3132560	what is a field?
3133360	3142320	A field is something that is found, well, let me back up one step. A cosmic field,
3142320	3146960	the field of the cosmos, is something that can be measured anywhere in the universe.
3148320	3154960	It's some sort of property which has the feature that if you change it in one place,
3155920	3162400	it has effects in other places in the future. In some sense, that's the most important
3162960	3167520	aspect of what a field is. It's something which is everywhere, and it's not just
3167520	3173200	randomly everywhere, it has this feature that it's somehow what you do at point A
3173200	3180560	affects later what happens at point B and vice versa. So in the context of air as an analogy,
3180560	3188000	the fields of air are found everywhere in the air, and if you change the wind in one place,
3188000	3191440	it's going to cause the wind to change somewhere else, and in fact, that's what weather prediction
3191440	3197120	is all about. It's about saying, okay, I know what the fields of air are today. I know what the
3197120	3203200	pressure and the temperature and the wind are right now. Can I predict in the future what they
3203200	3210080	will be? And the fact that the future depends in such detail on the past, and not just on the past
3210080	3216320	at my current location, but on the past at all locations nearby, and the further back in time
3216320	3222720	I go for my predictions, the more of these fields I need to know and further, further distances,
3222720	3226080	this is what's characteristic of a field. So if you think about weather prediction
3226080	3231840	and about the properties of the air and how they affect each other, and now you extend that to
3231840	3237280	properties of the universe, now you're thinking about fields, I think, in a sensible way.
3237280	3243840	Okay, that's very good. And if we were to add quantum mechanics to the mix, there's this wonderful
3243840	3249280	fact that, and we don't need to talk about many worlds or measurement problem, that's okay,
3249280	3253920	that's a different podcast, but we should talk about the fact that when you quantize a field,
3253920	3258640	when you take fields and put them into your quantum mechanical brain, out pop particles.
3258640	3261760	I don't know if you want to just take that for granted right now, or do you have a favorite
3261760	3268480	way of thinking about that remarkable fact? Well, I think it's useful maybe to step back a moment.
3268480	3275360	Obviously, the purpose of, I should say something about the reason why the book that I've just
3275360	3281600	written is called Waves in an Impossible Sea. We've just been talking about the sea, that's the
3281600	3285120	universe, and we've been talking about why it's impossible because it has these very strange
3285840	3290640	features that it both seems to be there and seems not to be there, depending on what question you
3290640	3299680	ask. But then there are the waves, and the reason to talk about waves is that fundamentally,
3300400	3306960	the things we call elementary particles, electrons, quarks, photons, they are
3308800	3314640	in the language of quantum field theory more wave-like than particle-like. And
3315920	3320240	to understand what that means requires dealing with the fact that there's a history
3320240	3326080	to the notion that electrons are both particles and waves. That's a trope that comes out of the
3326080	3332960	1920s and 30s, but it's one that got modified over the decades and in ways that aren't always
3333600	3341520	made explicit. It's a mess. And the word particle and the word field are again misleading in how
3341520	3350160	we use them compared to how they're used in daily English. And so one has to really take a moment
3350160	3359680	to just parcel that. So with that preamble, let me please start. So when we talk about particle
3359680	3366080	in ordinary English, we always mean something like a grain of sand or a dust particle. Something
3366080	3372720	that's like a little ball, maybe irregular shaped, but it's this little thing that moves
3372720	3379760	around on some path. And when people first discovered electrons, that's what they thought
3379760	3384080	they were. So they called them particles. And when it turned out that's not what they were,
3384080	3392000	they still called them particles. So we often face this problem in science and science communication
3392000	3400160	that things are named before they are understood. And very rarely are they renamed
3401040	3407120	once it becomes clear what's actually going on. Very true. That's a problem. So there's that
3407120	3410400	problem. We have to first take the word particle and understand that we're not going to use it the
3410400	3418640	way our English conception of particle is used in ordinary language. And then wave is a problem too.
3419520	3426400	When we say light is a wave, we do not mean that light is like a wave breaking at the beach.
3427440	3432640	At the beach, we mean here comes a big wave. What we mean is here is a high point in the water
3433200	3438320	separated from the next high point by a low point behind it and a low point in front of it.
3439440	3445840	Whereas when we talk about sound waves coming from a musical instrument or from somebody's voice,
3445840	3452080	or we talk about light waves coming from a light bulb, we're talking about a long sequence of high
3452080	3458240	and low points, a long sequence of wave crests and wave troughs, which we often call in ordinary
3458240	3463440	English, if we were at the beach, we would call it a wave set or a series of waves. So what we mean
3463440	3470640	by wave singular in physics may have many crests and troughs, which is not the way we would talk
3470640	3476880	about things at the beach. So that's important because when we say light is made from particles,
3477760	3482960	don't want you to think about the individual particles as being individual crests in a
3482960	3494240	wave train. That's the wrong picture. Okay, I won't. So now how do we understand that we are made
3494240	3500960	from waves? This is a very strange thing. Again, it's such a strange thing that it took people
3500960	3506480	a long time to make sense of it because we from ordinary life have a lot of intuition about waves
3507360	3513600	and we have all seen houses made of bricks and made from stones and made from concrete,
3513600	3518960	but you have never seen a house made from sound waves, you've never seen a house made from earthquake
3518960	3526240	waves. Waves are not things that we think of as objects from which you can make structured
3526240	3536080	objects that will stay together and stay organized for centuries. And so the idea that we and the
3536080	3542000	walls and the table and so forth are made from waves requires already some sort of conceptual
3542000	3549760	leap. And the conceptual leap is that, and again it's due to Einstein, although not in a single step,
3550640	3556720	is that even the waves of light, which are definitely waves in the sense that they are
3558000	3562480	there are crests and troughs, these things have a frequency and a wavelength just like
3562480	3570960	sound waves do, nevertheless, they are made from, well, we call them particles, let's not call them
3570960	3576000	particles, let's just say they're made from things, we'll call them photons, and now let's figure out
3576000	3583600	what they are. And so the way I like to talk about this that I think is useful is that we have many
3583600	3590720	examples of objects that we know are kind of granular or particulate, but not in the sense
3590720	3595520	that they're made from particles per se. So yes, if you go to a beach, it looks continuous, but if
3595520	3599440	you look closely, there's all sorts of sand grains that make it up. In that case, the objects are
3599440	3607120	really particles of sand. But if you take a giant pile of spaghetti, dried spaghetti before you cook
3607120	3611680	it, well, if you look at it from far enough away, it just looks like a giant pile, but if you go in
3611680	3616400	there and dig around, you realize there's lots of individual strands of spaghetti there, or if you
3616400	3621120	take a giant stack of paper, you've never seen one before, it may not be obvious to you whether
3621120	3626160	it's continuous or discrete, whether it's what it's made of, but if you start taking it apart,
3626160	3633440	you will very quickly realize it's made from sheets of paper. And so when we look at a laser beam,
3634960	3639760	it is not obvious to us that it isn't a continuous thing. And then in fact, it's made
3640320	3647440	from individual strands, in a sense. The way a rope is made from individual strands of twine,
3649440	3654080	it's not that it's made literally from particle-like objects, but it can be disassembled
3654720	3660800	into individual pieces. And those pieces of a light wave, again, they're not individual crests
3660800	3668400	and troughs. Each one of them is a series of crests and troughs. And we call those things photons.
3669920	3677120	So photons are waves, but they are particulate. They cannot be divided into smaller pieces.
3678000	3684000	And they are the things out of which more dramatic waves, like those in a laser beam,
3684000	3689520	are constructed. And this is far from obvious, just as it would not be obvious to a person
3689520	3693280	seeing a rope for the first time, that you could disassemble the rope into individual strands.
3694080	3702080	And that's why people before the 20th century didn't have,
3702960	3707840	it wasn't obvious to people before the 20th century that this was true. You needed the technology
3707840	3711200	and you also needed the right set of experiments to give you a clue that this is something that
3711200	3717520	might be the case. And this is a specifically quantum mechanical aspect of light. Maxwell's
3717520	3722480	equations did a perfectly good job of talking about light waves in a classical way. And this
3722480	3726240	photon language only becomes relevant once quantum mechanics comes on the scene.
3726960	3732640	In a way, you can say it's the definition of the first aspect of quantum physics.
3732640	3739200	The statement that light is made from photons is a more general statement that there are large
3739200	3743840	classes of waves in our universe, and in particular, all of the waves of the elementary
3743840	3749520	fields of the universe are made from these individual pieces, which are called, generally,
3749520	3753600	quanta. That's where the word quantum initially comes from historically,
3753600	3758640	is Einstein trying to suggest that light is made from these individual strands or packets,
3758640	3766640	or whatever you want to call them. And it was only 15 to 20 years later that people gave these
3766640	3772640	bits of light the name photon. And even five years after that, that they realized that there
3772640	3779920	was an analogy between photons and electrons, that electrons were not actually these dot-like
3779920	3784960	particles, the ones we draw in the cartoon of atoms, but they're more like photons. They have
3784960	3791920	wave-like properties. They are particulate waves rather than being particles in the English sense.
3792640	3799120	And so this is really the language of quantum field theory that comes out of the 1950s.
3800240	3806000	And it's different from the language of the quantum mechanics physicists of the 1920s and 30s,
3806000	3810800	whose famous statements such as an electron is both a wave and a particle, or sometimes it's a
3810800	3815600	wave, and sometimes it's a particle. That's a language which Niels Bohr popularized,
3816480	3824880	but it was left in historical dust as far as the math. And yet, it maintained a life of its own
3824880	3831040	in the culture. So most people who teach quantum physics still use this language
3832000	3838080	when they teach quantum mechanics to juniors in college. And it certainly has survived in most of
3838080	3845520	the popular science books. So that causes a lot of confusion. And that's one of the reasons why
3845520	3852640	in my book I spent a whole chapter trying to make this really clear, that we don't think about an
3852640	3858720	electron as a dot. And in fact, you can't understand its most critical properties, such as the fact
3858800	3866560	that it has mass, if you think of it as a dot. Because if it's really a dot, and it's really
3866560	3871840	true that E equals mc squared, and therefore the mass of the electron has something to do with the
3871840	3878400	energy that it carries with it, when it's stationary, well, why would a stationary dot have energy,
3879280	3884960	especially if it's really a point-like object in some sense? Where would that energy be?
3885440	3891520	But when you understand that an electron, even an electron that is stationary, is a wave-like
3891520	3898080	object, and like the wave on a guitar string, it is vibrating and is sitting in place. It's not
3898080	3903840	going anywhere. But nevertheless, there is vibration associated with it. Then you understand, ah,
3904480	3911280	there's energy associated with the vibration. And that's where the mass comes from. And if you
3912240	3917040	thought of an electron as a dot just sitting there, instead of thinking of it as a wave that's
3917040	3922560	vibrating, you have no way into this idea. And that's why it's so important that in quantum field
3922560	3927680	theory, we do not think about electrons as dots. And we do have an understanding of what their mass
3927680	3933520	is associated with. Not to mention the fact that, at least at face value, a dot-like electron would
3933520	3938960	collapse to be a black hole. Well, there is that problem too, but you know,
3940960	3948320	I think it's useful to understand that this particular problem is independent of gravity.
3949520	3954240	And would be there even in the absence of gravity. So while it's certainly true that point-like
3954240	3959280	objects without some sort of wave-like structure have all sorts of conceptual issues associated
3959280	3965120	with them, there's an independent sort of conceptual problem, which is that if you carry
3965120	3970000	this notion of a dot-like electron with you too far, even if you take Bohr seriously, that some
3970000	3973920	of the time it's like a particle and some of the time it's like a wave, you've lost the fact that
3974640	3980880	its wave-like property, the fact that it's a vibrating object, is essential in its existence.
3980880	3989280	And its basic properties, such as its mass, simply are not explicable if you somehow try
3989280	3994800	to make that point-like object work in your head. It doesn't work. And we see this in these
3994800	3998560	fundamental properties of electrons and all the other elementary particles too.
3999760	4005040	For the listeners who have followed us this far into the podcast, we're allowed to get a little
4005040	4012400	more technical and wild here. So I'm going to fearlessly ask you about the difference between
4012400	4020880	electron fields and photon fields. We have our fermions and our bosons, and they're fundamentally
4020880	4026720	different kinds of fields, and that contributes to why, conceptually, we tend to think of
4027360	4031280	matter and light as two different kinds of things.
4032160	4038720	Right. And of course, you and I have, well, the word matter is another one of those words that
4038720	4040720	is really problematic. So let's be a little clearer.
4040720	4043440	I'm just throwing it out just so because I know you'll get a rise out of here.
4043440	4050480	Yeah. You went there, the target was right on. But let's just talk about atoms and light.
4051440	4061760	And there is this, as you said, this remarkable feature of our world that is not to be taken
4061760	4067840	for granted. You have to work out in mathematics of quantum fields to show that there's only two
4067840	4073600	types of fields. Or rather, you can divide all of the fields that could possibly be part of our
4073600	4080240	cosmos into two classes. One of those classes is called bosonic fields. The other class is called
4080240	4090400	fermionic fields. The particles, that is to say, the waves that are the minimal waves that you
4090400	4096000	can have in the electromagnetic field that we call photons, they are bosons. Then there is an
4096000	4100080	electron field, not to be confused with the electric field. There is an electron field,
4100080	4109120	that is fermionic, and it's minimal waves of what we call electrons. And all of the different
4109120	4114160	elementary particles of nature can be understood. Each one is a wave of a particular field, and
4114160	4118640	each field has to be either bosonic or fermionic, and each particle has to either be a boson or
4118640	4125440	fermion. Now, what's the key difference? The key difference, we already learned some of it in
4126720	4132960	undergraduate chemistry. Electrons cannot do the same thing at the same time. No two electrons can
4132960	4139200	do identical things. This is known as the Pauli exclusion principle, and it was discovered as
4139200	4146800	people tried to understand the properties of atoms back in the 1920s. And the whole structure of atoms
4146800	4153040	would be completely different if electrons were bosons, because bosons don't have an exclusion
4153040	4158240	principle. In fact, they are perfectly happy to do exactly the same thing, and that's why lasers can
4158320	4165520	be made out of photons. So you couldn't make atoms like ours if electrons were bosons instead of
4165520	4173200	fermions, and you couldn't make lasers out of light if light was made from fermions. So these are
4173200	4180240	very obvious differences, but the degree to which they affect our macroscopic experience
4180960	4187200	is a little less obvious. And so one of the remarkable things is that if electrons were
4187200	4195680	bosons, not only would atomic structure be very different, but if you tried now to pile a large
4195680	4203360	number of atoms together, instead of forming crystals or blocky structures that you could make
4203360	4207840	tables and microphones and people out of, they would just sort of collapse in on themselves.
4208320	4218240	And so the very basics of the macroscopic world depend on the fact that electrons are fermions,
4218240	4223280	but they also depend on something else, because the powerly exclusion principle would not apply
4224080	4234800	if electrons weren't literally identical. And why are electrons literally identical? Well,
4234880	4241200	that is one of the key predictions of quantum field theory. If electrons were just dots,
4241760	4249040	we would have no idea why they are identical, but they are waves in a field, and it's the same field,
4249760	4256000	right? There's just one electron field, and the minimal wave in an electron field is an electron,
4256000	4259120	and it doesn't matter where you make it, it doesn't matter when you make it, it doesn't matter how
4259120	4264720	long it's been around for, it remains a minimal wave of the electron field, and so any two electrons
4264720	4269360	they're the same type of thing, they are literally identical, and because of that the
4269360	4274000	powerly exclusion principle can apply to them, and because of that our world can have macroscopic
4274000	4280560	objects in it that don't collapse. And it's really important and fascinating to me in the context
4280560	4285840	of quantum field theory that you have your electrons, you have your electromagnetic field,
4285840	4292800	but there's not an infinite variety of possible kinds of fields, right? There's a kind of a tiny
4292800	4299600	handful, and essentially almost all the ones that we think are possible are there between gravity
4299600	4305840	and Higgs, and electromagnetism, and other forest fields, and electrons and so forth. Like,
4305840	4313120	it's a really limited set to draw from. Well, this is an interesting feature of the
4315280	4321360	discoveries that physicists on the theoretical side and mathematical physicists have made about
4322240	4330880	how quantum field theory can work. When you go into a subject which has some mathematical content,
4332000	4339280	like physics, you could wonder whether the world that you see is just one example of
4339920	4344960	possible worlds, maybe there's an enormous number and you're living in just one for some reason,
4344960	4349120	or you can imagine maybe there's only one possible world that's consistent with quantum field theory,
4349840	4354240	or with quantum field theory and gravity together, and we live in it because there's
4354240	4359920	simply no other type of world that you could have. And the reality turns out to be somewhere
4359920	4368000	in between. It's remarkable how many mathematical constraints there are. When you try to combine
4368000	4377200	quantum physics and special relativity, that is, say, pre-gravity, and then when you try to combine
4377200	4382480	it with gravity as well, you find that the mathematics is somewhat rigid. You can't do
4382480	4388160	anything you want. You can only do a relatively limited set of things. It's still a very big set,
4388160	4394960	but it's a lot smaller than you might have thought. And on your point that there's a limited set of
4394960	4400960	types of fields, that's true with a caveat, which is that this assumes that the fields have
4401920	4408880	particles either whose mass is zero or their mass has come from a limited set of possibilities.
4408880	4417680	Once you allow for particles that get and get their mass any old way, you have a wider set
4417680	4423520	of possibilities. But experimentally, we find that all of the particles that we know of so far,
4423520	4432480	with one exception, their particles either don't have any mass like the photon, or if they do have
4432480	4438960	mass like the electron, they get it in a very special way. And that's from this strange substance
4438960	4443840	called the Higgs field that we started our discussion with. So it is true that once you know
4443840	4448480	experimentally that there are some limits to the types of fields we find in nature, then you find
4448480	4454480	that the possibilities are very limited indeed. And so it's some mix of theory and experiment
4454480	4458880	that tell us that we're in this strangely or maybe not strangely limited situation.
4459600	4466720	Well, let's close the circle here by getting the Higgs boson right, because I think that
4466720	4471760	as we discussed with people with the best of intentions, physicists try to explain things,
4471760	4477840	and they smooth over some rough edges, and they say the Higgs field is responsible for mass.
4478880	4484560	And I get very well intentioned members of the general public saying, well, mass creates gravity.
4484560	4488640	So without gravity, would there be no Higgs field or is the Higgs responsible for gravity or
4488640	4493600	something like that? Hopefully, everyone who's been following along with what you've said so far
4493600	4498080	knows why that's not right. But let's help them out a little bit. Well, indeed, it's a natural
4498080	4504320	confusion to have if you think that the Higgs field is responsible for mass. But that is not
4504320	4511520	correct. In fact, the Higgs field is not responsible for most of your mass. Because protons and
4511520	4517520	neutrons, which are the majority of the mass in an atom, do not get their mass from the Higgs field.
4518080	4521760	So we can dispense with that idea. The Higgs field is responsible for the mass of certain
4521760	4526640	elementary particles, but it's not responsible for the mass of protons and neutrons. And the story
4526640	4530640	of where they get their mass from, okay, I'm afraid that we'll have to leave that for the book.
4530640	4536240	But we don't have time for that right now. But now there's the question, okay, so electrons
4536240	4540800	do get their mass from the Higgs field. So do up quarks and down quarks. And so most of the
4540800	4544880	elementary particles that we're made from do get their masses from the Higgs field,
4544880	4549680	even if the more complicated objects, the protons and neutrons and therefore the atoms do not.
4551280	4555280	So simply because of that, it's clear that the Higgs field and gravity
4555280	4559200	can't be directly linked because protons and neutrons have lots of gravity, but they're not
4559200	4564320	really getting much mass from the Higgs field. So, and there are other reasons which we could
4564320	4571280	discuss, but let's leave that aside for now. So they're independent ideas. And now the question
4571280	4576480	comes, well, all right, so we started with this Margaret Thatcher in a room analogy,
4576480	4581440	where the Higgs field is like a crowd that slows people down as they try to move through it. And
4581440	4587680	the more well known they are, the harder they have. Okay, well, what's, what's wrong with that
4588480	4593280	is partly that it is in conflict with the principle of relativity, and that's pretty bad.
4593840	4600480	But in a way, the broader way in which it's wrong is that it suggests that the Higgs field has to do
4601200	4606960	with motion, and that it affects the properties of the motion of objects directly.
4608160	4614400	But that's not how it works. And we have to go back a moment and remember that what are, you know,
4614400	4621760	what electrons are electrons are waves in the electron field. And the Higgs field does not,
4621760	4627760	in some direct sense, give mass to electrons, it does not provide the energy
4629440	4637600	that an electron carries that gives it mass. What it actually does is it changes the properties
4637680	4645600	of the electron field. The Higgs field affects other fields. That's the real direct connection.
4647120	4656240	And the way in which it affects the electron field changes the way that the electron field vibrates.
4658400	4662640	And since electrons are vibrations in the electron field, that changes the properties
4662640	4672560	of electrons. So it's that more indirect route that is the way that the Higgs field does its thing.
4672560	4678080	And so really, the fundamental story is not how does the electron, how does the, sorry,
4678080	4682080	how does the Higgs field affect elementary particles? It's really how does the Higgs field
4682080	4686720	affect the fields whose waves are elementary particles? And so it's the interactions between
4686720	4694640	fields, the Higgs field and other fields that is at the fundamental heart of how the Higgs
4694640	4700800	field is able to affect the world in such a dramatic way. And just to add one side comment
4700800	4706880	to that, again, to just make sure it's all clear. The big news in 2012 was the discovery of the
4706880	4715200	Higgs boson, a type of particle. The type of particle is itself a ripple, a minimal wave,
4715760	4721200	in something. What is it a ripple in? It's a ripple in the Higgs field. So the discovery of
4721200	4727040	the Higgs particle was really not the big story. It was the means to an end. The discovery of the
4727040	4732240	Higgs particle proved that there must be a Higgs field because, you know, particles are just
4732240	4737040	manifestations of ripples of fields. And so the discovery of the Higgs field, that was the big
4737040	4742160	deal. The Higgs particle doesn't give mass to anything. And it doesn't affect anything. It's
4742240	4747120	despite the name God particle that's been given to it. It has essentially no role in the universe
4747120	4752400	at all. And if you make a Higgs particle, it's gone in a tiny fraction of a second. But the Higgs
4752400	4756720	field, that's another matter. It's present everywhere in the universe, just like the electromagnetic
4756720	4762960	field. But it has an additional feature that has allowed it to change the properties of other fields
4762960	4767840	and thereby the properties of elementary particles on which our lives fundamentally depend.
4768560	4773120	I'm fond of pointing out that we shouldn't call it the God particle anymore, because now we have
4773120	4780000	evidence that it exists. It goes over separately with different audiences, depending on who you're
4780000	4785760	talking to. But that was very helpful. Good. And I think that we can, you know, actually wind things
4785760	4793120	up with, this leads us directly to, you know, okay, mass, gravity, etc. You brought up the fact
4793120	4797920	that one way of thinking about gravity is through the gravitational field, which at the quantum
4797920	4804160	field theory level, looks like a spin two particle, the graviton. And I know that this is a lot of,
4804160	4810000	this is definitely an area where people struggle trying to understand what we physicists are
4810000	4816240	saying. Because on the one hand, we're saying, gravity is not a force, right? Einstein seemed
4816240	4821440	to imply that gravity is a feature of space time, not a force. On the other hand, it's a particle
4821440	4828880	just like the photon is a particle, which makes it seem kind of force like. And on the, well,
4828880	4834320	I mean, there's many hands we can go down here. But we don't understand gravity at the quantum
4834320	4839360	level. Is that an obstacle to talking about things like gravitons? Gravitons have never
4839360	4843040	been detected. Should we really be sure that they're there? I'm just going to dump all these
4843040	4847840	questions in your lap and give you 30 seconds to close it out. You get more than 30 seconds,
4847840	4853840	don't worry, but however long it takes. Well, I think the way to understand what we
4854880	4860480	know and don't know about gravity and what we suspect about how it works is really to make
4860480	4867280	sure that your understanding of electromagnetism and the photon is complete. Because the analogies
4867280	4879040	are almost exact. The notion that the electric force has to do with the exchange of photons,
4879040	4887280	this is another phrase that's common in the world of science communication. I hate it,
4888640	4892880	because I think it really fundamentally miscommunicates what particles are.
4893520	4898480	And what we learn in first year physics classes that electric forces are associated with the
4898480	4903760	electric field is still just as true as it was before people invented quantum mechanics. The
4903760	4911520	electric field does generate the effect that we call electric force. And to try to talk about it
4911520	4916560	in terms of photons moving back and forth is kind of a math trick and not fundamental from my
4917200	4926640	perspective to the actual physics. Photons, as we said, are the basic elements out of which
4926640	4933840	a light wave is constructed. Now, we can import these ideas to gravity, that gravity is caused
4933840	4939040	by the gravitational field, which itself, in this case, we have some idea of what it might be. It
4939040	4943040	reflects the curvature. It's the property of spacetime, which we call curvature.
4944800	4951600	And waves in the gravitational field, we call gravitational waves, just as a laser beam is a
4951600	4956640	very bright wave of light. The gravitational waves that were recently measured, they are very bright,
4956640	4960800	even though they are extraordinarily difficult to measure, and they're very dim by human standards.
4960800	4966240	They're extraordinarily bright by quantum standards. And if you could make a sufficiently dim
4966240	4971120	gravitational wave, you would discover that it's made from individual gravitons,
4971120	4977200	just as if you take a laser and make it sufficiently dim, you'll discover that it's made
4977200	4983120	from photons. Now, that is still conjecture, but that is the analogy that we make, and we believe
4983120	4989520	it's likely true. Unfortunately, to test it experimentally is far beyond current technology.
4989520	4995280	But as far as the math goes, that math analogy works just fine. The problems of quantum gravity
4995280	5001520	do not arise with that analogy. They arise when you try to make sense of the more quantum properties
5001520	5009440	of spacetime itself. And so that's sort of a more sophisticated application of quantum physics.
5009440	5015920	There's no problem with imagining gravitons. They can be put into the equations. They can be
5015920	5020240	calculated. One can even calculate things that they do, like scatter off of objects.
5021040	5027600	And so we have reason to think that gravitons may exist, but it's always possible that our
5027600	5032480	understanding of gravity is wrong and that some aspect of it will break down even before we get
5032480	5036640	to the quantum level. And if that's the case, then the story will be more complicated.
5037280	5043040	That's for experiment to decide. I would still argue, maybe disagree, but I would still argue
5043040	5049920	that there's essentially zero credence we should put on gravitons not existing. Maybe they're not
5050000	5057600	fundamental, but even in the wind, there's sound waves and we can quantize them to get phonons,
5057600	5063280	right? I mean, there's going to be something that is the quantum of the gravitational field,
5063280	5069040	whether it's fundamental or not. Well, this is an interesting physics point that I
5069680	5074320	am not 100% sure my own understanding is as good as it should be. It's kind of one of those things
5074320	5081040	which I looked into at some point. It's certainly true that sound waves in a piece of metal
5083040	5088320	are made out of phonons in the same way that light waves are made from photons.
5089680	5099520	But it is, I think, not the case that there are phonons in air. I think this is true.
5099520	5103200	This is something where I might be embarrassing myself here. The point is that
5103760	5110240	when the amplitude gets sufficiently low and you're trying to tell whether the
5110240	5115280	sound wave is really something you could pull apart, the whole structure of the material starts
5115280	5124560	to become important. So your ability to describe it as a collective wave breaks down before you
5124560	5132640	get to the quantum effects. I think it is possible that something similar is true for gravity.
5133760	5139200	And that we will have to change the way we talk about it before we really get to individual
5139200	5143840	quanta. And that if you try to get to individual quanta, you would discover that there's something
5143840	5149280	wrong about the way you're thinking of space and time. Now, again, I don't say this with 100%
5149280	5152160	confidence because I haven't actually worked through the math and tried to understand this
5152160	5156560	in detail. I do remember reading something of this sort. And so I think both you and I have
5156560	5160480	some reading to do to settle this issue. That's always true. And that's very helpful,
5160480	5166400	because that's a point I hadn't thought about. So that's useful. But maybe tell me if I'm
5166400	5170800	oversimplifying, but for the people out there who are still trying to get straight on whether
5170800	5176480	gravity is a force or not, I would say there's a language that says gravity is not a force,
5176480	5182480	it's the curvature of space time. There's another language that says gravity is a force that follows
5182480	5187200	the inverse square law, like Isaac Newton said. There's a third language that says gravity can
5187200	5192480	be thought of as a manifestation of a bunch of spin two particles grouped up into some condensate.
5192480	5198720	And all of these languages are correct. They're mutually incompatible. You had to choose one
5198720	5204000	at one time, but they all describe the same underlying phenomenon in slightly different
5204000	5211520	linguistic choices. Well, this is, I think, this reflects a very important aspect of physics and
5211520	5217600	mathematics that I view as one of the really important conceptual points that is
5219840	5228480	poorly understood outside of the experts. But even the experts forget about it. They know it.
5229360	5238480	And the first time we physicists learn that there's not going to be one unique language
5239280	5245920	for talking about anything is when we're learning Newtonian physics. Because we first learn everything
5245920	5249840	that everybody learns in first year of physics, which is that there are forces and there's
5249840	5256800	accelerations and that's the way you should describe things. And then we learn three entirely
5256800	5263600	different ways of saying the same thing. Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, Hamilton Jacobi theory, each one of
5263600	5270480	these is a different way of talking about Newton's laws. And you can prove mathematically that all
5270480	5276240	the predictions that you will get from these different ways of saying the same thing are identical.
5277360	5282160	Which means that there are multiple conceptual languages based on multiple ways of writing
5282160	5287680	down the same math, which have exactly the same experimental consequences and cannot be
5287680	5297600	distinguished by an experiment. So how should we think about this? Math can be written in
5297600	5304640	different ways. Adding a positive number to a negative number can be thought of a subtraction,
5305520	5309440	subtracting a positive number from a positive number. So is it addition or is it subtraction?
5310000	5317760	Well, clearly you could do it either way and if you wanted to base your world on addition
5317760	5322640	and negative numbers, you could view the world that way. And if you wanted to think about no,
5322640	5325920	all numbers are positive, but I can do addition or subtraction, that would be a different way to
5325920	5330720	do it. And there's nothing wrong with either one. But it might change the way you talk.
5332000	5337440	So the different languages which you described for talking about general relativity,
5338080	5343520	they are different ways of writing the math or viewing the math that have exactly the same
5343520	5350320	consequences. And so a professional will use any and all of them whenever a particular one is
5350320	5355120	convenient, will use that one. If it makes the calculation simpler, we'll use it. And what we
5355120	5361680	learn is that we should not be too wedded to a particular conceptual viewpoint. We simply can't
5361680	5366720	be. We can't decide on the basis of experiment which one of these viewpoints is correct, nor
5366720	5372400	should we try. The math is what we use to make predictions. The language in which we talk about
5372400	5376800	the math or the version of the math that we use, as long as they're literally identical in all
5376800	5383520	predictions, they are simply equivalent and common ways. Just like you can describe a table
5383520	5386560	using English or French or German, it doesn't make it any less a table.
5387520	5391760	I think that's a wonderful lesson to wrap up with. So Matt Straszler, thanks so much for being on
5391760	5394800	the Winescape podcast. Thank you very much, Sean.
