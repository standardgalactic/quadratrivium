00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:10,400
I bet that most of us out here have had the experience of trying to put together a bookshelf

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,960
or something like that from IKEA or from wherever, some somewhat complicated piece of furniture or

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,320
something to have around the house for which you get blueprints, instructions, as well as pieces,

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,120
the raw materials, right? And so we have a certain paradigm in mind about how something

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,160
complicated like a bookshelf comes to be. There's a blueprint, a set of instructions,

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,200
there's stuff that we're going to put together, and there's some agent, us, that does that work.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,320
It's very natural then, because we're familiar with that kind of process, to think that something

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,360
like that also happens when you put together a living organism, right? When you put together

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,600
a person or a whale or a tree, there is some blueprint set of instructions, which presumably

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,120
is in the DNA, right, in the genome of the organism. And then there is some agents putting

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,800
them together, presumably the proteins that get their information from the DNA via the RNA,

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,520
and they go off and they build things, and voila, you get an organism. So it turns out,

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,920
it's almost not at all like that pretty much, okay? That's some truth to the idea that there are

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,640
instructions or information contained in our DNA that will go into constructing an organism such as

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,640
a person. But the actual process by which it happens is much more nuanced, much richer, not quite

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,400
that simple paradigm we have in mind of an instruction kit and agent and some raw materials.

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,360
And partly that's because, you know, we are not intelligently designed, right? This whole system

19
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:47,360
that we have in us of DNA, genome, RNA, proteins, the organs that we have, the cells in our body,

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,040
this all evolved in a complicated process and whatever kinds of dynamics and process was

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,320
important and useful as far as evolution is concerned is what we ended up using, okay? It's

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,680
not supposed to be code in a computer where it's carefully commented or anything like that, it's

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,280
just what was thrown together and what eventually got used. And as a result of that, biologists

24
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,360
keep finding ways in which the morphology, the shape and the way things are put together in

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,640
organisms comes to be in fun and different ways than you might expect from the simple Ikea paradigm.

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,840
So our guest today, Michael Levin, is a biologist at Tufts University and it's actually a little

27
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,200
bit difficult to describe what he specializes in because it's kind of many different projects that

28
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,400
are all fascinating to me. But in the overall space of talking about how information and physical

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,480
dynamics come together to make organisms and all their different functions and things like that.

30
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,760
Not only does it help us understand the particular features of organisms that we know and love,

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,000
but to someone like me who cares about emergence and different levels of description of reality,

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
it's fascinating because we can start asking questions like, at what point is a decision

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,720
being made by an organism or by the processes that are going into making that organism? Is it

34
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,840
anything like a computer? Is there a separation between hardware and software? What is the role

35
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,720
of memory? What is the role of dynamical processes? All these fun questions. So we're going to be

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,600
talking about how cells, how information and how organisms all fit together. I'm not sure that I am

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,320
capable or qualified to draw a single unified theme from it, but I think you'll find that it's a

38
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,480
fascinating conversation that touches on many kinds of things we've been talking about on

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:45,200
Mindscape for quite a while now. So let's go.

40
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,320
Michael Levin, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. Well, thank you so much. Pleased to be here.

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,280
This is an interesting podcast for me to think about organizing and talking about because you

42
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,960
do so many different kinds of things. And I finally hit on a starting point of asking you about

43
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,240
one of the experiments you described in your papers with the Xenopus tadpole. I think that's

44
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,080
how you pronounce it, the Xenopus. You basically, if I understand correctly, you in your lab or

45
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:26,240
your collaborators rearranged the face of a little baby frog tadpole and it somehow,

46
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,640
nevertheless, grew correctly into the right shape. Is that roughly speaking correct?

47
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes, that's correct. And I do think it's a pretty important experiment and it's one that we can

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,320
definitely form this conversation around because it illustrates something very important. So it

49
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,760
used to be thought because all tadpoles look the same and all frogs look the same that basically

50
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,320
what the genome could do is somehow encode a hardwired set of movements that would transform

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,160
a standard tadpole into a standard frog. So the idea would be that the nostrils, the eyes,

52
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,120
the jaws, all these things have to rearrange themselves to become a frog. And so what we

53
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,920
did was a start out by making something we call Picasso tadpoles where everything is in the wrong

54
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,240
place. So the jaws might be off to one side, the eyes might be on the top of the head or

55
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,240
everything is sort of mixed up and we can talk about how we make those. And then the remarkable

56
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,640
thing is that they largely become normal frogs. So all of these little pieces that make up the

57
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:33,120
head and the face will move in novel unnatural configurations until they land in the correct

58
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,800
positions to make a frog face. And so what this is telling us is that the genetics in fact gives

59
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,320
us a system that's very good at reducing error. That what it does is continuously work to sort of

60
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,960
reduce the difference, the delta between the configuration you have now and the configuration

61
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,840
that it in some way remembers as a correct frog face and that things stop moving and stop proliferating

62
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,880
when that error is sufficiently small. Yeah, which is a remarkable way of thinking about it

63
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,200
because it's probably not what most people have in mind. Well, I say most people, I mean me,

64
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,240
you know, not being a biologist myself. I mean, I think that we think of what's packed into our

65
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,880
genome as roughly the equivalent of the instructions you get from Ikea or something like that, right?

66
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,080
Here are some building blocks. Here are the steps you have to take in order. And at the end, hopefully

67
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,440
you get the finished product. But so you're saying it's not like that. No, it's absolutely not like

68
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,280
that. And on the one hand, we kind of already know it's not like that because if you actually,

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,320
and look, the view that you've described is definitely the kind of the mainstream perception

70
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,200
that everybody has. And I've given talks to nine year olds in middle school and so on. And when I

71
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,160
ask them what determines what comes out of an egg, you know, it can be a bird, a dinosaur, a snake,

72
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,680
you know, what determines the shape of what comes out of an egg, everybody says the genome.

73
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,000
And in a certain sense, that's true. But if you actually look at now that we can read genomes,

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
if you actually look at what's in the genome, you're not going to find anything in there about

75
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,520
the size, the shape, the type of symmetry of the organism that's going to come out. And what's

76
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,400
important to realize is that we currently do not have the ability to look at a genome and guess

77
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,680
anything about what the shape of the organism is going to be. Now you can cheat and compare it to

78
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,560
the genome of another organism that you do know what it looks like. But this idea that you can

79
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,920
read the genome and sort of understand what the anatomy is going to be is not the case.

80
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,040
And that is because the genome does have a recipe, but it's not a recipe for shape, it's a recipe

81
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:38,320
for proteins. So what the genome does is prescribe what protein hardware every cell in your body

82
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,160
gets to have. So these are the smallest sorts of building blocks from which cells build various

83
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,760
structures. And so it's sort of like you're not getting the design of the IKEA shelf,

84
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,640
you're getting a description of the metal that goes into the screws and the wood or whatever

85
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,360
it is that goes into the other part. It's a description of a very low level aspect of the

86
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,160
system you're actually interested in. Yeah, and it's what do you say we can't look at the genome

87
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,560
and see what the shape is going to be? Is that our fault? I mean, is it implicit in there,

88
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,840
but there's just a lot of steps? Or is it really that even in principle you couldn't look at the

89
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,680
genome and figure out what the animal is going to be? Well, that's a great question. So let's

90
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:27,120
think about what we mean by in principle. So if you were to sort of a laplace kind of simulate

91
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,520
all of the micro interactions, then certainly you could. If you take into account the environment,

92
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,560
even things like let's say turtles, which use external temperature to determine the sex of

93
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,920
the offspring, you could figure out what was going to happen. So in a certain molecular sense,

94
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,920
if you were to simply absolutely model the lowest level of physics, yes, it's in there.

95
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,480
But we would like to do something better than that. We would like to understand the encoding.

96
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,720
And from that perspective, it's not our fault in the sense that that's not what's encoded there. So

97
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,000
what's encoded is not the actual anatomical features. What's encoded are the proteins and a

98
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,440
little bit about the order in which some of those proteins will appear as a function of time. So

99
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,000
from that perspective, even though developmental biologists are doing a very nice job trying to

100
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,400
understand how all of these organs come to be, we really need to understand a lot more. And you

101
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,960
can sort of, an example you might think about is the kind of bell curve that you get from dropping

102
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,640
marbles into a Galton board. Where does the shape of that bell curve come from? So in a certain

103
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:45,760
sense, at a micro level, you could probably calculate it out and predict it maybe if the errors

104
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,160
were small enough. But in a larger sense, that shape is not encoded anywhere in the material of

105
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,880
the marbles or the definition of the board or anything like that. It's because what that device

106
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,240
is doing is harnessing particular laws of physics. And what embryos do and all living structures

107
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,800
do is they harness the laws of physics and the laws of computation. So this is very important.

108
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,880
And so what you get in the genome is the description of a very important and very

109
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,720
interesting machine, which is able to generate and process information exploiting various laws of

110
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,480
physics and computation to make certain outcomes. And what's super cool about it is that these

111
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,200
outcomes are reliable most of the time. So most acorns give you oak trees and most fish eggs

112
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,480
give you a fish. But actually, it's way better than that because it is not only robust to all

113
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,240
kinds of perturbations, but it's actually reprogrammable, which I think is one of the most

114
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,000
exciting aspects of it. I guess it's very hard for us to escape the metaphors that we use to

115
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,440
think about these things, like as if there were blueprints or an instruction manual in the DNA.

116
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,400
But the reality is more, I guess, like you're saying, the DNA makes RNA, the RNA makes proteins,

117
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,440
and the DNA is chosen not because someone wanted to design something, but just because

118
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:14,160
making these proteins in this right environment gets us the morphology, the shape that is been

119
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,680
selected for by natural selection. Yeah, this is correct. So natural selection, of course,

120
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,960
shapes the proteins that cells will use. I think a really good analogy, and we can come back to

121
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,880
the status of metaphors in this field because I think it's not quite what a lot of people think

122
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:39,280
it is. But one useful metaphor for this is the distinction between software and hardware.

123
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,640
So if you can imagine that if you had a bunch of electric parts, you could connect them together.

124
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,400
And if they were the right kind of parts, one of the things you would get would be an electric

125
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,560
circuit that might do something. And one of the things that might do if your parts included

126
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,720
transistors is that it might carry out logic functions. And so it might be able to carry out

127
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,120
certain operations that would be logic that from which you could build up all kinds of complex

128
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,600
computations. And so now you could ask where the laws of computation live. That's an interesting

129
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,040
question. Certainly, right? Certainly, you know, the operations of AND gates and NOR gates and

130
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:26,240
things like this were not in the electric parts that you got a specification to. But what evolution

131
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,520
did was shape the parts. And it shapes the parts in a way that when those parts interact together,

132
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,320
they make a circuit. And the part that we study in my lab is largely the electrical aspect of it,

133
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,880
which is why I keep coming back to these kind of electronics analogies. The amazing thing about

134
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,520
these circuits is that they take advantage of really interesting laws of physics having to do

135
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:51,280
with electricity and how that propagates. And the laws of computation, which allows cells and

136
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,400
tissues to make decisions and to have memory and things like that. And that's where evolution

137
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:04,080
really shines is to exploit these laws of physics. Right. But I guess what I'm trying to

138
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,600
understand better is this idea that there's no top down directing of what's going on in the

139
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,240
individual cells. I mean, the cells that make up my liver and my brain have the same DNA in them.

140
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,240
And they're just doing their production of proteins. And it sort of all fits together at

141
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,120
the end of the day. And it's not that anyone wrote software to do that, right? It's just that

142
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,440
the DNA that makes that happen is the one that gets passed on.

143
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,040
Well, I'll say two things about that. Certainly, no one wrote the software in the sense of some

144
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:48,880
sort of designer. So that's for sure. But I will say that this issue of top down control is tricky.

145
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,600
And what I'm about to say is probably not the mainstream sort of story of developmental

146
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,800
biology that you'll get from a textbook. But this is how I see it. If you look at it, it's

147
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,240
a multi-scale problem. So if you look at it from the scale of individual cells or molecules,

148
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:13,280
then that's basically correct. They are simply following sort of local rules about what they're

149
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:19,840
going to do. But I think the evidence is pretty good now that there is a larger level of organization

150
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,800
that you can look at. And this larger level of organizations at the tissue and organ level

151
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,440
is performing some interesting computations that deforms the possible action space for the subunits.

152
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:39,360
So what that means is that it basically alters the space of what's possible for the cells and

153
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,680
the molecular networks to do so that by simply following very mechanical rules, sort of minimization

154
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:54,160
of free energy and things like this, they end up doing things that are in line with a global

155
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,600
body plan. So you can look at things that tissues and organ level structures are doing

156
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,240
that are very large-scale computations and decision-making about things like, hey,

157
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,680
is our face patterned correctly? Do we have the right number of fingers? Are the limbs long enough?

158
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,560
And the outcome of those computations are instructions to individual cells to either

159
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,720
proliferate or turn on certain genes or turn off certain genes. And at that point,

160
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,160
the cells are just doing what the chemistry sort of suggests in the sense that there isn't

161
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,720
any magic there. But if you look at the level above, what's happening is that all of those

162
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,280
low-level reactions are being harnessed towards a higher-level goal that none of the individual

163
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,640
cells are capable of perceiving. So at the single cell level, there's no such thing as an arm or an

164
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:49,840
eye or anything like that. No single cell can perceive that. But the group agent, and so I

165
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,200
think fundamentally this is a problem of swarm intelligence and group cognition. The group agent

166
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:02,000
has very sort of rough memories of what the correct pattern should be, and it has the ability to make

167
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,720
decisions about whether or not the current state is close enough to the target state,

168
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,960
and if not adjust behaviors. So I think from that perspective, there is a bit of top-down control,

169
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,160
and we can talk about some of our worm experiments that tend to show this,

170
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,920
that is not in the sense of some sort of rational designer that writes software,

171
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,080
but in the cybernetic sense where there are systems that reduce error from a stored set point.

172
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,200
And so as long as they can remember what that set point is, they can then have this kind of

173
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:40,080
homeostatic cycle that harnesses the parts of the machine towards the goal, which is again,

174
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,200
not something magical, but is a representative target state towards which the whole system tries

175
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,800
to get to. There are times when we have a long stretch of time ahead of us where we're doing

176
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,760
something, but our attention is not completely absorbed. That's when Audible.com and their

177
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,480
audiobook selections can come to your rescue. I know that I've driven across the country several

178
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,480
times, and my favorite thing to do is to listen to ancient poems. I listen to the Iliad, the Odyssey,

179
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,160
the Aeneid, Beowulf, helps make those long highways in Nebraska fly by. If you'd like something a

180
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,640
little bit more modern, my own books are on Audible.com. I was the one who read Something

181
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,720
Deeply Hidden and The Big Picture. The other ones were read by others, so let that color your choices.

188
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,960
the shape that it wants, that has encoded in it, the shape that it wants its body and

189
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:14,720
its face to have? And then the large scale, whatever shape it currently has, reacts back

190
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,080
against that genome to sort of say, well, what do we do next to move us closer to that goal?

191
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,520
Is that the right way of thinking about it? That's close. I would say what the genome encodes

192
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,040
is a bunch of parts that when implemented in parallel, it makes a piece of hardware that

193
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,760
has a very reliable default behavior. That default behavior is a set of biochemical,

194
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:46,160
biomechanical and bioelectrical circuits that if nothing weird happens to them by their normal

195
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,200
behavior in their normal environment, they will generate a set of patterns that give rise to a

196
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,200
standard frog. And so the real outcome, if you ask the question of where does a frog face come from,

197
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:04,080
it's a sort of interplay of the constraints imposed by the genetics which specifies the machine

198
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,520
and the laws of physics and computation which exist around it. Now, there's an additional

199
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,880
factor as it turns out that this machine has some really interesting properties. It isn't,

200
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,840
evolution apparently doesn't just favor machines that only have one outcome,

201
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:27,120
but they favor, at least in many cases, it favors machines with a particular capability which is

202
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,920
a separation of hardware from software. What I mean is it's able to represent

203
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,960
different possible set points and what the cells know how to do really well is to build

204
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,360
towards the set point. And if the set point changes, you don't have to rewire the cells.

205
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,600
I mean, that's a really interesting, that reprogrammability is a really powerful

206
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,440
aspect of all this. I guess this is what I'm learning, not just from this conversation,

207
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,320
but from other podcast interviews I did with Carl Friston, for example, with his

208
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,240
free energy principle. I'll make a grandiose claim and then you can fact-check me here.

209
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:09,600
In many ways, the way that biological organisms work, either in sort of day-to-day dynamics or

210
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:16,800
evolution or development of the organism, is not this sort of Laplacian idea that you give me

211
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,320
exactly the state right now and I will tell you what direction to move in. It's this almost

212
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,960
teleological way of thinking about things. Just had David Hague on the podcast and he

213
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,400
wants to let us talk in teleological terms. It's like, rather than saying, if this, then that,

214
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,280
if this is where we are now, here's where we should go, it's like, well, here's where we want to get

215
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,600
to, figure out a way to get there. Yes, I think that's absolutely correct. I think

216
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:51,680
biology has been trapped in this teleophobia, which is doing us a great disservice. I think

217
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:57,920
it's completely, not only fine, but absolutely necessary to talk about those kinds of things.

218
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,440
I think that's exactly what biological systems do and we can talk about how I think this aspect

219
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,920
of goal-directedness, this multi-scale goal-directedness, is crucial for evolution. I think it's what

220
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:21,600
makes evolution work. It's what makes for much greater evolvability. I'm a big fan of Friston's

221
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,880
work. We've used it in our own research. I think it's absolutely correct in that not only do living

222
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,160
things have to predict their environment, but they actually have to predict themselves. Living

223
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:40,480
things are a patchwork at different scales of systems that cooperate and compete with each

224
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,120
other. Part of all of that is being able to guess what's going to happen next and having a

225
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,160
preference about what you'd like to have happen next. Everything is working towards minimizing

226
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,920
that delta from what it expects and what's actually going to happen. This is critical for

227
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,320
evolvability. I think those kinds of, what's important about that that teleology isn't simply

228
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,520
that we allow it or disallow it, but I think we need to move it from a philosophical problem,

229
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,640
which a lot of people have argued in a vacuum about whether it is or is not okay to talk this way

230
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,640
or whether all models in biology should be framed in terms of biochemistry and molecules and not

231
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,560
goals and things like this. I think it's an empirical. It's a very practical problem. The

232
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,520
question, it's a little like Dan Dennett's intentional stance, where it's very simple.

233
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,400
You just say, what level of intentionality do I ascribe to my system that best gets me

234
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,640
to new prediction and control? Sometimes you'll err on the side of attributing too much agency and

235
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:50,160
it's wasted and you can do better with a simpler model. Sometimes you're applying simple laws to

236
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,080
systems that internally have a very rich protocognitive structure that should be much better

237
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,400
off taking advantage of. I've argued that for regenerative medicine and just in our lab and

238
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,680
others, it's driven a ton of work to novel experiments that otherwise would not have been done

239
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,800
and to actually ask, what does the system know? What does it expect? What are the preferences?

240
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,640
What goals is it trying to achieve? This is on all scales of organization.

241
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,600
You and I are probably familiar with the distinction between in physics Newtonian mechanics

242
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,760
versus the principle of least action. I noticed that the principle of least action is actually

243
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,240
quoted on your web page. It's interesting because it's two different ways of conceptualizing

244
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,280
exactly the same problem and getting exactly the same answer, but from very different languages.

245
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,280
So maybe for the people out there who don't hang out on the wrong street corners and hear

246
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,880
about the principle of least action, why don't you tell us how physicists think about that?

247
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,840
Because it's clearly related to what you're saying about biology.

248
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,560
Well, I'm probably going to make a massive fool of myself here because I'm not a physicist.

249
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,280
I'm sure you are a much better place to give a proper definition of it.

250
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:08,720
But what I understand is that there are lots of physical systems and probably all of them

251
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,800
where one of the things you can do, so let's say trying to understand how light is going to

252
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,800
propagate through a bunch of lenses stacked one after the other things like that, you could go

253
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,400
after the micro details and try to use Maxwell's equations and things like this to really model

254
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,080
every piece of it and eventually you'll crank through and you'll get the answer.

255
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,320
Apparently, it turns out that you could get the exact same answer with a lot less effort if you

256
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,880
simply make an assumption that what the light wants to do is to minimize the effort, so to speak,

257
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,920
or the action that it will take to get there. That's a rough, that's how I understand these

258
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:51,920
things. And I think that's an incredibly powerful concept because asking about how much effort

259
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,840
does it take to compute something, I think is really important because when people, especially

260
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:04,400
in the biosciences where things impact medicine a lot, when people say, well, everything should

261
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,400
be done at the lowest possible level, and he said, well, you don't really mean the lowest,

262
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,240
you don't want to talk about quantum foam, but you really want to talk about his biochemistry,

263
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,360
right? That's often when people say to me, ah, you got to reduce, and you don't really mean that.

264
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,880
What you mean is you've picked a level and that level is biochemistry. And my point is you can't,

265
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,000
and this is people like Dennis Noble have been saying this much better than I, that you can't

266
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,200
simply pick a level because you like it, you have to pick the best level. And how do you know what

267
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,680
the best level is? And the best level is how much effort do I need to put in to control the outcome?

268
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,880
And in the case of regenerative medicine, that outcome might be we're going to replace a complex

269
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,880
finger or a hand that's way too complicated for anybody to build by hand from stem cells or anything

270
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,120
like that. So the question is going to be, to what extent is your system persuadable? There's this,

271
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,440
you know, I visualize this axis, right? On the one hand, you have things like cuckoo clocks,

272
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,680
which are not persuadable. You are, you know, if you want to make a change in the way that system

273
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,000
works, you have to rewire, you have to physically change the hardware, there's no getting around it.

274
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,120
And then you have systems way on the sort of on the right side of that spectrum, which might be

275
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,840
humans or they might be other kinds of advanced cognitive systems where trying to intervene in

276
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,280
their activity on the molecular scale is maybe possible. But realistically, you know, the sun's

277
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,960
going to burn down before you figure out how to tweak all the cells in a person's brain to get

278
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,480
this or that to happen. So there you're probably better off with stimuli, with experiences, with

279
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,880
inputs that take advantage of the cognitive structure of the system to convince them or

280
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,720
motivate them or train them to do various things. And then in between are all kinds of agents,

281
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,520
many of which we know, so animals and simple AIs and basic life forms and cells. And then

282
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,920
all kinds of agents that don't exist yet. I mean, I think one of the fun things to talk about is the

283
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,400
space of possible agents, which I think is going to be actually enormous in our lifetime. And

284
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,920
somewhere on that scale is the correct way to interact with everything you come into contact

285
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:16,320
with. And you really have to ask, what is the, what are, you know, are there goals that your

286
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,920
system is trying to achieve? And are you better off rewriting those goals or motivating the system

287
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,200
than micromanaging it? And I think it sounds it seems like physics is telling you at the

288
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,720
lowest level that this kind of stuff is already baked in. Yeah, I mean, I can't help but talk

289
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,040
about the physics and least action just a little bit more because it's really fascinating to me.

290
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:43,760
I mean, like we said, there is this way, I even did a video on this in my summer quarantine project

291
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,520
video series called The Biggest Ideas in the Universe about how you can either be Newtonian and

292
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,360
say, well, I know where I am now and all the laws of physics tell me is what to do next. Or you can

293
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:02,080
be, I don't know, Lagrangian or whatever it's called. You can you can say, well, of all the

294
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,760
histories I could have in the future, I will take the one that minimizes the certain function,

295
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,840
right, the action. And that latter one just seems a little magical. I mean, you're saying like,

296
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,920
well, how did it know? But you show that in fact, secretly, they're mathematically exactly the same.

297
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,160
It's just, you know, a matter of convenience. But, but the convenience is extreme when you're

298
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,280
when you become a modern particle physicist, you're constantly writing down this action, this

299
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,960
this thing that is the thing you minimize globally rather than locally. And it's just a much more

300
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,200
convenient way of talking about it. So I guess the question that is obvious to me now is,

301
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,800
is there a reason why it doesn't have something to do with the fact that biological organisms

302
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,960
are these multilevel systems where there's collective action from all of our tiny little

303
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,120
cells coming together? Is that does that help explain why it is convenient to talk in these

304
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,760
more global terms rather than just locally following the action of every little atom or

305
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,840
molecular cell? Yeah, I think well, I think there are there are two two aspects to this. The sort

306
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,120
of more metaphysical aspect is in which I'm not sure how much value this is, but I'll just say it

307
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,440
because it's it's something I've been thinking about is that if you ask yourself, you know,

308
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,320
let's say people who are who are into panpsychism or this idea that, you know, sort of some sort of

309
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,000
intentionality is everywhere fundamentally. What one of the problems that people often have with

310
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,640
this is that they scale down the physical system, they say, Okay, now let's consider a rock or a,

311
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,920
you know, something like that. And then they fail to scale down the intentionality that I think

312
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm seeing is they say, Well, it's ridiculous to say that a rock has hopes and dreams. And

313
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,680
well, of course, it is so right. So what you need to do is you need to proportionally scale

314
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:52,160
down the cognition. So if you ask yourself what would intentionality or freedom in the sense of

315
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,440
indeterminacy look like in the simplest possible case, I think what you get is exactly what particle

316
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,040
physics is telling us. So so if you ask, you know, what would freedom look like at the most minimal

317
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,800
kind of instantiation, I think you would you would predict something that looks like quantum

318
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,640
indeterminacy. And if you ask, what does what would goal directedness look like at the at the

319
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,200
simplest possible layer of reality, I think you would get exactly what these action principles

320
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,680
look like. So from that perspective, I think I think it's a it's a it's a scale. And the way I

321
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:31,920
think it scales is this, you know, when we when we look at living things now, all we're seeing are

322
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:37,920
it's a selection effect, all we're seeing are things that survived the gauntlet of competition

323
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:45,200
and and selection. So we don't have any objects in that we don't see any living forms that are

324
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,240
not good at pursuing goals, those things disappeared very early on. Now, maybe we'll be able to create

325
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,080
some life that doesn't do that as as people work on synthetic, you know, origins of life and synthetic

326
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,760
life and so on. But any sophisticated life that makes it past, you know, the first few the first

327
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:09,280
few steps of competition is going to be great at pursuing goals in the very simple sense of

328
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:14,720
homeostasis. So one of the things that we're working on now is to try to understand the

329
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,560
scaling of goals from tiny homeostatic goals, like either chemical reactions that try to keep

330
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,160
certain entropic principles in particular ranges, or single cells like bacteria that try to keep

331
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:35,840
metabolic states in particular ranges. How do you scale goals from these very modest types of

332
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,720
goals to something that's much larger, like the goal of having a properly shaped hand or face

333
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,200
with particular, you know, and then how do you pivot the whole thing to from from early organisms

334
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,200
that, and in fact, still current organisms that execute goals in morpho space, meaning the the

335
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,760
space of possible anatomical configurations. And you sort of pivot you run the same algorithms,

336
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,480
but now your space is three dimensional space outdoors. So now you can run around and have

337
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,480
behavior and have goals that are, Hey, I'm going to run this maze because I remember the structure

338
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,680
of the maze. And at the end, there's some cheese and along with the way I'm going to do this and

339
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:15,600
that. So this this idea, you know, life has to start out with with homeostatic loops, I don't

340
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,480
think there's any way around it. And those loops scale into progressively more impressive goals

341
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:28,960
that what's what's what one way to organize all this is to is to ask yourself, what are the

342
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,640
spatiotemporal boundaries of the goals that any given system could potentially have. So it's

343
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,440
sort of like like think of a light cone, so to speak, that that says, okay, here, right in space

344
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,280
and time, here is the boundary of things I can possibly have goals about. So if you're a goldfish

345
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,400
or a tick, those both in space and time, it's rather modest, you can only conceive of things

346
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,720
that are right in front of you and not too far in the past. And you maybe have a little bit of

347
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,120
anticipatory ability. But by the time you get to great apes or humans, you know, you could have

348
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:07,920
goals that are that are that are massive in scale. And you know, you just just a huge both both in

349
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,400
terms of time in terms of memory and anticipation that you could be working towards things that are

350
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:17,920
going to happen long after you're long after you die and things like that. So that's one way

351
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:23,840
to organize all this is by the by the scale of the goals that these systems are capable of maintaining.

352
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,120

363
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,720
I thought of myself a lot about levels of description and reality. I mean, my book,

364
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,160
The Big Picture, just talked about levels a lot. And I'll be honest, I've always been very resistant

365
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:44,560
to the idea of causation acting between levels, downward or upward. It seems to me, and I think

366
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,160
this is just my fundamental physicist training kicking in, that levels should be autonomous

367
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,200
from each other. And I mean, you can derive one from another maybe, but they act differently. But

368
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:03,040
maybe I should just start thinking differently when it comes to biology or human scale things.

369
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,720
Certainly, the words you're using seem to indicate to me that you find it useful to

370
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,920
speak as if what's happening on one level, like organism wide or network wide or whatever,

371
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,760
is important to take consideration of even when we're talking about what's happening on lower

372
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:26,960
levels. Yes, I think that's true. And I think that actually, you may have seen this, but there's

373
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:34,080
very interesting work on this coming out of Giulio Tononi's lab and Eric Hall about

374
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:39,040
quantifying some of these things. So there's now math that will help you understand for a given

375
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:49,920
system, what is the causally most potent level at which to manipulate it. And it's not practical

376
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,840
to compute some of those things for a lot of real systems that we care about. But certainly,

377
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:02,000
there are techniques that we use all the time in the lab to ask what is the most appropriate level

378
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:09,120
at which to try to manipulate the system. And inevitably, it bleeds down into the lower levels

379
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,680
in the following sense. So in Plenaria, let's say, so we have these flatworms and they have one head

380
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,280
and one tail and you chop them into pieces. And each piece knows where the head and the tail are

381
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,160
supposed to go and it reliably sort of regenerates whatever is missing. So what we've been able to

382
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,080
show is that this is partly the result of a circuit, which is partially electrical,

383
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,880
which stores the pattern of what a correct Plenarian is supposed to look like. And we can now see this

384
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,840
pattern, we can rewrite it, we can alter it so that now the pattern memory says two heads instead

385
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,000
of one. And then that's exactly what sells Bill, Bill, two-headed flatworms.

386
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,160
I don't want to go over this too quickly because I know you do this all the time,

387
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:01,280
but this is just amazing to the rest of us. You can chop off the tail and head of this little worm

388
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,560
and train it to grow back two heads or two tails instead of one head and one tail.

389
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:11,040
That's correct. Yeah, it's an amazing thing. So Plenaria, basically, I think every important

390
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,280
question of life is found somewhere in Plenarian biology, I think you could say. They're an amazing

391
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,480
creature. First of all, they're flatworms, not roundworms, so they are bilaterians,

392
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,800
meaning they are similar to our ancestors. They have a true brain. Most of the same neurotransmitters

393
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,640
that you and I have, they're smart, they can learn, but they have this incredible property.

394
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,400
You can chop them into pieces. The record, I think, is something like 275. And every piece

395
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,440
will regenerate exactly what's missing, no more, no less, and make a perfect, tiny little worm.

396
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,400
Now, they are so regenerative that they're immortal. They don't age. There's no such thing as an old

397
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,600
Plenarian, which means, first of all, that the worms that we have in our lab are in a direct

398
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,560
physical continuity with worms that were here half a billion years ago, and that's mind-boggling

399
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,080
to think about. And also, it's telling us that, in fact, it is possible to be a complex organism

400
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:11,360
with a good brain and so on, and never die. These ideas of thermodynamic limits on aging and so on,

401
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,960
I don't think are correct. But anyway, so that's what the animal does normally. Now,

402
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:23,200
of course, lots of interesting work has been done on how this works. They have a bunch of stem cells

403
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,360
that lots of work has been done on the molecular and genetic networks that specify different

404
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,600
cell types out of these stem cells. But what's really important to understand is the stem cells

405
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,760
produce the building blocks, all the different things that you need to make a Plenarian,

406
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,160
but you still have to decide how to arrange all this stuff. And all of it can be arranged in many

407
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:51,440
different configurations. Now, people learned long ago to manipulate the lower levels of the system,

408
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,680
meaning to get in there and take some of the genes that are required for making heads and tails,

409
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:02,000
regulate their expression, and get one-headed or two-headed worms. We found something that's,

410
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,640
I think, it takes us to the next level, which is two things. First of all, that you can actually,

411
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:16,640
that there is a real-time bioelectrical circuit that stores an active pattern, which you can see

412
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,080
using special dyes that reveal electrical states and microscopy. You can actually see this

413
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,920
this anatomical pattern towards which the thing is going to build.

414
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,880
And so that's the first thing. The second thing is that you can, by turning on and off

415
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,080
these ion channels, which are these little protein batteries that exist in cell membranes,

416
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,880
by turning these things on and off, you can manipulate that circuit and get pieces to build,

417
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,920
let's say, a two-headed or a no-headed animal. And one of the most amazing things about it

418
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,840
is that if you then, if you have a two-headed animal and you recut that animal in plain water,

419
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,640
so no more manipulation, no more doing anything to the ion channels, you will once again get

420
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,360
a two-headed worm. Now, this is worth pausing here because what has not been done in this case

421
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:09,040
is to manipulate the genome. The genome has a wild-type sequence. You've not altered the genetics

422
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:15,280
at all. This is a great example and maybe the best example of the separation of data from machine

423
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,600
in this case because the cells are standard planarian cells. There's nothing wrong with

424
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:25,760
them that you would identify on genomic sequencing. And they are happy to build whatever it is that

425
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,280
is specified in this large-scale pattern memory that is kept by the tissue electric circuit. And

426
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,520
if the electric circuit has two heads, that is, in fact, what they will build. And so this goes

427
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,160
on in perpetuity. As far as we can tell, you can keep doing this. We now know how to set it back

428
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,640
from two-headed to one-headed. Again, there's a change in the electrical state that you can make.

429
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,960
And so this goes back to your question about downward causation because what you can say is,

430
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,400
well, it makes a second head. What happened to the molecular pathways? Well, of course,

431
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,840
the molecular pathways that are required to build a head are all activated on the posterior side

432
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:07,280
of the animal. So you still need all... It's not like the Bioelectricity Act by itself. You still

433
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:14,080
need all the building blocks. The hardware still has to make all the cells that create the brain

434
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:20,400
tissue and eyes and all of that. But the decision, the early-on decision of what this tissue level

435
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,240
agent is going to build, is made at this higher level, which then inevitably filters down to the

436
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,920
lower level. So you can track that lower level. You can look at the gene expression. You will see

437
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,400
nothing but chemistry. There's no magic. You will see every gene being triggered by some other gene

438
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:43,120
or something like that. But if you ask the practical question of what is the best way to

439
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:48,000
make a two-headed worm, you've got a couple options. You can try to manipulate these lower level

440
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:57,680
activities. And it's quite hard. Or you can go up to the master regulator level and you can just

441
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,280
interact. And this happens roughly between three and six hours after cutting. All the transcriptional

442
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,320
changes happen in the next 24 hours. The first thing after amputation, that circuit acts between

443
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:14,240
three and six hours. And it triggers both scaling so that the heads are correctly scaled with respect

444
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,520
to the rest of the worm and the identity of the tissue. So head versus tail. All of that stuff

445
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:26,720
is downstream. So I do think from that perspective, I do think there's a kind of downward causation

446
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,600
regardless of some of the philosophical aspects in the sense that you simply ask what's the best

447
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,480
control knob. And in some cases, it will not be by electricity. And in many cases, we've seen that

448
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,200
that's exactly where the decisions are made. And I think that's not surprising. Looking at the way

449
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:47,680
the brain works, brains are basically an elaboration of the system that evolution found probably around

450
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,800
the time of bacterial biofilms, actually. Oh, you'll have to say more about that. But

451
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,240
in what sense, how are you relating bacterial biofilms to brains?

452
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:06,240
Sure. So actually, there's a lot of work on some of the early work on ion channels,

453
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:13,440
actually, was done in bacteria. It was known from decades ago that bacteria can be electrically

454
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:20,560
active. And there was some recently some really nice work from UCLA, where there's a set of papers

455
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:29,520
by Arthur Prindle and colleagues who have shown that bacterial biofilms drive a lot of very brain

456
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,040
like electrical dynamics. So individual individual bacteria coordinate with each other. And what you

457
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:42,000
get are waves, potassium waves that in many ways are similar to what happens in brains. And I see,

458
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,840
right. And basically bacterial biofilms, you know, they're kind of proto body, right? They're

459
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,800
individual organisms learning to live with each other in a way to make a larger agent that can

460
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,760
do things that individual agents can't. Good. That is actually very helpful. And I'm sure that's

461
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,000
worth the whole podcast by itself. But I do want to get back to the planarian there because I am

462
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,360
not personally an expert on the planarian reproductive strategy. So I don't even know

463
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:13,280
do they lay eggs or give birth. But how exactly is the information about one headed versus two

464
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:21,120
headed planarian set down traveling down to future generations? Like where in the organism is it?

465
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,640
Yeah. Yeah. So so this is a great question. A couple of things. Let's let's start back with

466
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:32,240
the question of how they normally reproduce. So which which already tells us that there's a

467
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:38,320
lot we don't know. So so planaria is some at least the species that we work with, they are capable

468
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:43,680
of laying eggs and producing sperm and sexual reproduction. But mostly what they do is fission.

469
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,400
So when they feel happy or in fact, when they're stressed, either either one leads to the same

470
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,320
outcome. Oddly enough, they are good model organisms for human beings too. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

471
00:44:54,320 --> 00:45:00,880
There are lots of lots of I mean, people use them actually for to study addiction to drug

472
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,880
addiction. And you know, they get addicted to all the same stuff that we do and so on.

473
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,560
So when you know, when they want to fission, the back end grabs on to the dish, the front end

474
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,960
keeps going and they tear themselves in the middle and then they regenerate. Now you've got two worms.

475
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,840
So that's their normal reproductive cycle. Now, already before we even get to the two headed

476
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,600
stuff, there's something really interesting here, which is that you and I and most animals, when

477
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:30,480
we reproduce, our children do not inherit the mutations that happen to us during our lifetime.

478
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,080
So if you get a change of DNA in your arm, your kids don't get that. So that is, that's really

479
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:42,480
important. And but the thing with planaria, because each piece rebuilds a new body out of

480
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,960
the cells that were in that piece, this means that unlike the rest of us, they practice somatic

481
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,000
inheritance. They do inherit every mutation that doesn't kill the neoblast, the stem cell, they

482
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,160
got it. And those things proliferate. So for, let's say 400 million years, they've been accumulating

483
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,120
mutations. And you can see this in their genomes are an incredible mess. We don't even have a proper

484
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:09,280
genomic assembly for the kinds of worms that we work with. They are mix deployed, meaning every cell

485
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,640
might have a different number of chromosomes. So you don't even really know what you're sequencing

486
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:18,000
when you sequence these things. The genome is an incredible mess. And yet, the regeneration,

487
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,520
the anatomy is rock solid 100% of the time you cut that thing into pieces, you get normal worms.

488
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,760
So this is already telling us that there's some very interesting room between the genetics and

489
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:33,200
the anatomy that we don't understand because the genetics could be very messy and the anatomy is

490
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:39,680
rock solid. So now let's get to your next question, which is the two heads. So if you have a two-headed

491
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:49,600
worm, they can reproduce by fissioning. When that happens, generally speaking, one of the pieces

492
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:56,320
will end up two-headed and one of the pieces will end up one-headed. So you can imagine a scenario

493
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:02,640
where we take some two-headed worms and we throw them in the Charles River here in Boston and sort

494
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,280
of at some point, some scientists in the future come along and they scoop up some samples and they

495
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,280
find some one-headed forms and some two-headed forms and they say, ah, cool, a speciation event.

496
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,440
Let's sequence the genomes and see where that happened, right? And they're not going to find

497
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,120
anything. And the reason is precisely your question, where does the information live?

498
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:27,440
So we have found, so far, we've found two places where that information lives. In the strict two-headed,

499
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,120
there's actually another part of this that I hadn't mentioned yet, which is called cryptic

500
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:36,080
worms, which I'll talk about in a minute. In the two-headed worms, one of the things that happens

501
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:44,800
is the molecular structure of the cytoskeleton, the thing that allows cells, especially neurons,

502
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:54,480
but all kinds of cells, to know a direction from basal to apicalers and so on. This cytoskeleton

503
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:01,360
is actually carrying a lot of the information. And it goes back to a really interesting

504
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,760
experiment, which is classical epigenetics. So now, right now, if you say epigenetics,

505
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,000
people normally think about chromatin modifications, all the things that can happen to the genome

506
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,960
to mark it for future generations. There's an older example, which is that if you take

507
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:22,240
a single cell organism, like a paramecium, they have these little hairs that point a particular

508
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,320
way, and they swim, they wave the little cilia, and they swim. So what somebody did was they took

509
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,400
a glass needle, and this is an amazing experiment because these things are tiny. They took a glass

510
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,080
needle and they cut a little square in the surface of the animal. I don't actually think it was a

511
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,120
paramecium, but it was a related thing. And they rotated it 180 degrees and they put it back. This

512
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:48,080
is doing this to a single cell, mind you, with my hand. Under the microscope. And so what they

513
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:54,720
found is that these things give rise to a line of animals that all have a little square looking

514
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:00,400
the wrong way. And this was incredible. This was the first real example of epigenetics because,

515
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,080
of course, they had a wild type genome. And in fact, there's a beautiful line in one of the

516
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:09,120
papers that says these things are always on the verge of starvation because they're trying to

517
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:14,240
use the little cilia to waft food into their mouths. And there's a little square that's, of

518
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,240
course, kicking the food out the wrong way so they're never quite good. And he says they're

519
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,200
always on the verge of starvation and their normal genome is powerless to help them. And this is a

520
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,480
very powerful point because, yes, the genome has done everything correctly. All the proteins have

521
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,680
been made. They have all of the proteins that it takes to make a normal structure. But the reason

522
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,720
these guys aren't normal is because the information is being templated off of the mother cell. So when

523
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:44,400
the mother cell makes a daughter cell, it templates that abnormal structure of the cytoskeleton,

524
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:51,760
you know, almost like a crystal templating, it templates it and creates an offspring with

525
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:58,320
the same structure. So there's something like that in Plenaria where actually that subcellular

526
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:04,320
polarity is being scaled up from individual cells to the whole organism. And then, of course,

527
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,920
there's the one that I think is also extremely interesting, which is the bioelectric circuit.

528
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:16,880
So one of the things that we can see is that the way that the ion channels in Plenaria have been

529
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,760
shaped by evolution is that they make a circuit that has memory. And now engineers, of course,

530
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:27,040
are pretty familiar with this. It's a really convenient way to make memory circuits. As long

531
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,920
as you keep powering them, you can have flip flops and things like this where you make a transient

532
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,000
electrical change. And the circuit keeps that change until you come back and reset it. So it's

533
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,200
sort of like like like volatile RAM, so to speak. So so this electrical circuit, there's a there's

534
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,680
another type of worm that we can make, which is really interesting. We call them cryptic worms.

535
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:52,000
And the thing with cryptic worms is that they they every time you cut them, they toss a coin,

536
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
and they make a more or less random, although it's a weighted it's a biased coin, but it's more or

537
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,600
less a random decision as to whether they're going to make one heads or not. And if they

538
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,240
don't, what results is again, a cryptic worm. And if they do, you get a two headed worm that is

539
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,440
forever a two headed worm. These cryptic worms, the as far as we can tell, all the molecular

540
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:18,000
aspects are normal. But what's abnormal is the bio electric pattern that is stored by their real

541
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,600
time electric circuit. And it is this pattern that makes them be this it makes them have this

542
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:28,240
destabilized anatomy where they're not quite sure if they should be one headed or two headed.

543
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,640
And you can you can manipulate that electrical pattern and convert them back into one headed

544
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,760
worms or into two headed worms or whatever. One of the interesting there's a there's a paper that

545
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:43,920
from our lab that's about to about to come out in a few weeks, that looks at this as as as a as a

546
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,760
by stable perception problem in the nervous system. So you know, when you look at these things that

547
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,840
are like the rabbit duck illusion, right, or the necker cube or these kinds of things. Yeah. So

548
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,080
so there's a there's this there's this ability of nervous systems to exist in almost the almost

549
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,400
superposition of states where you're and this is very much top down control, right, because it's

550
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,760
driven in both cases, the the photons, the pattern of photons hitting your retina is exactly the same.

551
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,120
The reason that you keep flipping from one to the other is because you have expectations

552
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,880
in the firstonian sense, right, you think it's got to be a cube and if it's always got to be

553
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,560
facing in or out. Yeah. So so that kind of top down control in the nervous system is very similar

554
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:23,680
to what happens in these electrical circuits in non neural cells, where there can be this this

555
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,600
by stability where there's kind of two ways to interpret this electrical information. And that's

556
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:33,520
what that's what the cells do. So so I think I think and all of that is not to say that we've

557
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:38,880
plumbed the depths of this. There's absolutely more open questions than there are answers. So there

558
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,320
may be other pieces to this puzzle. But I feel very strongly that the question of where is this

559
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:52,480
information is in part, it's kept as electrical memory in the electrical circuit. And partially

560
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:58,640
it's in the in the in the in the sub cellular architecture of the cells that are copying

561
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,200
previous architectures when they when they form. And we should, you know, you might also be interested

562
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,920
in the the shifting of worm heads to other species, because you can do that too. It's not,

563
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,960
you know, making multiple, you know, making multiple heads of the same species is one thing.

564
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:19,040
But you can actually, again, by by interfering in the normal electrical electric in the normal

565
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,320
electrical circuit, you can get these cells to build heads that belong to other species of

566
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:31,120
planaria 150 million years distant with with no genetic change at all. And to go back to put

567
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:36,800
this in the context of the tadpoles whose faces we rearranged, and they figured out how to get

568
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:43,120
them back. The idea there is a goal in mind as to what the ultimate face you want is.

569
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,240
Combining that with what we've just been talking about with the paramisi in the planaria,

570
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:54,400
that means that wherever this goal is, that's not all by itself encoded in the genome either,

571
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,880
right? It's encoded a little bit more globally. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, it is absolutely not

572
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,320
directly in the genome. I think I think again, the way to think about this is is good. You know,

573
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,360
our concept of software running on electrical devices, I think is actually really good to

574
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:16,560
to get us an intuitive understanding of this. I think what the genome does is encode a system

575
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,480
that when you turn on the juice, it encodes a set of electrical, and of course, there's also

576
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,040
biomechanics and biochemical signals that are important. But when you turn on the juice,

577
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:30,800
it reliably executes a pattern of activity. There's symmetry breaking, there's amplification,

578
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,720
there's robustness, meaning if you have some extra potassium in the in the pond that you're

579
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,680
growing in, it's not going to destabilize the whole thing. There are all these important

580
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:43,440
properties that allow you to spontaneously form a pattern of activity in this electric circuit.

581
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,120
It's like, you know, you got a bag of parts that were specified for you, you connect them all

582
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:51,680
together, you turn on the juice, and it does something. And the parts were fine tuned over

583
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:58,000
eons to make sure that what it does by default is is reliable and adaptive and useful. But then

584
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,440
you find an amazing thing, which is that there's actually that the thing's actually reprogrammable

585
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:11,360
that while it does have a default mode of behavior that would that it will execute every single time,

586
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:17,840
there is in fact a set of stimuli or experiences that you can give it without going in and having

587
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:24,800
to rewire it, that will push it into a different mode. In particular, what it will do is what you

588
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:31,920
can do is you can rewrite the part of that electric circuit that serves as your homeostatic

589
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:37,280
set point. It's like, you know, if you had a thermostat, there has to be some physical

590
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,080
structure that encodes the range that this thing is trying to maintain, and you can just go change

591
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:46,240
that, you don't need to, you know, rebuild your thermostat, you can you can change the set point.

592
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:53,600
So it looks like in many cases, living things have a set point. Now, this is much more complex

593
00:55:53,600 --> 00:56:00,320
than let's say pH or some sort of metabolic level, these are anatomical set points that are that are

594
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:05,840
rough, not to the cell scale, obviously, but a rough description of what the thing should look like.

595
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:11,840
And these set points are in many ways, we call them target morphologies, it's the pattern to

596
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,320
which the cells are trying to build and it's the pattern that once they achieve it, then they stop.

597
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,000
These things are rewritable. And once you rewrite them, the cells will build something different.

598
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,240
And what we don't know, of course, is the limitations. We don't know if cells are a

599
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:32,240
universal constructor in the sense that can you make absolutely anything or are there constraints?

600
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:37,760
People talk about developmental constraints. I'm not 100% sure what that really is, or if there are

601
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,440
any constraints, in the sense that if we knew, I think we just don't know the code enough. If we

602
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:52,000
understood how to reprogram correctly these target patterns, I think we would be looking at something

603
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,520
like an anatomical compiler. This is like our vision when I talk about what's the end game for our

604
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:02,000
group, when can you give up and go home? Because everything's done. I think what we're looking

605
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,720
at is something like an anatomical compiler that you sit down, much like computer aided drawing,

606
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:13,440
you basically just draw a picture of a schematic of the animal or plant that you want. And if we

607
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,400
knew what we were doing, the system would decompose that into a set of stimuli that you would give

608
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,240
cells to get them to build that particular thing. Not because you're going to micromanage,

609
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:28,960
you're not going to 3D print individual stem cell derivatives, but you're going to rewrite the

610
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,520
goal state that the cells are accessing the cell collective. I should be more precise. The cell

611
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:39,840
collective is accessing to know what to build and when to stop. The idea that there's all these

612
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,760
different levels that are interacting with each other is a very powerful one. And not just because

613
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,120
there are levels with different levels of coarse graining, if you want, but that there are

614
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:56,080
right levels in some sense. This is what you sort of got to earlier. There are ways of describing

615
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:01,280
these complex systems that just give you an enormously more powerful handle on what they're

616
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,400
going to do. And one of the issues that you've talked about, it's even come up a little bit

617
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,560
in what we've already said about the planaria and the biofilms with the bacteria, which is

618
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,960
at what point do a bunch of either cells or molecules or whatever constitute an organism?

619
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:22,240
I mean, at what point are they a self that you can pinpoint? That's a level of analysis.

620
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,120
I can talk about the morphology and the hopes and dreams of that little bugger right there.

621
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:35,280
Yeah, I think that's a great question. And there's two aspects to this, I think,

622
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:42,400
that we at least that we focused on. One of the aspects is how cells come into being. And this

623
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,280
is the scale up of, and I think this is both philosophically and empirically, this is one

624
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,720
of the most fascinating problems in science, is the fact that all cognitive agents are made of

625
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:58,960
parts. There's no such thing as a sort of this monadic kind of diamond like cognitive thing

626
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:05,280
that's not divisible. We are a bag of cells in between our ears. And when people say, oh,

627
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:11,920
what are you talking about? This collection of cells has memory and goals. So, well,

628
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,520
you have memory and goals, right? And they say, yes, I certainly do. And I say, well, very good,

629
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:21,840
because you're a collection of cells. And so the question isn't whether cells can have goals and

630
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:26,960
hopes and dreams, that question has been settled, at least if for no one else but for yourself.

631
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,880
This is other mind's problem, maybe, but at least for yourself, you know, that's the case.

632
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,760
And so now the only remaining question is the scaling. How do you scale up from a collection

633
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:43,680
of competent agents to some sort of unified single agent that has that has a coherent

634
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:49,040
integrated cells that is larger than these others, right? So I actually have a model of this,

635
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,360
of how this works, although much work remains to be done. But I have a beginning model of this

636
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:00,560
that has to do with these really important elements called gap junctions. So these are

637
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:05,920
things that, these are proto synapses. This is what synapses were before they became modern

638
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:11,760
synapses. They're basically, think about two, they're little proteins that hang out in the cell

639
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,000
surface that can dock with each other. And you can think about like two submarine hatches underwater,

640
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,240
sort of docking and opening up a path that you can go from cell to cell. So the interesting thing

641
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:28,240
about that is that, and these are critical for multi-cellularity. They are an important part

642
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:34,240
of electric circuits because they are themselves voltage gated. So not only does electrical potential

643
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,640
propagate through these open gap junctions, but it actually controls whether they're open or closed.

644
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:45,280
So that means that this is a voltage gated current conductance, which a.k.a. a transistor.

645
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,960
And we know that once you have a transistor, you can make almost anything, you can make logicates

646
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,840
and so on. It gives them memory historicity and so on. So what's really neat about these things,

647
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:58,400
if you imagine two individual cells coming together and forming this kind of gap junction,

648
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,760
unlike every other kind of cell signaling. So cells produce all kinds of molecules in their

649
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,840
environment. They secrete all kinds of molecules. And if you're a cell in the environment,

650
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:12,800
you can receive those molecules. And then you know perfectly well that they're not yours. You

651
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:18,160
know perfectly that they originate from the outside. You can choose to interpret them or you can think

652
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:23,760
that they are false. You know that somebody's taking advantage of you or cooperating or competing

653
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:29,120
or whatever. But something very different happens when you connect with these electrical synapses.

654
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:34,400
When you connect with these gap junctions, both cells get access to each other's internal

655
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:40,960
milieu. This means that things that happen to one of the cells very rapidly propagate to the other

656
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:49,040
cell. And all the metadata as far as what the originator of that information is is stripped.

657
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,760
So if something happens to cell A and there's a calcium flux and that calcium flux propagates to

658
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:59,280
cell B, it doesn't you know, all cell B sees is this flux. It doesn't know whether what triggered

659
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:05,440
it happened to it or to its partner. This has a couple of really critical implications. The first

660
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:10,000
is that it makes lying or cheating almost impossible. Because anything you do right,

661
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,120
anything you do to your neighbor is immediately going to come back to you. So if you try to poison

662
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:22,080
your neighbor in some sort of you know competition, you're going to get it too. And what it also means

663
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:28,800
is that it becomes really difficult to maintain ownership of individual thought. So if what you

664
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,960
have are a bunch of information molecules that were a track record of things that happened to you.

665
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,720
And you know, we don't have to think about complex thinking here. We can just say

666
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,800
there are events that happen that trigger molecular reactions and these molecular reactions are

667
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:47,040
a record that you use to adjust future behaviors in all cells to this. So now you're sharing those

668
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:51,920
molecules and you can no longer tell which are true memories that you accumulated, and which

669
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,720
are false memories that are incepted into your cognitive structure by the fact that they floated

670
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:02,560
in from your neighbor. So now this erases it's like an amazing form of telepathy, so to speak,

671
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:10,000
because it merges the minds of these two cells into a group agent where they literally cannot tell

672
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,200
what belongs to what. And in that case, that is the origin of this I would claim that is the

673
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:21,200
origin of a simple compound self. It's because you're erasing it's kind of cool. I mean, I think

674
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:26,160
and again, this is far outside my field, but I think there's a lot of important quantum computation

675
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,400
work as far as erasures, right? The fact that erasing information is critical. I think this

676
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:37,440
is an example of that erasing this metadata that, hey, here's a memory that belongs to this

677
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:44,320
unit over here. All of that is gone and that helps create a kind of larger mind, so to speak. And

678
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:50,400
of course, this is a proto cognitive sort of thing, but you can imagine the scaling larger and larger

679
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:56,560
to allow this agent now to have bigger horizons of those goals that I mentioned so that you can now

680
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:02,960
contemplate much, much, much bigger things in both space. And you have the computational machinery

681
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:09,200
to remember further back in time and to anticipate further into the future. Now, this kind of thing

682
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:15,520
has a has a cool implication, which is that he would think that okay, if this is the origin of

683
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,720
the self, then you have two questions. Number one is can it break down and what the how would it

684
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:27,760
break down? And what you can imagine is imagine that you're part of this sensation, you're connected

685
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,480
to a bunch of neighbors, you're this multicellular kind of creature. And for whatever reason,

686
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:37,600
your gap junctions get closed, you can no longer hear the electrical signals from your neighbors,

687
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:46,480
you are now sort of isolated from all this, you no longer get the information input, you no longer

688
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,680
get the consequences of things you do directly fed back to you. You could imagine that you would

689
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:57,680
then in a game theory sense, instead of previously where you're sort of forced to cooperate. And

690
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:01,280
by the way, this is very interesting. This is where we're doing now simulations of prisoners

691
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:07,200
dilemma, where the agents instead of just cooperating and defecting, they actually have a new ability

692
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,680
they can merge. And once you merge, what you see is that, right, it's the as to my knowledge,

693
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:16,160
it's the first time that the number of agents in a prisoner's dilemma is not constant, usually

694
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,320
define the agents, and then you see what emerges and there's cooperation, whatever. But what happens

695
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,960
is, if you don't, if you don't fix the number to be a constant, and you let agents merge,

696
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,760
you find out that cooperation doesn't just emerge, it's inevitable, because you can't

697
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:35,840
cheat against yourself, because your yourself is now bigger. So what happens when this breaks down,

698
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:41,600
you can sort of imagine the consequences. And this is precisely what happens in cancer. So in

699
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:46,720
cancer, what they've known since the late 70s, that one of the first steps of carcinogenic

700
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,960
transformation is a closure of the gap junctions. And then it wasn't quite clear why. And I think

701
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:57,760
this is exactly what happens. When you as a cell, which your identity was smeared out all over this

702
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:04,240
tissue, you were part of this larger group cognition, as soon as you are now back, your

703
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,880
computational boundary, that surface from which you're getting signals is now shrunk back down

704
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:14,960
to the level of a single cell, you basically revert to your unicellular ancient past you.

705
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,200
And this has been borne out by transcriptomics studies by Paul Davies group and others,

706
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:27,280
where you now basically treat the rest of the body as just environment. You do what single cells

707
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,360
always do, they go where life is good, they migrate, they proliferate as much as they can.

708
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:37,600
And this is metastasis. And so one way to think about this as a cancer is a breakdown of multi

709
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:42,400
cellularity. And it, in fact, can be caused, it doesn't have to have a genetic component,

710
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,120
it can be caused by purely physiological cause. We've shown that we can make

711
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:52,960
metastatic melanoma in perfectly normal tadpoles by preventing electrical communication briefly.

712
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:58,960
And these cells, this is what happens, the self literally shrinks. So going back to your question

713
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:04,080
of how you get the, when can you talk about cells, I think it has to do with the boundaries of these

714
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:10,320
goals. So that as soon as this cell no longer has a goal of building a proper, you know, liver

715
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:14,640
or kidney or whatever it was doing, all of its goals have now shrunk down to things that a single

716
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:19,200
cell can understand, which is very simple. I'm going to go down, I'm going to go, I'm going to

717
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:24,000
follow some, some gradients to where, where, where food is more plentiful. And I'm going to make as

718
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:30,080
many copies of myself as I possibly can. And this is, this is how cells shrink. So, you know, and

719
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:34,480
of course the implications of that are that you ought to be able to reverse it, which suggests

720
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:39,280
that cancer doesn't just have to be treated by trying to chase down all these irrevocably

721
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,280
broken cells and killing them with some sort of toxin. You might be able to convince them to

722
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:49,200
rejoin the collective. And we've done this in the frog model. We've shown that you can use either

723
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:56,160
optogenetics or drugs or iron channel misexpression to take cells that are expressing really nasty

724
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:02,160
human oncogenes or KRS and things like that. And basically just normalize them and force them

725
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:09,200
artificially to connect back into this, into this group, group agent, and normalize and, and when

726
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:14,640
go back to normal morphogenesis. You must know you're exactly describing the Borg collective

727
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:22,000
from Star Trek, right? I mean, in Star Trek, all these individuals, it's, it's treated as bad

728
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,400
that all these individuals melt into a single collective. But when we, when it's our cells

729
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,360
melting their individuality to make us, we think it's good.

730
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,720
Yeah, yeah, you're absolutely right. And I'm not, I'm not big on, on, on collectivist

731
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:39,040
kinds of things in general. I think that key is, but I think this is telling us something

732
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:44,000
important. I think what it's telling us is that we need to come up with optimal strategies. And

733
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,520
these are the sorts of things I do a lot of work, for example, with Josh Bongard at the University

734
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:54,960
of Vermont, he's a roboticist, computer scientist. We, we want to work on identifying optimal policies

735
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:00,240
that try to get the best of both worlds. Because you see, when you do combine into this,

736
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:04,320
into this collective, there are some good things about it, which is, which are that you achieve

737
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:09,600
higher computational capacity cooperation is goes through the roof, all of that. But of course,

738
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,160
the downside is that this collective agent, the goals of the collective agent might have

739
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:17,520
absolutely nothing to do with the goals of the individual. And so, you know, when, when, when

740
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,840
you lose some skin, you don't worry about it and so on. And so, right. And so, so this is,

741
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:26,880
this is a real problem. And so what we need to do is to figure out now, evolution has, has optimized

742
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,960
this in particular ways. That's not to say that that's necessarily what we want. We need to come

743
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:38,640
up with optimal ways to, to enhance the, the, the, the benefits of this kind of cooperativity,

744
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:43,920
but still retain the multi-scale nature of it. You see, that's the key is you don't want to lose

745
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:49,680
the, the agency of the, of the pieces. You want to retain it while reaping the benefits of some

746
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:54,400
of the larger scale features. And it's hard to say at this point how well that's going to work,

747
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,600
but I think that's a really important thing to work on in the future.

748
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:04,320
Does this whole philosophy help us either philosophically or practically when it comes

749
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:11,360
to our ambitions to go in there and change organisms, not just solve cure diseases, but to

750
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:16,720
make new organisms to do synthetic biology, to create new things from scratch? And vice-versa,

751
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:23,680
does it help us in what we would think of usually as robotics or technology? Can we learn lessons

752
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:28,640
from the biological side of things? Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think absolutely. And there's two ways

753
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,880
to, there's sort of a short-term view and a longer-term view of this. The short-term view is

754
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:39,840
that absolutely. So, so we work very closely with, with roboticists to take deep concepts in

755
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,680
both directions. So, on the one hand, take the things that we've learned from the robustness

756
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:49,200
and intelligence. I mean, the intelligent problem solving of, of these living forms is, is incredibly

757
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:54,880
high. And even, even organisms without brains, you know, this whole focus on, on kind of like

758
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,680
neuromorphic architectures for AI, I think is really a very limiting, limiting way to look at it.

759
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:05,120
And so, so we, we try very hard to export some of these concepts into machine learning, into

760
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:10,240
robotics and, and so on. Multiscale robotics. You know, I gave a talk called, why robots don't get

761
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:15,280
cancer. You know, and this is, right, this is, this is exactly the problem is, is we make devices

762
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:20,800
where the pieces don't have sub-goals. And that's the, the good news is, yes, no, no, no, you're

763
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,320
not going to have a robot where part of it decides to defect and do something different. But on the

764
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:28,320
other hand, the robots aren't very good. They're not, they're not, you know, very, very flexible.

765
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:33,200
So, so part of this, we're trying to export. And then going in the, in the other direction and take

766
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,720
interesting concepts from computer science, from cognitive science

767
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:42,400
into biology to help us understand how this works. I fundamentally think that

768
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,240
computer science and biology are not really different fields. I think we are all studying

769
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:54,480
computation just in different media. And I do think there's a lot of opportunity for, for, for

770
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:58,880
back and forth. But now the other thing that you mentioned is really important, which is the creation

771
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:07,360
of novel, novel systems. We are doing some work on, on synthetic, synthetic living machines and,

772
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:14,400
and creating new, new life forms by basically taking perfectly normal cells and giving them

773
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,880
additional freedom and then, and then some stimulation to, to become other types of organisms.

774
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:26,160
We, I think in our, in our lifetime, I think we are going to be surrounded by, you know,

775
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:32,880
Darwin had this, this phrase, endless forms, most beautiful. We, I mean, I think the reality is going

776
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:39,920
to be a variety of living agents that he couldn't have even conceived of in the sense that the space,

777
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:45,600
and this is something I'm working on now, is to map out at least the axes of this option space of

778
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:52,080
all possible agents. Because what the bioengineering is enabling us to do is to create hybrid,

779
01:12:52,880 --> 01:13:01,520
to create hybrid agents that are in part biological, in part electronic, right? The parts are

780
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:06,240
designed, parts are evolved, the parts that are evolved might have been biologically evolved,

781
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:11,680
or they might have been evolved in a virtual environment using genetic algorithms on the computer.

782
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:20,800
All of these combinations and this, we're going to see everything from household appliances that

783
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:26,000
are run in part by machine learning and part by living, living brains that are, that are, you

784
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,800
know, sort of being controllers for various things that we would like to optimize to, to,

785
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:35,120
to humans and animals that have various implants that make, allow them to control other devices

786
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:40,720
and communicate with each other. These, you know, the space of possible agents and possible bodies

787
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:48,000
is enormous, right? I think that, right, the plasticity of cells and the ability, look, we,

788
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:54,560
we put eyes, eyes on the tails of tadpoles and those animals can see perfectly well, you know,

789
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:01,040
these, the plasticity with which cells can organize into a, into a functional form,

790
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,840
even though it's completely different from their genomic default is, is, is massive.

791
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,680
And there's a few things important about that. One of the things that's important about that

792
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:13,680
is that, and Josh Bongart and I are currently writing a paper on this,

793
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:19,840
it blows up a lot of the vocabulary that we normally use. You know, people argue about

794
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,760
whether, there's a lot of papers arguing that living things are not machines.

795
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:29,200
Well, they're certainly not 18th century machines, right? That's for sure, right? But,

796
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:33,680
but if you look at what machines are now, you know, all of the, all of the kinds of things that

797
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:37,360
people say, well, machines are predictable and they're, and they're made by a human and they're,

798
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:42,720
none of those things are true of machines anymore. And things like, what is a robot?

799
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:47,360
What is a, what, what does it mean to be evolved? What does it mean to be designed? You know,

800
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,560
if you dig into this question of what are we actually doing when we design something and

801
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:55,200
how is that different from testing variants over long times, you know, time span,

802
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:03,600
all of these words like robot, program, machine, all of these things, I think, are operating on

803
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:09,520
categories that are no longer good categories. They served us well in the past when our

804
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:15,840
engineering was, was primitive and we couldn't make these, we couldn't fill in the middle of

805
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:21,200
these continuum between all of these kinds of things, but now we can. And so all of these terms

806
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:27,440
have to, all of these terms have to be redefined to really pick out what's essential about these

807
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:34,400
terms to really, I think, you know, sort of carve a nature up better than, than they used to. And

808
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:40,640
that will, will have massive implications not only for, let's say, regenerative biology and

809
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:45,040
biomedicine and robotics and things like this, but there's, there are ethics issues here too.

810
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:51,600
We have to think very hard about what we owe to different kinds of agents with different kinds

811
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:58,480
of cognitive capacities. And, you know, I've been in a lot of debates with people talking about

812
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:03,760
brain organoids and human brain organoids and what, you know, what human brains are and so on.

813
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:11,760
Because these things are now continua, you know, we could, you could now make a system that's 80%

814
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:17,440
human brain cells, 20% drosophila cells and 10% electronics with machine learning. Is that a human?

815
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:22,640
Is it not? You know, something like, you know, if your neighbor got the brain implant that allowed

816
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:27,920
it to, that allowed him to mentally run a vacuum cleaner, no big deal. We have people with assistive

817
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,400
devices now and wheelchairs and things, right? No problem. And if your other neighbor had a

818
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:38,480
vacuum cleaner that had some human brain cells that were sort of a controller and enabled to get

819
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:43,280
around, also no big deal, still pretty much a vacuum cleaner. So in those cases, you have,

820
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:48,480
you know, a 90-10 split and a 10-90 split and that's easy. But what about the 50-50 split?

821
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:55,520
And so we really have to, I think this idea where we clearly know what a machine is, we clearly

822
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:00,720
know what real preferences are as opposed to just sort of as if, you know, algorithm following by

823
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:07,200
robots, none of these distinctions are as robust as a lot of people think they are. And the implications

824
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:12,400
for ethics are at least as large as they are for biomedicine and robotics.

825
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:19,120
No, I completely agree. And I think that, you know, for example, people have cared a lot about

826
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:24,240
the possibility of uploading our brains onto computers. Whereas I suspect that just like you

827
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:31,600
say, blending the boundary between humans and computers is going to be a much nearer term thing

828
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:36,720
that we're going to have to worry about in this domain. But the stuff you just said brings up,

829
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:41,600
you know, about 12 podcasts worth of topics to discuss. So we're running out of time here.

830
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:46,160
Let me just pick one that I really want to get to before we go, which is you mentioned the idea

831
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:51,280
that robots don't get cancer. And that's very interesting to me because the thing when I have

832
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,800
artificial intelligence discussions, the things that I always want to bring up is that robots

833
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:01,840
don't get bored. You know, there's no sort of motivation or irritability or desire to come

834
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:07,440
back to some homeostasis built in automatically. You can try to build it in, but it's not automatic

835
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:14,400
in an artificial system. And what you've said has given me the initial idea or the additional idea

836
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,640
that maybe the point is not just that robots don't get bored, but that robots are not

837
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:23,840
or the way that we currently make robots, they're not made of pieces that get bored,

838
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:28,960
the get bored, right? I mean, this is the extra little insight that real biological organisms

839
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:34,560
are made of these collections. And the collections, you know, should be thought of in quasi-teleological

840
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,720
ways as well. Absolutely, absolutely. And there's this notion of info taxes, where

841
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:46,480
everything from molecular networks up are in a constant search for information to update their

842
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:51,440
ways of representing themselves and the world in a kind of Fristonian sense.

843
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:57,600
Yeah, I think there is a really interesting question about motivations and the fact that

844
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,320
with any living system, we can tell very quickly how to motivate it. We know what it cares about,

845
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,160
we know what it likes, what it dislikes, because we can train it with positive and

846
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:12,320
negative reinforcement. Maybe these things will be a little harder in the exobiological arena,

847
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:17,040
where we can run across new life forms. But I bet even there, in short order, you can figure out

848
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:21,840
what you could use to train this thing with what it's going to enjoy and what it's going to be

849
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:30,160
about punishment. There have been papers dealing with this issue of motivation in artificial

850
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:34,880
agents. You know, you can have an algorithm that causes this thing to do A or B, but does it really

851
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:41,760
care? You know, does AlphaGo really care that it wins, right? So the problem with this question of

852
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:47,360
does it really care, like a lot of problems, you start to see the limitations of our categories

853
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:55,760
when you think about the chimeric case. So I can take cells out of a brain, an animal brain,

854
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:02,400
and we can connect them in culture to some sort of device that has machine learning or whatever.

855
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:08,880
And now, if those cells had some sort of magic intrinsic caring that enable human brains to

856
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:15,200
care about things, does that now carry over to the machine? Because this new sort of compound

857
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:20,080
organism has some of that. And what is it about? You know, can you take out the human pleasure

858
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:25,360
center and culture it alone in addition? Is it just activated all day long? And if you've got like

859
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:31,840
a little chunk of happiness there in addition, these kinds of things are really important.

860
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:39,680
These chimeric constructions are really important to push us to develop better concepts, because

861
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:45,600
we don't know really what it means to have intrinsic preferences or how they might carry

862
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:50,240
over to hybrid devices. All of that needs a lot of overhaul.

863
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:55,760
Well, I'm looking forward to our brave new cyborg future that you've outlined for us here.

864
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,160
It's certainly, certainly things are changing really, really rapidly and we're not able to

865
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,360
really predict where it's going to go, even though apparently that's what we're supposed

866
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,960
to be doing, having a goal and trying to get there. So, Mike Levine, thanks so much for

867
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:17,680
being on the Mindscape podcast. Thank you very much. Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.
