0	3520	Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.
3520	10400	I bet that most of us out here have had the experience of trying to put together a bookshelf
10400	16960	or something like that from IKEA or from wherever, some somewhat complicated piece of furniture or
16960	22320	something to have around the house for which you get blueprints, instructions, as well as pieces,
22320	27120	the raw materials, right? And so we have a certain paradigm in mind about how something
27120	32160	complicated like a bookshelf comes to be. There's a blueprint, a set of instructions,
32160	37200	there's stuff that we're going to put together, and there's some agent, us, that does that work.
37200	42320	It's very natural then, because we're familiar with that kind of process, to think that something
42320	47360	like that also happens when you put together a living organism, right? When you put together
47360	53600	a person or a whale or a tree, there is some blueprint set of instructions, which presumably
53680	59120	is in the DNA, right, in the genome of the organism. And then there is some agents putting
59120	64800	them together, presumably the proteins that get their information from the DNA via the RNA,
64800	69520	and they go off and they build things, and voila, you get an organism. So it turns out,
69520	75920	it's almost not at all like that pretty much, okay? That's some truth to the idea that there are
75920	82640	instructions or information contained in our DNA that will go into constructing an organism such as
82720	88640	a person. But the actual process by which it happens is much more nuanced, much richer, not quite
88640	94400	that simple paradigm we have in mind of an instruction kit and agent and some raw materials.
94400	99360	And partly that's because, you know, we are not intelligently designed, right? This whole system
99360	107360	that we have in us of DNA, genome, RNA, proteins, the organs that we have, the cells in our body,
107360	113040	this all evolved in a complicated process and whatever kinds of dynamics and process was
113040	118320	important and useful as far as evolution is concerned is what we ended up using, okay? It's
118320	123680	not supposed to be code in a computer where it's carefully commented or anything like that, it's
123680	129280	just what was thrown together and what eventually got used. And as a result of that, biologists
129280	135360	keep finding ways in which the morphology, the shape and the way things are put together in
135360	142640	organisms comes to be in fun and different ways than you might expect from the simple Ikea paradigm.
142640	147840	So our guest today, Michael Levin, is a biologist at Tufts University and it's actually a little
147840	153200	bit difficult to describe what he specializes in because it's kind of many different projects that
153200	160400	are all fascinating to me. But in the overall space of talking about how information and physical
160400	166480	dynamics come together to make organisms and all their different functions and things like that.
166480	171760	Not only does it help us understand the particular features of organisms that we know and love,
171760	178000	but to someone like me who cares about emergence and different levels of description of reality,
178000	184000	it's fascinating because we can start asking questions like, at what point is a decision
184000	188720	being made by an organism or by the processes that are going into making that organism? Is it
188720	193840	anything like a computer? Is there a separation between hardware and software? What is the role
193840	198720	of memory? What is the role of dynamical processes? All these fun questions. So we're going to be
198720	205600	talking about how cells, how information and how organisms all fit together. I'm not sure that I am
205600	210320	capable or qualified to draw a single unified theme from it, but I think you'll find that it's a
210320	214480	fascinating conversation that touches on many kinds of things we've been talking about on
214480	225200	Mindscape for quite a while now. So let's go.
234240	238320	Michael Levin, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. Well, thank you so much. Pleased to be here.
238320	243280	This is an interesting podcast for me to think about organizing and talking about because you
243280	248960	do so many different kinds of things. And I finally hit on a starting point of asking you about
249520	254240	one of the experiments you described in your papers with the Xenopus tadpole. I think that's
254240	260080	how you pronounce it, the Xenopus. You basically, if I understand correctly, you in your lab or
260080	266240	your collaborators rearranged the face of a little baby frog tadpole and it somehow,
266240	270640	nevertheless, grew correctly into the right shape. Is that roughly speaking correct?
271360	276000	Yes, that's correct. And I do think it's a pretty important experiment and it's one that we can
276000	282320	definitely form this conversation around because it illustrates something very important. So it
282320	287760	used to be thought because all tadpoles look the same and all frogs look the same that basically
287760	294320	what the genome could do is somehow encode a hardwired set of movements that would transform
294320	300160	a standard tadpole into a standard frog. So the idea would be that the nostrils, the eyes,
300160	305120	the jaws, all these things have to rearrange themselves to become a frog. And so what we
305120	309920	did was a start out by making something we call Picasso tadpoles where everything is in the wrong
309920	314240	place. So the jaws might be off to one side, the eyes might be on the top of the head or
314240	320240	everything is sort of mixed up and we can talk about how we make those. And then the remarkable
320240	326640	thing is that they largely become normal frogs. So all of these little pieces that make up the
326640	333120	head and the face will move in novel unnatural configurations until they land in the correct
333120	338800	positions to make a frog face. And so what this is telling us is that the genetics in fact gives
338800	344320	us a system that's very good at reducing error. That what it does is continuously work to sort of
344320	348960	reduce the difference, the delta between the configuration you have now and the configuration
348960	355840	that it in some way remembers as a correct frog face and that things stop moving and stop proliferating
355840	360880	when that error is sufficiently small. Yeah, which is a remarkable way of thinking about it
360880	365200	because it's probably not what most people have in mind. Well, I say most people, I mean me,
365200	370240	you know, not being a biologist myself. I mean, I think that we think of what's packed into our
370240	374880	genome as roughly the equivalent of the instructions you get from Ikea or something like that, right?
374880	380080	Here are some building blocks. Here are the steps you have to take in order. And at the end, hopefully
380080	385440	you get the finished product. But so you're saying it's not like that. No, it's absolutely not like
385440	391280	that. And on the one hand, we kind of already know it's not like that because if you actually,
392000	396320	and look, the view that you've described is definitely the kind of the mainstream perception
396320	401200	that everybody has. And I've given talks to nine year olds in middle school and so on. And when I
401200	406160	ask them what determines what comes out of an egg, you know, it can be a bird, a dinosaur, a snake,
406160	409680	you know, what determines the shape of what comes out of an egg, everybody says the genome.
409680	414000	And in a certain sense, that's true. But if you actually look at now that we can read genomes,
414000	418000	if you actually look at what's in the genome, you're not going to find anything in there about
418000	423520	the size, the shape, the type of symmetry of the organism that's going to come out. And what's
423520	430400	important to realize is that we currently do not have the ability to look at a genome and guess
430400	435680	anything about what the shape of the organism is going to be. Now you can cheat and compare it to
435680	440560	the genome of another organism that you do know what it looks like. But this idea that you can
440560	445920	read the genome and sort of understand what the anatomy is going to be is not the case.
445920	451040	And that is because the genome does have a recipe, but it's not a recipe for shape, it's a recipe
451040	458320	for proteins. So what the genome does is prescribe what protein hardware every cell in your body
458320	464160	gets to have. So these are the smallest sorts of building blocks from which cells build various
464160	469760	structures. And so it's sort of like you're not getting the design of the IKEA shelf,
469760	474640	you're getting a description of the metal that goes into the screws and the wood or whatever
474640	479360	it is that goes into the other part. It's a description of a very low level aspect of the
479360	486160	system you're actually interested in. Yeah, and it's what do you say we can't look at the genome
486160	490560	and see what the shape is going to be? Is that our fault? I mean, is it implicit in there,
490560	495840	but there's just a lot of steps? Or is it really that even in principle you couldn't look at the
495840	499680	genome and figure out what the animal is going to be? Well, that's a great question. So let's
499760	507120	think about what we mean by in principle. So if you were to sort of a laplace kind of simulate
507120	513520	all of the micro interactions, then certainly you could. If you take into account the environment,
513520	518560	even things like let's say turtles, which use external temperature to determine the sex of
518560	523920	the offspring, you could figure out what was going to happen. So in a certain molecular sense,
524000	531920	if you were to simply absolutely model the lowest level of physics, yes, it's in there.
531920	536480	But we would like to do something better than that. We would like to understand the encoding.
536480	542720	And from that perspective, it's not our fault in the sense that that's not what's encoded there. So
542720	548000	what's encoded is not the actual anatomical features. What's encoded are the proteins and a
548000	553440	little bit about the order in which some of those proteins will appear as a function of time. So
553440	560000	from that perspective, even though developmental biologists are doing a very nice job trying to
560000	566400	understand how all of these organs come to be, we really need to understand a lot more. And you
566400	572960	can sort of, an example you might think about is the kind of bell curve that you get from dropping
572960	578640	marbles into a Galton board. Where does the shape of that bell curve come from? So in a certain
578640	585760	sense, at a micro level, you could probably calculate it out and predict it maybe if the errors
585760	592160	were small enough. But in a larger sense, that shape is not encoded anywhere in the material of
592160	596880	the marbles or the definition of the board or anything like that. It's because what that device
596880	604240	is doing is harnessing particular laws of physics. And what embryos do and all living structures
604240	608800	do is they harness the laws of physics and the laws of computation. So this is very important.
608800	614880	And so what you get in the genome is the description of a very important and very
614880	620720	interesting machine, which is able to generate and process information exploiting various laws of
620720	626480	physics and computation to make certain outcomes. And what's super cool about it is that these
626480	633200	outcomes are reliable most of the time. So most acorns give you oak trees and most fish eggs
633200	638480	give you a fish. But actually, it's way better than that because it is not only robust to all
638480	642240	kinds of perturbations, but it's actually reprogrammable, which I think is one of the most
642240	648000	exciting aspects of it. I guess it's very hard for us to escape the metaphors that we use to
648000	653440	think about these things, like as if there were blueprints or an instruction manual in the DNA.
653440	660400	But the reality is more, I guess, like you're saying, the DNA makes RNA, the RNA makes proteins,
660400	665440	and the DNA is chosen not because someone wanted to design something, but just because
666160	674160	making these proteins in this right environment gets us the morphology, the shape that is been
674160	679680	selected for by natural selection. Yeah, this is correct. So natural selection, of course,
679680	686960	shapes the proteins that cells will use. I think a really good analogy, and we can come back to
687280	692880	the status of metaphors in this field because I think it's not quite what a lot of people think
692880	699280	it is. But one useful metaphor for this is the distinction between software and hardware.
699280	706640	So if you can imagine that if you had a bunch of electric parts, you could connect them together.
706640	712400	And if they were the right kind of parts, one of the things you would get would be an electric
712400	716560	circuit that might do something. And one of the things that might do if your parts included
716560	722720	transistors is that it might carry out logic functions. And so it might be able to carry out
722720	727120	certain operations that would be logic that from which you could build up all kinds of complex
727120	733600	computations. And so now you could ask where the laws of computation live. That's an interesting
733600	739040	question. Certainly, right? Certainly, you know, the operations of AND gates and NOR gates and
739040	746240	things like this were not in the electric parts that you got a specification to. But what evolution
746240	751520	did was shape the parts. And it shapes the parts in a way that when those parts interact together,
751520	756320	they make a circuit. And the part that we study in my lab is largely the electrical aspect of it,
756320	760880	which is why I keep coming back to these kind of electronics analogies. The amazing thing about
760880	765520	these circuits is that they take advantage of really interesting laws of physics having to do
765520	771280	with electricity and how that propagates. And the laws of computation, which allows cells and
771280	776400	tissues to make decisions and to have memory and things like that. And that's where evolution
776400	784080	really shines is to exploit these laws of physics. Right. But I guess what I'm trying to
784800	791600	understand better is this idea that there's no top down directing of what's going on in the
791600	798240	individual cells. I mean, the cells that make up my liver and my brain have the same DNA in them.
798240	804240	And they're just doing their production of proteins. And it sort of all fits together at
804240	809120	the end of the day. And it's not that anyone wrote software to do that, right? It's just that
810240	813440	the DNA that makes that happen is the one that gets passed on.
813440	819040	Well, I'll say two things about that. Certainly, no one wrote the software in the sense of some
819040	828880	sort of designer. So that's for sure. But I will say that this issue of top down control is tricky.
828880	833600	And what I'm about to say is probably not the mainstream sort of story of developmental
833600	840800	biology that you'll get from a textbook. But this is how I see it. If you look at it, it's
840800	846240	a multi-scale problem. So if you look at it from the scale of individual cells or molecules,
846320	853280	then that's basically correct. They are simply following sort of local rules about what they're
853280	859840	going to do. But I think the evidence is pretty good now that there is a larger level of organization
859840	864800	that you can look at. And this larger level of organizations at the tissue and organ level
864800	871440	is performing some interesting computations that deforms the possible action space for the subunits.
871440	879360	So what that means is that it basically alters the space of what's possible for the cells and
879360	885680	the molecular networks to do so that by simply following very mechanical rules, sort of minimization
885680	894160	of free energy and things like this, they end up doing things that are in line with a global
894160	901600	body plan. So you can look at things that tissues and organ level structures are doing
901600	906240	that are very large-scale computations and decision-making about things like, hey,
906240	911680	is our face patterned correctly? Do we have the right number of fingers? Are the limbs long enough?
911680	916560	And the outcome of those computations are instructions to individual cells to either
916560	920720	proliferate or turn on certain genes or turn off certain genes. And at that point,
920720	926160	the cells are just doing what the chemistry sort of suggests in the sense that there isn't
926160	930720	any magic there. But if you look at the level above, what's happening is that all of those
930720	937280	low-level reactions are being harnessed towards a higher-level goal that none of the individual
937280	942640	cells are capable of perceiving. So at the single cell level, there's no such thing as an arm or an
942640	949840	eye or anything like that. No single cell can perceive that. But the group agent, and so I
949840	955200	think fundamentally this is a problem of swarm intelligence and group cognition. The group agent
955200	962000	has very sort of rough memories of what the correct pattern should be, and it has the ability to make
962000	966720	decisions about whether or not the current state is close enough to the target state,
966720	972960	and if not adjust behaviors. So I think from that perspective, there is a bit of top-down control,
972960	976160	and we can talk about some of our worm experiments that tend to show this,
977120	981920	that is not in the sense of some sort of rational designer that writes software,
981920	988080	but in the cybernetic sense where there are systems that reduce error from a stored set point.
988080	993200	And so as long as they can remember what that set point is, they can then have this kind of
993200	1000080	homeostatic cycle that harnesses the parts of the machine towards the goal, which is again,
1000080	1005200	not something magical, but is a representative target state towards which the whole system tries
1005200	1010800	to get to. There are times when we have a long stretch of time ahead of us where we're doing
1010800	1015760	something, but our attention is not completely absorbed. That's when Audible.com and their
1015760	1020480	audiobook selections can come to your rescue. I know that I've driven across the country several

1032160	1036640	little bit more modern, my own books are on Audible.com. I was the one who read Something

1081920	1086960	the shape that it wants, that has encoded in it, the shape that it wants its body and
1086960	1094720	its face to have? And then the large scale, whatever shape it currently has, reacts back
1094720	1100080	against that genome to sort of say, well, what do we do next to move us closer to that goal?
1100080	1105520	Is that the right way of thinking about it? That's close. I would say what the genome encodes
1105520	1111040	is a bunch of parts that when implemented in parallel, it makes a piece of hardware that
1111040	1117760	has a very reliable default behavior. That default behavior is a set of biochemical,
1117760	1126160	biomechanical and bioelectrical circuits that if nothing weird happens to them by their normal
1126160	1131200	behavior in their normal environment, they will generate a set of patterns that give rise to a
1131200	1137200	standard frog. And so the real outcome, if you ask the question of where does a frog face come from,
1137200	1144080	it's a sort of interplay of the constraints imposed by the genetics which specifies the machine
1144080	1149520	and the laws of physics and computation which exist around it. Now, there's an additional
1149520	1154880	factor as it turns out that this machine has some really interesting properties. It isn't,
1154880	1159840	evolution apparently doesn't just favor machines that only have one outcome,
1159840	1167120	but they favor, at least in many cases, it favors machines with a particular capability which is
1168160	1173920	a separation of hardware from software. What I mean is it's able to represent
1173920	1178960	different possible set points and what the cells know how to do really well is to build
1178960	1183360	towards the set point. And if the set point changes, you don't have to rewire the cells.
1183360	1187600	I mean, that's a really interesting, that reprogrammability is a really powerful
1187600	1191440	aspect of all this. I guess this is what I'm learning, not just from this conversation,
1191440	1196320	but from other podcast interviews I did with Carl Friston, for example, with his
1197040	1202240	free energy principle. I'll make a grandiose claim and then you can fact-check me here.
1202240	1209600	In many ways, the way that biological organisms work, either in sort of day-to-day dynamics or
1209600	1216800	evolution or development of the organism, is not this sort of Laplacian idea that you give me
1216800	1222320	exactly the state right now and I will tell you what direction to move in. It's this almost
1222320	1226960	teleological way of thinking about things. Just had David Hague on the podcast and he
1226960	1232400	wants to let us talk in teleological terms. It's like, rather than saying, if this, then that,
1232400	1237280	if this is where we are now, here's where we should go, it's like, well, here's where we want to get
1237280	1243600	to, figure out a way to get there. Yes, I think that's absolutely correct. I think
1243600	1251680	biology has been trapped in this teleophobia, which is doing us a great disservice. I think
1251680	1257920	it's completely, not only fine, but absolutely necessary to talk about those kinds of things.
1258640	1265440	I think that's exactly what biological systems do and we can talk about how I think this aspect
1265440	1271920	of goal-directedness, this multi-scale goal-directedness, is crucial for evolution. I think it's what
1271920	1281600	makes evolution work. It's what makes for much greater evolvability. I'm a big fan of Friston's
1281600	1286880	work. We've used it in our own research. I think it's absolutely correct in that not only do living
1286880	1292160	things have to predict their environment, but they actually have to predict themselves. Living
1292160	1300480	things are a patchwork at different scales of systems that cooperate and compete with each
1300480	1305120	other. Part of all of that is being able to guess what's going to happen next and having a
1305120	1310160	preference about what you'd like to have happen next. Everything is working towards minimizing
1310160	1315920	that delta from what it expects and what's actually going to happen. This is critical for
1316880	1322320	evolvability. I think those kinds of, what's important about that that teleology isn't simply
1322320	1327520	that we allow it or disallow it, but I think we need to move it from a philosophical problem,
1327520	1332640	which a lot of people have argued in a vacuum about whether it is or is not okay to talk this way
1332640	1338640	or whether all models in biology should be framed in terms of biochemistry and molecules and not
1338640	1344560	goals and things like this. I think it's an empirical. It's a very practical problem. The
1344560	1349520	question, it's a little like Dan Dennett's intentional stance, where it's very simple.
1349520	1356400	You just say, what level of intentionality do I ascribe to my system that best gets me
1356400	1362640	to new prediction and control? Sometimes you'll err on the side of attributing too much agency and
1362640	1370160	it's wasted and you can do better with a simpler model. Sometimes you're applying simple laws to
1370160	1376080	systems that internally have a very rich protocognitive structure that should be much better
1376080	1382400	off taking advantage of. I've argued that for regenerative medicine and just in our lab and
1382400	1387680	others, it's driven a ton of work to novel experiments that otherwise would not have been done
1388240	1392800	and to actually ask, what does the system know? What does it expect? What are the preferences?
1392800	1396640	What goals is it trying to achieve? This is on all scales of organization.
1398000	1403600	You and I are probably familiar with the distinction between in physics Newtonian mechanics
1403600	1407760	versus the principle of least action. I noticed that the principle of least action is actually
1407840	1414240	quoted on your web page. It's interesting because it's two different ways of conceptualizing
1414800	1419280	exactly the same problem and getting exactly the same answer, but from very different languages.
1419280	1423280	So maybe for the people out there who don't hang out on the wrong street corners and hear
1423280	1426880	about the principle of least action, why don't you tell us how physicists think about that?
1426880	1429840	Because it's clearly related to what you're saying about biology.
1430720	1436560	Well, I'm probably going to make a massive fool of myself here because I'm not a physicist.
1437200	1441280	I'm sure you are a much better place to give a proper definition of it.
1441280	1448720	But what I understand is that there are lots of physical systems and probably all of them
1448720	1452800	where one of the things you can do, so let's say trying to understand how light is going to
1452800	1458800	propagate through a bunch of lenses stacked one after the other things like that, you could go
1458800	1464400	after the micro details and try to use Maxwell's equations and things like this to really model
1464720	1468080	every piece of it and eventually you'll crank through and you'll get the answer.
1468800	1474320	Apparently, it turns out that you could get the exact same answer with a lot less effort if you
1474320	1478880	simply make an assumption that what the light wants to do is to minimize the effort, so to speak,
1478880	1483920	or the action that it will take to get there. That's a rough, that's how I understand these
1483920	1491920	things. And I think that's an incredibly powerful concept because asking about how much effort
1491920	1497840	does it take to compute something, I think is really important because when people, especially
1497840	1504400	in the biosciences where things impact medicine a lot, when people say, well, everything should
1504400	1508400	be done at the lowest possible level, and he said, well, you don't really mean the lowest,
1508400	1512240	you don't want to talk about quantum foam, but you really want to talk about his biochemistry,
1512240	1517360	right? That's often when people say to me, ah, you got to reduce, and you don't really mean that.
1517360	1522880	What you mean is you've picked a level and that level is biochemistry. And my point is you can't,
1522880	1528000	and this is people like Dennis Noble have been saying this much better than I, that you can't
1528000	1533200	simply pick a level because you like it, you have to pick the best level. And how do you know what
1533200	1539680	the best level is? And the best level is how much effort do I need to put in to control the outcome?
1539680	1544880	And in the case of regenerative medicine, that outcome might be we're going to replace a complex
1544880	1550880	finger or a hand that's way too complicated for anybody to build by hand from stem cells or anything
1550880	1557120	like that. So the question is going to be, to what extent is your system persuadable? There's this,
1557120	1561440	you know, I visualize this axis, right? On the one hand, you have things like cuckoo clocks,
1561440	1565680	which are not persuadable. You are, you know, if you want to make a change in the way that system
1565680	1570000	works, you have to rewire, you have to physically change the hardware, there's no getting around it.
1570000	1575120	And then you have systems way on the sort of on the right side of that spectrum, which might be
1575120	1581840	humans or they might be other kinds of advanced cognitive systems where trying to intervene in
1581840	1587280	their activity on the molecular scale is maybe possible. But realistically, you know, the sun's
1587280	1592960	going to burn down before you figure out how to tweak all the cells in a person's brain to get
1592960	1598480	this or that to happen. So there you're probably better off with stimuli, with experiences, with
1598480	1602880	inputs that take advantage of the cognitive structure of the system to convince them or
1602880	1608720	motivate them or train them to do various things. And then in between are all kinds of agents,
1608720	1615520	many of which we know, so animals and simple AIs and basic life forms and cells. And then
1615520	1619920	all kinds of agents that don't exist yet. I mean, I think one of the fun things to talk about is the
1619920	1624400	space of possible agents, which I think is going to be actually enormous in our lifetime. And
1624480	1629920	somewhere on that scale is the correct way to interact with everything you come into contact
1629920	1636320	with. And you really have to ask, what is the, what are, you know, are there goals that your
1636320	1641920	system is trying to achieve? And are you better off rewriting those goals or motivating the system
1641920	1647200	than micromanaging it? And I think it sounds it seems like physics is telling you at the
1647200	1652720	lowest level that this kind of stuff is already baked in. Yeah, I mean, I can't help but talk
1652720	1657040	about the physics and least action just a little bit more because it's really fascinating to me.
1657040	1663760	I mean, like we said, there is this way, I even did a video on this in my summer quarantine project
1663760	1669520	video series called The Biggest Ideas in the Universe about how you can either be Newtonian and
1669520	1675360	say, well, I know where I am now and all the laws of physics tell me is what to do next. Or you can
1675360	1682080	be, I don't know, Lagrangian or whatever it's called. You can you can say, well, of all the
1682080	1687760	histories I could have in the future, I will take the one that minimizes the certain function,
1687760	1691840	right, the action. And that latter one just seems a little magical. I mean, you're saying like,
1691840	1697920	well, how did it know? But you show that in fact, secretly, they're mathematically exactly the same.
1697920	1702160	It's just, you know, a matter of convenience. But, but the convenience is extreme when you're
1702160	1707280	when you become a modern particle physicist, you're constantly writing down this action, this
1707280	1712960	this thing that is the thing you minimize globally rather than locally. And it's just a much more
1712960	1719200	convenient way of talking about it. So I guess the question that is obvious to me now is,
1719840	1724800	is there a reason why it doesn't have something to do with the fact that biological organisms
1724800	1728960	are these multilevel systems where there's collective action from all of our tiny little
1728960	1735120	cells coming together? Is that does that help explain why it is convenient to talk in these
1735120	1739760	more global terms rather than just locally following the action of every little atom or
1739760	1745840	molecular cell? Yeah, I think well, I think there are there are two two aspects to this. The sort
1745840	1751120	of more metaphysical aspect is in which I'm not sure how much value this is, but I'll just say it
1751120	1757440	because it's it's something I've been thinking about is that if you ask yourself, you know,
1757600	1762320	let's say people who are who are into panpsychism or this idea that, you know, sort of some sort of
1762320	1768000	intentionality is everywhere fundamentally. What one of the problems that people often have with
1768000	1772640	this is that they scale down the physical system, they say, Okay, now let's consider a rock or a,
1772640	1777920	you know, something like that. And then they fail to scale down the intentionality that I think
1777920	1782000	I'm seeing is they say, Well, it's ridiculous to say that a rock has hopes and dreams. And
1782000	1785680	well, of course, it is so right. So what you need to do is you need to proportionally scale
1785680	1792160	down the cognition. So if you ask yourself what would intentionality or freedom in the sense of
1792160	1797440	indeterminacy look like in the simplest possible case, I think what you get is exactly what particle
1797440	1803040	physics is telling us. So so if you ask, you know, what would freedom look like at the most minimal
1803040	1808800	kind of instantiation, I think you would you would predict something that looks like quantum
1808800	1814640	indeterminacy. And if you ask, what does what would goal directedness look like at the at the
1814640	1819200	simplest possible layer of reality, I think you would get exactly what these action principles
1819200	1825680	look like. So from that perspective, I think I think it's a it's a it's a scale. And the way I
1825680	1831920	think it scales is this, you know, when we when we look at living things now, all we're seeing are
1831920	1837920	it's a selection effect, all we're seeing are things that survived the gauntlet of competition
1837920	1845200	and and selection. So we don't have any objects in that we don't see any living forms that are
1845200	1850240	not good at pursuing goals, those things disappeared very early on. Now, maybe we'll be able to create
1850240	1856080	some life that doesn't do that as as people work on synthetic, you know, origins of life and synthetic
1856080	1861760	life and so on. But any sophisticated life that makes it past, you know, the first few the first
1861760	1869280	few steps of competition is going to be great at pursuing goals in the very simple sense of
1869280	1874720	homeostasis. So one of the things that we're working on now is to try to understand the
1874720	1880560	scaling of goals from tiny homeostatic goals, like either chemical reactions that try to keep
1880560	1886160	certain entropic principles in particular ranges, or single cells like bacteria that try to keep
1886160	1895840	metabolic states in particular ranges. How do you scale goals from these very modest types of
1895840	1900720	goals to something that's much larger, like the goal of having a properly shaped hand or face
1900720	1907200	with particular, you know, and then how do you pivot the whole thing to from from early organisms
1907200	1913200	that, and in fact, still current organisms that execute goals in morpho space, meaning the the
1913280	1917760	space of possible anatomical configurations. And you sort of pivot you run the same algorithms,
1917760	1922480	but now your space is three dimensional space outdoors. So now you can run around and have
1922480	1926480	behavior and have goals that are, Hey, I'm going to run this maze because I remember the structure
1926480	1929680	of the maze. And at the end, there's some cheese and along with the way I'm going to do this and
1929680	1935600	that. So this this idea, you know, life has to start out with with homeostatic loops, I don't
1935600	1942480	think there's any way around it. And those loops scale into progressively more impressive goals
1942560	1948960	that what's what's what one way to organize all this is to is to ask yourself, what are the
1948960	1954640	spatiotemporal boundaries of the goals that any given system could potentially have. So it's
1954640	1959440	sort of like like think of a light cone, so to speak, that that says, okay, here, right in space
1959440	1965280	and time, here is the boundary of things I can possibly have goals about. So if you're a goldfish
1965280	1970400	or a tick, those both in space and time, it's rather modest, you can only conceive of things
1970400	1974720	that are right in front of you and not too far in the past. And you maybe have a little bit of
1975440	1981120	anticipatory ability. But by the time you get to great apes or humans, you know, you could have
1981120	1987920	goals that are that are that are massive in scale. And you know, you just just a huge both both in
1987920	1992400	terms of time in terms of memory and anticipation that you could be working towards things that are
1992400	1997920	going to happen long after you're long after you die and things like that. So that's one way
1997920	2003840	to organize all this is by the by the scale of the goals that these systems are capable of maintaining.

2068080	2072720	I thought of myself a lot about levels of description and reality. I mean, my book,
2072720	2078160	The Big Picture, just talked about levels a lot. And I'll be honest, I've always been very resistant
2078160	2084560	to the idea of causation acting between levels, downward or upward. It seems to me, and I think
2084560	2090160	this is just my fundamental physicist training kicking in, that levels should be autonomous
2090160	2095200	from each other. And I mean, you can derive one from another maybe, but they act differently. But
2095840	2103040	maybe I should just start thinking differently when it comes to biology or human scale things.
2103200	2108720	Certainly, the words you're using seem to indicate to me that you find it useful to
2110560	2115920	speak as if what's happening on one level, like organism wide or network wide or whatever,
2115920	2119760	is important to take consideration of even when we're talking about what's happening on lower
2119760	2126960	levels. Yes, I think that's true. And I think that actually, you may have seen this, but there's
2127600	2134080	very interesting work on this coming out of Giulio Tononi's lab and Eric Hall about
2134080	2139040	quantifying some of these things. So there's now math that will help you understand for a given
2140240	2149920	system, what is the causally most potent level at which to manipulate it. And it's not practical
2149920	2153840	to compute some of those things for a lot of real systems that we care about. But certainly,
2154400	2162000	there are techniques that we use all the time in the lab to ask what is the most appropriate level
2162000	2169120	at which to try to manipulate the system. And inevitably, it bleeds down into the lower levels
2169120	2173680	in the following sense. So in Plenaria, let's say, so we have these flatworms and they have one head
2173680	2179280	and one tail and you chop them into pieces. And each piece knows where the head and the tail are
2179280	2184160	supposed to go and it reliably sort of regenerates whatever is missing. So what we've been able to
2184160	2190080	show is that this is partly the result of a circuit, which is partially electrical,
2190800	2196880	which stores the pattern of what a correct Plenarian is supposed to look like. And we can now see this
2196880	2203840	pattern, we can rewrite it, we can alter it so that now the pattern memory says two heads instead
2203920	2208000	of one. And then that's exactly what sells Bill, Bill, two-headed flatworms.
2210000	2214160	I don't want to go over this too quickly because I know you do this all the time,
2214160	2221280	but this is just amazing to the rest of us. You can chop off the tail and head of this little worm
2221280	2224560	and train it to grow back two heads or two tails instead of one head and one tail.
2225600	2231040	That's correct. Yeah, it's an amazing thing. So Plenaria, basically, I think every important
2231040	2237280	question of life is found somewhere in Plenarian biology, I think you could say. They're an amazing
2237280	2242480	creature. First of all, they're flatworms, not roundworms, so they are bilaterians,
2242480	2248800	meaning they are similar to our ancestors. They have a true brain. Most of the same neurotransmitters
2248800	2252640	that you and I have, they're smart, they can learn, but they have this incredible property.
2252640	2258400	You can chop them into pieces. The record, I think, is something like 275. And every piece
2258400	2263440	will regenerate exactly what's missing, no more, no less, and make a perfect, tiny little worm.
2263440	2268400	Now, they are so regenerative that they're immortal. They don't age. There's no such thing as an old
2268400	2273600	Plenarian, which means, first of all, that the worms that we have in our lab are in a direct
2273600	2278560	physical continuity with worms that were here half a billion years ago, and that's mind-boggling
2278560	2284080	to think about. And also, it's telling us that, in fact, it is possible to be a complex organism
2284480	2291360	with a good brain and so on, and never die. These ideas of thermodynamic limits on aging and so on,
2291360	2296960	I don't think are correct. But anyway, so that's what the animal does normally. Now,
2298080	2303200	of course, lots of interesting work has been done on how this works. They have a bunch of stem cells
2303200	2309360	that lots of work has been done on the molecular and genetic networks that specify different
2310320	2315600	cell types out of these stem cells. But what's really important to understand is the stem cells
2315600	2319760	produce the building blocks, all the different things that you need to make a Plenarian,
2319760	2324160	but you still have to decide how to arrange all this stuff. And all of it can be arranged in many
2324160	2331440	different configurations. Now, people learned long ago to manipulate the lower levels of the system,
2331440	2335680	meaning to get in there and take some of the genes that are required for making heads and tails,
2336480	2342000	regulate their expression, and get one-headed or two-headed worms. We found something that's,
2342000	2348640	I think, it takes us to the next level, which is two things. First of all, that you can actually,
2349840	2356640	that there is a real-time bioelectrical circuit that stores an active pattern, which you can see
2356640	2362080	using special dyes that reveal electrical states and microscopy. You can actually see this
2362880	2365920	this anatomical pattern towards which the thing is going to build.
2366720	2370880	And so that's the first thing. The second thing is that you can, by turning on and off
2370880	2376080	these ion channels, which are these little protein batteries that exist in cell membranes,
2376080	2380880	by turning these things on and off, you can manipulate that circuit and get pieces to build,
2380880	2385920	let's say, a two-headed or a no-headed animal. And one of the most amazing things about it
2385920	2391840	is that if you then, if you have a two-headed animal and you recut that animal in plain water,
2391840	2396640	so no more manipulation, no more doing anything to the ion channels, you will once again get
2396640	2403360	a two-headed worm. Now, this is worth pausing here because what has not been done in this case
2403360	2409040	is to manipulate the genome. The genome has a wild-type sequence. You've not altered the genetics
2409040	2415280	at all. This is a great example and maybe the best example of the separation of data from machine
2415280	2419600	in this case because the cells are standard planarian cells. There's nothing wrong with
2419600	2425760	them that you would identify on genomic sequencing. And they are happy to build whatever it is that
2425760	2431280	is specified in this large-scale pattern memory that is kept by the tissue electric circuit. And
2431280	2435520	if the electric circuit has two heads, that is, in fact, what they will build. And so this goes
2435520	2440160	on in perpetuity. As far as we can tell, you can keep doing this. We now know how to set it back
2440160	2444640	from two-headed to one-headed. Again, there's a change in the electrical state that you can make.
2444640	2450960	And so this goes back to your question about downward causation because what you can say is,
2450960	2456400	well, it makes a second head. What happened to the molecular pathways? Well, of course,
2456400	2461840	the molecular pathways that are required to build a head are all activated on the posterior side
2461840	2467280	of the animal. So you still need all... It's not like the Bioelectricity Act by itself. You still
2467280	2474080	need all the building blocks. The hardware still has to make all the cells that create the brain
2474080	2480400	tissue and eyes and all of that. But the decision, the early-on decision of what this tissue level
2480400	2486240	agent is going to build, is made at this higher level, which then inevitably filters down to the
2486240	2491920	lower level. So you can track that lower level. You can look at the gene expression. You will see
2492560	2496400	nothing but chemistry. There's no magic. You will see every gene being triggered by some other gene
2496400	2503120	or something like that. But if you ask the practical question of what is the best way to
2503120	2508000	make a two-headed worm, you've got a couple options. You can try to manipulate these lower level
2510160	2517680	activities. And it's quite hard. Or you can go up to the master regulator level and you can just
2517680	2523280	interact. And this happens roughly between three and six hours after cutting. All the transcriptional
2523280	2528320	changes happen in the next 24 hours. The first thing after amputation, that circuit acts between
2528320	2534240	three and six hours. And it triggers both scaling so that the heads are correctly scaled with respect
2534240	2539520	to the rest of the worm and the identity of the tissue. So head versus tail. All of that stuff
2539520	2546720	is downstream. So I do think from that perspective, I do think there's a kind of downward causation
2546720	2551600	regardless of some of the philosophical aspects in the sense that you simply ask what's the best
2551600	2556480	control knob. And in some cases, it will not be by electricity. And in many cases, we've seen that
2556480	2561200	that's exactly where the decisions are made. And I think that's not surprising. Looking at the way
2561200	2567680	the brain works, brains are basically an elaboration of the system that evolution found probably around
2567680	2572800	the time of bacterial biofilms, actually. Oh, you'll have to say more about that. But
2573840	2578240	in what sense, how are you relating bacterial biofilms to brains?
2578240	2586240	Sure. So actually, there's a lot of work on some of the early work on ion channels,
2586240	2593440	actually, was done in bacteria. It was known from decades ago that bacteria can be electrically
2593440	2600560	active. And there was some recently some really nice work from UCLA, where there's a set of papers
2600560	2609520	by Arthur Prindle and colleagues who have shown that bacterial biofilms drive a lot of very brain
2609520	2615040	like electrical dynamics. So individual individual bacteria coordinate with each other. And what you
2615040	2622000	get are waves, potassium waves that in many ways are similar to what happens in brains. And I see,
2622000	2625840	right. And basically bacterial biofilms, you know, they're kind of proto body, right? They're
2626400	2630800	individual organisms learning to live with each other in a way to make a larger agent that can
2630800	2635760	do things that individual agents can't. Good. That is actually very helpful. And I'm sure that's
2635760	2640000	worth the whole podcast by itself. But I do want to get back to the planarian there because I am
2640000	2645360	not personally an expert on the planarian reproductive strategy. So I don't even know
2645360	2653280	do they lay eggs or give birth. But how exactly is the information about one headed versus two
2653280	2661120	headed planarian set down traveling down to future generations? Like where in the organism is it?
2662000	2666640	Yeah. Yeah. So so this is a great question. A couple of things. Let's let's start back with
2666640	2672240	the question of how they normally reproduce. So which which already tells us that there's a
2672240	2678320	lot we don't know. So so planaria is some at least the species that we work with, they are capable
2678320	2683680	of laying eggs and producing sperm and sexual reproduction. But mostly what they do is fission.
2683680	2688400	So when they feel happy or in fact, when they're stressed, either either one leads to the same
2688400	2694320	outcome. Oddly enough, they are good model organisms for human beings too. Yeah. Right. Yeah.
2694320	2700880	There are lots of lots of I mean, people use them actually for to study addiction to drug
2700880	2704880	addiction. And you know, they get addicted to all the same stuff that we do and so on.
2704880	2710560	So when you know, when they want to fission, the back end grabs on to the dish, the front end
2710560	2714960	keeps going and they tear themselves in the middle and then they regenerate. Now you've got two worms.
2714960	2719840	So that's their normal reproductive cycle. Now, already before we even get to the two headed
2719840	2725600	stuff, there's something really interesting here, which is that you and I and most animals, when
2725600	2730480	we reproduce, our children do not inherit the mutations that happen to us during our lifetime.
2730480	2736080	So if you get a change of DNA in your arm, your kids don't get that. So that is, that's really
2736080	2742480	important. And but the thing with planaria, because each piece rebuilds a new body out of
2742480	2746960	the cells that were in that piece, this means that unlike the rest of us, they practice somatic
2746960	2752000	inheritance. They do inherit every mutation that doesn't kill the neoblast, the stem cell, they
2752000	2758160	got it. And those things proliferate. So for, let's say 400 million years, they've been accumulating
2758160	2763120	mutations. And you can see this in their genomes are an incredible mess. We don't even have a proper
2763120	2769280	genomic assembly for the kinds of worms that we work with. They are mix deployed, meaning every cell
2769280	2772640	might have a different number of chromosomes. So you don't even really know what you're sequencing
2772640	2778000	when you sequence these things. The genome is an incredible mess. And yet, the regeneration,
2778000	2783520	the anatomy is rock solid 100% of the time you cut that thing into pieces, you get normal worms.
2783520	2787760	So this is already telling us that there's some very interesting room between the genetics and
2787760	2793200	the anatomy that we don't understand because the genetics could be very messy and the anatomy is
2793200	2799680	rock solid. So now let's get to your next question, which is the two heads. So if you have a two-headed
2799680	2809600	worm, they can reproduce by fissioning. When that happens, generally speaking, one of the pieces
2809600	2816320	will end up two-headed and one of the pieces will end up one-headed. So you can imagine a scenario
2816320	2822640	where we take some two-headed worms and we throw them in the Charles River here in Boston and sort
2822640	2827280	of at some point, some scientists in the future come along and they scoop up some samples and they
2827280	2831280	find some one-headed forms and some two-headed forms and they say, ah, cool, a speciation event.
2831280	2835440	Let's sequence the genomes and see where that happened, right? And they're not going to find
2835440	2839120	anything. And the reason is precisely your question, where does the information live?
2839760	2847440	So we have found, so far, we've found two places where that information lives. In the strict two-headed,
2847440	2851120	there's actually another part of this that I hadn't mentioned yet, which is called cryptic
2851120	2856080	worms, which I'll talk about in a minute. In the two-headed worms, one of the things that happens
2856080	2864800	is the molecular structure of the cytoskeleton, the thing that allows cells, especially neurons,
2864800	2874480	but all kinds of cells, to know a direction from basal to apicalers and so on. This cytoskeleton
2874480	2881360	is actually carrying a lot of the information. And it goes back to a really interesting
2882000	2887760	experiment, which is classical epigenetics. So now, right now, if you say epigenetics,
2887760	2892000	people normally think about chromatin modifications, all the things that can happen to the genome
2892240	2896960	to mark it for future generations. There's an older example, which is that if you take
2896960	2902240	a single cell organism, like a paramecium, they have these little hairs that point a particular
2902240	2906320	way, and they swim, they wave the little cilia, and they swim. So what somebody did was they took
2906320	2910400	a glass needle, and this is an amazing experiment because these things are tiny. They took a glass
2910400	2916080	needle and they cut a little square in the surface of the animal. I don't actually think it was a
2916080	2921120	paramecium, but it was a related thing. And they rotated it 180 degrees and they put it back. This
2921120	2928080	is doing this to a single cell, mind you, with my hand. Under the microscope. And so what they
2928080	2934720	found is that these things give rise to a line of animals that all have a little square looking
2934720	2940400	the wrong way. And this was incredible. This was the first real example of epigenetics because,
2940400	2944080	of course, they had a wild type genome. And in fact, there's a beautiful line in one of the
2944080	2949120	papers that says these things are always on the verge of starvation because they're trying to
2949120	2954240	use the little cilia to waft food into their mouths. And there's a little square that's, of
2954240	2958240	course, kicking the food out the wrong way so they're never quite good. And he says they're
2958240	2963200	always on the verge of starvation and their normal genome is powerless to help them. And this is a
2963200	2968480	very powerful point because, yes, the genome has done everything correctly. All the proteins have
2969360	2973680	been made. They have all of the proteins that it takes to make a normal structure. But the reason
2973680	2978720	these guys aren't normal is because the information is being templated off of the mother cell. So when
2978720	2984400	the mother cell makes a daughter cell, it templates that abnormal structure of the cytoskeleton,
2984400	2991760	you know, almost like a crystal templating, it templates it and creates an offspring with
2991760	2998320	the same structure. So there's something like that in Plenaria where actually that subcellular
2998320	3004320	polarity is being scaled up from individual cells to the whole organism. And then, of course,
3004400	3009920	there's the one that I think is also extremely interesting, which is the bioelectric circuit.
3009920	3016880	So one of the things that we can see is that the way that the ion channels in Plenaria have been
3016880	3021760	shaped by evolution is that they make a circuit that has memory. And now engineers, of course,
3021760	3027040	are pretty familiar with this. It's a really convenient way to make memory circuits. As long
3027040	3031920	as you keep powering them, you can have flip flops and things like this where you make a transient
3031920	3036000	electrical change. And the circuit keeps that change until you come back and reset it. So it's
3036000	3041200	sort of like like like volatile RAM, so to speak. So so this electrical circuit, there's a there's
3041200	3045680	another type of worm that we can make, which is really interesting. We call them cryptic worms.
3045680	3052000	And the thing with cryptic worms is that they they every time you cut them, they toss a coin,
3052000	3056000	and they make a more or less random, although it's a weighted it's a biased coin, but it's more or
3056000	3061600	less a random decision as to whether they're going to make one heads or not. And if they
3061600	3066240	don't, what results is again, a cryptic worm. And if they do, you get a two headed worm that is
3066240	3071440	forever a two headed worm. These cryptic worms, the as far as we can tell, all the molecular
3072080	3078000	aspects are normal. But what's abnormal is the bio electric pattern that is stored by their real
3078000	3083600	time electric circuit. And it is this pattern that makes them be this it makes them have this
3083600	3088240	destabilized anatomy where they're not quite sure if they should be one headed or two headed.
3088240	3092640	And you can you can manipulate that electrical pattern and convert them back into one headed
3092640	3097760	worms or into two headed worms or whatever. One of the interesting there's a there's a paper that
3097760	3103920	from our lab that's about to about to come out in a few weeks, that looks at this as as as a as a
3103920	3107760	by stable perception problem in the nervous system. So you know, when you look at these things that
3107760	3111840	are like the rabbit duck illusion, right, or the necker cube or these kinds of things. Yeah. So
3111840	3116080	so there's a there's this there's this ability of nervous systems to exist in almost the almost
3116160	3120400	superposition of states where you're and this is very much top down control, right, because it's
3120400	3125760	driven in both cases, the the photons, the pattern of photons hitting your retina is exactly the same.
3125760	3129120	The reason that you keep flipping from one to the other is because you have expectations
3129120	3132880	in the firstonian sense, right, you think it's got to be a cube and if it's always got to be
3132880	3138560	facing in or out. Yeah. So so that kind of top down control in the nervous system is very similar
3138560	3143680	to what happens in these electrical circuits in non neural cells, where there can be this this
3143680	3147600	by stability where there's kind of two ways to interpret this electrical information. And that's
3147600	3153520	what that's what the cells do. So so I think I think and all of that is not to say that we've
3153520	3158880	plumbed the depths of this. There's absolutely more open questions than there are answers. So there
3158880	3164320	may be other pieces to this puzzle. But I feel very strongly that the question of where is this
3164320	3172480	information is in part, it's kept as electrical memory in the electrical circuit. And partially
3172480	3178640	it's in the in the in the in the sub cellular architecture of the cells that are copying
3178640	3183200	previous architectures when they when they form. And we should, you know, you might also be interested
3183200	3187920	in the the shifting of worm heads to other species, because you can do that too. It's not,
3187920	3192960	you know, making multiple, you know, making multiple heads of the same species is one thing.
3192960	3199040	But you can actually, again, by by interfering in the normal electrical electric in the normal
3199040	3204320	electrical circuit, you can get these cells to build heads that belong to other species of
3204320	3211120	planaria 150 million years distant with with no genetic change at all. And to go back to put
3211120	3216800	this in the context of the tadpoles whose faces we rearranged, and they figured out how to get
3216800	3223120	them back. The idea there is a goal in mind as to what the ultimate face you want is.
3224880	3228240	Combining that with what we've just been talking about with the paramisi in the planaria,
3228240	3234400	that means that wherever this goal is, that's not all by itself encoded in the genome either,
3234400	3238880	right? It's encoded a little bit more globally. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, it is absolutely not
3238880	3244320	directly in the genome. I think I think again, the way to think about this is is good. You know,
3244320	3249360	our concept of software running on electrical devices, I think is actually really good to
3249360	3256560	to get us an intuitive understanding of this. I think what the genome does is encode a system
3256640	3260480	that when you turn on the juice, it encodes a set of electrical, and of course, there's also
3260480	3265040	biomechanics and biochemical signals that are important. But when you turn on the juice,
3265040	3270800	it reliably executes a pattern of activity. There's symmetry breaking, there's amplification,
3270800	3274720	there's robustness, meaning if you have some extra potassium in the in the pond that you're
3274720	3277680	growing in, it's not going to destabilize the whole thing. There are all these important
3277680	3283440	properties that allow you to spontaneously form a pattern of activity in this electric circuit.
3283440	3287120	It's like, you know, you got a bag of parts that were specified for you, you connect them all
3287120	3291680	together, you turn on the juice, and it does something. And the parts were fine tuned over
3291680	3298000	eons to make sure that what it does by default is is reliable and adaptive and useful. But then
3298000	3303440	you find an amazing thing, which is that there's actually that the thing's actually reprogrammable
3303440	3311360	that while it does have a default mode of behavior that would that it will execute every single time,
3312240	3317840	there is in fact a set of stimuli or experiences that you can give it without going in and having
3317840	3324800	to rewire it, that will push it into a different mode. In particular, what it will do is what you
3324800	3331920	can do is you can rewrite the part of that electric circuit that serves as your homeostatic
3331920	3337280	set point. It's like, you know, if you had a thermostat, there has to be some physical
3337280	3342080	structure that encodes the range that this thing is trying to maintain, and you can just go change
3342080	3346240	that, you don't need to, you know, rebuild your thermostat, you can you can change the set point.
3346240	3353600	So it looks like in many cases, living things have a set point. Now, this is much more complex
3353600	3360320	than let's say pH or some sort of metabolic level, these are anatomical set points that are that are
3360320	3365840	rough, not to the cell scale, obviously, but a rough description of what the thing should look like.
3365920	3371840	And these set points are in many ways, we call them target morphologies, it's the pattern to
3371840	3376320	which the cells are trying to build and it's the pattern that once they achieve it, then they stop.
3377760	3382000	These things are rewritable. And once you rewrite them, the cells will build something different.
3382000	3386240	And what we don't know, of course, is the limitations. We don't know if cells are a
3386240	3392240	universal constructor in the sense that can you make absolutely anything or are there constraints?
3392320	3397760	People talk about developmental constraints. I'm not 100% sure what that really is, or if there are
3397760	3403440	any constraints, in the sense that if we knew, I think we just don't know the code enough. If we
3403440	3412000	understood how to reprogram correctly these target patterns, I think we would be looking at something
3412000	3417520	like an anatomical compiler. This is like our vision when I talk about what's the end game for our
3417520	3422000	group, when can you give up and go home? Because everything's done. I think what we're looking
3422000	3426720	at is something like an anatomical compiler that you sit down, much like computer aided drawing,
3426720	3433440	you basically just draw a picture of a schematic of the animal or plant that you want. And if we
3433440	3438400	knew what we were doing, the system would decompose that into a set of stimuli that you would give
3438400	3442240	cells to get them to build that particular thing. Not because you're going to micromanage,
3443120	3448960	you're not going to 3D print individual stem cell derivatives, but you're going to rewrite the
3448960	3453520	goal state that the cells are accessing the cell collective. I should be more precise. The cell
3453520	3459840	collective is accessing to know what to build and when to stop. The idea that there's all these
3459840	3463760	different levels that are interacting with each other is a very powerful one. And not just because
3464640	3469120	there are levels with different levels of coarse graining, if you want, but that there are
3469920	3476080	right levels in some sense. This is what you sort of got to earlier. There are ways of describing
3476080	3481280	these complex systems that just give you an enormously more powerful handle on what they're
3481280	3486400	going to do. And one of the issues that you've talked about, it's even come up a little bit
3486400	3490560	in what we've already said about the planaria and the biofilms with the bacteria, which is
3491200	3496960	at what point do a bunch of either cells or molecules or whatever constitute an organism?
3497280	3502240	I mean, at what point are they a self that you can pinpoint? That's a level of analysis.
3502240	3507120	I can talk about the morphology and the hopes and dreams of that little bugger right there.
3508080	3515280	Yeah, I think that's a great question. And there's two aspects to this, I think,
3515280	3522400	that we at least that we focused on. One of the aspects is how cells come into being. And this
3522480	3527280	is the scale up of, and I think this is both philosophically and empirically, this is one
3527280	3532720	of the most fascinating problems in science, is the fact that all cognitive agents are made of
3532720	3538960	parts. There's no such thing as a sort of this monadic kind of diamond like cognitive thing
3538960	3545280	that's not divisible. We are a bag of cells in between our ears. And when people say, oh,
3546240	3551920	what are you talking about? This collection of cells has memory and goals. So, well,
3551920	3555520	you have memory and goals, right? And they say, yes, I certainly do. And I say, well, very good,
3555520	3561840	because you're a collection of cells. And so the question isn't whether cells can have goals and
3561840	3566960	hopes and dreams, that question has been settled, at least if for no one else but for yourself.
3566960	3570880	This is other mind's problem, maybe, but at least for yourself, you know, that's the case.
3570880	3575760	And so now the only remaining question is the scaling. How do you scale up from a collection
3575760	3583680	of competent agents to some sort of unified single agent that has that has a coherent
3583680	3589040	integrated cells that is larger than these others, right? So I actually have a model of this,
3589920	3595360	of how this works, although much work remains to be done. But I have a beginning model of this
3595360	3600560	that has to do with these really important elements called gap junctions. So these are
3600560	3605920	things that, these are proto synapses. This is what synapses were before they became modern
3605920	3611760	synapses. They're basically, think about two, they're little proteins that hang out in the cell
3611760	3616000	surface that can dock with each other. And you can think about like two submarine hatches underwater,
3616000	3620240	sort of docking and opening up a path that you can go from cell to cell. So the interesting thing
3620240	3628240	about that is that, and these are critical for multi-cellularity. They are an important part
3628240	3634240	of electric circuits because they are themselves voltage gated. So not only does electrical potential
3634240	3638640	propagate through these open gap junctions, but it actually controls whether they're open or closed.
3638640	3645280	So that means that this is a voltage gated current conductance, which a.k.a. a transistor.
3645280	3648960	And we know that once you have a transistor, you can make almost anything, you can make logicates
3648960	3653840	and so on. It gives them memory historicity and so on. So what's really neat about these things,
3653840	3658400	if you imagine two individual cells coming together and forming this kind of gap junction,
3658960	3663760	unlike every other kind of cell signaling. So cells produce all kinds of molecules in their
3663760	3667840	environment. They secrete all kinds of molecules. And if you're a cell in the environment,
3667840	3672800	you can receive those molecules. And then you know perfectly well that they're not yours. You
3672800	3678160	know perfectly that they originate from the outside. You can choose to interpret them or you can think
3678160	3683760	that they are false. You know that somebody's taking advantage of you or cooperating or competing
3683760	3689120	or whatever. But something very different happens when you connect with these electrical synapses.
3689120	3694400	When you connect with these gap junctions, both cells get access to each other's internal
3694400	3700960	milieu. This means that things that happen to one of the cells very rapidly propagate to the other
3700960	3709040	cell. And all the metadata as far as what the originator of that information is is stripped.
3709040	3713760	So if something happens to cell A and there's a calcium flux and that calcium flux propagates to
3713760	3719280	cell B, it doesn't you know, all cell B sees is this flux. It doesn't know whether what triggered
3719280	3725440	it happened to it or to its partner. This has a couple of really critical implications. The first
3725440	3730000	is that it makes lying or cheating almost impossible. Because anything you do right,
3730000	3735120	anything you do to your neighbor is immediately going to come back to you. So if you try to poison
3735120	3742080	your neighbor in some sort of you know competition, you're going to get it too. And what it also means
3742080	3748800	is that it becomes really difficult to maintain ownership of individual thought. So if what you
3748800	3752960	have are a bunch of information molecules that were a track record of things that happened to you.
3752960	3756720	And you know, we don't have to think about complex thinking here. We can just say
3756720	3760800	there are events that happen that trigger molecular reactions and these molecular reactions are
3761440	3767040	a record that you use to adjust future behaviors in all cells to this. So now you're sharing those
3767040	3771920	molecules and you can no longer tell which are true memories that you accumulated, and which
3771920	3776720	are false memories that are incepted into your cognitive structure by the fact that they floated
3776720	3782560	in from your neighbor. So now this erases it's like an amazing form of telepathy, so to speak,
3782560	3790000	because it merges the minds of these two cells into a group agent where they literally cannot tell
3790000	3795200	what belongs to what. And in that case, that is the origin of this I would claim that is the
3795200	3801200	origin of a simple compound self. It's because you're erasing it's kind of cool. I mean, I think
3801200	3806160	and again, this is far outside my field, but I think there's a lot of important quantum computation
3806160	3810400	work as far as erasures, right? The fact that erasing information is critical. I think this
3810400	3817440	is an example of that erasing this metadata that, hey, here's a memory that belongs to this
3817440	3824320	unit over here. All of that is gone and that helps create a kind of larger mind, so to speak. And
3824320	3830400	of course, this is a proto cognitive sort of thing, but you can imagine the scaling larger and larger
3830400	3836560	to allow this agent now to have bigger horizons of those goals that I mentioned so that you can now
3836560	3842960	contemplate much, much, much bigger things in both space. And you have the computational machinery
3842960	3849200	to remember further back in time and to anticipate further into the future. Now, this kind of thing
3849200	3855520	has a has a cool implication, which is that he would think that okay, if this is the origin of
3855520	3860720	the self, then you have two questions. Number one is can it break down and what the how would it
3860720	3867760	break down? And what you can imagine is imagine that you're part of this sensation, you're connected
3867760	3872480	to a bunch of neighbors, you're this multicellular kind of creature. And for whatever reason,
3872480	3877600	your gap junctions get closed, you can no longer hear the electrical signals from your neighbors,
3877600	3886480	you are now sort of isolated from all this, you no longer get the information input, you no longer
3886720	3891680	get the consequences of things you do directly fed back to you. You could imagine that you would
3891680	3897680	then in a game theory sense, instead of previously where you're sort of forced to cooperate. And
3897680	3901280	by the way, this is very interesting. This is where we're doing now simulations of prisoners
3901280	3907200	dilemma, where the agents instead of just cooperating and defecting, they actually have a new ability
3907200	3911680	they can merge. And once you merge, what you see is that, right, it's the as to my knowledge,
3911680	3916160	it's the first time that the number of agents in a prisoner's dilemma is not constant, usually
3916400	3920320	define the agents, and then you see what emerges and there's cooperation, whatever. But what happens
3920320	3924960	is, if you don't, if you don't fix the number to be a constant, and you let agents merge,
3924960	3929760	you find out that cooperation doesn't just emerge, it's inevitable, because you can't
3929760	3935840	cheat against yourself, because your yourself is now bigger. So what happens when this breaks down,
3935840	3941600	you can sort of imagine the consequences. And this is precisely what happens in cancer. So in
3941680	3946720	cancer, what they've known since the late 70s, that one of the first steps of carcinogenic
3946720	3950960	transformation is a closure of the gap junctions. And then it wasn't quite clear why. And I think
3950960	3957760	this is exactly what happens. When you as a cell, which your identity was smeared out all over this
3957760	3964240	tissue, you were part of this larger group cognition, as soon as you are now back, your
3964240	3968880	computational boundary, that surface from which you're getting signals is now shrunk back down
3968880	3974960	to the level of a single cell, you basically revert to your unicellular ancient past you.
3974960	3979200	And this has been borne out by transcriptomics studies by Paul Davies group and others,
3979200	3987280	where you now basically treat the rest of the body as just environment. You do what single cells
3987280	3991360	always do, they go where life is good, they migrate, they proliferate as much as they can.
3991360	3997600	And this is metastasis. And so one way to think about this as a cancer is a breakdown of multi
3997600	4002400	cellularity. And it, in fact, can be caused, it doesn't have to have a genetic component,
4002400	4007120	it can be caused by purely physiological cause. We've shown that we can make
4007120	4012960	metastatic melanoma in perfectly normal tadpoles by preventing electrical communication briefly.
4012960	4018960	And these cells, this is what happens, the self literally shrinks. So going back to your question
4018960	4024080	of how you get the, when can you talk about cells, I think it has to do with the boundaries of these
4024080	4030320	goals. So that as soon as this cell no longer has a goal of building a proper, you know, liver
4030320	4034640	or kidney or whatever it was doing, all of its goals have now shrunk down to things that a single
4034640	4039200	cell can understand, which is very simple. I'm going to go down, I'm going to go, I'm going to
4039200	4044000	follow some, some gradients to where, where, where food is more plentiful. And I'm going to make as
4044000	4050080	many copies of myself as I possibly can. And this is, this is how cells shrink. So, you know, and
4050080	4054480	of course the implications of that are that you ought to be able to reverse it, which suggests
4054480	4059280	that cancer doesn't just have to be treated by trying to chase down all these irrevocably
4059280	4063280	broken cells and killing them with some sort of toxin. You might be able to convince them to
4063280	4069200	rejoin the collective. And we've done this in the frog model. We've shown that you can use either
4069200	4076160	optogenetics or drugs or iron channel misexpression to take cells that are expressing really nasty
4076160	4082160	human oncogenes or KRS and things like that. And basically just normalize them and force them
4082160	4089200	artificially to connect back into this, into this group, group agent, and normalize and, and when
4089200	4094640	go back to normal morphogenesis. You must know you're exactly describing the Borg collective
4094640	4102000	from Star Trek, right? I mean, in Star Trek, all these individuals, it's, it's treated as bad
4102000	4106400	that all these individuals melt into a single collective. But when we, when it's our cells
4106400	4109360	melting their individuality to make us, we think it's good.
4110560	4114720	Yeah, yeah, you're absolutely right. And I'm not, I'm not big on, on, on collectivist
4114720	4119040	kinds of things in general. I think that key is, but I think this is telling us something
4119040	4124000	important. I think what it's telling us is that we need to come up with optimal strategies. And
4124000	4127520	these are the sorts of things I do a lot of work, for example, with Josh Bongard at the University
4127520	4134960	of Vermont, he's a roboticist, computer scientist. We, we want to work on identifying optimal policies
4134960	4140240	that try to get the best of both worlds. Because you see, when you do combine into this,
4140240	4144320	into this collective, there are some good things about it, which is, which are that you achieve
4144320	4149600	higher computational capacity cooperation is goes through the roof, all of that. But of course,
4149600	4154160	the downside is that this collective agent, the goals of the collective agent might have
4154160	4157520	absolutely nothing to do with the goals of the individual. And so, you know, when, when, when
4157520	4161840	you lose some skin, you don't worry about it and so on. And so, right. And so, so this is,
4161840	4166880	this is a real problem. And so what we need to do is to figure out now, evolution has, has optimized
4166880	4170960	this in particular ways. That's not to say that that's necessarily what we want. We need to come
4170960	4178640	up with optimal ways to, to enhance the, the, the, the benefits of this kind of cooperativity,
4178640	4183920	but still retain the multi-scale nature of it. You see, that's the key is you don't want to lose
4183920	4189680	the, the agency of the, of the pieces. You want to retain it while reaping the benefits of some
4189680	4194400	of the larger scale features. And it's hard to say at this point how well that's going to work,
4194400	4197600	but I think that's a really important thing to work on in the future.
4198240	4204320	Does this whole philosophy help us either philosophically or practically when it comes
4204320	4211360	to our ambitions to go in there and change organisms, not just solve cure diseases, but to
4211360	4216720	make new organisms to do synthetic biology, to create new things from scratch? And vice-versa,
4216720	4223680	does it help us in what we would think of usually as robotics or technology? Can we learn lessons
4223680	4228640	from the biological side of things? Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think absolutely. And there's two ways
4228640	4232880	to, there's sort of a short-term view and a longer-term view of this. The short-term view is
4232880	4239840	that absolutely. So, so we work very closely with, with roboticists to take deep concepts in
4239840	4243680	both directions. So, on the one hand, take the things that we've learned from the robustness
4243680	4249200	and intelligence. I mean, the intelligent problem solving of, of these living forms is, is incredibly
4249200	4254880	high. And even, even organisms without brains, you know, this whole focus on, on kind of like
4254880	4259680	neuromorphic architectures for AI, I think is really a very limiting, limiting way to look at it.
4259680	4265120	And so, so we, we try very hard to export some of these concepts into machine learning, into
4265200	4270240	robotics and, and so on. Multiscale robotics. You know, I gave a talk called, why robots don't get
4270240	4275280	cancer. You know, and this is, right, this is, this is exactly the problem is, is we make devices
4275280	4280800	where the pieces don't have sub-goals. And that's the, the good news is, yes, no, no, no, you're
4280800	4284320	not going to have a robot where part of it decides to defect and do something different. But on the
4284320	4288320	other hand, the robots aren't very good. They're not, they're not, you know, very, very flexible.
4288320	4293200	So, so part of this, we're trying to export. And then going in the, in the other direction and take
4293920	4296720	interesting concepts from computer science, from cognitive science
4297760	4302400	into biology to help us understand how this works. I fundamentally think that
4303600	4308240	computer science and biology are not really different fields. I think we are all studying
4308240	4314480	computation just in different media. And I do think there's a lot of opportunity for, for, for
4314480	4318880	back and forth. But now the other thing that you mentioned is really important, which is the creation
4318960	4327360	of novel, novel systems. We are doing some work on, on synthetic, synthetic living machines and,
4327360	4334400	and creating new, new life forms by basically taking perfectly normal cells and giving them
4334400	4338880	additional freedom and then, and then some stimulation to, to become other types of organisms.
4339520	4346160	We, I think in our, in our lifetime, I think we are going to be surrounded by, you know,
4347120	4352880	Darwin had this, this phrase, endless forms, most beautiful. We, I mean, I think the reality is going
4352880	4359920	to be a variety of living agents that he couldn't have even conceived of in the sense that the space,
4359920	4365600	and this is something I'm working on now, is to map out at least the axes of this option space of
4365600	4372080	all possible agents. Because what the bioengineering is enabling us to do is to create hybrid,
4372880	4381520	to create hybrid agents that are in part biological, in part electronic, right? The parts are
4381520	4386240	designed, parts are evolved, the parts that are evolved might have been biologically evolved,
4386240	4391680	or they might have been evolved in a virtual environment using genetic algorithms on the computer.
4393120	4400800	All of these combinations and this, we're going to see everything from household appliances that
4400800	4406000	are run in part by machine learning and part by living, living brains that are, that are, you
4406000	4410800	know, sort of being controllers for various things that we would like to optimize to, to,
4410800	4415120	to humans and animals that have various implants that make, allow them to control other devices
4415120	4420720	and communicate with each other. These, you know, the space of possible agents and possible bodies
4420720	4428000	is enormous, right? I think that, right, the plasticity of cells and the ability, look, we,
4428000	4434560	we put eyes, eyes on the tails of tadpoles and those animals can see perfectly well, you know,
4434560	4441040	these, the plasticity with which cells can organize into a, into a functional form,
4441040	4445840	even though it's completely different from their genomic default is, is, is massive.
4445840	4449680	And there's a few things important about that. One of the things that's important about that
4449680	4453680	is that, and Josh Bongart and I are currently writing a paper on this,
4454400	4459840	it blows up a lot of the vocabulary that we normally use. You know, people argue about
4459840	4463760	whether, there's a lot of papers arguing that living things are not machines.
4463760	4469200	Well, they're certainly not 18th century machines, right? That's for sure, right? But,
4469200	4473680	but if you look at what machines are now, you know, all of the, all of the kinds of things that
4473680	4477360	people say, well, machines are predictable and they're, and they're made by a human and they're,
4477360	4482720	none of those things are true of machines anymore. And things like, what is a robot?
4482720	4487360	What is a, what, what does it mean to be evolved? What does it mean to be designed? You know,
4487360	4490560	if you dig into this question of what are we actually doing when we design something and
4490560	4495200	how is that different from testing variants over long times, you know, time span,
4496240	4503600	all of these words like robot, program, machine, all of these things, I think, are operating on
4503680	4509520	categories that are no longer good categories. They served us well in the past when our
4509520	4515840	engineering was, was primitive and we couldn't make these, we couldn't fill in the middle of
4515840	4521200	these continuum between all of these kinds of things, but now we can. And so all of these terms
4521200	4527440	have to, all of these terms have to be redefined to really pick out what's essential about these
4527440	4534400	terms to really, I think, you know, sort of carve a nature up better than, than they used to. And
4534400	4540640	that will, will have massive implications not only for, let's say, regenerative biology and
4540640	4545040	biomedicine and robotics and things like this, but there's, there are ethics issues here too.
4545040	4551600	We have to think very hard about what we owe to different kinds of agents with different kinds
4551600	4558480	of cognitive capacities. And, you know, I've been in a lot of debates with people talking about
4558480	4563760	brain organoids and human brain organoids and what, you know, what human brains are and so on.
4564560	4571760	Because these things are now continua, you know, we could, you could now make a system that's 80%
4571760	4577440	human brain cells, 20% drosophila cells and 10% electronics with machine learning. Is that a human?
4577520	4582640	Is it not? You know, something like, you know, if your neighbor got the brain implant that allowed
4582640	4587920	it to, that allowed him to mentally run a vacuum cleaner, no big deal. We have people with assistive
4587920	4592400	devices now and wheelchairs and things, right? No problem. And if your other neighbor had a
4592400	4598480	vacuum cleaner that had some human brain cells that were sort of a controller and enabled to get
4598480	4603280	around, also no big deal, still pretty much a vacuum cleaner. So in those cases, you have,
4603280	4608480	you know, a 90-10 split and a 10-90 split and that's easy. But what about the 50-50 split?
4609520	4615520	And so we really have to, I think this idea where we clearly know what a machine is, we clearly
4615520	4620720	know what real preferences are as opposed to just sort of as if, you know, algorithm following by
4620720	4627200	robots, none of these distinctions are as robust as a lot of people think they are. And the implications
4627200	4632400	for ethics are at least as large as they are for biomedicine and robotics.
4633680	4639120	No, I completely agree. And I think that, you know, for example, people have cared a lot about
4639120	4644240	the possibility of uploading our brains onto computers. Whereas I suspect that just like you
4644240	4651600	say, blending the boundary between humans and computers is going to be a much nearer term thing
4651600	4656720	that we're going to have to worry about in this domain. But the stuff you just said brings up,
4656720	4661600	you know, about 12 podcasts worth of topics to discuss. So we're running out of time here.
4661600	4666160	Let me just pick one that I really want to get to before we go, which is you mentioned the idea
4666160	4671280	that robots don't get cancer. And that's very interesting to me because the thing when I have
4671280	4674800	artificial intelligence discussions, the things that I always want to bring up is that robots
4674800	4681840	don't get bored. You know, there's no sort of motivation or irritability or desire to come
4681840	4687440	back to some homeostasis built in automatically. You can try to build it in, but it's not automatic
4687440	4694400	in an artificial system. And what you've said has given me the initial idea or the additional idea
4694960	4698640	that maybe the point is not just that robots don't get bored, but that robots are not
4699200	4703840	or the way that we currently make robots, they're not made of pieces that get bored,
4703840	4708960	the get bored, right? I mean, this is the extra little insight that real biological organisms
4708960	4714560	are made of these collections. And the collections, you know, should be thought of in quasi-teleological
4714560	4718720	ways as well. Absolutely, absolutely. And there's this notion of info taxes, where
4720800	4726480	everything from molecular networks up are in a constant search for information to update their
4726480	4731440	ways of representing themselves and the world in a kind of Fristonian sense.
4732480	4737600	Yeah, I think there is a really interesting question about motivations and the fact that
4737600	4742320	with any living system, we can tell very quickly how to motivate it. We know what it cares about,
4742320	4746160	we know what it likes, what it dislikes, because we can train it with positive and
4746160	4752320	negative reinforcement. Maybe these things will be a little harder in the exobiological arena,
4752320	4757040	where we can run across new life forms. But I bet even there, in short order, you can figure out
4757040	4761840	what you could use to train this thing with what it's going to enjoy and what it's going to be
4761840	4770160	about punishment. There have been papers dealing with this issue of motivation in artificial
4770160	4774880	agents. You know, you can have an algorithm that causes this thing to do A or B, but does it really
4774880	4781760	care? You know, does AlphaGo really care that it wins, right? So the problem with this question of
4781760	4787360	does it really care, like a lot of problems, you start to see the limitations of our categories
4787360	4795760	when you think about the chimeric case. So I can take cells out of a brain, an animal brain,
4796720	4802400	and we can connect them in culture to some sort of device that has machine learning or whatever.
4802400	4808880	And now, if those cells had some sort of magic intrinsic caring that enable human brains to
4808880	4815200	care about things, does that now carry over to the machine? Because this new sort of compound
4815200	4820080	organism has some of that. And what is it about? You know, can you take out the human pleasure
4820080	4825360	center and culture it alone in addition? Is it just activated all day long? And if you've got like
4825360	4831840	a little chunk of happiness there in addition, these kinds of things are really important.
4831840	4839680	These chimeric constructions are really important to push us to develop better concepts, because
4839680	4845600	we don't know really what it means to have intrinsic preferences or how they might carry
4845600	4850240	over to hybrid devices. All of that needs a lot of overhaul.
4850480	4855760	Well, I'm looking forward to our brave new cyborg future that you've outlined for us here.
4855760	4860160	It's certainly, certainly things are changing really, really rapidly and we're not able to
4860160	4863360	really predict where it's going to go, even though apparently that's what we're supposed
4863360	4866960	to be doing, having a goal and trying to get there. So, Mike Levine, thanks so much for
4866960	4877680	being on the Mindscape podcast. Thank you very much. Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.
