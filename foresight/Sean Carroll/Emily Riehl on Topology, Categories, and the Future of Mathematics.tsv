0	3680	Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll.
3680	9200	We've done a lot of sort of science on the podcast over the years, as it were. The podcast is old
9200	13200	enough, I can now say over the years. Wow, that's pretty impressive. And doing science, when you
13200	18480	try to talk about science to an audience, which is not necessarily full of specialists in that
18480	24640	particular kind of science, what do you do? How do you talk about science to non-scientists? Well,
24640	29680	the very first thing you do is you strip out all the math, right? You assume that the people
29680	34560	listening are not necessarily familiar with the equations, the symbols, the manipulations that
34560	39840	the professional scientists have to go through to understand their field. But you can nevertheless,
39840	44160	even without the math, you can talk about the concepts that the scientists are dealing with.
44800	51120	This raises a puzzle when the thing you want to talk about is math. We haven't talked about math
51120	56400	as a pure subject that much here on Mindscape. We did talk to Steven Strogatz, who's a professional
56400	61920	mathematician, but he's very close to being a physicist in many ways. We haven't quite ascended
61920	68560	to the truly abstract realms of very pure mathematics. So that's what we're doing here today.
68560	74320	Pure mathematics, no equations, but we're going to try to talk about the concepts that you come
74320	80160	across at the most elevated realms of mathematical thought. Our guest today is Emily Reel, who is
80160	86160	a topologist at Johns Hopkins, and she's a very big believer in being able to conceptualize these
86160	92160	deep mathematical ideas in the simplest and best way possible. So she's a great person to guide us
92160	97120	on this tour. And the foundational idea we're going to be talking about is topology.
97120	102960	Topology is the study of the properties of mathematical spaces that are invariant when
102960	109040	you smush them, when you smoothly deform them a little bit, right? Like if you have some clay
109040	114320	that is molded into a shape, you can talk about the number of holes in the shape of clay that you
114320	119280	have. And then if you move around the clay a little bit, if you don't rip it, the number of holes will
119280	125440	remain constant. So that's a topological invariant. It turns out, and this is where the fun part comes,
125440	132240	that as a mathematician you want to say, okay, what do we mean by characterizing the qualities
132240	138080	of a mathematical space that are invariant under smooth deformations? Well, you can count the
138080	144240	holes. You can also say, well, how many times can I make a path that wraps around the holes in
144240	151680	this particular system? Those kinds of structures turn out to be numbers or transformations or
151680	158160	other things that we can add together and multiply together. And we build these mathematical algebraic
158160	164320	structures by asking the question, how do we topologically characterize these kinds of spaces?
164320	170400	So we're led from topology into algebra. And Emily's going to take us there. We're going to discuss
170400	176480	things like homotopy, groups, rings, group oids, all these words that you're not supposed to have
176480	181600	necessarily been familiar with already. We're going to discuss them. And by the end, we're getting
181600	186960	into what is called category theory. Category theory is something where even the other mathematicians
186960	192960	go, oh, no, that's too abstract for me. Category theory is sort of a general theory of spaces and
192960	198560	structures and maps between them. It provides a different way of thinking about mathematics as a
198560	204000	whole. So I'm a big believer that, you know, math, just like physics, is part of the general
204000	209280	intellectual conversation we should be having. There should be history and economics and math
209280	214880	and physics. And it would be a mistake to exclude math from this overall intellectual discourse.
214880	219920	And I think this conversation is a good example of how we can do it. You know, thinking like a
220000	224640	mathematician gives you new handles on the world just like thinking like a physicist does. And
224640	246080	so I think it's going to be fun. Let's go. Emily Reel, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
246560	250320	Thank you. You know, I know that as a physicist, as a theoretical physicist,
250320	253840	who thinks about the universe and the many worlds of quantum mechanics and so forth,
254640	259040	I'm often asked, like, what is the point of this? You know, are you making a better cell
259040	263280	phone or are you carrying cancer? Like, why are you doing this? And I have my own answers. But
263280	268240	as a mathematician who works on topology category, things like that, you must also
268240	271680	get this. So what is your, do you have a favorite answer to that kind of question?
272000	278320	Sure. I mean, my dad loves to ask me what the practical applications are about the math I
278320	283360	love to think about. And I think he knows that he's kind of needling me because, you know,
283360	288240	that's just, it's just not the point for all mathematicians. I mean, for some, of course,
288240	295360	it is, you know, there are very important uses of mathematics to make the world a better place.
295360	299280	But I guess a way that mathematics can make the world a better place is by making it a
299280	305280	more interesting place to be a conscious being. And that's how I, or that's what inspires me
305280	309360	to be a mathematician. Yeah. Good. No, I think I, I'm not going to say that's the right answer,
309360	313120	because like you say, different people have different answers, but that's analogous to my
313120	317120	answer. And people ask me about looking for the Higgs boson. And so many of my physics friends
317120	322320	will say like, well, it might someday inspire a new technological something. I'm like, no,
322320	326160	number one, no, it won't. And number two, that's not why we're doing it. We're doing it because
326240	331680	we want to find out what's going on. And if there's an application someday, that'll be a benefit.
332960	337600	The other preliminary question I wanted to ask, I just had a podcast episode a couple of weeks ago
337600	343840	about the philosophy of mathematics. And, you know, there's realism versus non realism,
343840	350400	Platonism versus, I don't know, anti-platonism. I'm told that most working mathematicians are
350400	356320	Platonists. They think of what they study as, in some sense, real. Do you, do you know or care
356320	362480	or have a take on that debate? I certainly don't know as much about it as some of your other
362480	369840	guests, but I agree with that instinct. I mean, the things that I think about and I dream about
369840	374720	and I talk about with my friends feel very real to me. And, you know, I don't expect that I'll
374720	379840	kind of trip over one on my walk to campus, but, you know, they feel as real to me as,
380480	385360	I mean, as anything else. I mean, I guess as I understand it, that, you know, a table that
385360	391840	seems like a solid real thing is not really real either. So, yes, I subscribe to Platonism.
392400	396800	Well, yeah, I mean, there's certainly some structure to math, right? Like we all agree,
396800	401520	given the axioms, where we go and so forth. So there's something there. I actually don't have
401600	405040	a strong opinion one way or the other. That's why I'm quizzing people these days. But
405600	410320	actually, I mean, there's a philosophy of mathematics that's maybe a little closer to
410320	414000	the point of view of category theory, which we'll get into later on, which goes by the name of
414000	423120	structuralism, which says that, you know, what a mathematical object really is, is determined by
423120	431920	the role that it plays within mathematics. So, for example, you know, you could ask,
431920	439040	what are the natural numbers, you know, zero, one, two, three, four, five, and a role that
440720	445520	the natural numbers play within mathematics, I could give it a fancy name, I could say they're
445520	449760	the kind of universal discrete dynamical system. But essentially what that means is,
450640	457120	you know, natural numbers are something you can recursively define functions on. If you have,
457120	463920	if you're trying to define a, you know, sort of a sequence of points or a sequence of real numbers,
464560	469120	what you, a strategy, you know, Fibonacci sequence, for instance, is a famous sequence,
469120	476480	one, one, two, three, five, eight, 13, 21, 34. The relative terms converge to the golden ratio,
476720	480720	there's a lot of fun properties in Fibonacci, but a strategy for defining a sequence
480720	485440	is you define the first term in the sequence, or maybe the first few terms, and then you give
486320	492640	formula or a strategy for producing the next term in the sequence from the terms you have
492640	499120	previously. And the fact that recursion is possible is telling us something very deep
499120	505280	about the role that natural numbers play in mathematics. And so I guess I'm of the point
505280	508800	of view of like, that's what the natural numbers are. They are sort of the thing that you can
508800	515200	recursively define functions on. How, quite how that fits with Platonism isn't entirely clear to me,
515200	519600	but yeah, I don't know, me neither. I did have a guest a while ago, James Ladiman, who's a philosopher,
519600	525040	who says the same thing about physics. He is a structural realist. He thinks that what really
525040	529680	matters are the different structures, not the objects that we attribute these structures to,
529680	534640	relating between. I don't, great. It sounds like he's a category theorist. So it could be.
534640	538800	Aren't we all a category theorist? We're moving in that direction. So we will get to there. But
538800	544720	I think that you had, as we were talking about what to discuss here, I think you had a strategy
544720	550480	that makes perfect sense of starting with topology, because topology is something everyone has heard
550480	554400	of, right? I mean, why don't I, rather than trying to guess, why don't you tell us what you think
554400	561680	the definition of topology is that we could all get our hands on? Great. So topology is the study
561760	567520	of spaces, both, you know, kind of physical geometrical spaces that we move in in the world,
567520	574240	but also spaces that you might imagine that, you know, have some resemblance to, you know,
574240	579840	Euclidean space, three dimensions, two dimensions, one dimension, but are somehow more exotic.
580640	589520	So a topological space could be, you know, for instance, the points on a plane is an example
589600	595280	of a topological space, or you can imagine the points that are on the surface of a sphere,
595280	600480	so the surface of a soccer ball, surface of the earth, or you can imagine the points that are
600480	606960	on the surface of a donut. You can imagine that you're an ant that sort of walks around a donut
606960	613120	and all the different configurations that ant could be in those describe points in a topological
613120	620160	space, and then you can start to compare what those worlds are like. Topology is a realm to do
620160	625520	that. Can I just ask very quickly, when mathematicians use the word space, obviously it doesn't
625520	629600	simply mean the three-dimensional space in which we live. What's the difference between space and set?
630640	638160	Right. So if I wanted to define a topological space formally in mathematics, I would start with a set
638160	647120	of points. So if I wanted to describe three-dimensional Euclidean space, I would start with the set
647120	652640	of points which are determined by three real coordinates, sort of a distance along the x-axis,
652640	658400	a distance along the y-axis, a distance along the z-axis. So that's a set of points. We can
658400	663680	think of them as the points in three-dimensional space. But then what turns a set into a topological
663680	669680	space is also a way to understand distances between points, or more generally understand when
669680	675920	points are nearby and when points are far apart. So that could be a function that tells you how
675920	681520	to compute the distance between two points. That's a metric space, which is an important type of
681520	686480	topological space, or there's a more abstract way to get at the same thing in the absence of a formula
686560	695760	for distances. Okay. And so a line is a space, a circle is a space, a sphere. So for mathematicians,
695760	699520	the sphere is just the surface of the sphere, right? It's not the interior. Like you said, the
699520	705600	two-dimensional sphere is the surface of the ball. And then you could have like a 100-dimensional
705600	710000	sphere or whatever. So there's a lot of spaces we have to play with. You can have Mobius bands. So
710480	718320	that's a space that's kind of like a cylinder. So it's like a toilet paper tube. But imagine you
718960	724800	cut the toilet paper tube sort of long ways from end to end. So now you have just a flat
725440	732960	strip, and then you twist it and then glue it back together. So that is also a space. It's
732960	740720	quite similar to the cylinder, but it's a non-orientable space. It's confusing in a Mobius
740720	745920	strip, whether you're on the inside or the outside. There's no way to decide that. Whereas on, you
745920	749440	know, the toilet paper tube, there's the outside where the toilet paper goes around, and then
749440	754240	there's the inside, which you sort of put on the roll, on the holder. Do you have one of those
754240	761840	Klein bottle sculptures? I have a Klein bottle sculpture. I don't, but right. So a Klein bottle
761840	766400	is a one-dimension higher version of this. And what's interesting about the Klein bottle is,
769680	776720	well, so it's a surface. It's kind of like the surface of a sphere. Let me describe how you
776720	784480	would build a Klein bottle. So you can start with a flat sheet of paper. You would glue two sides
784480	792000	of the paper together. So you're forming now a toilet paper tube. And then, so from there, kind of
792000	797760	a simpler construction that isn't the Klein bottle, as you could just sort of stretch the toilet paper
797760	802720	tube and glue the end circles together. And if you did that, you would get a surface of a doughnut
802720	807360	shape. So that's familiar. The torus. We can use the word torus. It's okay. Okay, we can use the
807360	812320	word torus. So if I want to get a Klein bottle, it's the same idea. I'm going to glue the two ends
812320	817680	of the toilet paper tube together, glue those two circular ends together. But I want to twist
818560	825520	the one. So if I'm gluing, if I'm walking around, when I glue them together, I'm sort of zipping up
825520	829440	the, going counterclockwise around one of the circles and clockwise around the other circle.
829440	834000	But I want to reverse the orientation on one of the circles before doing this. Now, you can't do
834000	840000	this in three-dimensional space. So if we were in a fourth dimension, you could actually embed a Klein
840000	844880	bottle into four-dimensional space and do this construction. But there are, there are these
844880	849280	toys that you should, you should just, everyone should just Google and there are these toy glass
849280	857040	versions. And what's fun about it is there's some ambiguity between what space is inside of a Klein
857040	861600	bottle and what is outside. So if you, you have a torus, like a glass doughnut, you could sort of
861600	866640	fill it with jelly. And the jelly is inside the torus. It's not outside, you know, until you bite
866800	870560	it, you're not going to get jelly everywhere. But if you have one of these Klein bottles,
871520	876160	you could try and put, you know, jelly or let's say Kool-Aid inside the Klein bottle. And if you're
876160	880640	not careful, if you sort of flip it upside down and flip it right side up again, it's going to get
880640	886400	all over your, your chest because there's no inside and outside. Yeah. And this is the stock and trade
886400	892480	of topologists, right? So you don't care so much about the individual bumps and wiggles like geometry
892480	897840	cares about. Topology is more loosey-goosey in what it cares about. Exactly. Yeah. Very loosey-goosey.
898560	903440	And so, but the, the other thing to get on the table, I guess, is that there are topological
903440	908960	spaces that we care about. Well, maybe they're inspired by real physical situations, but you
908960	913920	might think that, well, physical space is three dimensional and we can have subsets of that.
913920	918720	Therefore, you know, there's some topological spaces to think about, but not that many. But as
918720	922880	you point out, like there are complicated situations where the space of all possible
922880	928080	configurations of something is an interesting topological space. Yeah, totally. So, I mean,
928080	933840	one of my favorite sources of examples of topological spaces are something called configuration
933840	938080	spaces. And these come up in robotics. They come up in physics where they might be called
938640	944320	state spaces. And exactly as you point out, these can get very high dimension very quick. But let me
944400	950080	mention an example that's small enough that we can dream about it. So, you know, imagine you have
950080	956080	a factory and there's a sort of one-dimensional track on the floor in the factory. So there's a,
956640	962240	there's a strip, essentially. And, you know, maybe it's a kind of a wheel or like a train
962240	966400	track. You can move forward and backwards along that track. And we're going to have two robots
966400	972800	positioned on the track. There's a red robot and a blue robot. So, well, let's actually start with
972800	978960	one robot. So if you wanted to, if you had one robot on a track, then you can describe its positions,
979920	984400	you know, using just kind of a one dimension. It's like an interval. You can have the robot
984400	988400	all the way, one end or all the way at the other end or any place in between. It can move continuously.
988400	993520	So this one-dimensional interval is describing the space of configurations of that robot.
994160	1000800	So now let's put two robots on the track, a red one and a blue one. And now there's a space that
1000880	1006560	describes the configurations of those two robots. I mean, you might think it's a one-dimensional space
1006560	1011440	because you're still, robots are still on this one-dimensional track. But actually, you know,
1011440	1015680	you should use kind of one coordinate to keep track of where the red robot is and another
1015680	1021280	coordinate to keep track of where the blue robot is. And so that is describing the space that's
1021280	1025440	formed by taking a product of an interval with itself. In other words, it's a square, including
1025440	1032160	the interior, except the two robots can't be in the same spot. You know, one, you know, that if
1032160	1037040	these are physical robots, they can't collide into each other. So you have to remove a diagonal
1037040	1044400	segment from that square. And what you're left is with these two triangular components. The bottom
1044400	1048880	triangle corresponds to the red robot being on the right of the blue robot. And the top triangle
1048880	1054000	corresponds to the red robot being on the left of the blue robot. And so what's interesting about
1054000	1058160	the space, what we can see already by visualizing the configuration space, which is this square
1058160	1063360	with a diagonal removed from it, is that it's disconnected. Once you've put your robots on the
1063360	1068400	track, you're not going to be able to swap their orientation with respect to each other.
1068400	1069360	That's right.
1069920	1074400	But, you know, if you're designing the factory, you might say, well, that's a little bit undesirable.
1074400	1078880	I don't have as much flexibility and improvement, perhaps in the design, depending, of course,
1078880	1081920	what you're trying to do with these robots on this track is you could make a circular track
1081920	1088880	instead of a, you know, straight track. And if you a circle is also a one dimensional object,
1088880	1092240	you just sort of move around it going clockwise. There's kind of one direction of motion.
1093760	1099360	But if you had two robots on a circular track, then what the way you describe their configuration
1099360	1104400	space is you would take, you know, each robot is some arbitrary point in the circle. We have two
1104400	1110320	circles, though. So we take the product of those two circles. And this is fun to think about that
1110320	1115440	actually, the product of two circles corresponds to the points on the surface of a torus again.
1116480	1121360	So S1 cross S1, the product of two circles are the points on the torus. Again, the robots can't
1121360	1125120	be on the same point. So what you have to do is you have to imagine you have the surface of a
1125120	1130480	torus, you built it by gluing together your toilet paper tube. Now you're going to make a diagonal
1130480	1140320	cut that, it's a cut that goes around sort of both loops in the torus once. So you actually did
1140320	1146720	this at home last night to test it in the way my toilet paper tube was made. Had a seam exactly
1146720	1151920	there. So it was easy to see that cut. It's sort of a diagonal cut that moves once around in both
1151920	1156880	directions. And if you do that, you're left with a connected surface. And that corresponds to the
1156960	1161600	idea that if you have two robots on a circular track, they can really visit all configurations.
1161600	1168320	There's no sort of left and right anymore. You can have them in any position. So anyway, this is
1168320	1174880	just sort of baby, baby examples of a really rich and beautiful subject. Some of the most difficult
1174880	1181200	and important decisions we make involve choosing people, whether it's choosing a PhD thesis advisor

1240480	1247920	that don't change by like small deformations of the space. So the fact that a space is in two
1247920	1252720	disconnected components like the original example versus just being one connected component like
1252720	1257440	the second example, that's the kind of thing that gets topologists very excited. Right, so when I
1257440	1261600	say circular track, it could be an oval track, it could be a square track, it could be a hexagonal
1261600	1266080	track from a topologist, those are all the same. The famous thing I bet many people have heard
1266080	1271040	that to a topologist, a coffee cup is the same as a donut, right? Because they're both tourists.
1271760	1275920	Right, right. I mean, that's not that's not my favorite example, because
1277360	1281680	so topologists have different notions of when things are the same that we're alluding to.
1281680	1289680	And one of the notions of sameness is if two spaces are what's called homeomorphic.
1289680	1295600	And what homeomorphic means is that there is a sort of one-to-one correspondence between the
1295600	1300560	points and the space. There's a way, you know, there are two invertible functions, invertible
1300560	1305040	continuous functions that map all the points on one space to the other and the other to the one.
1305040	1311760	And so if you have a solid tourist now built out of clay, and you have a solid coffee cup,
1312800	1317520	you can define one of these homeomorphisms, this sort of one-to-one correspondence between
1317520	1324640	the points and the tourists and the points in the mug that are continuous so that you're not
1324640	1329280	tearing the surface as a part or adding new holes where there weren't holes before, that sort of thing.
1330720	1337440	So, I mean, it's true that topologists consider tourists and a coffee mug to be the same, but
1337440	1342960	for like really kind of obvious reason, they're just so evidently the same. But there's another
1342960	1347440	notion of sameness, a weaker notion of sameness that also comes up in topology, which is called
1347520	1352960	homotopy equivalence. And here are the ideas, two spaces are homotopy equivalent if you can
1352960	1360240	continuously deform one to another. And so let me give you some examples. So, all of Euclidean
1360240	1364480	space, you know, three-dimensional Euclidean space is homotopy equivalent to a single point.
1365360	1370160	So, you could imagine, I think of this homotopy equivalence as like the reverse Big Bang. So,
1370720	1375360	you imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space, you know, so you have, let's imagine we have the
1375360	1379280	origin point, so the center of the universe and then all the other points in the universe. I
1379280	1382080	realize the universe is probably not three-dimensional, but let's just bear with me here.
1382080	1384640	Also, it doesn't have a center, but that's okay, we're gonna, your method.
1384640	1387840	And Orinor does have a center, but let's pretend there's a center of the universe and the universe
1387840	1391920	is three-dimensional. So, in the reverse Big Bang, what I'm going to do is I'm going to continuously
1391920	1396800	move all the points in the universe back in a straight line to the center of the universe,
1396800	1401680	to the origin. And they'll move kind of faster, slower depending on how far away they are. So,
1401760	1405840	at time zero, every point is where it is. And then at time one, they've all
1405840	1411600	crashed home into the center of the universe. So, that is describing a continuous deformation
1411600	1419520	that reveals that three-dimensional Euclidean space and the point are the same. So, here's an
1419520	1423920	example, sort of everyday example of a homotopy equivalence that feels more fun to me than the...
1425200	1429680	Let me just butt in there because, so just to get it clear, the reason why this is an
1429680	1435760	interesting example is because the point and three-dimensional space are homotopy equivalent.
1435760	1440800	They can be... One can be continuously deformed to the other, but they're not homeomorphic because
1440800	1445680	there's not sort of an equal number of points in them. Yeah, right. There's uncountably infinitely
1445680	1449200	many points in three-dimensional space, but there's one point in one point space. And yeah,
1449200	1454240	so this is a cooler, way more destructive notion. I mean, dimensions totally don't matter anymore.
1454240	1458160	You know, all n-dimensional Euclidean space is also homotopy equivalent to a point.
1458560	1464000	Yeah. So, an example, an everyday example that is kind of like that is to a topologist,
1464000	1469920	a pair of pants and a thong are the same. You can imagine a homotopy equivalence that sort of,
1470800	1476560	you know, shrinks sort of vertically, I guess, you know, and just leaves the thong from the
1476560	1482400	pair of pants. And this is the... So, the point is that there are different ways of expressing
1482400	1487040	the idea of sameness, depending on your sort of level of focus on what you care about.
1487040	1492000	Yeah, totally, totally. And this is very pervasive in mathematics. You know, mathematicians
1492880	1496560	love trying to understand the sense in which things are the same and it's often a pretty loose
1496560	1502240	sense. So, I had a very, very brief career, in fact, as a hack topologist when I was in graduate
1502240	1507760	school and I needed to calculate the homotopy of various things that appear in particle physics
1507760	1511760	because we have these things called topological defects, right, which are very important from
1511760	1516160	the early universe. None of the things I calculated turn it out to be relevant to the real world,
1516160	1521760	but, you know, that's the risk that we take when we do these things. But it gets us into, you know,
1522800	1526960	so far it's been fun, homotopy, you know, smoothly deforming things into each other,
1526960	1530960	but now we want to be a little bit more rigorous about it. We want to characterize,
1531760	1537360	we want to use this notion of smoothly deforming one thing into another to characterize the topology
1537360	1543600	of different spaces, right? I mean, is in some sense our job to sort of characterize all topological
1543600	1550240	spaces? Yeah, exactly. And a way to, a classical problem, which is a good way to visualize this,
1550240	1556320	is you can ask how many different surfaces are there, you know, sort of in this sort of very
1556320	1563680	flexible sense. So, not necessarily just, so for instance, is we've described a few different
1563680	1570400	surfaces. There's the sort of surface of a sphere. There's a surface of a torus. You can have many
1570400	1574800	hold, the torus was the donut shape. You can imagine having many hold donuts, they're like,
1574800	1578560	you know, you're baking a tray of donuts, but you've put them too close to each other. And so
1578560	1582480	they've all kind of congealed and there's, you know, one donut with three holes in it, you know,
1582480	1588960	that's another surface. And there's a classification question, you know, how can we tell that these
1588960	1595920	spaces are really different? I mean, they seem different, perhaps maybe I'm giving away my
1595920	1599520	intuition, but they seem different, you know, how, but how do we prove that they're different?
1599520	1603680	Because we've seen that these wildly different spaces are, in some sense, the same.
1604560	1606320	Yeah. So, so how do we do that?
1608080	1614640	So, yeah, so, so the idea is, I mean, this, this is a hard question to answer geometrically, because
1615200	1619040	just because you can't imagine a continuous deformation of one space to the other doesn't
1619040	1628880	mean it doesn't exist. So, strategy is to bring algebra into the story somehow and give a way to
1628960	1638000	assign a number or some other kind of algebraic structure to a topological space. And if,
1638720	1643440	in a way, that would give the same answer if the spaces were homotopy equivalent. So,
1644480	1651280	so the homology groups or homotopy groups that there are various different constructions you
1651280	1656560	can do. And it's, it's easy to prove that if the spaces have continuously deformable into each other,
1656560	1660400	they'll produce the same invariance. And so, if you happen to get different invariance,
1660400	1663920	then you know that they were different. Right. So, actually, go ahead.
1665040	1668080	Well, I can give an example of this. Yeah, exactly, do that.
1668640	1674240	So, what I'm going to try and argue for you is that the surface of a sphere,
1674240	1679840	so the surface of a soccer ball, is a different space than the surface of a donut. So, a torus
1679840	1685360	and a sphere are different topological spaces. And just to make sure we're imagining these spaces,
1685360	1691360	again, you know, imagine you're an ant walking around the surface of a sphere, that's one space,
1691360	1695360	the different positions the ant could be, or you can imagine an ant walking around the surface of
1695360	1699040	a donut. Not the interior in either case, just the surface. Not the interior in either case,
1699040	1703280	right. The ant, the ant can't eat the donut or eat the sphere, the ant is sort of stuck on the
1703280	1712080	surface. And it can't like jump off either, it's, you know, okay. So, right. So, the invariant that
1712160	1716400	I'm going to use to prove that these are different is something called the fundamental group,
1716400	1723360	that is, it's a, and what it's counting essentially. So, in each, it's for convenience,
1723360	1728000	I'm going to pick a point on each of these spaces. These spaces are connected. So,
1728000	1732960	picking a point is not a big deal. So, pick whichever one you want. We'll take the north pole on the
1734320	1739040	sphere and any point at all on the torus. And what the fundamental group is going to
1739040	1744800	calculate is the number of essentially different ways that the ant can walk from this home base
1744800	1752480	point, walk around on the surface and come back to the home base point. So, the subtlety there,
1752480	1756720	as I said, the number of essentially different ways. So, I mean, they're uncountably infinitely
1756720	1761680	many ways an ant can walk around the surfaces, but what I'm asking are they essentially different?
1761680	1765520	And so, let's set aside the sphere example for now. Let's start by thinking about the surface
1765520	1770720	of the donut. Okay. So, an example of two ways that are essentially different is we can imagine
1771280	1777280	starting at our home base point and walking, you know, say in a counterclockwise direction
1778000	1783120	around the loop that goes through the sort of donut hole. If you put a donut hole inside the
1783120	1788800	donut, that's, you can imagine walking, it's sort of been a vertical. The short way around, basically.
1789280	1793040	The short way around, great. So, that's one way the ant could walk.
1795920	1803360	Or the ant could walk, let's say, tracing the same trajectory, but going in reverse orientation,
1803360	1809920	going backwards rather than forwards. So, those are fundamentally different. And what I mean
1809920	1815360	by fundamentally different is there's no way to continuously deform the first trajectory
1816000	1822640	into the second trajectory while staying on the surface of the donut. If I could sort of slice
1822640	1829680	through, you know, where the dough bit of the donut is, I could do that. I could sort of cut
1829680	1834400	through the bit that's not on the surface, but that's not allowed. So, walking in the surface,
1834400	1837440	once the ant decides it's going clockwise rather than counterclockwise,
1839440	1844560	those are different choices that the ant can make. In fact, they're homotopically
1844560	1849200	inequivalent, right? So, because you cannot continuously deform one into another.
1850480	1854720	What's cool is you can actually enumerate all of the different choices. So,
1854720	1858400	another different trajectory the ant could take is it could walk the long way around. So, let's say,
1858400	1863600	staying on the top and going clockwise or going counterclockwise. Or it can do some sort of
1864240	1869360	combination where it loops, you know, some number of times through the center circle while also
1869360	1877760	traversing the long way around. And there's a way to enumerate all of these essentially
1877760	1882000	different trajectories. What you need are two different integers, essentially. One integer
1882000	1888080	that's describing the number of times you go in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction around
1888080	1893280	the short loop. And then another integer is describing the number of ways to go counterclockwise
1893280	1898560	or clockwise depending on whether it's positive or negative around the long loop. And you can prove
1898560	1908800	that this pair of integers enumerates all possible trajectories. So, on the sphere,
1909600	1915120	it's actually quite a lot simpler. So, if you have, you can imagine any path the ant might
1915120	1918720	take on the surface of a sphere from the north pole to the north pole, kind of wandering around
1918720	1926320	any which way. And you could kind of shrink that trajectory in a continuous way.
1926640	1932880	Sort of so that it gets smaller and smaller and smaller. So, if it in fact goes all the way to
1932880	1937040	the south pole, maybe it shrinks a little bit so it only goes to the equator and then maybe it
1937040	1942400	shrinks a little more so it stays north of the Tropic of Cancer and so on and so forth. And
1942960	1947760	eventually all of the trajectories are deformable to just the ants sitting at the north pole and
1947760	1953920	never moving at all. So, there there's only one trajectory that the ant can make. And that's
1953920	1959840	the proof somehow that these two spaces are not the same. Which is wonderful because it took
1959840	1964480	us on a little journey. I actually want to dig into this because on the one hand we're not surprised
1964480	1968960	that the sphere and the tourists are topologically different, but it was a bit of an effort there
1968960	1975360	to actually show it, right? Even in that case where we had things under control. And in doing that,
1975360	1979280	you know, you stumble across, so you ask the question, how many different ways are there to
1979280	1985200	sort of do this path that returns to itself? A loop, right? A closed circle in this space.
1985200	1992720	And in the case of the tourists, you just uncovered this pair of integers, the number of
1992720	1996800	times you go around the short way, the number of times you go around the long way. And integers,
1996800	2001680	not to not to get too fancy about it, now that's algebra. That's not geometry or topology or
2001680	2008240	anything. Like, roughly speaking, mathematicians are either geometers and they like space or their
2008240	2014000	algebraists and they like equations, right? But an algebraic structure appeared here somehow.
2015840	2020560	Right. I think, you know, this is just the tale of complexity in the modern world. Like,
2020560	2025280	everybody has to be everything these days. So even if your heart isn't with geometry,
2025280	2030400	you have to use some algebra. Well, I want to just take advantage of your being here to dig
2030400	2036640	into this a little bit more. I mean, we asked this question about how many ways you can draw a
2036640	2041840	circle, roughly speaking, in the tourists. And there's a lot of ways, but then there's this
2041840	2048800	hidden structure in that if you have a circle going around once in one direction and another
2048800	2053760	circle just doing the same thing, you can add them together in some sense, right? And that's
2053760	2060320	the beginning of algebra. Am I too dramatic there? Yeah, that's exactly right. So a more,
2062240	2065680	I mean, I've described this in describing the fundamental group, I said, you know,
2065680	2071200	let's imagine we have a home base point where they, and we're going to consider the ant walking
2071200	2075200	in these little loops from the home base to the home base, but it's actually maybe more natural
2075200	2080400	to not have a home base point because, you know, I don't know where it would be on the surface of
2080400	2085360	a tourist, for instance. So another way to think about this sort of algebraic structure is you
2085360	2091760	can imagine an ant walking from any point P on the surface to any other point Q on the surface,
2091840	2096560	it, you know, takes some path. And then later, you know, maybe the ant is tired and it takes
2096560	2100800	a nap, but then later it wakes up and then it walks from the point Q to some other point R.
2101760	2106240	And what you're referring to is you could then compose those two paths, compose those two
2107120	2111920	trajectories and then get a path directly from P to R. So if you can walk from P to Q and walk
2111920	2116880	from Q to R, you can compose those two walks and get from P to R. And that's the beginning. So this
2116880	2124240	is a composition operation on the paths and the surface of a tourist or on any space, paths in
2124240	2134640	any space. And really the sort of invariant that more exactly describes the algebra that's hidden
2134640	2140080	in the geometry is something called the fundamental groupoid or the fundamental infinity groupoid,
2140080	2145280	which is not a group, which is a type of mathematical object we teach undergraduates,
2145840	2150720	but an sort of infinite dimensional analog of a group and infinity groupoid, which is a,
2150720	2155840	you know, sort of frontier of research level mathematics. Right. I think that it, look, if
2155840	2160720	people are going to listen to this entire podcast episode, I want them to come away knowing what
2160720	2164320	an infinity groupoid is. I think that's going to be something that they'll be able to impress their
2164320	2168640	friends with at cocktail parties and so forth. So you but to go very slowly to get there, you know,
2168640	2173920	you mentioned the fundamental group, which is the collection of the circles we started with. So
2173920	2185520	what's a group? Right. So a group is, I mean, a way to, I mean, this, like it, there's this,
2188400	2193040	there's this metaphor of the blind men and the elephant and, you know, somebody's holding,
2193040	2197360	somebody's touching the trunk, somebody's touching one of the legs, somebody's touching the tail and
2197360	2200480	have a completely different perspective of it. And that's, that's how I'm thinking about groups.
2200480	2208800	So it's like really hard to know how to start. But, you know, a group in this context is a set.
2208800	2214800	Here it's the collection of all different loops that aunt could take walking through some space,
2215520	2221040	together with a composition operation. So it's performing one loop and then following it by
2221040	2225200	another loop that can be understood as a loop. Even though you come back through the center,
2225200	2232800	it's still a loop and then satisfying some, you know, sort of very natural axioms. So if you're
2232800	2238320	walking along a loop, you could always reverse your trajectory and walk back in the other direction.
2238320	2243120	And that's an undoing somehow of the process. So every element in a group has an inverse
2243760	2249520	that if you compose with it, it gets back to sort of where you started. And a few sort of simple
2249520	2255680	axioms like that. So it's kind of a, it's a stripped down version of, you know, the integers
2255680	2259680	or something like that, right? Where the integers, you can add them together. So the integers are
2259680	2264720	an example of a group, right? Right. Integers with addition is an example of a group. Absolutely.
2264720	2268400	That's right. Not with multiplication. Matrices with multiplication is an example of a group.
2269280	2275040	Matrices with addition is an example of a group. So I have to say something about the dimensions
2275040	2282320	to make those examples work. But okay. And the physicists love group theory because symmetries
2282320	2287120	are a group, right? Like rotations and translations and things like that. Yeah, absolutely. So another
2287120	2293600	perspective on groups, if we sort of move around the elephant is a group is an axiomatization of
2295120	2300960	the symmetries of an object. So, so, or the different configurations that an object might be.
2300960	2306960	So let me, let me explain what a symmetry is. So, so imagine you have a twin mattress and you know
2306960	2310480	that you're supposed to kind of flip your, your mattress occasionally, because I guess it's good
2310480	2315120	for the life of the mattress. And so you might wonder, like, how many different ways are there
2315120	2319360	to flip the mattress? How many different configurations could the mattress be in? And
2320560	2325760	well, it's the mattress, one option is whatever the mattress is when you start it. Then you could
2326400	2331680	sort of rotate it head to toe. So you're sort of switching the head and the toe, but the top
2331680	2340720	stays the same. That's one move. You could also flip it sort of side to side. So I'm keeping the
2340720	2345680	head at the head and the toe at the toe, but I'm switching the top and the bottom. Yep. Or you
2345680	2349840	could combine those two operations. And the effect of this is the head is now where the toe was and
2349840	2356160	the toes were the head and the top and bottom surface has also flipped. So a group is recording
2356160	2362480	on the one hand, the four different positions that the mattress could be in, but also how these
2362480	2368080	different flipping operations that I described compose to each other. So each of those flips
2369120	2373360	is an order two element of the group, meaning if you perform the same move twice, you get the
2373360	2379600	mattress back to where you started. If you do any two different of the flips, you'll get the
2379680	2384400	third one, which is not a typical property of a group, but it's special to this one, which is,
2384400	2390000	goes by the name, the client for group. This group does not have a generator, meaning that
2390720	2395040	there's not one operation you can do over and over again that will take you all the way
2395040	2398880	through the group. And this is why it's hard to remember how to flip your mattress because
2399520	2403920	you have to remember sort of how you flipped it last month. So you don't just do the same operation
2403920	2409200	and again and get back to where you were the month before. So the integers do have a generator.
2409280	2413120	You just add one and then you can get all the integers either by doing that or undoing it.
2413120	2415680	Yeah. Add one or negative one, you get all the way through everything. So yes,
2415680	2420640	the integers are cyclic group, which have a single generator, absolutely, but client for group is not.
2422400	2426160	Right. So the integers may be two people who are not group theory,
2426160	2431120	Fischinados are a nice little paradigm, but it's important that groups can be very different. So
2431120	2436400	this is a finite group, this mattress flipping group, right? It's only how many elements are
2436400	2441680	there in the mattress? Yeah, four elements. Okay. Yeah. All right. And there's, so I mean,
2441680	2446800	these groups are super cool and really tell you something profound about geometry. So
2447360	2453120	you might have heard of the platonic solids, which are the three dimensional figures that you can get
2453120	2460000	by gluing together regular two dimensional figures. So a regular two dimensional figure is like a
2460000	2465920	triangle or a square or pentagon or a hexagon where all the sides have the same length,
2465920	2470480	all the angles are the same and so on and so forth. And there are infinitely many of these
2470480	2475520	because there's a heptagon and an octagon and a nonagon for any natural number N,
2475520	2481200	you can get a plain figure with N sides. So you might wonder how many of these regular
2481200	2489920	platonic solids are, how many different shapes you can get by gluing together, say triangles or
2489920	2494800	gluing together squares or gluing together pentagons or gluing together hexagons maybe.
2495360	2500960	And you can prove in fact that there are only finitely many. In fact, there are five of them
2501600	2508320	using group theory by studying the symmetries, the sort of orthogonal groups, the special
2508320	2512320	orthogonal groups that describe the different configurations of these hypothetical shapes.
2512320	2515760	Before even knowing they exist, you can limit the possible configurations.
2517200	2518960	But clearly that's not what Plato did.
2519200	2527440	I don't know, maybe somewhere like buried in Plato's intuition. But another fun fact is,
2527440	2532080	so the five, there's something called the tetrahedron, which is built from triangles. And
2532080	2536560	then there's the cube, which is that's the most familiar one built from squares. Then there's
2536560	2543040	the octahedron also built from triangles. And then the dodecahedron and the icosahedron. And
2543040	2547280	even though I named five things, in a sense there's kind of only three of them because
2548240	2552480	there's this duality relationship between the platonic solids, which you might have seen. If
2552480	2560720	you take a cube, so it's got four, so it's sorry, its faces are squares, there are six of them,
2560720	2566080	and they are glued together along 12 different edges, and there are eight corners. And what I'm
2566080	2572240	going to do is I'm going to build a new platonic solid by replacing each of the corners by a face,
2572320	2578320	and each face by a corner. And what you get in that, just by kind of connecting everything up,
2578320	2584800	is an octahedron, so one of the other platonic solids. And so there's a duality relationship
2584800	2589280	between the cube and the octahedron, and also between the dodecahedron and the icosahedron,
2589280	2593680	and between the tetrahedron and itself. And those are reflected by their symmetry groups.
2593680	2598320	So because of this duality relationship, the symmetry group that describes the configurations
2598320	2605840	of the cube is the same isomorphic to, same shape as the symmetry group of the octahedron, and so
2605840	2609600	on. Anyone who played Dungeons and Dragons knows about the platonic solids because they have a
2609600	2613040	dice, but they don't know about the duality relations. So now that's good, that's something
2613040	2619520	else that they have in their bag now. I'm only going to do this at great risk, but I figure,
2619520	2624800	like, all right, while we've talked about groups, why don't we also explain rings and fields to
2624800	2628800	the audience, since these are the other sort of algebraic structures that mathematicians love to
2628800	2634480	throw around. Yeah, absolutely. So I mean, what's funny is, you know, after a while, you kind of
2634480	2638320	forget that these terms refer to other things. Sorry, when I say field, I mean, I definitely
2638320	2641600	think about the mathematical field before. I remember that's like also the thing that's
2641600	2649040	out the window, but right. So a group is describing a setting where you have, you know,
2649040	2653600	a collection of objects, and you have one composition operation to combine them together.
2653600	2659200	So if we have the integers, we can think about addition. If you add two integers, you get another
2659200	2665520	integer. But, you know, there are other binary operations on the integers that come up, you
2665520	2670560	know, multiplication, for instance. And a ring is a setting where you have two operations,
2670560	2676640	an addition operation or an addition like operation and a multiplication like operation.
2676640	2684800	And they interact in ways that are sort of familiar for the integers. So if I, you can
2684800	2691840	understand, there's a distributivity property that says if I add two integers together, and then I
2691840	2697200	multiply by something, it's the same as multiplying first and then adding. And there are a few axioms
2697200	2702480	like that. So what's cool about, I mean, you might ask, like, why do we bother we like everybody
2702480	2707840	knows what the integers are? Why do I need this abstract concept of a ring? And that's a totally
2707840	2716080	fair question. But a really fun, or it's kind of interesting fact is there's a very deep analogy
2716080	2723520	between the integers and polynomials. So, so a polynomial is like this, this is sort of the
2723520	2729920	thing that you would meet in a high school algebra class. So you have a variable X, an indeterminate
2729920	2736560	variable X, and then you can form a polynomial by sort of adding up X's and multiplying X's and
2736560	2745840	then throwing in real numbers as the coefficients. So the polynomial might be like 5x minus 5x plus,
2745840	2752560	I don't know, 17x squared plus pi x cubed, because we can have real numbers as coefficients,
2752560	2761360	minus 3. So that's a polynomial in a single variable X. And polynomials also form a ring. If
2761360	2767120	you have two polynomials, you can add them together, you can multiply them. There's sort of rules for
2767120	2772400	doing this that you might have learned in a high school algebra class. And those ring, the ring of
2772400	2777200	polynomials with coefficients in a field, which we'll get to what a field is later on, coefficients
2777200	2782640	in the real numbers. And the ring of integers are very, are very quite similar as rings. They're
2782640	2788160	both, they have a division algorithm. You can do sort of long division with polynomials like with rings.
2790000	2795840	All the ideal elements are principles. And so, I mean, that's the sort of thing that's of interest
2795840	2799760	to mathematicians are these kind of deep analogies between structures that are superficially quite
2799760	2803680	different. Well, and what's the difference between a ring and a field? Because they're kind of similar.
2804320	2811920	Right. So a field is like a ring, it has two binary operations. But if we go back to the
2811920	2816160	ring of integers, there's a pretty big difference between the addition rule and the multiplication
2816160	2825040	rule. So if I, in that, every addition, every element has an additive inverse. So if I pick
2825040	2831680	my favorite integer, you know, 17, there's another integer, negative 17, that when I add them together,
2831760	2836640	I get zero, which is the identity for the addition operation. But that doesn't work for
2836640	2841760	multiplication. If I pick my favorite integer again, 17, there's no integer I can multiply
2843360	2849680	17 by to get back to one, which is the multiplicative identity. Right. So that's what distinguishes a
2849680	2855440	ring where you don't necessarily have multiplicative inverses from a field. In a field, you do have
2855440	2859680	an inverse to both the multiplication and the addition operation. You sort of assuming you're
2859680	2864400	not trying to divide by zero, that number quite works. So things like the rational numbers,
2864400	2869920	which throw in these multiplicative inverses or the real numbers are fields in addition to being
2869920	2876160	rings. And does the existence of the number zero get you in trouble? Because it doesn't have an
2876160	2883440	inverse? Yeah. So in a field, you have to treat zero as a kind of special case. So in a field,
2883440	2888800	you have to, your zero and your one can't be the same. Otherwise, the whole thing kind of collapses.
2889440	2893920	Zero will not have a multiplicative inverse, but every other element has to. Got it. Okay.
2893920	2898160	And so when we started, we started this little journey, this whole sidetrack, because we were
2898160	2904080	thinking about the torus and its topology. And we found that the space of all the little loops,
2904080	2912240	the ant could walk on, formed a group. Are there examples where we associate rings or fields with
2912240	2919680	topological invariance? That's a good question. I don't know that that's commonly done. And I
2919680	2927200	think the reason is that groups are just so rich, you know, but, you know, a single group will not
2927200	2932800	capture the full data of a topological space. I mean, really, what you have to do is have introduced
2932800	2937520	lots of different groups that are measuring lots of different things. So the fundamental group
2937520	2943920	tells you about sort of loops in the space and whether you can, if you sort of walk along a
2943920	2948800	circular path in the space, can you fill that in with a disk? You know, could you,
2951840	2954720	I guess I don't know how to say it any better than that. That's a good way to say it.
2954720	2958880	Can you contract it? You know, if you have sort of a wire ring, is there, could you put sort of a
2958880	2963680	soap bubble on it somehow so that the surface of the soap bubble lives within the space that you
2963680	2969280	were talking about? So that's not possible if you're walking the short way around on a torus,
2969280	2973760	because the soap bubble would have to kind of cut through the dough, and that's not on the surface.
2973760	2978880	But it is on the surface of a sphere, you could just kind of, you know, paint over the disk.
2980720	2985200	So that's measuring this kind of one-dimensional holds, I guess, is the
2987280	2991760	area that's bounded by a one-dimensional sphere. But as we mentioned, there are kind of spheres
2991760	2997360	in higher dimensions. So you could ask, if you have a balloon inside your surface,
2997360	3002320	can that be filled in with sand sort of staying within the surface? And that's a
3002320	3005520	two-dimensional analog of the same question. And there's a question like that in all
3006400	3014320	positive integer dimensions. And that family of groups describes the full homotopy type
3014320	3018560	of a space. A single group does not, but if you have this sort of infinitely many groups that
3018560	3023520	it does. One of the things that I say just very casually to people who are non-mathematicians is
3023520	3029040	that you might think that mathematicians spend all their time thinking about mathematical objects,
3029040	3032720	like spheres or toruses or whatever. But really, they're thinking about maps
3032720	3038480	between the different objects. So I guess it's fair to say that first thing, the fundamental group
3038480	3046720	is maps from circles into the space you care about. Then there's the set of maps from spheres,
3046720	3051280	and then the set of maps from three spheres, and it clearly generalizes to infinite numbers.
3051840	3058080	Yeah, absolutely. But there's something special about the groups. You don't get fields or rings,
3058080	3062880	which have two different binary operations on them. I guess the last thing that I have in that
3062880	3068080	angle is, is there something special about fields and rings that have two binary operations that
3068080	3074080	it's worth stopping there? Can we define three binary operations on a set and make hyper-rings
3074080	3083280	or something like that? Sure. Algebra is a very flexible subject. To define what an algebra is
3083280	3087760	in full generality, you need the collection of elements that you're considering, and then you
3087760	3093520	can specify arbitrarily many operations with arbitrary arities, and you can specify arbitrarily
3093520	3099840	many rules between them. The subject of universal algebra invites you to consider examples like that.
3100160	3106560	Let's invite listeners in the audience who are inclined in that direction to follow study universal
3106560	3111840	algebras. We're going to go back to the topology and the groups. You made a statement there.
3111840	3119520	I just want to make sure that I get it clear. If I figure out the set of all ways that I can map
3120800	3129040	circles and spheres and three-dimensional spheres, etc., into a space, I have not specified its
3129120	3135040	topology completely, but I have specified its homotopy type topology completely, which is a
3135040	3140640	slightly weaker thing. Is that right? That's right. Yeah. Okay. Do we know the answer to the
3140640	3148800	general question of how to completely specify the topology of a space? Right. The classical
3148800	3153200	approach to that, and it's kind of a topology, but let's imagine it's a theorem as opposed to a
3153200	3158480	topology. If you restrict to well-behaved spaces, it's a theorem, and if you take general spaces,
3158480	3164240	it's kind of a topology. The classical approach to this is exactly what you're saying. You describe
3164240	3172720	what's called the nth homotopy group as the collection of maps from the n sphere into your
3172720	3178720	space. Then because it's a group, you need a composition operation, which for two spheres,
3178720	3187680	I can describe the composition. If I have a map from a two-dimensional sphere into a space and a
3187680	3192880	map from another two-dimensional sphere into the space, and these maps are based so there's
3192880	3198640	the north pole and they send them to the same point in the space, you could imagine taking
3198640	3204400	another two-dimensional sphere and then collapsing the equator to a single point. If you had a balloon
3204960	3209280	and you collapse the points on the equator, you sort of squeeze at them carefully so it doesn't
3209280	3213360	pop. Now you have a single point. Now what you look like is something that's called a bouquet
3213360	3218480	of spheres. It's sort of two different spheres that are glued together along the point where
3218480	3222720	the equator used to be. You could sort of map from that into the space because you have two
3222720	3229680	different maps into the space that have a common point. The combination of that operation is how
3229680	3235040	you define the composition here. There's an analog of that in all dimensions. This is the
3235040	3241040	classical approach to saying what is a space algebraically? What are some algebra stuff that
3241040	3244960	tell you everything that you would want to know about the homotopy type of the space?
3245760	3252000	But a modern approach goes back to the idea of the fundamental group but replaces it by
3253040	3257280	something called the fundamental infinity groupoid. Since I promised I would tell
3257280	3263680	listeners what an infinity groupoid is, let me do it now. I like this because this feels like
3263920	3271040	a much more natural way to describe the space. Again, the fundamental groupoid,
3272240	3275440	depending on your point of view either is a theorem or it's a tautology,
3275440	3282640	really does capture the full homotopy type of the space. It's some algebraic structure where I'm
3282640	3288080	going to start with the set of all points in the space. The topology, I've forgotten about
3288080	3293600	distances and stuff. I'm just remembering the set of points because in algebra I have sets
3293600	3298560	and stuff I don't have geometry. I just remember the set of the points in the space.
3299200	3304400	Then what I'm going to throw in is the data of every possible path between any points in the space.
3305040	3310720	This is going to be a very big thing, by the way. We recover now every possible path that
3310720	3314000	an ant could take between points in the space plus the composition.
3314560	3319280	I mean, I gotta say that mathematicians use the word data in a different sense than physicists
3320160	3324320	Oh, yeah. I mean, all of our sets are infinite. It's fine. No problems here.
3324320	3328400	When you say the data of a path, you mean whatever information is required to
3328400	3330720	specify that path among the space of all the paths.
3331440	3334560	Right. We have all the points in the space. We have all the paths in the space.
3334560	3338880	When we were thinking about paths before, when we were talking about the torus, we were talking
3338880	3344080	about, well, we only want to consider paths up to being essentially the same,
3344080	3347760	sort of continuously deformable. We're not doing that here. We're literally remembering
3347760	3351120	every single path, every path as a distinct path. Good.
3351120	3355360	But we are also going to remember data of these continuous deformations.
3356160	3362240	There's a notion of path between paths. If a path is a map from an interval into the space,
3362240	3367440	this is a continuous map from a square into the space. An interval times an interval is a square.
3369120	3372400	So a map from a square into space can be understood as a path between paths,
3372400	3376400	sort of where one edge goes as one path, where the other edge goes as the other path,
3376400	3380960	and then the sort of other direction, the other dimension is giving the kind of path between
3380960	3385200	paths. So we're going to remember all of those as well, all of these paths between paths.
3385200	3389680	So these are called homotopies. And then there's no reason to stop at two dimensions.
3389680	3394160	So we could take three intervals, product it together. That's a cube. Remember all of those
3394160	3398000	maps into the space. These are paths between paths between paths. And then we could take
3398000	3401200	paths between paths between paths between paths, paths between paths, between paths,
3401200	3404480	between paths, between paths, and all the way up. And that goes to infinity. That's the infinity
3404480	3409680	groupoid. So that data, I mean, this feels like it's maybe not an improvement, but somehow...
3409680	3411120	Oh, yeah, it's something.
3411840	3419520	Somehow that algebraic structure, you know, both describes the full homotopy type of a space,
3419520	3426960	which is a useful way to think about it, but also invites you to imagine a generalization
3426960	3432480	to a different world that's further removed from the geometry, where you can imagine some
3432480	3438160	of these paths are no longer invertible anymore. These are sort of one-way paths, you know, you
3438160	3442640	might not be able to go backwards for whatever reason. And this is now the world of infinite
3442640	3445600	dimensional category theory. And that's really where I work, though.
3446240	3449040	Well, so, which brings up a couple, there's a couple of things I just got to clean up there.
3449040	3453840	You were on a roll, so I just wanted to let you keep going. But one thing is just to remind
3453840	3461200	folks, when you talked about the path between two paths, right? The cube, sorry, the square
3461200	3467600	that was a map into it, that path between two paths might not exist if the two paths are not
3467600	3472400	homotopically equivalent, that there won't be any path between them. So there's some structure in
3472400	3477200	the space of what paths between paths exist. Right, by what's present and what's absent,
3477200	3481840	that's a beautiful way to say it. Good. And the other one was, this is a little bit off topic,
3481840	3488160	but when you did the explanation of the sphere and you squeezed it down at the equator to get
3488160	3492800	the bouquet, not only is the language very beautiful, but the visualization is very compelling.
3492800	3498880	And one thing that always gets asked, how do you visualize the infinity groupoid? Is that
3498880	3504240	something that is necessary for you to do? Do you approximate infinity by two, or is there
3504240	3511520	some other trick? It's hard. I don't know. I mean, you sort of imagine a little piece of it at a
3511520	3518320	time and then I don't know. Yeah, it's hard. Okay, that's fair, completely fair. I basically
3518320	3522560	give the same answer. I say you don't. You do the two-dimensional or three-dimensional examples
3522560	3527280	you can get, but at some point you have to trust the equations you're pushing around.
3527280	3532080	And I don't think we've quite elaborated the difference between a group and a groupoid.
3534000	3539760	Right, so the difference between a group is, so the example of a fundamental group,
3540320	3545520	the elements of the group are actually the loops themselves. We've kind of fixed,
3545520	3552720	as prior we given data, the home base point for the ant, and then the only further data we record
3552720	3561920	are the loops in the space. So in a groupoid, you don't fix a base point. You allow different
3561920	3568000	base points, so the different points on the surface of, or in the space. And now, so now
3568000	3572640	you have kind of two levels of data. You have the collection of different points, and then
3572640	3578240	you also have the paths between the different points. Okay, is this, I mean, outside of the
3578240	3584880	world of topology and homotopy, are there group oids? I mean, groups, physicists use groups all
3584880	3589600	the time, right? SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 is the symmetry group of the standard model of particle
3589600	3595360	physics. We never use the word groupoid unless we're secretly mathematicians. So just in the
3595360	3602240	abstract sense, is there a difference? Yeah, sure. So your groups are all automorphism groups of some
3602240	3607520	object, and it's a fixed object. So, you know, you're thinking about automorphisms of R3 or
3607520	3613360	automorphisms of R4 or sort of R3 with a chosen orientation or something like that. So your groups
3613360	3618640	were all automorphism groups of a fixed object. In a groupoid, you have different objects. So
3618640	3622320	there's not just one object anymore, there are different objects, and it's exactly the mini
3622320	3627040	object analog of a group. Okay, I see. That's not so bad. And automorphism is just a map from a
3627040	3633840	space to itself. Is that right? Yeah. Okay, good. Yeah, sorry. We all know what automorphisms are.
3636720	3640560	So then, okay, good. Sorry, there's a lot of clarifying questions, but then let's get back
3640560	3647760	to the punchline here. The infinity groupoid, the sort of topological sense of all the different
3647760	3653280	paths that we can map into the space and the paths between the paths and the paths between
3653280	3658400	the paths of paths. So if we knew the infinity groupoid of a space, we would know what?
3659200	3664320	Everything. Well, everything if you only care about the space up to homotopy. I mean,
3664320	3668320	if you're willing to say that n-dimensional Euclidean space is the same as a point, there's no
3668320	3672960	difference whatsoever. Then yes, you know everything about the space. Now, I mean, if you care about
3672960	3677600	geometry or dimension or things like that, then this is not the right point of view.
3678480	3683360	But for the Taurus, when you said, you know, let's calculate the fundamental group,
3683360	3687600	and we noticed that it looked like, so for the sphere, the fundamental group is as trivial,
3687600	3693200	so it's one element. For the Taurus, it's two copies of the integers. So it's basically two
3693200	3700080	integers you just give me. How do I even express what the infinity groupoid of a space is?
3702800	3707440	Right. So let me move back to the sphere because the two sphere, because it's a little easier to
3707520	3713280	describe here. So if we're thinking about the loops in the two sphere or the paths in the two
3713280	3717840	sphere, there's kind of nothing interesting to say. If you have any two points on the, sorry,
3717840	3721360	the two spheres in the ordinary sphere, if you have any two points on the sphere, you can connect
3721360	3725520	them by a path, and there's a sense in which all paths are the same. You could continuously
3725520	3732960	deform any path from x to y into any other path from x to y. But now if we think about these
3732960	3737520	two-dimensional paths between paths, there are fundamentally different ones, and this is really
3737520	3742480	surprising. So in one dimension, all paths are somehow the same. But in two dimensions,
3743200	3749680	paths can be quite different. So I want to think about paths between paths, and so I should fix
3749680	3758320	the two paths first. So let's start at the north pole and the south pole. So these will be paths
3758320	3762560	from the north pole to the south pole. And one of the paths I want to take is the
3762640	3767120	international dateline, so somewhere through the Pacific Ocean. And the other path I want to take
3767120	3770480	is the prime meridian, which is, I don't know, it's through England or something like that.
3770480	3771120	Two-grenage, yeah.
3771920	3775760	Okay, somewhere else. So there's the Greenwich one and the Pacific Ocean. So those are both
3775760	3781360	paths from the north pole to the south pole. Now a path between paths is a continuous map
3781920	3788720	from a square onto the surface of the earth that sends one edge to the prime meridian and the other
3788720	3794800	edge to the international dateline. And one of them is the one that would cover Asia that would
3794800	3799120	go east from the prime meridian to the international dateline. And the other one is the one that would
3799120	3806480	cover the New World, so go west. And those are fundamentally different in the sense that there
3806480	3813680	is no three-dimensional path, no path between paths between paths that continuously deforms the one
3813680	3819120	to the other. If you could pass through the core of the earth, you could do that, but we have to
3819120	3824800	stay on the surface. It's not allowed. So in this sense, the fundamental group or the fundamental
3824800	3829280	group or sort of one-dimensional thing does not describe everything that's going on on the surface
3829280	3833680	of the sphere. But once we allow these higher-dimensional things, we do get everything.
3834240	3840480	And is the kind of day job that you're involved in more actually calculating the
3841120	3846880	infinity groupoid of this or that, or is it more proving theorems about properties of infinity
3846880	3852240	groupoids? Right. So that's a great question, because those are both very active areas. There
3852240	3857520	are a lot of researchers working on both problems. I don't do the calculations myself. They're very
3857520	3863920	hard. I do kind of the theory side, but some of my colleagues work on the calculations.
3863920	3866640	I'm sure it makes everyone feel good that you don't really do the hard part. You're just doing
3866720	3872960	the simple part of proving theorems about infinity groupoids. And also, this discussion is wonderful
3872960	3879360	because it does, beneath the surface in the language that you use and the way you talk about it,
3880480	3886800	the role of the maps between the different spaces really shines through. Just think of all the
3886800	3891440	spaces you can invent and all the different ways you can map them in some sense. And that
3891440	3895840	sneaks us up into the topic of category theory, which is not really our focus here, but I don't
3896720	3900880	want to leave the audience completely bereft of category theory while we're here.
3900880	3907760	So how do we get from topology to category theory? Sure. I mean, again, there's lots of
3907760	3912320	different roots in, but maybe the one that's most relevant to this conversation. And this is
3912320	3919040	kind of back to the conversation and philosophy that we started off with is,
3919360	3925760	um, so the fundamental theorem in category theory or somehow that that's expressing the core
3925760	3930000	philosophy of category theory, this thing called the yinata lemma says that if you have any sort
3930000	3935680	of mathematical object, it could be a topological space or it could be a vector space or it could
3935680	3940880	be a ring or it could be a field or whatever, any sort of mathematical object. You can understand
3940880	3946160	everything that you want to know about it by considering the other objects of that same type.
3946160	3952000	So other spaces or other rings or other fields and the maps between them. So,
3953040	3958480	right. So what this is saying in the case of spaces is that if you have a unknown space x and
3958480	3963360	you're trying to understand that space, so we don't know sort of what its dimensions are,
3963360	3968000	what its points are, we don't know anything about it. Um, a theorem in category theory,
3968000	3972720	the yinata lemma says that you can completely characterize your unknown space by considering
3972720	3977520	the other spaces. So all these spheres and torii and other surfaces and whatever and all
3977520	3983200	dimensions and then the continuous maps from that into your space x. Well, okay, what's cool
3983200	3988480	about that result. So we were, we were using this idea in topology already to understand spaces,
3988480	3993440	but what's cool is it's completely independent of the mathematical context. So the same theorem
3993440	3999200	is true for rings. You can understand a ring by thinking about other rings and the ring
3999280	4002960	homomorphisms between them. You can understand a group by thinking about other groups and the
4002960	4008000	group homomorphisms between them. Um, this works in any mathematical context whatsoever.
4008560	4014080	It's again, a little bit, uh, related to some ideas in physics that we should always be talking
4014080	4020320	about relations between different things rather than intrinsic essences of things themselves.
4020320	4025600	So yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And, and why is this called category theory? Like let's, let's just
4025600	4030080	bite the bullet and tell people what a category is maybe. Sure. So I mean, a category is kind of
4030080	4035040	like a very general template for a mathematical theory. So Barry Mazer has this metaphor. It's
4035040	4040880	like something with, uh, nouns and verbs. So a category is given by a collection of objects.
4040880	4045440	These are the nouns and what you should think of here are like all the rings, all the possible
4045440	4050720	rings. So the integers and the rationals and the polynomials and matrices and blah, blah, blah.
4050800	4057840	So all the rings. Um, and then you also have the sort of functions between them. So
4058480	4062400	in the case of rings, these would be functions that respect the addition and multiplication
4062400	4067280	laws. In the case of spaces, these would be continuous functions and sort of that totality
4067280	4073120	of information, the objects like the spaces and the functions, the continuous functions or maps
4073120	4079200	between them and their composition and so on. That's a category. And what's great about this is
4079200	4084240	every word you say makes perfect sense. And at the end, I'm left not quite knowing what the
4084240	4088800	implications of these ideas are. That's where that's the devil being the details, right? You've
4088800	4094160	ascended to this platonic realm of wonderful abstraction where there's just things and maps
4094160	4099200	between them. So how do you, what's the usefulness? What's the cashing out of this? What is the
4099200	4105440	free market value of a good category theory? Right. So, um, I mean, one nice thing about
4105440	4110560	category theory is you can just say when two categories are the same in a essential sense.
4110560	4114960	So there's a notion of equivalence between categories and I'll give you my favorite example. So
4116960	4123680	there's a category whose objects are vector spaces, which are something that are kind of
4123680	4128800	fundamental in, in sort of modern quantum physics. So a vector space is like a, you know, collection
4128800	4133760	of vectors with vector addition and scalar multiplication. And then the, the sort of
4133760	4138000	transformations between vector spaces are called linear transformations. So there's,
4138000	4142880	so this is kind of a bread and butter category objects or vector spaces, the maps or transformations,
4142880	4146960	which are some sort of functions between these vector spaces. Now there's another category
4146960	4152720	that's kind of a lot simpler to define. So the objects in this category are just natural numbers.
4153440	4157040	So there, I know exactly how many objects there are. Each natural number is an object,
4157040	4161600	there are no other objects. That's it. And now I need to say sort of what an
4162240	4166560	transformation is. The natural numbers are zero, one, two, three, the positive, not negative
4166560	4172720	integers. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. So, so now I need to say what a sort of transformation or what an
4172720	4179360	arrow is from one number, let's say five to another number eight. And what it is, is it's going to be
4179360	4185520	an eight by five matrix. Okay. So to make something a category, I need to tell you about the objects
4185520	4189040	and the arrows between them. And that's what I've done. The natural numbers are the objects,
4189040	4193680	the matrices are the arrows, but you also need a composition law. So I need a way to take a
4194240	4198480	five by eight matrix and an eight by seven matrix and produce a five by seven matrix.
4199120	4204480	But there's a thing for that. It's called matrix multiplication. It's an operation that satisfies
4204480	4208960	the axioms of category. So those are two very different sounding categories. On the one hand,
4208960	4213920	I have this like very abstract comp, you know, very large thing of all vector spaces and all
4213920	4218160	linear transformations between them. And then on the other hand, I have this kind of toy category
4218160	4224480	with natural numbers and matrices. And those categories are equivalent. So in other words,
4225040	4231200	you can think of the natural number as a stand in for a vector space, the number five corresponds
4231200	4236880	to five dimensional Euclidean space. I was going to guess that, I promise. Yes. Yeah. And you can
4236880	4242720	think of matrix as a stand in for a linear transformation. So if you have vector spaces
4242720	4248960	and you choose a basis, then you can use those bases to get a matrix of numbers that encodes the
4248960	4254800	full data of the linear transformation. And so in a mathematics department, we often teach linear
4254800	4259280	algebra and kind of two different tracks. There's a sort of computational linear algebra. If you're
4259280	4264080	going to be, you know, the next founder of Google, you need to learn how to use these matrix operations
4264080	4268880	and you'll take that sort of course. Or there's a theoretical linear algebra that's, you know,
4268880	4275360	taken maybe by more math majors. And this on the ground, the subjects feel very different because
4275360	4278960	one, you're learning a lot about matrices and reduction and operations. And then the other,
4278960	4283440	you're learning this theory about linear independence and bases and so on and so forth. But
4283440	4289040	it's the same subject because they're, these are equivalent categories. Okay, that is actually
4289040	4293280	a very good example of like a little useful bit of insight that you get from thinking this way.
4293280	4298000	So just, I know that this is sort of already been said by you, but let me try to say it again to
4298000	4302320	drive home this notion of a category to people who don't use it as a bread and butter. Because
4302320	4306960	when you say a vector space, let's just imagine, let's optimistically imagine everyone knows what
4306960	4312160	a vector space is, right? They have in their mind x y axes and little vectors. So a vector space is
4312160	4316640	itself a collection of things, right? The vectors, there's an infinite number of vectors in the vector
4316640	4323760	space. But the category is of vector spaces. So the individual elements of the category
4323760	4327280	are the whole vector space, a two dimensional vector space, a three dimensional vector space,
4327280	4334560	et cetera. And you're thinking about the maps between vector spaces and then extra maps between
4335200	4339680	the set of all vector spaces and the set of all integers and things like that. So it gets pretty
4341040	4343840	unvisualizable pretty quickly, but that's why you get paid the big bucks.
4344560	4348480	Well, the visual is you're sort of zooming out. You're really taking a bird's eye view of
4348480	4356560	mathematics. The objects that a group theorist would study are really just little atoms inside
4356880	4360560	the category of all groups. And what's fun is if you're a category theorist or a higher
4360560	4364640	dimensional category theorist, really the categories themselves become very small. So
4364640	4369120	in my work, I zoom out one other level and I think about categories whose objects are categories.
4369760	4373120	Inside those categories are things like the category of vector spaces and then the vector
4373120	4377120	space is an actual vector space, which has uncountably infinitely many vectors in it,
4377120	4381200	as you point out. And so at what point do we get to the infinity categories? There's an
4381200	4383200	infinity group, or there must be an infinity category, right?
4383920	4395440	Yeah, sure. I mean, yeah. As every decade, mathematicians invent more complicated objects
4395440	4401440	to study and the universes where those objects live are categories with more dimensions of
4401440	4404640	morphisms between them. And those are these infinity categories.
4404640	4408960	I mean, just knowing that, can you foresee what was going to be invented in the next decade?
4409040	4412160	Like what is the obvious thing to draw more arrows between?
4412800	4417760	Yeah. I mean, what I'm hoping happens in the future is that we change our foundation system
4417760	4424000	of mathematics. So it's kind of more suitable to these complicated up-to-homeotopy structures that
4424880	4429200	we're thinking about today. Well, maybe this is a good place to end up. Because
4430320	4435120	in some sense, like this all, it's kind of fun. Like you and I are both in the small group of
4435120	4441280	people who just think it's fun thinking about this stuff. But it's also maybe a shift of
4441280	4449120	perspective on what math is in changing what we mean by equality and equivalence and things
4449120	4454400	like that. And so can you imagine that math is going to look very different down the road when
4454400	4458960	this really seeps in? Is it kind of like a shift from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics in
4458960	4468240	some sense? Yeah, I think so. I think we maybe see glimpses of it today. But I think every living
4468240	4475280	mathematician would be very surprised by 22nd century mathematics. And I hope to be around to
4475280	4479920	see some of it. Well, I was very interested to read. There's a wonderful interview with you in
4479920	4485760	Quantum Magazine. And one of the interesting things you're doing is writing books. I mean,
4485760	4489440	maybe you count them as textbooks, but anyway, technical mathematical books where,
4490720	4496880	correct me if I'm saying this wrong, but you were just as interested in reproving known theorems
4496880	4501600	in better ways as in improving new theorems, which is supposed to be the typical thing
4501600	4508720	mathematicians are paid to do. Right. And there's this Bill Thurston, who is this wonderful
4508800	4516480	topologist, Geometer, drew attention to kind of the role that mathematicians need to play in
4516480	4522800	making mathematics understandable to humans. So because something has been proven, that means
4522800	4527600	it's true, which a nice thing about mathematics is the theorems that were proven 2000 years ago
4527600	4532000	are equally true today. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's understandable by somebody who
4532000	4537840	wants to build on those ideas and use them to do something else. So I think it is worthwhile to do
4537840	4547280	a bit of kind of tidying up and repackaging, streamlining. A wonderful success in the history
4547280	4552400	of mathematics is that these cutting edge discoveries that were kind of very controversial
4552400	4557120	or inconceivable to somebody 100 years ago are now stuff we teach undergraduates in their first
4557120	4560960	and second year. True, right. I mean, there was a lot of controversy over calculus, right? That
4560960	4565600	was considered hard, yeah. Right. These pinnacles of human achievement are now something that
4566400	4570000	thousands and hundreds of thousands of students are learning every single year. And
4570000	4574000	I hope we continue to progress in that way. We should check back 30 years from now. We'll have
