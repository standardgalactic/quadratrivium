Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.

00:03.520 --> 00:10.400
I bet that most of us out here have had the experience of trying to put together a bookshelf

00:10.400 --> 00:16.960
or something like that from IKEA or from wherever, some somewhat complicated piece of furniture or

00:16.960 --> 00:22.320
something to have around the house for which you get blueprints, instructions, as well as pieces,

00:22.320 --> 00:27.120
the raw materials, right? And so we have a certain paradigm in mind about how something

00:27.120 --> 00:32.160
complicated like a bookshelf comes to be. There's a blueprint, a set of instructions,

00:32.160 --> 00:37.200
there's stuff that we're going to put together, and there's some agent, us, that does that work.

00:37.200 --> 00:42.320
It's very natural then, because we're familiar with that kind of process, to think that something

00:42.320 --> 00:47.360
like that also happens when you put together a living organism, right? When you put together

00:47.360 --> 00:53.600
a person or a whale or a tree, there is some blueprint set of instructions, which presumably

00:53.680 --> 00:59.120
is in the DNA, right, in the genome of the organism. And then there is some agents putting

00:59.120 --> 01:04.800
them together, presumably the proteins that get their information from the DNA via the RNA,

01:04.800 --> 01:09.520
and they go off and they build things, and voila, you get an organism. So it turns out,

01:09.520 --> 01:15.920
it's almost not at all like that pretty much, okay? That's some truth to the idea that there are

01:15.920 --> 01:22.640
instructions or information contained in our DNA that will go into constructing an organism such as

01:22.720 --> 01:28.640
a person. But the actual process by which it happens is much more nuanced, much richer, not quite

01:28.640 --> 01:34.400
that simple paradigm we have in mind of an instruction kit and agent and some raw materials.

01:34.400 --> 01:39.360
And partly that's because, you know, we are not intelligently designed, right? This whole system

01:39.360 --> 01:47.360
that we have in us of DNA, genome, RNA, proteins, the organs that we have, the cells in our body,

01:47.360 --> 01:53.040
this all evolved in a complicated process and whatever kinds of dynamics and process was

01:53.040 --> 01:58.320
important and useful as far as evolution is concerned is what we ended up using, okay? It's

01:58.320 --> 02:03.680
not supposed to be code in a computer where it's carefully commented or anything like that, it's

02:03.680 --> 02:09.280
just what was thrown together and what eventually got used. And as a result of that, biologists

02:09.280 --> 02:15.360
keep finding ways in which the morphology, the shape and the way things are put together in

02:15.360 --> 02:22.640
organisms comes to be in fun and different ways than you might expect from the simple Ikea paradigm.

02:22.640 --> 02:27.840
So our guest today, Michael Levin, is a biologist at Tufts University and it's actually a little

02:27.840 --> 02:33.200
bit difficult to describe what he specializes in because it's kind of many different projects that

02:33.200 --> 02:40.400
are all fascinating to me. But in the overall space of talking about how information and physical

02:40.400 --> 02:46.480
dynamics come together to make organisms and all their different functions and things like that.

02:46.480 --> 02:51.760
Not only does it help us understand the particular features of organisms that we know and love,

02:51.760 --> 02:58.000
but to someone like me who cares about emergence and different levels of description of reality,

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
it's fascinating because we can start asking questions like, at what point is a decision

03:04.000 --> 03:08.720
being made by an organism or by the processes that are going into making that organism? Is it

03:08.720 --> 03:13.840
anything like a computer? Is there a separation between hardware and software? What is the role

03:13.840 --> 03:18.720
of memory? What is the role of dynamical processes? All these fun questions. So we're going to be

03:18.720 --> 03:25.600
talking about how cells, how information and how organisms all fit together. I'm not sure that I am

03:25.600 --> 03:30.320
capable or qualified to draw a single unified theme from it, but I think you'll find that it's a

03:30.320 --> 03:34.480
fascinating conversation that touches on many kinds of things we've been talking about on

03:34.480 --> 03:45.200
Mindscape for quite a while now. So let's go.

03:54.240 --> 03:58.320
Michael Levin, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. Well, thank you so much. Pleased to be here.

03:58.320 --> 04:03.280
This is an interesting podcast for me to think about organizing and talking about because you

04:03.280 --> 04:08.960
do so many different kinds of things. And I finally hit on a starting point of asking you about

04:09.520 --> 04:14.240
one of the experiments you described in your papers with the Xenopus tadpole. I think that's

04:14.240 --> 04:20.080
how you pronounce it, the Xenopus. You basically, if I understand correctly, you in your lab or

04:20.080 --> 04:26.240
your collaborators rearranged the face of a little baby frog tadpole and it somehow,

04:26.240 --> 04:30.640
nevertheless, grew correctly into the right shape. Is that roughly speaking correct?

04:31.360 --> 04:36.000
Yes, that's correct. And I do think it's a pretty important experiment and it's one that we can

04:36.000 --> 04:42.320
definitely form this conversation around because it illustrates something very important. So it

04:42.320 --> 04:47.760
used to be thought because all tadpoles look the same and all frogs look the same that basically

04:47.760 --> 04:54.320
what the genome could do is somehow encode a hardwired set of movements that would transform

04:54.320 --> 05:00.160
a standard tadpole into a standard frog. So the idea would be that the nostrils, the eyes,

05:00.160 --> 05:05.120
the jaws, all these things have to rearrange themselves to become a frog. And so what we

05:05.120 --> 05:09.920
did was a start out by making something we call Picasso tadpoles where everything is in the wrong

05:09.920 --> 05:14.240
place. So the jaws might be off to one side, the eyes might be on the top of the head or

05:14.240 --> 05:20.240
everything is sort of mixed up and we can talk about how we make those. And then the remarkable

05:20.240 --> 05:26.640
thing is that they largely become normal frogs. So all of these little pieces that make up the

05:26.640 --> 05:33.120
head and the face will move in novel unnatural configurations until they land in the correct

05:33.120 --> 05:38.800
positions to make a frog face. And so what this is telling us is that the genetics in fact gives

05:38.800 --> 05:44.320
us a system that's very good at reducing error. That what it does is continuously work to sort of

05:44.320 --> 05:48.960
reduce the difference, the delta between the configuration you have now and the configuration

05:48.960 --> 05:55.840
that it in some way remembers as a correct frog face and that things stop moving and stop proliferating

05:55.840 --> 06:00.880
when that error is sufficiently small. Yeah, which is a remarkable way of thinking about it

06:00.880 --> 06:05.200
because it's probably not what most people have in mind. Well, I say most people, I mean me,

06:05.200 --> 06:10.240
you know, not being a biologist myself. I mean, I think that we think of what's packed into our

06:10.240 --> 06:14.880
genome as roughly the equivalent of the instructions you get from Ikea or something like that, right?

06:14.880 --> 06:20.080
Here are some building blocks. Here are the steps you have to take in order. And at the end, hopefully

06:20.080 --> 06:25.440
you get the finished product. But so you're saying it's not like that. No, it's absolutely not like

06:25.440 --> 06:31.280
that. And on the one hand, we kind of already know it's not like that because if you actually,

06:32.000 --> 06:36.320
and look, the view that you've described is definitely the kind of the mainstream perception

06:36.320 --> 06:41.200
that everybody has. And I've given talks to nine year olds in middle school and so on. And when I

06:41.200 --> 06:46.160
ask them what determines what comes out of an egg, you know, it can be a bird, a dinosaur, a snake,

06:46.160 --> 06:49.680
you know, what determines the shape of what comes out of an egg, everybody says the genome.

06:49.680 --> 06:54.000
And in a certain sense, that's true. But if you actually look at now that we can read genomes,

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
if you actually look at what's in the genome, you're not going to find anything in there about

06:58.000 --> 07:03.520
the size, the shape, the type of symmetry of the organism that's going to come out. And what's

07:03.520 --> 07:10.400
important to realize is that we currently do not have the ability to look at a genome and guess

07:10.400 --> 07:15.680
anything about what the shape of the organism is going to be. Now you can cheat and compare it to

07:15.680 --> 07:20.560
the genome of another organism that you do know what it looks like. But this idea that you can

07:20.560 --> 07:25.920
read the genome and sort of understand what the anatomy is going to be is not the case.

07:25.920 --> 07:31.040
And that is because the genome does have a recipe, but it's not a recipe for shape, it's a recipe

07:31.040 --> 07:38.320
for proteins. So what the genome does is prescribe what protein hardware every cell in your body

07:38.320 --> 07:44.160
gets to have. So these are the smallest sorts of building blocks from which cells build various

07:44.160 --> 07:49.760
structures. And so it's sort of like you're not getting the design of the IKEA shelf,

07:49.760 --> 07:54.640
you're getting a description of the metal that goes into the screws and the wood or whatever

07:54.640 --> 07:59.360
it is that goes into the other part. It's a description of a very low level aspect of the

07:59.360 --> 08:06.160
system you're actually interested in. Yeah, and it's what do you say we can't look at the genome

08:06.160 --> 08:10.560
and see what the shape is going to be? Is that our fault? I mean, is it implicit in there,

08:10.560 --> 08:15.840
but there's just a lot of steps? Or is it really that even in principle you couldn't look at the

08:15.840 --> 08:19.680
genome and figure out what the animal is going to be? Well, that's a great question. So let's

08:19.760 --> 08:27.120
think about what we mean by in principle. So if you were to sort of a laplace kind of simulate

08:27.120 --> 08:33.520
all of the micro interactions, then certainly you could. If you take into account the environment,

08:33.520 --> 08:38.560
even things like let's say turtles, which use external temperature to determine the sex of

08:38.560 --> 08:43.920
the offspring, you could figure out what was going to happen. So in a certain molecular sense,

08:44.000 --> 08:51.920
if you were to simply absolutely model the lowest level of physics, yes, it's in there.

08:51.920 --> 08:56.480
But we would like to do something better than that. We would like to understand the encoding.

08:56.480 --> 09:02.720
And from that perspective, it's not our fault in the sense that that's not what's encoded there. So

09:02.720 --> 09:08.000
what's encoded is not the actual anatomical features. What's encoded are the proteins and a

09:08.000 --> 09:13.440
little bit about the order in which some of those proteins will appear as a function of time. So

09:13.440 --> 09:20.000
from that perspective, even though developmental biologists are doing a very nice job trying to

09:20.000 --> 09:26.400
understand how all of these organs come to be, we really need to understand a lot more. And you

09:26.400 --> 09:32.960
can sort of, an example you might think about is the kind of bell curve that you get from dropping

09:32.960 --> 09:38.640
marbles into a Galton board. Where does the shape of that bell curve come from? So in a certain

09:38.640 --> 09:45.760
sense, at a micro level, you could probably calculate it out and predict it maybe if the errors

09:45.760 --> 09:52.160
were small enough. But in a larger sense, that shape is not encoded anywhere in the material of

09:52.160 --> 09:56.880
the marbles or the definition of the board or anything like that. It's because what that device

09:56.880 --> 10:04.240
is doing is harnessing particular laws of physics. And what embryos do and all living structures

10:04.240 --> 10:08.800
do is they harness the laws of physics and the laws of computation. So this is very important.

10:08.800 --> 10:14.880
And so what you get in the genome is the description of a very important and very

10:14.880 --> 10:20.720
interesting machine, which is able to generate and process information exploiting various laws of

10:20.720 --> 10:26.480
physics and computation to make certain outcomes. And what's super cool about it is that these

10:26.480 --> 10:33.200
outcomes are reliable most of the time. So most acorns give you oak trees and most fish eggs

10:33.200 --> 10:38.480
give you a fish. But actually, it's way better than that because it is not only robust to all

10:38.480 --> 10:42.240
kinds of perturbations, but it's actually reprogrammable, which I think is one of the most

10:42.240 --> 10:48.000
exciting aspects of it. I guess it's very hard for us to escape the metaphors that we use to

10:48.000 --> 10:53.440
think about these things, like as if there were blueprints or an instruction manual in the DNA.

10:53.440 --> 11:00.400
But the reality is more, I guess, like you're saying, the DNA makes RNA, the RNA makes proteins,

11:00.400 --> 11:05.440
and the DNA is chosen not because someone wanted to design something, but just because

11:06.160 --> 11:14.160
making these proteins in this right environment gets us the morphology, the shape that is been

11:14.160 --> 11:19.680
selected for by natural selection. Yeah, this is correct. So natural selection, of course,

11:19.680 --> 11:26.960
shapes the proteins that cells will use. I think a really good analogy, and we can come back to

11:27.280 --> 11:32.880
the status of metaphors in this field because I think it's not quite what a lot of people think

11:32.880 --> 11:39.280
it is. But one useful metaphor for this is the distinction between software and hardware.

11:39.280 --> 11:46.640
So if you can imagine that if you had a bunch of electric parts, you could connect them together.

11:46.640 --> 11:52.400
And if they were the right kind of parts, one of the things you would get would be an electric

11:52.400 --> 11:56.560
circuit that might do something. And one of the things that might do if your parts included

11:56.560 --> 12:02.720
transistors is that it might carry out logic functions. And so it might be able to carry out

12:02.720 --> 12:07.120
certain operations that would be logic that from which you could build up all kinds of complex

12:07.120 --> 12:13.600
computations. And so now you could ask where the laws of computation live. That's an interesting

12:13.600 --> 12:19.040
question. Certainly, right? Certainly, you know, the operations of AND gates and NOR gates and

12:19.040 --> 12:26.240
things like this were not in the electric parts that you got a specification to. But what evolution

12:26.240 --> 12:31.520
did was shape the parts. And it shapes the parts in a way that when those parts interact together,

12:31.520 --> 12:36.320
they make a circuit. And the part that we study in my lab is largely the electrical aspect of it,

12:36.320 --> 12:40.880
which is why I keep coming back to these kind of electronics analogies. The amazing thing about

12:40.880 --> 12:45.520
these circuits is that they take advantage of really interesting laws of physics having to do

12:45.520 --> 12:51.280
with electricity and how that propagates. And the laws of computation, which allows cells and

12:51.280 --> 12:56.400
tissues to make decisions and to have memory and things like that. And that's where evolution

12:56.400 --> 13:04.080
really shines is to exploit these laws of physics. Right. But I guess what I'm trying to

13:04.800 --> 13:11.600
understand better is this idea that there's no top down directing of what's going on in the

13:11.600 --> 13:18.240
individual cells. I mean, the cells that make up my liver and my brain have the same DNA in them.

13:18.240 --> 13:24.240
And they're just doing their production of proteins. And it sort of all fits together at

13:24.240 --> 13:29.120
the end of the day. And it's not that anyone wrote software to do that, right? It's just that

13:30.240 --> 13:33.440
the DNA that makes that happen is the one that gets passed on.

13:33.440 --> 13:39.040
Well, I'll say two things about that. Certainly, no one wrote the software in the sense of some

13:39.040 --> 13:48.880
sort of designer. So that's for sure. But I will say that this issue of top down control is tricky.

13:48.880 --> 13:53.600
And what I'm about to say is probably not the mainstream sort of story of developmental

13:53.600 --> 14:00.800
biology that you'll get from a textbook. But this is how I see it. If you look at it, it's

14:00.800 --> 14:06.240
a multi-scale problem. So if you look at it from the scale of individual cells or molecules,

14:06.320 --> 14:13.280
then that's basically correct. They are simply following sort of local rules about what they're

14:13.280 --> 14:19.840
going to do. But I think the evidence is pretty good now that there is a larger level of organization

14:19.840 --> 14:24.800
that you can look at. And this larger level of organizations at the tissue and organ level

14:24.800 --> 14:31.440
is performing some interesting computations that deforms the possible action space for the subunits.

14:31.440 --> 14:39.360
So what that means is that it basically alters the space of what's possible for the cells and

14:39.360 --> 14:45.680
the molecular networks to do so that by simply following very mechanical rules, sort of minimization

14:45.680 --> 14:54.160
of free energy and things like this, they end up doing things that are in line with a global

14:54.160 --> 15:01.600
body plan. So you can look at things that tissues and organ level structures are doing

15:01.600 --> 15:06.240
that are very large-scale computations and decision-making about things like, hey,

15:06.240 --> 15:11.680
is our face patterned correctly? Do we have the right number of fingers? Are the limbs long enough?

15:11.680 --> 15:16.560
And the outcome of those computations are instructions to individual cells to either

15:16.560 --> 15:20.720
proliferate or turn on certain genes or turn off certain genes. And at that point,

15:20.720 --> 15:26.160
the cells are just doing what the chemistry sort of suggests in the sense that there isn't

15:26.160 --> 15:30.720
any magic there. But if you look at the level above, what's happening is that all of those

15:30.720 --> 15:37.280
low-level reactions are being harnessed towards a higher-level goal that none of the individual

15:37.280 --> 15:42.640
cells are capable of perceiving. So at the single cell level, there's no such thing as an arm or an

15:42.640 --> 15:49.840
eye or anything like that. No single cell can perceive that. But the group agent, and so I

15:49.840 --> 15:55.200
think fundamentally this is a problem of swarm intelligence and group cognition. The group agent

15:55.200 --> 16:02.000
has very sort of rough memories of what the correct pattern should be, and it has the ability to make

16:02.000 --> 16:06.720
decisions about whether or not the current state is close enough to the target state,

16:06.720 --> 16:12.960
and if not adjust behaviors. So I think from that perspective, there is a bit of top-down control,

16:12.960 --> 16:16.160
and we can talk about some of our worm experiments that tend to show this,

16:17.120 --> 16:21.920
that is not in the sense of some sort of rational designer that writes software,

16:21.920 --> 16:28.080
but in the cybernetic sense where there are systems that reduce error from a stored set point.

16:28.080 --> 16:33.200
And so as long as they can remember what that set point is, they can then have this kind of

16:33.200 --> 16:40.080
homeostatic cycle that harnesses the parts of the machine towards the goal, which is again,

16:40.080 --> 16:45.200
not something magical, but is a representative target state towards which the whole system tries

16:45.200 --> 16:50.800
to get to. There are times when we have a long stretch of time ahead of us where we're doing

16:50.800 --> 16:55.760
something, but our attention is not completely absorbed. That's when Audible.com and their

16:55.760 --> 17:00.480
audiobook selections can come to your rescue. I know that I've driven across the country several

17:00.480 --> 17:06.480
times, and my favorite thing to do is to listen to ancient poems. I listen to the Iliad, the Odyssey,

17:06.480 --> 17:12.160
the Aeneid, Beowulf, helps make those long highways in Nebraska fly by. If you'd like something a

17:12.160 --> 17:16.640
little bit more modern, my own books are on Audible.com. I was the one who read Something

17:16.640 --> 17:22.720

18:01.920 --> 18:06.960
the shape that it wants, that has encoded in it, the shape that it wants its body and

18:06.960 --> 18:14.720
its face to have? And then the large scale, whatever shape it currently has, reacts back

18:14.720 --> 18:20.080
against that genome to sort of say, well, what do we do next to move us closer to that goal?

18:20.080 --> 18:25.520
Is that the right way of thinking about it? That's close. I would say what the genome encodes

18:25.520 --> 18:31.040
is a bunch of parts that when implemented in parallel, it makes a piece of hardware that

18:31.040 --> 18:37.760
has a very reliable default behavior. That default behavior is a set of biochemical,

18:37.760 --> 18:46.160
biomechanical and bioelectrical circuits that if nothing weird happens to them by their normal

18:46.160 --> 18:51.200
behavior in their normal environment, they will generate a set of patterns that give rise to a

18:51.200 --> 18:57.200
standard frog. And so the real outcome, if you ask the question of where does a frog face come from,

18:57.200 --> 19:04.080
it's a sort of interplay of the constraints imposed by the genetics which specifies the machine

19:04.080 --> 19:09.520
and the laws of physics and computation which exist around it. Now, there's an additional

19:09.520 --> 19:14.880
factor as it turns out that this machine has some really interesting properties. It isn't,

19:14.880 --> 19:19.840
evolution apparently doesn't just favor machines that only have one outcome,

19:19.840 --> 19:27.120
but they favor, at least in many cases, it favors machines with a particular capability which is

19:28.160 --> 19:33.920
a separation of hardware from software. What I mean is it's able to represent

19:33.920 --> 19:38.960
different possible set points and what the cells know how to do really well is to build

19:38.960 --> 19:43.360
towards the set point. And if the set point changes, you don't have to rewire the cells.

19:43.360 --> 19:47.600
I mean, that's a really interesting, that reprogrammability is a really powerful

19:47.600 --> 19:51.440
aspect of all this. I guess this is what I'm learning, not just from this conversation,

19:51.440 --> 19:56.320
but from other podcast interviews I did with Carl Friston, for example, with his

19:57.040 --> 20:02.240
free energy principle. I'll make a grandiose claim and then you can fact-check me here.

20:02.240 --> 20:09.600
In many ways, the way that biological organisms work, either in sort of day-to-day dynamics or

20:09.600 --> 20:16.800
evolution or development of the organism, is not this sort of Laplacian idea that you give me

20:16.800 --> 20:22.320
exactly the state right now and I will tell you what direction to move in. It's this almost

20:22.320 --> 20:26.960
teleological way of thinking about things. Just had David Hague on the podcast and he

20:26.960 --> 20:32.400
wants to let us talk in teleological terms. It's like, rather than saying, if this, then that,

20:32.400 --> 20:37.280
if this is where we are now, here's where we should go, it's like, well, here's where we want to get

20:37.280 --> 20:43.600
to, figure out a way to get there. Yes, I think that's absolutely correct. I think

20:43.600 --> 20:51.680
biology has been trapped in this teleophobia, which is doing us a great disservice. I think

20:51.680 --> 20:57.920
it's completely, not only fine, but absolutely necessary to talk about those kinds of things.

20:58.640 --> 21:05.440
I think that's exactly what biological systems do and we can talk about how I think this aspect

21:05.440 --> 21:11.920
of goal-directedness, this multi-scale goal-directedness, is crucial for evolution. I think it's what

21:11.920 --> 21:21.600
makes evolution work. It's what makes for much greater evolvability. I'm a big fan of Friston's

21:21.600 --> 21:26.880
work. We've used it in our own research. I think it's absolutely correct in that not only do living

21:26.880 --> 21:32.160
things have to predict their environment, but they actually have to predict themselves. Living

21:32.160 --> 21:40.480
things are a patchwork at different scales of systems that cooperate and compete with each

21:40.480 --> 21:45.120
other. Part of all of that is being able to guess what's going to happen next and having a

21:45.120 --> 21:50.160
preference about what you'd like to have happen next. Everything is working towards minimizing

21:50.160 --> 21:55.920
that delta from what it expects and what's actually going to happen. This is critical for

21:56.880 --> 22:02.320
evolvability. I think those kinds of, what's important about that that teleology isn't simply

22:02.320 --> 22:07.520
that we allow it or disallow it, but I think we need to move it from a philosophical problem,

22:07.520 --> 22:12.640
which a lot of people have argued in a vacuum about whether it is or is not okay to talk this way

22:12.640 --> 22:18.640
or whether all models in biology should be framed in terms of biochemistry and molecules and not

22:18.640 --> 22:24.560
goals and things like this. I think it's an empirical. It's a very practical problem. The

22:24.560 --> 22:29.520
question, it's a little like Dan Dennett's intentional stance, where it's very simple.

22:29.520 --> 22:36.400
You just say, what level of intentionality do I ascribe to my system that best gets me

22:36.400 --> 22:42.640
to new prediction and control? Sometimes you'll err on the side of attributing too much agency and

22:42.640 --> 22:50.160
it's wasted and you can do better with a simpler model. Sometimes you're applying simple laws to

22:50.160 --> 22:56.080
systems that internally have a very rich protocognitive structure that should be much better

22:56.080 --> 23:02.400
off taking advantage of. I've argued that for regenerative medicine and just in our lab and

23:02.400 --> 23:07.680
others, it's driven a ton of work to novel experiments that otherwise would not have been done

23:08.240 --> 23:12.800
and to actually ask, what does the system know? What does it expect? What are the preferences?

23:12.800 --> 23:16.640
What goals is it trying to achieve? This is on all scales of organization.

23:18.000 --> 23:23.600
You and I are probably familiar with the distinction between in physics Newtonian mechanics

23:23.600 --> 23:27.760
versus the principle of least action. I noticed that the principle of least action is actually

23:27.840 --> 23:34.240
quoted on your web page. It's interesting because it's two different ways of conceptualizing

23:34.800 --> 23:39.280
exactly the same problem and getting exactly the same answer, but from very different languages.

23:39.280 --> 23:43.280
So maybe for the people out there who don't hang out on the wrong street corners and hear

23:43.280 --> 23:46.880
about the principle of least action, why don't you tell us how physicists think about that?

23:46.880 --> 23:49.840
Because it's clearly related to what you're saying about biology.

23:50.720 --> 23:56.560
Well, I'm probably going to make a massive fool of myself here because I'm not a physicist.

23:57.200 --> 24:01.280
I'm sure you are a much better place to give a proper definition of it.

24:01.280 --> 24:08.720
But what I understand is that there are lots of physical systems and probably all of them

24:08.720 --> 24:12.800
where one of the things you can do, so let's say trying to understand how light is going to

24:12.800 --> 24:18.800
propagate through a bunch of lenses stacked one after the other things like that, you could go

24:18.800 --> 24:24.400
after the micro details and try to use Maxwell's equations and things like this to really model

24:24.720 --> 24:28.080
every piece of it and eventually you'll crank through and you'll get the answer.

24:28.800 --> 24:34.320
Apparently, it turns out that you could get the exact same answer with a lot less effort if you

24:34.320 --> 24:38.880
simply make an assumption that what the light wants to do is to minimize the effort, so to speak,

24:38.880 --> 24:43.920
or the action that it will take to get there. That's a rough, that's how I understand these

24:43.920 --> 24:51.920
things. And I think that's an incredibly powerful concept because asking about how much effort

24:51.920 --> 24:57.840
does it take to compute something, I think is really important because when people, especially

24:57.840 --> 25:04.400
in the biosciences where things impact medicine a lot, when people say, well, everything should

25:04.400 --> 25:08.400
be done at the lowest possible level, and he said, well, you don't really mean the lowest,

25:08.400 --> 25:12.240
you don't want to talk about quantum foam, but you really want to talk about his biochemistry,

25:12.240 --> 25:17.360
right? That's often when people say to me, ah, you got to reduce, and you don't really mean that.

25:17.360 --> 25:22.880
What you mean is you've picked a level and that level is biochemistry. And my point is you can't,

25:22.880 --> 25:28.000
and this is people like Dennis Noble have been saying this much better than I, that you can't

25:28.000 --> 25:33.200
simply pick a level because you like it, you have to pick the best level. And how do you know what

25:33.200 --> 25:39.680
the best level is? And the best level is how much effort do I need to put in to control the outcome?

25:39.680 --> 25:44.880
And in the case of regenerative medicine, that outcome might be we're going to replace a complex

25:44.880 --> 25:50.880
finger or a hand that's way too complicated for anybody to build by hand from stem cells or anything

25:50.880 --> 25:57.120
like that. So the question is going to be, to what extent is your system persuadable? There's this,

25:57.120 --> 26:01.440
you know, I visualize this axis, right? On the one hand, you have things like cuckoo clocks,

26:01.440 --> 26:05.680
which are not persuadable. You are, you know, if you want to make a change in the way that system

26:05.680 --> 26:10.000
works, you have to rewire, you have to physically change the hardware, there's no getting around it.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.120
And then you have systems way on the sort of on the right side of that spectrum, which might be

26:15.120 --> 26:21.840
humans or they might be other kinds of advanced cognitive systems where trying to intervene in

26:21.840 --> 26:27.280
their activity on the molecular scale is maybe possible. But realistically, you know, the sun's

26:27.280 --> 26:32.960
going to burn down before you figure out how to tweak all the cells in a person's brain to get

26:32.960 --> 26:38.480
this or that to happen. So there you're probably better off with stimuli, with experiences, with

26:38.480 --> 26:42.880
inputs that take advantage of the cognitive structure of the system to convince them or

26:42.880 --> 26:48.720
motivate them or train them to do various things. And then in between are all kinds of agents,

26:48.720 --> 26:55.520
many of which we know, so animals and simple AIs and basic life forms and cells. And then

26:55.520 --> 26:59.920
all kinds of agents that don't exist yet. I mean, I think one of the fun things to talk about is the

26:59.920 --> 27:04.400
space of possible agents, which I think is going to be actually enormous in our lifetime. And

27:04.480 --> 27:09.920
somewhere on that scale is the correct way to interact with everything you come into contact

27:09.920 --> 27:16.320
with. And you really have to ask, what is the, what are, you know, are there goals that your

27:16.320 --> 27:21.920
system is trying to achieve? And are you better off rewriting those goals or motivating the system

27:21.920 --> 27:27.200
than micromanaging it? And I think it sounds it seems like physics is telling you at the

27:27.200 --> 27:32.720
lowest level that this kind of stuff is already baked in. Yeah, I mean, I can't help but talk

27:32.720 --> 27:37.040
about the physics and least action just a little bit more because it's really fascinating to me.

27:37.040 --> 27:43.760
I mean, like we said, there is this way, I even did a video on this in my summer quarantine project

27:43.760 --> 27:49.520
video series called The Biggest Ideas in the Universe about how you can either be Newtonian and

27:49.520 --> 27:55.360
say, well, I know where I am now and all the laws of physics tell me is what to do next. Or you can

27:55.360 --> 28:02.080
be, I don't know, Lagrangian or whatever it's called. You can you can say, well, of all the

28:02.080 --> 28:07.760
histories I could have in the future, I will take the one that minimizes the certain function,

28:07.760 --> 28:11.840
right, the action. And that latter one just seems a little magical. I mean, you're saying like,

28:11.840 --> 28:17.920
well, how did it know? But you show that in fact, secretly, they're mathematically exactly the same.

28:17.920 --> 28:22.160
It's just, you know, a matter of convenience. But, but the convenience is extreme when you're

28:22.160 --> 28:27.280
when you become a modern particle physicist, you're constantly writing down this action, this

28:27.280 --> 28:32.960
this thing that is the thing you minimize globally rather than locally. And it's just a much more

28:32.960 --> 28:39.200
convenient way of talking about it. So I guess the question that is obvious to me now is,

28:39.840 --> 28:44.800
is there a reason why it doesn't have something to do with the fact that biological organisms

28:44.800 --> 28:48.960
are these multilevel systems where there's collective action from all of our tiny little

28:48.960 --> 28:55.120
cells coming together? Is that does that help explain why it is convenient to talk in these

28:55.120 --> 28:59.760
more global terms rather than just locally following the action of every little atom or

28:59.760 --> 29:05.840
molecular cell? Yeah, I think well, I think there are there are two two aspects to this. The sort

29:05.840 --> 29:11.120
of more metaphysical aspect is in which I'm not sure how much value this is, but I'll just say it

29:11.120 --> 29:17.440
because it's it's something I've been thinking about is that if you ask yourself, you know,

29:17.600 --> 29:22.320
let's say people who are who are into panpsychism or this idea that, you know, sort of some sort of

29:22.320 --> 29:28.000
intentionality is everywhere fundamentally. What one of the problems that people often have with

29:28.000 --> 29:32.640
this is that they scale down the physical system, they say, Okay, now let's consider a rock or a,

29:32.640 --> 29:37.920
you know, something like that. And then they fail to scale down the intentionality that I think

29:37.920 --> 29:42.000
I'm seeing is they say, Well, it's ridiculous to say that a rock has hopes and dreams. And

29:42.000 --> 29:45.680
well, of course, it is so right. So what you need to do is you need to proportionally scale

29:45.680 --> 29:52.160
down the cognition. So if you ask yourself what would intentionality or freedom in the sense of

29:52.160 --> 29:57.440
indeterminacy look like in the simplest possible case, I think what you get is exactly what particle

29:57.440 --> 30:03.040
physics is telling us. So so if you ask, you know, what would freedom look like at the most minimal

30:03.040 --> 30:08.800
kind of instantiation, I think you would you would predict something that looks like quantum

30:08.800 --> 30:14.640
indeterminacy. And if you ask, what does what would goal directedness look like at the at the

30:14.640 --> 30:19.200
simplest possible layer of reality, I think you would get exactly what these action principles

30:19.200 --> 30:25.680
look like. So from that perspective, I think I think it's a it's a it's a scale. And the way I

30:25.680 --> 30:31.920
think it scales is this, you know, when we when we look at living things now, all we're seeing are

30:31.920 --> 30:37.920
it's a selection effect, all we're seeing are things that survived the gauntlet of competition

30:37.920 --> 30:45.200
and and selection. So we don't have any objects in that we don't see any living forms that are

30:45.200 --> 30:50.240
not good at pursuing goals, those things disappeared very early on. Now, maybe we'll be able to create

30:50.240 --> 30:56.080
some life that doesn't do that as as people work on synthetic, you know, origins of life and synthetic

30:56.080 --> 31:01.760
life and so on. But any sophisticated life that makes it past, you know, the first few the first

31:01.760 --> 31:09.280
few steps of competition is going to be great at pursuing goals in the very simple sense of

31:09.280 --> 31:14.720
homeostasis. So one of the things that we're working on now is to try to understand the

31:14.720 --> 31:20.560
scaling of goals from tiny homeostatic goals, like either chemical reactions that try to keep

31:20.560 --> 31:26.160
certain entropic principles in particular ranges, or single cells like bacteria that try to keep

31:26.160 --> 31:35.840
metabolic states in particular ranges. How do you scale goals from these very modest types of

31:35.840 --> 31:40.720
goals to something that's much larger, like the goal of having a properly shaped hand or face

31:40.720 --> 31:47.200
with particular, you know, and then how do you pivot the whole thing to from from early organisms

31:47.200 --> 31:53.200
that, and in fact, still current organisms that execute goals in morpho space, meaning the the

31:53.280 --> 31:57.760
space of possible anatomical configurations. And you sort of pivot you run the same algorithms,

31:57.760 --> 32:02.480
but now your space is three dimensional space outdoors. So now you can run around and have

32:02.480 --> 32:06.480
behavior and have goals that are, Hey, I'm going to run this maze because I remember the structure

32:06.480 --> 32:09.680
of the maze. And at the end, there's some cheese and along with the way I'm going to do this and

32:09.680 --> 32:15.600
that. So this this idea, you know, life has to start out with with homeostatic loops, I don't

32:15.600 --> 32:22.480
think there's any way around it. And those loops scale into progressively more impressive goals

32:22.560 --> 32:28.960
that what's what's what one way to organize all this is to is to ask yourself, what are the

32:28.960 --> 32:34.640
spatiotemporal boundaries of the goals that any given system could potentially have. So it's

32:34.640 --> 32:39.440
sort of like like think of a light cone, so to speak, that that says, okay, here, right in space

32:39.440 --> 32:45.280
and time, here is the boundary of things I can possibly have goals about. So if you're a goldfish

32:45.280 --> 32:50.400
or a tick, those both in space and time, it's rather modest, you can only conceive of things

32:50.400 --> 32:54.720
that are right in front of you and not too far in the past. And you maybe have a little bit of

32:55.440 --> 33:01.120
anticipatory ability. But by the time you get to great apes or humans, you know, you could have

33:01.120 --> 33:07.920
goals that are that are that are massive in scale. And you know, you just just a huge both both in

33:07.920 --> 33:12.400
terms of time in terms of memory and anticipation that you could be working towards things that are

33:12.400 --> 33:17.920
going to happen long after you're long after you die and things like that. So that's one way

33:17.920 --> 33:23.840
to organize all this is by the by the scale of the goals that these systems are capable of maintaining.

33:26.000 --> 33:31.120
It can be hard sometimes to get up the motivation to start exercising. But once you get going,

33:31.120 --> 33:36.800
it can be really thrilling. Peloton is an easy way to overcome that barrier to getting started

33:36.800 --> 33:42.560
and staying motivated once you're there. Peloton has inspiring instructors, amazing music, endless

33:42.560 --> 33:47.120
fitness variety and an engaging community. Whether you're looking for some extra encouragement,

33:47.120 --> 33:51.760
structured workouts or just in the mood to laugh, their instructors are there to bring out the best

33:51.760 --> 33:57.520
during each class. And with epic artist collaborations, and there's specially curated music, whether

33:57.520 --> 34:02.560
you're in the mood for some hip hop, pop country, the Peloton bike has the right music to keep you

34:02.560 --> 34:08.160

34:28.080 --> 34:32.720
I thought of myself a lot about levels of description and reality. I mean, my book,

34:32.720 --> 34:38.160
The Big Picture, just talked about levels a lot. And I'll be honest, I've always been very resistant

34:38.160 --> 34:44.560
to the idea of causation acting between levels, downward or upward. It seems to me, and I think

34:44.560 --> 34:50.160
this is just my fundamental physicist training kicking in, that levels should be autonomous

34:50.160 --> 34:55.200
from each other. And I mean, you can derive one from another maybe, but they act differently. But

34:55.840 --> 35:03.040
maybe I should just start thinking differently when it comes to biology or human scale things.

35:03.200 --> 35:08.720
Certainly, the words you're using seem to indicate to me that you find it useful to

35:10.560 --> 35:15.920
speak as if what's happening on one level, like organism wide or network wide or whatever,

35:15.920 --> 35:19.760
is important to take consideration of even when we're talking about what's happening on lower

35:19.760 --> 35:26.960
levels. Yes, I think that's true. And I think that actually, you may have seen this, but there's

35:27.600 --> 35:34.080
very interesting work on this coming out of Giulio Tononi's lab and Eric Hall about

35:34.080 --> 35:39.040
quantifying some of these things. So there's now math that will help you understand for a given

35:40.240 --> 35:49.920
system, what is the causally most potent level at which to manipulate it. And it's not practical

35:49.920 --> 35:53.840
to compute some of those things for a lot of real systems that we care about. But certainly,

35:54.400 --> 36:02.000
there are techniques that we use all the time in the lab to ask what is the most appropriate level

36:02.000 --> 36:09.120
at which to try to manipulate the system. And inevitably, it bleeds down into the lower levels

36:09.120 --> 36:13.680
in the following sense. So in Plenaria, let's say, so we have these flatworms and they have one head

36:13.680 --> 36:19.280
and one tail and you chop them into pieces. And each piece knows where the head and the tail are

36:19.280 --> 36:24.160
supposed to go and it reliably sort of regenerates whatever is missing. So what we've been able to

36:24.160 --> 36:30.080
show is that this is partly the result of a circuit, which is partially electrical,

36:30.800 --> 36:36.880
which stores the pattern of what a correct Plenarian is supposed to look like. And we can now see this

36:36.880 --> 36:43.840
pattern, we can rewrite it, we can alter it so that now the pattern memory says two heads instead

36:43.920 --> 36:48.000
of one. And then that's exactly what sells Bill, Bill, two-headed flatworms.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.160
I don't want to go over this too quickly because I know you do this all the time,

36:54.160 --> 37:01.280
but this is just amazing to the rest of us. You can chop off the tail and head of this little worm

37:01.280 --> 37:04.560
and train it to grow back two heads or two tails instead of one head and one tail.

37:05.600 --> 37:11.040
That's correct. Yeah, it's an amazing thing. So Plenaria, basically, I think every important

37:11.040 --> 37:17.280
question of life is found somewhere in Plenarian biology, I think you could say. They're an amazing

37:17.280 --> 37:22.480
creature. First of all, they're flatworms, not roundworms, so they are bilaterians,

37:22.480 --> 37:28.800
meaning they are similar to our ancestors. They have a true brain. Most of the same neurotransmitters

37:28.800 --> 37:32.640
that you and I have, they're smart, they can learn, but they have this incredible property.

37:32.640 --> 37:38.400
You can chop them into pieces. The record, I think, is something like 275. And every piece

37:38.400 --> 37:43.440
will regenerate exactly what's missing, no more, no less, and make a perfect, tiny little worm.

37:43.440 --> 37:48.400
Now, they are so regenerative that they're immortal. They don't age. There's no such thing as an old

37:48.400 --> 37:53.600
Plenarian, which means, first of all, that the worms that we have in our lab are in a direct

37:53.600 --> 37:58.560
physical continuity with worms that were here half a billion years ago, and that's mind-boggling

37:58.560 --> 38:04.080
to think about. And also, it's telling us that, in fact, it is possible to be a complex organism

38:04.480 --> 38:11.360
with a good brain and so on, and never die. These ideas of thermodynamic limits on aging and so on,

38:11.360 --> 38:16.960
I don't think are correct. But anyway, so that's what the animal does normally. Now,

38:18.080 --> 38:23.200
of course, lots of interesting work has been done on how this works. They have a bunch of stem cells

38:23.200 --> 38:29.360
that lots of work has been done on the molecular and genetic networks that specify different

38:30.320 --> 38:35.600
cell types out of these stem cells. But what's really important to understand is the stem cells

38:35.600 --> 38:39.760
produce the building blocks, all the different things that you need to make a Plenarian,

38:39.760 --> 38:44.160
but you still have to decide how to arrange all this stuff. And all of it can be arranged in many

38:44.160 --> 38:51.440
different configurations. Now, people learned long ago to manipulate the lower levels of the system,

38:51.440 --> 38:55.680
meaning to get in there and take some of the genes that are required for making heads and tails,

38:56.480 --> 39:02.000
regulate their expression, and get one-headed or two-headed worms. We found something that's,

39:02.000 --> 39:08.640
I think, it takes us to the next level, which is two things. First of all, that you can actually,

39:09.840 --> 39:16.640
that there is a real-time bioelectrical circuit that stores an active pattern, which you can see

39:16.640 --> 39:22.080
using special dyes that reveal electrical states and microscopy. You can actually see this

39:22.880 --> 39:25.920
this anatomical pattern towards which the thing is going to build.

39:26.720 --> 39:30.880
And so that's the first thing. The second thing is that you can, by turning on and off

39:30.880 --> 39:36.080
these ion channels, which are these little protein batteries that exist in cell membranes,

39:36.080 --> 39:40.880
by turning these things on and off, you can manipulate that circuit and get pieces to build,

39:40.880 --> 39:45.920
let's say, a two-headed or a no-headed animal. And one of the most amazing things about it

39:45.920 --> 39:51.840
is that if you then, if you have a two-headed animal and you recut that animal in plain water,

39:51.840 --> 39:56.640
so no more manipulation, no more doing anything to the ion channels, you will once again get

39:56.640 --> 40:03.360
a two-headed worm. Now, this is worth pausing here because what has not been done in this case

40:03.360 --> 40:09.040
is to manipulate the genome. The genome has a wild-type sequence. You've not altered the genetics

40:09.040 --> 40:15.280
at all. This is a great example and maybe the best example of the separation of data from machine

40:15.280 --> 40:19.600
in this case because the cells are standard planarian cells. There's nothing wrong with

40:19.600 --> 40:25.760
them that you would identify on genomic sequencing. And they are happy to build whatever it is that

40:25.760 --> 40:31.280
is specified in this large-scale pattern memory that is kept by the tissue electric circuit. And

40:31.280 --> 40:35.520
if the electric circuit has two heads, that is, in fact, what they will build. And so this goes

40:35.520 --> 40:40.160
on in perpetuity. As far as we can tell, you can keep doing this. We now know how to set it back

40:40.160 --> 40:44.640
from two-headed to one-headed. Again, there's a change in the electrical state that you can make.

40:44.640 --> 40:50.960
And so this goes back to your question about downward causation because what you can say is,

40:50.960 --> 40:56.400
well, it makes a second head. What happened to the molecular pathways? Well, of course,

40:56.400 --> 41:01.840
the molecular pathways that are required to build a head are all activated on the posterior side

41:01.840 --> 41:07.280
of the animal. So you still need all... It's not like the Bioelectricity Act by itself. You still

41:07.280 --> 41:14.080
need all the building blocks. The hardware still has to make all the cells that create the brain

41:14.080 --> 41:20.400
tissue and eyes and all of that. But the decision, the early-on decision of what this tissue level

41:20.400 --> 41:26.240
agent is going to build, is made at this higher level, which then inevitably filters down to the

41:26.240 --> 41:31.920
lower level. So you can track that lower level. You can look at the gene expression. You will see

41:32.560 --> 41:36.400
nothing but chemistry. There's no magic. You will see every gene being triggered by some other gene

41:36.400 --> 41:43.120
or something like that. But if you ask the practical question of what is the best way to

41:43.120 --> 41:48.000
make a two-headed worm, you've got a couple options. You can try to manipulate these lower level

41:50.160 --> 41:57.680
activities. And it's quite hard. Or you can go up to the master regulator level and you can just

41:57.680 --> 42:03.280
interact. And this happens roughly between three and six hours after cutting. All the transcriptional

42:03.280 --> 42:08.320
changes happen in the next 24 hours. The first thing after amputation, that circuit acts between

42:08.320 --> 42:14.240
three and six hours. And it triggers both scaling so that the heads are correctly scaled with respect

42:14.240 --> 42:19.520
to the rest of the worm and the identity of the tissue. So head versus tail. All of that stuff

42:19.520 --> 42:26.720
is downstream. So I do think from that perspective, I do think there's a kind of downward causation

42:26.720 --> 42:31.600
regardless of some of the philosophical aspects in the sense that you simply ask what's the best

42:31.600 --> 42:36.480
control knob. And in some cases, it will not be by electricity. And in many cases, we've seen that

42:36.480 --> 42:41.200
that's exactly where the decisions are made. And I think that's not surprising. Looking at the way

42:41.200 --> 42:47.680
the brain works, brains are basically an elaboration of the system that evolution found probably around

42:47.680 --> 42:52.800
the time of bacterial biofilms, actually. Oh, you'll have to say more about that. But

42:53.840 --> 42:58.240
in what sense, how are you relating bacterial biofilms to brains?

42:58.240 --> 43:06.240
Sure. So actually, there's a lot of work on some of the early work on ion channels,

43:06.240 --> 43:13.440
actually, was done in bacteria. It was known from decades ago that bacteria can be electrically

43:13.440 --> 43:20.560
active. And there was some recently some really nice work from UCLA, where there's a set of papers

43:20.560 --> 43:29.520
by Arthur Prindle and colleagues who have shown that bacterial biofilms drive a lot of very brain

43:29.520 --> 43:35.040
like electrical dynamics. So individual individual bacteria coordinate with each other. And what you

43:35.040 --> 43:42.000
get are waves, potassium waves that in many ways are similar to what happens in brains. And I see,

43:42.000 --> 43:45.840
right. And basically bacterial biofilms, you know, they're kind of proto body, right? They're

43:46.400 --> 43:50.800
individual organisms learning to live with each other in a way to make a larger agent that can

43:50.800 --> 43:55.760
do things that individual agents can't. Good. That is actually very helpful. And I'm sure that's

43:55.760 --> 44:00.000
worth the whole podcast by itself. But I do want to get back to the planarian there because I am

44:00.000 --> 44:05.360
not personally an expert on the planarian reproductive strategy. So I don't even know

44:05.360 --> 44:13.280
do they lay eggs or give birth. But how exactly is the information about one headed versus two

44:13.280 --> 44:21.120
headed planarian set down traveling down to future generations? Like where in the organism is it?

44:22.000 --> 44:26.640
Yeah. Yeah. So so this is a great question. A couple of things. Let's let's start back with

44:26.640 --> 44:32.240
the question of how they normally reproduce. So which which already tells us that there's a

44:32.240 --> 44:38.320
lot we don't know. So so planaria is some at least the species that we work with, they are capable

44:38.320 --> 44:43.680
of laying eggs and producing sperm and sexual reproduction. But mostly what they do is fission.

44:43.680 --> 44:48.400
So when they feel happy or in fact, when they're stressed, either either one leads to the same

44:48.400 --> 44:54.320
outcome. Oddly enough, they are good model organisms for human beings too. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

44:54.320 --> 45:00.880
There are lots of lots of I mean, people use them actually for to study addiction to drug

45:00.880 --> 45:04.880
addiction. And you know, they get addicted to all the same stuff that we do and so on.

45:04.880 --> 45:10.560
So when you know, when they want to fission, the back end grabs on to the dish, the front end

45:10.560 --> 45:14.960
keeps going and they tear themselves in the middle and then they regenerate. Now you've got two worms.

45:14.960 --> 45:19.840
So that's their normal reproductive cycle. Now, already before we even get to the two headed

45:19.840 --> 45:25.600
stuff, there's something really interesting here, which is that you and I and most animals, when

45:25.600 --> 45:30.480
we reproduce, our children do not inherit the mutations that happen to us during our lifetime.

45:30.480 --> 45:36.080
So if you get a change of DNA in your arm, your kids don't get that. So that is, that's really

45:36.080 --> 45:42.480
important. And but the thing with planaria, because each piece rebuilds a new body out of

45:42.480 --> 45:46.960
the cells that were in that piece, this means that unlike the rest of us, they practice somatic

45:46.960 --> 45:52.000
inheritance. They do inherit every mutation that doesn't kill the neoblast, the stem cell, they

45:52.000 --> 45:58.160
got it. And those things proliferate. So for, let's say 400 million years, they've been accumulating

45:58.160 --> 46:03.120
mutations. And you can see this in their genomes are an incredible mess. We don't even have a proper

46:03.120 --> 46:09.280
genomic assembly for the kinds of worms that we work with. They are mix deployed, meaning every cell

46:09.280 --> 46:12.640
might have a different number of chromosomes. So you don't even really know what you're sequencing

46:12.640 --> 46:18.000
when you sequence these things. The genome is an incredible mess. And yet, the regeneration,

46:18.000 --> 46:23.520
the anatomy is rock solid 100% of the time you cut that thing into pieces, you get normal worms.

46:23.520 --> 46:27.760
So this is already telling us that there's some very interesting room between the genetics and

46:27.760 --> 46:33.200
the anatomy that we don't understand because the genetics could be very messy and the anatomy is

46:33.200 --> 46:39.680
rock solid. So now let's get to your next question, which is the two heads. So if you have a two-headed

46:39.680 --> 46:49.600
worm, they can reproduce by fissioning. When that happens, generally speaking, one of the pieces

46:49.600 --> 46:56.320
will end up two-headed and one of the pieces will end up one-headed. So you can imagine a scenario

46:56.320 --> 47:02.640
where we take some two-headed worms and we throw them in the Charles River here in Boston and sort

47:02.640 --> 47:07.280
of at some point, some scientists in the future come along and they scoop up some samples and they

47:07.280 --> 47:11.280
find some one-headed forms and some two-headed forms and they say, ah, cool, a speciation event.

47:11.280 --> 47:15.440
Let's sequence the genomes and see where that happened, right? And they're not going to find

47:15.440 --> 47:19.120
anything. And the reason is precisely your question, where does the information live?

47:19.760 --> 47:27.440
So we have found, so far, we've found two places where that information lives. In the strict two-headed,

47:27.440 --> 47:31.120
there's actually another part of this that I hadn't mentioned yet, which is called cryptic

47:31.120 --> 47:36.080
worms, which I'll talk about in a minute. In the two-headed worms, one of the things that happens

47:36.080 --> 47:44.800
is the molecular structure of the cytoskeleton, the thing that allows cells, especially neurons,

47:44.800 --> 47:54.480
but all kinds of cells, to know a direction from basal to apicalers and so on. This cytoskeleton

47:54.480 --> 48:01.360
is actually carrying a lot of the information. And it goes back to a really interesting

48:02.000 --> 48:07.760
experiment, which is classical epigenetics. So now, right now, if you say epigenetics,

48:07.760 --> 48:12.000
people normally think about chromatin modifications, all the things that can happen to the genome

48:12.240 --> 48:16.960
to mark it for future generations. There's an older example, which is that if you take

48:16.960 --> 48:22.240
a single cell organism, like a paramecium, they have these little hairs that point a particular

48:22.240 --> 48:26.320
way, and they swim, they wave the little cilia, and they swim. So what somebody did was they took

48:26.320 --> 48:30.400
a glass needle, and this is an amazing experiment because these things are tiny. They took a glass

48:30.400 --> 48:36.080
needle and they cut a little square in the surface of the animal. I don't actually think it was a

48:36.080 --> 48:41.120
paramecium, but it was a related thing. And they rotated it 180 degrees and they put it back. This

48:41.120 --> 48:48.080
is doing this to a single cell, mind you, with my hand. Under the microscope. And so what they

48:48.080 --> 48:54.720
found is that these things give rise to a line of animals that all have a little square looking

48:54.720 --> 49:00.400
the wrong way. And this was incredible. This was the first real example of epigenetics because,

49:00.400 --> 49:04.080
of course, they had a wild type genome. And in fact, there's a beautiful line in one of the

49:04.080 --> 49:09.120
papers that says these things are always on the verge of starvation because they're trying to

49:09.120 --> 49:14.240
use the little cilia to waft food into their mouths. And there's a little square that's, of

49:14.240 --> 49:18.240
course, kicking the food out the wrong way so they're never quite good. And he says they're

49:18.240 --> 49:23.200
always on the verge of starvation and their normal genome is powerless to help them. And this is a

49:23.200 --> 49:28.480
very powerful point because, yes, the genome has done everything correctly. All the proteins have

49:29.360 --> 49:33.680
been made. They have all of the proteins that it takes to make a normal structure. But the reason

49:33.680 --> 49:38.720
these guys aren't normal is because the information is being templated off of the mother cell. So when

49:38.720 --> 49:44.400
the mother cell makes a daughter cell, it templates that abnormal structure of the cytoskeleton,

49:44.400 --> 49:51.760
you know, almost like a crystal templating, it templates it and creates an offspring with

49:51.760 --> 49:58.320
the same structure. So there's something like that in Plenaria where actually that subcellular

49:58.320 --> 50:04.320
polarity is being scaled up from individual cells to the whole organism. And then, of course,

50:04.400 --> 50:09.920
there's the one that I think is also extremely interesting, which is the bioelectric circuit.

50:09.920 --> 50:16.880
So one of the things that we can see is that the way that the ion channels in Plenaria have been

50:16.880 --> 50:21.760
shaped by evolution is that they make a circuit that has memory. And now engineers, of course,

50:21.760 --> 50:27.040
are pretty familiar with this. It's a really convenient way to make memory circuits. As long

50:27.040 --> 50:31.920
as you keep powering them, you can have flip flops and things like this where you make a transient

50:31.920 --> 50:36.000
electrical change. And the circuit keeps that change until you come back and reset it. So it's

50:36.000 --> 50:41.200
sort of like like like volatile RAM, so to speak. So so this electrical circuit, there's a there's

50:41.200 --> 50:45.680
another type of worm that we can make, which is really interesting. We call them cryptic worms.

50:45.680 --> 50:52.000
And the thing with cryptic worms is that they they every time you cut them, they toss a coin,

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
and they make a more or less random, although it's a weighted it's a biased coin, but it's more or

50:56.000 --> 51:01.600
less a random decision as to whether they're going to make one heads or not. And if they

51:01.600 --> 51:06.240
don't, what results is again, a cryptic worm. And if they do, you get a two headed worm that is

51:06.240 --> 51:11.440
forever a two headed worm. These cryptic worms, the as far as we can tell, all the molecular

51:12.080 --> 51:18.000
aspects are normal. But what's abnormal is the bio electric pattern that is stored by their real

51:18.000 --> 51:23.600
time electric circuit. And it is this pattern that makes them be this it makes them have this

51:23.600 --> 51:28.240
destabilized anatomy where they're not quite sure if they should be one headed or two headed.

51:28.240 --> 51:32.640
And you can you can manipulate that electrical pattern and convert them back into one headed

51:32.640 --> 51:37.760
worms or into two headed worms or whatever. One of the interesting there's a there's a paper that

51:37.760 --> 51:43.920
from our lab that's about to about to come out in a few weeks, that looks at this as as as a as a

51:43.920 --> 51:47.760
by stable perception problem in the nervous system. So you know, when you look at these things that

51:47.760 --> 51:51.840
are like the rabbit duck illusion, right, or the necker cube or these kinds of things. Yeah. So

51:51.840 --> 51:56.080
so there's a there's this there's this ability of nervous systems to exist in almost the almost

51:56.160 --> 52:00.400
superposition of states where you're and this is very much top down control, right, because it's

52:00.400 --> 52:05.760
driven in both cases, the the photons, the pattern of photons hitting your retina is exactly the same.

52:05.760 --> 52:09.120
The reason that you keep flipping from one to the other is because you have expectations

52:09.120 --> 52:12.880
in the firstonian sense, right, you think it's got to be a cube and if it's always got to be

52:12.880 --> 52:18.560
facing in or out. Yeah. So so that kind of top down control in the nervous system is very similar

52:18.560 --> 52:23.680
to what happens in these electrical circuits in non neural cells, where there can be this this

52:23.680 --> 52:27.600
by stability where there's kind of two ways to interpret this electrical information. And that's

52:27.600 --> 52:33.520
what that's what the cells do. So so I think I think and all of that is not to say that we've

52:33.520 --> 52:38.880
plumbed the depths of this. There's absolutely more open questions than there are answers. So there

52:38.880 --> 52:44.320
may be other pieces to this puzzle. But I feel very strongly that the question of where is this

52:44.320 --> 52:52.480
information is in part, it's kept as electrical memory in the electrical circuit. And partially

52:52.480 --> 52:58.640
it's in the in the in the in the sub cellular architecture of the cells that are copying

52:58.640 --> 53:03.200
previous architectures when they when they form. And we should, you know, you might also be interested

53:03.200 --> 53:07.920
in the the shifting of worm heads to other species, because you can do that too. It's not,

53:07.920 --> 53:12.960
you know, making multiple, you know, making multiple heads of the same species is one thing.

53:12.960 --> 53:19.040
But you can actually, again, by by interfering in the normal electrical electric in the normal

53:19.040 --> 53:24.320
electrical circuit, you can get these cells to build heads that belong to other species of

53:24.320 --> 53:31.120
planaria 150 million years distant with with no genetic change at all. And to go back to put

53:31.120 --> 53:36.800
this in the context of the tadpoles whose faces we rearranged, and they figured out how to get

53:36.800 --> 53:43.120
them back. The idea there is a goal in mind as to what the ultimate face you want is.

53:44.880 --> 53:48.240
Combining that with what we've just been talking about with the paramisi in the planaria,

53:48.240 --> 53:54.400
that means that wherever this goal is, that's not all by itself encoded in the genome either,

53:54.400 --> 53:58.880
right? It's encoded a little bit more globally. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, it is absolutely not

53:58.880 --> 54:04.320
directly in the genome. I think I think again, the way to think about this is is good. You know,

54:04.320 --> 54:09.360
our concept of software running on electrical devices, I think is actually really good to

54:09.360 --> 54:16.560
to get us an intuitive understanding of this. I think what the genome does is encode a system

54:16.640 --> 54:20.480
that when you turn on the juice, it encodes a set of electrical, and of course, there's also

54:20.480 --> 54:25.040
biomechanics and biochemical signals that are important. But when you turn on the juice,

54:25.040 --> 54:30.800
it reliably executes a pattern of activity. There's symmetry breaking, there's amplification,

54:30.800 --> 54:34.720
there's robustness, meaning if you have some extra potassium in the in the pond that you're

54:34.720 --> 54:37.680
growing in, it's not going to destabilize the whole thing. There are all these important

54:37.680 --> 54:43.440
properties that allow you to spontaneously form a pattern of activity in this electric circuit.

54:43.440 --> 54:47.120
It's like, you know, you got a bag of parts that were specified for you, you connect them all

54:47.120 --> 54:51.680
together, you turn on the juice, and it does something. And the parts were fine tuned over

54:51.680 --> 54:58.000
eons to make sure that what it does by default is is reliable and adaptive and useful. But then

54:58.000 --> 55:03.440
you find an amazing thing, which is that there's actually that the thing's actually reprogrammable

55:03.440 --> 55:11.360
that while it does have a default mode of behavior that would that it will execute every single time,

55:12.240 --> 55:17.840
there is in fact a set of stimuli or experiences that you can give it without going in and having

55:17.840 --> 55:24.800
to rewire it, that will push it into a different mode. In particular, what it will do is what you

55:24.800 --> 55:31.920
can do is you can rewrite the part of that electric circuit that serves as your homeostatic

55:31.920 --> 55:37.280
set point. It's like, you know, if you had a thermostat, there has to be some physical

55:37.280 --> 55:42.080
structure that encodes the range that this thing is trying to maintain, and you can just go change

55:42.080 --> 55:46.240
that, you don't need to, you know, rebuild your thermostat, you can you can change the set point.

55:46.240 --> 55:53.600
So it looks like in many cases, living things have a set point. Now, this is much more complex

55:53.600 --> 56:00.320
than let's say pH or some sort of metabolic level, these are anatomical set points that are that are

56:00.320 --> 56:05.840
rough, not to the cell scale, obviously, but a rough description of what the thing should look like.

56:05.920 --> 56:11.840
And these set points are in many ways, we call them target morphologies, it's the pattern to

56:11.840 --> 56:16.320
which the cells are trying to build and it's the pattern that once they achieve it, then they stop.

56:17.760 --> 56:22.000
These things are rewritable. And once you rewrite them, the cells will build something different.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.240
And what we don't know, of course, is the limitations. We don't know if cells are a

56:26.240 --> 56:32.240
universal constructor in the sense that can you make absolutely anything or are there constraints?

56:32.320 --> 56:37.760
People talk about developmental constraints. I'm not 100% sure what that really is, or if there are

56:37.760 --> 56:43.440
any constraints, in the sense that if we knew, I think we just don't know the code enough. If we

56:43.440 --> 56:52.000
understood how to reprogram correctly these target patterns, I think we would be looking at something

56:52.000 --> 56:57.520
like an anatomical compiler. This is like our vision when I talk about what's the end game for our

56:57.520 --> 57:02.000
group, when can you give up and go home? Because everything's done. I think what we're looking

57:02.000 --> 57:06.720
at is something like an anatomical compiler that you sit down, much like computer aided drawing,

57:06.720 --> 57:13.440
you basically just draw a picture of a schematic of the animal or plant that you want. And if we

57:13.440 --> 57:18.400
knew what we were doing, the system would decompose that into a set of stimuli that you would give

57:18.400 --> 57:22.240
cells to get them to build that particular thing. Not because you're going to micromanage,

57:23.120 --> 57:28.960
you're not going to 3D print individual stem cell derivatives, but you're going to rewrite the

57:28.960 --> 57:33.520
goal state that the cells are accessing the cell collective. I should be more precise. The cell

57:33.520 --> 57:39.840
collective is accessing to know what to build and when to stop. The idea that there's all these

57:39.840 --> 57:43.760
different levels that are interacting with each other is a very powerful one. And not just because

57:44.640 --> 57:49.120
there are levels with different levels of coarse graining, if you want, but that there are

57:49.920 --> 57:56.080
right levels in some sense. This is what you sort of got to earlier. There are ways of describing

57:56.080 --> 58:01.280
these complex systems that just give you an enormously more powerful handle on what they're

58:01.280 --> 58:06.400
going to do. And one of the issues that you've talked about, it's even come up a little bit

58:06.400 --> 58:10.560
in what we've already said about the planaria and the biofilms with the bacteria, which is

58:11.200 --> 58:16.960
at what point do a bunch of either cells or molecules or whatever constitute an organism?

58:17.280 --> 58:22.240
I mean, at what point are they a self that you can pinpoint? That's a level of analysis.

58:22.240 --> 58:27.120
I can talk about the morphology and the hopes and dreams of that little bugger right there.

58:28.080 --> 58:35.280
Yeah, I think that's a great question. And there's two aspects to this, I think,

58:35.280 --> 58:42.400
that we at least that we focused on. One of the aspects is how cells come into being. And this

58:42.480 --> 58:47.280
is the scale up of, and I think this is both philosophically and empirically, this is one

58:47.280 --> 58:52.720
of the most fascinating problems in science, is the fact that all cognitive agents are made of

58:52.720 --> 58:58.960
parts. There's no such thing as a sort of this monadic kind of diamond like cognitive thing

58:58.960 --> 59:05.280
that's not divisible. We are a bag of cells in between our ears. And when people say, oh,

59:06.240 --> 59:11.920
what are you talking about? This collection of cells has memory and goals. So, well,

59:11.920 --> 59:15.520
you have memory and goals, right? And they say, yes, I certainly do. And I say, well, very good,

59:15.520 --> 59:21.840
because you're a collection of cells. And so the question isn't whether cells can have goals and

59:21.840 --> 59:26.960
hopes and dreams, that question has been settled, at least if for no one else but for yourself.

59:26.960 --> 59:30.880
This is other mind's problem, maybe, but at least for yourself, you know, that's the case.

59:30.880 --> 59:35.760
And so now the only remaining question is the scaling. How do you scale up from a collection

59:35.760 --> 59:43.680
of competent agents to some sort of unified single agent that has that has a coherent

59:43.680 --> 59:49.040
integrated cells that is larger than these others, right? So I actually have a model of this,

59:49.920 --> 59:55.360
of how this works, although much work remains to be done. But I have a beginning model of this

59:55.360 --> 01:00:00.560
that has to do with these really important elements called gap junctions. So these are

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:05.920
things that, these are proto synapses. This is what synapses were before they became modern

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:11.760
synapses. They're basically, think about two, they're little proteins that hang out in the cell

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:16.000
surface that can dock with each other. And you can think about like two submarine hatches underwater,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.240
sort of docking and opening up a path that you can go from cell to cell. So the interesting thing

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:28.240
about that is that, and these are critical for multi-cellularity. They are an important part

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:34.240
of electric circuits because they are themselves voltage gated. So not only does electrical potential

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:38.640
propagate through these open gap junctions, but it actually controls whether they're open or closed.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:45.280
So that means that this is a voltage gated current conductance, which a.k.a. a transistor.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.960
And we know that once you have a transistor, you can make almost anything, you can make logicates

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.840
and so on. It gives them memory historicity and so on. So what's really neat about these things,

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:58.400
if you imagine two individual cells coming together and forming this kind of gap junction,

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.760
unlike every other kind of cell signaling. So cells produce all kinds of molecules in their

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:07.840
environment. They secrete all kinds of molecules. And if you're a cell in the environment,

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:12.800
you can receive those molecules. And then you know perfectly well that they're not yours. You

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:18.160
know perfectly that they originate from the outside. You can choose to interpret them or you can think

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:23.760
that they are false. You know that somebody's taking advantage of you or cooperating or competing

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:29.120
or whatever. But something very different happens when you connect with these electrical synapses.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:34.400
When you connect with these gap junctions, both cells get access to each other's internal

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:40.960
milieu. This means that things that happen to one of the cells very rapidly propagate to the other

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:49.040
cell. And all the metadata as far as what the originator of that information is is stripped.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.760
So if something happens to cell A and there's a calcium flux and that calcium flux propagates to

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:59.280
cell B, it doesn't you know, all cell B sees is this flux. It doesn't know whether what triggered

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:05.440
it happened to it or to its partner. This has a couple of really critical implications. The first

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:10.000
is that it makes lying or cheating almost impossible. Because anything you do right,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.120
anything you do to your neighbor is immediately going to come back to you. So if you try to poison

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:22.080
your neighbor in some sort of you know competition, you're going to get it too. And what it also means

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:28.800
is that it becomes really difficult to maintain ownership of individual thought. So if what you

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.960
have are a bunch of information molecules that were a track record of things that happened to you.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.720
And you know, we don't have to think about complex thinking here. We can just say

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.800
there are events that happen that trigger molecular reactions and these molecular reactions are

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:47.040
a record that you use to adjust future behaviors in all cells to this. So now you're sharing those

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.920
molecules and you can no longer tell which are true memories that you accumulated, and which

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.720
are false memories that are incepted into your cognitive structure by the fact that they floated

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:02.560
in from your neighbor. So now this erases it's like an amazing form of telepathy, so to speak,

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:10.000
because it merges the minds of these two cells into a group agent where they literally cannot tell

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.200
what belongs to what. And in that case, that is the origin of this I would claim that is the

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:21.200
origin of a simple compound self. It's because you're erasing it's kind of cool. I mean, I think

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.160
and again, this is far outside my field, but I think there's a lot of important quantum computation

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:30.400
work as far as erasures, right? The fact that erasing information is critical. I think this

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:37.440
is an example of that erasing this metadata that, hey, here's a memory that belongs to this

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:44.320
unit over here. All of that is gone and that helps create a kind of larger mind, so to speak. And

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:50.400
of course, this is a proto cognitive sort of thing, but you can imagine the scaling larger and larger

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:56.560
to allow this agent now to have bigger horizons of those goals that I mentioned so that you can now

01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:02.960
contemplate much, much, much bigger things in both space. And you have the computational machinery

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:09.200
to remember further back in time and to anticipate further into the future. Now, this kind of thing

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:15.520
has a has a cool implication, which is that he would think that okay, if this is the origin of

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:20.720
the self, then you have two questions. Number one is can it break down and what the how would it

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:27.760
break down? And what you can imagine is imagine that you're part of this sensation, you're connected

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.480
to a bunch of neighbors, you're this multicellular kind of creature. And for whatever reason,

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:37.600
your gap junctions get closed, you can no longer hear the electrical signals from your neighbors,

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:46.480
you are now sort of isolated from all this, you no longer get the information input, you no longer

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:51.680
get the consequences of things you do directly fed back to you. You could imagine that you would

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:57.680
then in a game theory sense, instead of previously where you're sort of forced to cooperate. And

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:01.280
by the way, this is very interesting. This is where we're doing now simulations of prisoners

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:07.200
dilemma, where the agents instead of just cooperating and defecting, they actually have a new ability

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:11.680
they can merge. And once you merge, what you see is that, right, it's the as to my knowledge,

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:16.160
it's the first time that the number of agents in a prisoner's dilemma is not constant, usually

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:20.320
define the agents, and then you see what emerges and there's cooperation, whatever. But what happens

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.960
is, if you don't, if you don't fix the number to be a constant, and you let agents merge,

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:29.760
you find out that cooperation doesn't just emerge, it's inevitable, because you can't

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:35.840
cheat against yourself, because your yourself is now bigger. So what happens when this breaks down,

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:41.600
you can sort of imagine the consequences. And this is precisely what happens in cancer. So in

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:46.720
cancer, what they've known since the late 70s, that one of the first steps of carcinogenic

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.960
transformation is a closure of the gap junctions. And then it wasn't quite clear why. And I think

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:57.760
this is exactly what happens. When you as a cell, which your identity was smeared out all over this

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:04.240
tissue, you were part of this larger group cognition, as soon as you are now back, your

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.880
computational boundary, that surface from which you're getting signals is now shrunk back down

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:14.960
to the level of a single cell, you basically revert to your unicellular ancient past you.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:19.200
And this has been borne out by transcriptomics studies by Paul Davies group and others,

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:27.280
where you now basically treat the rest of the body as just environment. You do what single cells

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:31.360
always do, they go where life is good, they migrate, they proliferate as much as they can.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:37.600
And this is metastasis. And so one way to think about this as a cancer is a breakdown of multi

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.400
cellularity. And it, in fact, can be caused, it doesn't have to have a genetic component,

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:47.120
it can be caused by purely physiological cause. We've shown that we can make

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:52.960
metastatic melanoma in perfectly normal tadpoles by preventing electrical communication briefly.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:58.960
And these cells, this is what happens, the self literally shrinks. So going back to your question

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:04.080
of how you get the, when can you talk about cells, I think it has to do with the boundaries of these

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:10.320
goals. So that as soon as this cell no longer has a goal of building a proper, you know, liver

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:14.640
or kidney or whatever it was doing, all of its goals have now shrunk down to things that a single

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.200
cell can understand, which is very simple. I'm going to go down, I'm going to go, I'm going to

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:24.000
follow some, some gradients to where, where, where food is more plentiful. And I'm going to make as

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.080
many copies of myself as I possibly can. And this is, this is how cells shrink. So, you know, and

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:34.480
of course the implications of that are that you ought to be able to reverse it, which suggests

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:39.280
that cancer doesn't just have to be treated by trying to chase down all these irrevocably

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.280
broken cells and killing them with some sort of toxin. You might be able to convince them to

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:49.200
rejoin the collective. And we've done this in the frog model. We've shown that you can use either

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:56.160
optogenetics or drugs or iron channel misexpression to take cells that are expressing really nasty

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:02.160
human oncogenes or KRS and things like that. And basically just normalize them and force them

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:09.200
artificially to connect back into this, into this group, group agent, and normalize and, and when

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:14.640
go back to normal morphogenesis. You must know you're exactly describing the Borg collective

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:22.000
from Star Trek, right? I mean, in Star Trek, all these individuals, it's, it's treated as bad

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.400
that all these individuals melt into a single collective. But when we, when it's our cells

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:29.360
melting their individuality to make us, we think it's good.

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.720
Yeah, yeah, you're absolutely right. And I'm not, I'm not big on, on, on collectivist

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:39.040
kinds of things in general. I think that key is, but I think this is telling us something

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.000
important. I think what it's telling us is that we need to come up with optimal strategies. And

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.520
these are the sorts of things I do a lot of work, for example, with Josh Bongard at the University

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:54.960
of Vermont, he's a roboticist, computer scientist. We, we want to work on identifying optimal policies

01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:00.240
that try to get the best of both worlds. Because you see, when you do combine into this,

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.320
into this collective, there are some good things about it, which is, which are that you achieve

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:09.600
higher computational capacity cooperation is goes through the roof, all of that. But of course,

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.160
the downside is that this collective agent, the goals of the collective agent might have

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:17.520
absolutely nothing to do with the goals of the individual. And so, you know, when, when, when

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:21.840
you lose some skin, you don't worry about it and so on. And so, right. And so, so this is,

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:26.880
this is a real problem. And so what we need to do is to figure out now, evolution has, has optimized

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.960
this in particular ways. That's not to say that that's necessarily what we want. We need to come

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:38.640
up with optimal ways to, to enhance the, the, the, the benefits of this kind of cooperativity,

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.920
but still retain the multi-scale nature of it. You see, that's the key is you don't want to lose

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:49.680
the, the agency of the, of the pieces. You want to retain it while reaping the benefits of some

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:54.400
of the larger scale features. And it's hard to say at this point how well that's going to work,

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.600
but I think that's a really important thing to work on in the future.

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:04.320
Does this whole philosophy help us either philosophically or practically when it comes

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:11.360
to our ambitions to go in there and change organisms, not just solve cure diseases, but to

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:16.720
make new organisms to do synthetic biology, to create new things from scratch? And vice-versa,

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:23.680
does it help us in what we would think of usually as robotics or technology? Can we learn lessons

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:28.640
from the biological side of things? Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think absolutely. And there's two ways

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:32.880
to, there's sort of a short-term view and a longer-term view of this. The short-term view is

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:39.840
that absolutely. So, so we work very closely with, with roboticists to take deep concepts in

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.680
both directions. So, on the one hand, take the things that we've learned from the robustness

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:49.200
and intelligence. I mean, the intelligent problem solving of, of these living forms is, is incredibly

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:54.880
high. And even, even organisms without brains, you know, this whole focus on, on kind of like

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:59.680
neuromorphic architectures for AI, I think is really a very limiting, limiting way to look at it.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:05.120
And so, so we, we try very hard to export some of these concepts into machine learning, into

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:10.240
robotics and, and so on. Multiscale robotics. You know, I gave a talk called, why robots don't get

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:15.280
cancer. You know, and this is, right, this is, this is exactly the problem is, is we make devices

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:20.800
where the pieces don't have sub-goals. And that's the, the good news is, yes, no, no, no, you're

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.320
not going to have a robot where part of it decides to defect and do something different. But on the

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:28.320
other hand, the robots aren't very good. They're not, they're not, you know, very, very flexible.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:33.200
So, so part of this, we're trying to export. And then going in the, in the other direction and take

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.720
interesting concepts from computer science, from cognitive science

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.400
into biology to help us understand how this works. I fundamentally think that

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.240
computer science and biology are not really different fields. I think we are all studying

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:54.480
computation just in different media. And I do think there's a lot of opportunity for, for, for

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.880
back and forth. But now the other thing that you mentioned is really important, which is the creation

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:07.360
of novel, novel systems. We are doing some work on, on synthetic, synthetic living machines and,

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:14.400
and creating new, new life forms by basically taking perfectly normal cells and giving them

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.880
additional freedom and then, and then some stimulation to, to become other types of organisms.

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:26.160
We, I think in our, in our lifetime, I think we are going to be surrounded by, you know,

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.880
Darwin had this, this phrase, endless forms, most beautiful. We, I mean, I think the reality is going

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:39.920
to be a variety of living agents that he couldn't have even conceived of in the sense that the space,

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:45.600
and this is something I'm working on now, is to map out at least the axes of this option space of

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:52.080
all possible agents. Because what the bioengineering is enabling us to do is to create hybrid,

01:12:52.880 --> 01:13:01.520
to create hybrid agents that are in part biological, in part electronic, right? The parts are

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:06.240
designed, parts are evolved, the parts that are evolved might have been biologically evolved,

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:11.680
or they might have been evolved in a virtual environment using genetic algorithms on the computer.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:20.800
All of these combinations and this, we're going to see everything from household appliances that

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:26.000
are run in part by machine learning and part by living, living brains that are, that are, you

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.800
know, sort of being controllers for various things that we would like to optimize to, to,

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:35.120
to humans and animals that have various implants that make, allow them to control other devices

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:40.720
and communicate with each other. These, you know, the space of possible agents and possible bodies

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:48.000
is enormous, right? I think that, right, the plasticity of cells and the ability, look, we,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.560
we put eyes, eyes on the tails of tadpoles and those animals can see perfectly well, you know,

01:13:54.560 --> 01:14:01.040
these, the plasticity with which cells can organize into a, into a functional form,

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:05.840
even though it's completely different from their genomic default is, is, is massive.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:09.680
And there's a few things important about that. One of the things that's important about that

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:13.680
is that, and Josh Bongart and I are currently writing a paper on this,

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:19.840
it blows up a lot of the vocabulary that we normally use. You know, people argue about

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.760
whether, there's a lot of papers arguing that living things are not machines.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:29.200
Well, they're certainly not 18th century machines, right? That's for sure, right? But,

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:33.680
but if you look at what machines are now, you know, all of the, all of the kinds of things that

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:37.360
people say, well, machines are predictable and they're, and they're made by a human and they're,

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:42.720
none of those things are true of machines anymore. And things like, what is a robot?

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.360
What is a, what, what does it mean to be evolved? What does it mean to be designed? You know,

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:50.560
if you dig into this question of what are we actually doing when we design something and

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:55.200
how is that different from testing variants over long times, you know, time span,

01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:03.600
all of these words like robot, program, machine, all of these things, I think, are operating on

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:09.520
categories that are no longer good categories. They served us well in the past when our

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:15.840
engineering was, was primitive and we couldn't make these, we couldn't fill in the middle of

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:21.200
these continuum between all of these kinds of things, but now we can. And so all of these terms

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:27.440
have to, all of these terms have to be redefined to really pick out what's essential about these

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:34.400
terms to really, I think, you know, sort of carve a nature up better than, than they used to. And

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:40.640
that will, will have massive implications not only for, let's say, regenerative biology and

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:45.040
biomedicine and robotics and things like this, but there's, there are ethics issues here too.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:51.600
We have to think very hard about what we owe to different kinds of agents with different kinds

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:58.480
of cognitive capacities. And, you know, I've been in a lot of debates with people talking about

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:03.760
brain organoids and human brain organoids and what, you know, what human brains are and so on.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:11.760
Because these things are now continua, you know, we could, you could now make a system that's 80%

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:17.440
human brain cells, 20% drosophila cells and 10% electronics with machine learning. Is that a human?

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.640
Is it not? You know, something like, you know, if your neighbor got the brain implant that allowed

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:27.920
it to, that allowed him to mentally run a vacuum cleaner, no big deal. We have people with assistive

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:32.400
devices now and wheelchairs and things, right? No problem. And if your other neighbor had a

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:38.480
vacuum cleaner that had some human brain cells that were sort of a controller and enabled to get

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:43.280
around, also no big deal, still pretty much a vacuum cleaner. So in those cases, you have,

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:48.480
you know, a 90-10 split and a 10-90 split and that's easy. But what about the 50-50 split?

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:55.520
And so we really have to, I think this idea where we clearly know what a machine is, we clearly

01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:00.720
know what real preferences are as opposed to just sort of as if, you know, algorithm following by

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:07.200
robots, none of these distinctions are as robust as a lot of people think they are. And the implications

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:12.400
for ethics are at least as large as they are for biomedicine and robotics.

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:19.120
No, I completely agree. And I think that, you know, for example, people have cared a lot about

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:24.240
the possibility of uploading our brains onto computers. Whereas I suspect that just like you

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:31.600
say, blending the boundary between humans and computers is going to be a much nearer term thing

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:36.720
that we're going to have to worry about in this domain. But the stuff you just said brings up,

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:41.600
you know, about 12 podcasts worth of topics to discuss. So we're running out of time here.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:46.160
Let me just pick one that I really want to get to before we go, which is you mentioned the idea

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:51.280
that robots don't get cancer. And that's very interesting to me because the thing when I have

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.800
artificial intelligence discussions, the things that I always want to bring up is that robots

01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:01.840
don't get bored. You know, there's no sort of motivation or irritability or desire to come

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:07.440
back to some homeostasis built in automatically. You can try to build it in, but it's not automatic

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:14.400
in an artificial system. And what you've said has given me the initial idea or the additional idea

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.640
that maybe the point is not just that robots don't get bored, but that robots are not

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.840
or the way that we currently make robots, they're not made of pieces that get bored,

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:28.960
the get bored, right? I mean, this is the extra little insight that real biological organisms

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:34.560
are made of these collections. And the collections, you know, should be thought of in quasi-teleological

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.720
ways as well. Absolutely, absolutely. And there's this notion of info taxes, where

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:46.480
everything from molecular networks up are in a constant search for information to update their

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:51.440
ways of representing themselves and the world in a kind of Fristonian sense.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:57.600
Yeah, I think there is a really interesting question about motivations and the fact that

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:02.320
with any living system, we can tell very quickly how to motivate it. We know what it cares about,

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:06.160
we know what it likes, what it dislikes, because we can train it with positive and

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:12.320
negative reinforcement. Maybe these things will be a little harder in the exobiological arena,

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:17.040
where we can run across new life forms. But I bet even there, in short order, you can figure out

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:21.840
what you could use to train this thing with what it's going to enjoy and what it's going to be

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:30.160
about punishment. There have been papers dealing with this issue of motivation in artificial

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:34.880
agents. You know, you can have an algorithm that causes this thing to do A or B, but does it really

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:41.760
care? You know, does AlphaGo really care that it wins, right? So the problem with this question of

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:47.360
does it really care, like a lot of problems, you start to see the limitations of our categories

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:55.760
when you think about the chimeric case. So I can take cells out of a brain, an animal brain,

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:02.400
and we can connect them in culture to some sort of device that has machine learning or whatever.

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:08.880
And now, if those cells had some sort of magic intrinsic caring that enable human brains to

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:15.200
care about things, does that now carry over to the machine? Because this new sort of compound

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:20.080
organism has some of that. And what is it about? You know, can you take out the human pleasure

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:25.360
center and culture it alone in addition? Is it just activated all day long? And if you've got like

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:31.840
a little chunk of happiness there in addition, these kinds of things are really important.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:39.680
These chimeric constructions are really important to push us to develop better concepts, because

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:45.600
we don't know really what it means to have intrinsic preferences or how they might carry

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:50.240
over to hybrid devices. All of that needs a lot of overhaul.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:55.760
Well, I'm looking forward to our brave new cyborg future that you've outlined for us here.

01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:00.160
It's certainly, certainly things are changing really, really rapidly and we're not able to

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.360
really predict where it's going to go, even though apparently that's what we're supposed

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.960
to be doing, having a goal and trying to get there. So, Mike Levine, thanks so much for

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:17.680
being on the Mindscape podcast. Thank you very much. Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.
