0	3600	Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.
3600	7720	Today's podcast is one of those long-awaited episodes. People have been
7720	11600	asking for this one for a long time. You know, it's funny. Sometimes there are
11600	16640	some possible guests who are just so obviously Mindscape guests, and I haven't
16640	20120	had them on yet, and people are like, well, what's wrong? Why doesn't he have them on
20120	24560	yet? They must be feuding. There must be beef or something like that. That's not
24560	29160	usually the correct answer. It's usually just that I'd like to space them out.
29160	34760	As I've said many times, I like to have a variety, and that includes both people
34760	38360	who I know very well and I'm familiar with their work and the people I've never
38360	43720	heard of before. I got to looking for podcast guests. So Tim Maldon is someone
43720	48160	I've known for a long time. He's a leader in the philosophy of physics or what we
48160	52920	sometimes call the foundations of physics. So studying not physics as a
52920	58440	philosopher, but studying nature as a philosopher, but doing so in such a way
58600	61920	that you're looking at the foundational questions of nature. You're asking the
61920	66720	why questions, the deep questions. You're trying to be very careful. And Tim has
66720	71120	done very important work in thinking about space time and the geometry of
71120	76520	space time, the nature of time and the arrow of time. I will point to, I'll try
76520	81920	to link in the show notes to a wonderful mock debate that was done at the
81920	86800	Foundational Questions Institute between Tim and Julian Barber. Julian Barber
86800	92040	famously has advocated that time does not exist. Tim has famously advocated that
92040	97400	not only does time exist, but the arrow of time is fundamental, not just an
97400	101760	emergent approximation because of statistical mechanics. And what FUXI
101760	107080	does is it has the debaters flip sides. So Julian was arguing in favor of the
107080	111400	existence of time. Tim was arguing against it. And they were both really,
111400	115000	really good. I got to say, they were both quite persuasive. For the points of
115040	119600	view, they didn't actually agree with as well as being quite amusing along the
119600	123480	way. But today, we're actually going to be talking about quantum mechanics. In
123480	128760	some sense, this can be thought of as a sequel to the podcast they did a while
128760	133720	back with David Albert talking about quantum mechanics. David and Tim are
133720	136120	very good friends and have worked together for a long time. They don't agree
136120	140880	on everything because no two philosophers agree on everything. But they are
140880	145080	united in their skepticism about the Everett interpretation of quantum
145080	149320	mechanics. And so with David on the podcast, even though I'm pro Everett, I
149320	154280	want to give the voice to sensible voices on the other side, sensible points
154280	158760	of view. And so David explained why he doesn't like the Everett interpretation.
158760	163880	What we didn't get to right at a time was what he does like. So today with Tim,
163880	169600	we're going to be talking mostly about Bohmian or de Broglie-Bohm versions of
169600	173040	quantum mechanics, sometimes called hidden variable versions of quantum
173040	176240	mechanics. I keep calling them hidden variable theories as most people do,
176240	180400	even though as advocates like to point out, the variables are not hidden. The
180400	184120	extra variables that you add to quantum mechanics to make a hidden variable
184120	189080	theory are the ones that you observe when you actually make a measurement. And
189080	192640	physicists have not really caught on to hidden variable theories. They're not
192640	197920	very popular. But certain sets of people, some physicists, some mathematicians,
197960	202800	some philosophers have kept the flame alive. And interestingly, as we talk
202800	208720	about in the podcast, the Nobel Prize last year was given to tests of John
208720	213680	Bell's famous theorems, his famous inequalities, which were very much
213720	218120	prompted. Bell's exploration of these theorems and his proof of them was
218120	223240	prompted by David Bohm's hidden variable theory, which Bell thought was the
223280	226240	best formulated known version of quantum mechanics. Bell thought we should be
226240	231000	teaching it in textbooks. So it's a little weird that the people who really
231000	235320	take these theories seriously get good results that later lead to Nobel
235320	240360	Prizes, yet the theories themselves are not very popular within physics. Again,
240360	245360	I could give my reasons for not being a fan of hidden variable theories, but
245360	250120	they are, as Tim says about Everett, they are absolutely a serious attempt.
250160	252840	You know, it's something that you should think about if you care about these
252840	256000	things. And so we'll give the sales pitch for why you should take these
256000	259200	seriously. We'll talk a little bit about foundations of physics more generally
259200	262720	and even a little bit about the arrow of time. And the other thing that I want
262720	266400	to mention, because Tim reminded me of it at the very end of the podcast is
266640	271240	Tim is a the director and I think his title is director. But anyway, he's
271240	276000	the founder of something called the John Bell Institute for the foundations of
276000	281160	physics. Tim has been very active, not only in doing foundations of physics, but
281160	286760	in advocating for the status of this subdiscipline within philosophy and
286800	292400	physics. And the Bell Institute, which is located in Croatia and serves as a
292400	297720	place to meet and talk about foundations of physics is trying to raise funds to
297720	301960	get a permanent home. So they literally have a GoFundMe and you can visit the
301960	307240	John Bell Institute home page at johnbellinstitute.org that will link you
307240	312080	to a donate button. You can donate to the permanent home for the John Bell
312080	316280	Institute, where we're not there yet. We need a bunch more donations, but I
316280	319960	think they just started. So it's early days. Maybe mind scape listeners will
319960	322480	kick in a little bit. And with that, let's go.
338080	342400	Tim Maldon, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. Thank you. Good to be here.
342520	345400	So you've been a champion for a little while of something called the
345400	350160	foundations of physics. So I want to ask you two questions. One is, what is that
350160	355560	for the listeners out there? But also, what's your sales pitch like? Hypothetically,
355560	359000	if you're talking to your colleagues in a physics department or philosophy
359000	363560	department, how do you explain to them why foundations of physics is so important?
363880	368880	Okay. Oddly enough, I don't have to sell it to the to the philosophers. It's a
368880	373480	weird situation. You have to sell it to the physicists. But it's very simple.
373480	377240	Really, foundations of physics, as the name suggests, is a branch of physics,
377280	383080	namely the one that asks, what are the most fundamental items? How do we
383080	387280	understand the most fundamental physical structures and things that there are?
387680	392480	And that's only part of physics, because you could do condensed matter
392480	397200	physics, where you say, I'm just worried about other states or the physics of
397200	402840	stars, and you take for granted a lot of the micro stuff, or at least how to
402840	406560	handle it. And then you're building up from there. But if you just dig and dig
406560	410440	and dig and say, at the very bottom, what's the stuff that doesn't get
410440	415120	explained in terms of other stuff? That's the foundations. And so if you do that
415160	420600	in physics, that's the foundations of physics. In philosophy, it's easy. I
420680	425280	actually just gave a talk about this to the undergraduates at Rutgers, because
425280	431400	that is part of what philosophers call metaphysics or ontology, which is again
431400	438720	just the question of what exists asked at the most generic level. And if you're
438720	442080	a physicalist, you think everything that exists is somehow physical. If you're
442080	444240	not, you might think there are other things that aren't physical, but
444240	446880	everybody pretty much agrees. There's some physical stuff.
447200	450960	Not everybody's happy, but not everybody. Of course, every time you say
450960	455840	something, you can think of a counter example, unfortunately. Now, the curious
455840	459400	thing, if I describe it that way, is you say, but why should you have to sell
459400	465120	this to the physicists? Why isn't this just part of the physics curriculum? And
465120	470520	that has a very strange and disturbing sociological answer that really goes
470520	476920	back to quantum mechanics, because they didn't really understand when the
476920	480680	quantum mechanical formalism was first developed in a way that was very
480680	484440	predictively successful. They really didn't understand what they were talking
484440	488680	about. They, the physicists? They, the physicists, the physicists who came up
488680	493440	with the math. And you can come up with math and understand how to manipulate it
493440	498800	to get predictions, but still not look at that math and be quite sure what the
498840	504120	physics underlying it is. And those were very good questions, and they were asked
504120	510160	very rigorously and vociferously early on by people like Einstein, people like
510160	514560	Schrodinger, people who were very deeply involved, even in the development of the
514560	522440	theory. But at a certain point, another crew, led by Bohr, and to some extent
522440	528440	Heisenberg, kind of said, well, don't ask those questions, either because for
528480	532080	some deep philosophical reason, they're not good questions, although they sound
532080	536720	pretty good, or eventually, this morphed into what people call shut up and
536720	540840	calculate, where you don't even explain. You just say, don't ask those questions.
541320	545120	I mean, my impression would have been that Bohr and Heisenberg were more like,
545120	548320	we filled you the answer to those questions. And then when the Americans got
548320	550160	hold of it, it was like, just don't even ask those questions.
550160	555560	That's my take on it, was that it was, I mean, Bohr, Bohr's background was in
555600	560600	Neoconti and philosophy. He actually said very, very, very mysterious things.
561840	566440	And I would say early on, the idea of the Copenhagen School was, say, some
566440	569760	incomprehensible stuff and then calculate. And then when it came to America,
569760	571200	they cut out the first step.
573560	579560	Good. And so, but he said sociological reasons. I mean, I can imagine why,
579680	583520	well, don't let me imagine. What is in your opinion, the sociological reason
583520	588840	why physicists would stop asking what is going on at the fundamental nature of reality?
589440	594160	So, and I'm speculating here, when they first started, everybody's
594160	599000	familiar with this picture of the atom as a kind of planetary system with a
599000	603880	nucleus and then these electrons whizzing about it. We still kind of picture it that way.
605040	609880	And that was sort of what was called the old quantum theory said that.
609880	614720	And it said, by the way, these electron orbits are restricted. They can't just
614720	619360	orbit anywhere where a planet can. They're restricted to these particular little
619360	624000	orbits. And then all they can do is jump between them. And when they jump between
624000	628280	them, they'll either give off or or absorb some light. And there was a bunch of
628280	632480	explanation that you could get out of that basic picture. But if you pursue that
632480	635640	picture, the natural question is what, but how do they jump? I mean, what, you
635640	639000	know, how does it get from here to there? And how does it orbit when it's in one of
639000	643560	these orbits and questions like that? And they kind of work beavered away at that
643560	649120	and couldn't make much progress on it. And I think they eventually got to the point
649120	654040	where they, they didn't want to say, yes, those are good questions, which we can't
654040	660400	answer. And they were satisfied that they were calculating correctly. And in order
660400	664800	not to say, there's really deep questions, we don't know the answer to, they
664800	668760	said, no, no, no, we've got it. We just have the mathematical formalism. The only
668800	673240	reason you're puzzled is that you're trying to push some classical picture on
673240	677480	the microscopic realm and it doesn't belong there. And your confusion is
677480	683760	arising from you having unjustified desires for comprehension.
685840	690120	I have, I don't know if I've ever mentioned this to you, I have talked to
690160	696880	fellow physicists and I've opined that despite everything I personally care
696880	700840	about more than just correctly predicting the outcomes of experiments. I
700840	704720	actually care about talking about reality. And many of them are very open and
704720	708880	explicit that all they want to do is predict the outcomes of experiments.
709360	714240	Yeah. And I think it would if somebody had a lot of funding and a lot of time, it
714240	718400	would be interesting to figure out at what point these people started saying
718400	724600	that because my experience is that young people going into physics care a lot
724640	729480	about trying to understand and they get very upset. And I know this because I
729480	733000	teach foundations of physics in the philosophy department and I get physics
733000	736840	students who say, this is why I went into the field. You're talking about the
736840	743440	stuff I was interested in. And I think in most cases, I can't imagine an 18
743440	749280	year old saying, I just want to calculate. So I think that basic curiosity
750120	754880	about the world gets beaten out of them. Yeah. And I really think it's part of a
754880	759560	physics education, unfortunately, to beat it out of you. So we talked about
759600	763600	Einstein and Boris that are but it's still more or less true, he said. I that
763640	769080	that's my impression. I certainly can testify that lots of physics students
769840	774080	will come to me and say, I get very frustrated. I raise questions to my
774080	780640	physics professors of the form. What's really going on here? And I'm not told
780640	784600	these are good questions, right? I really am told, don't ask them. Don't don't
784600	789160	spend your time thinking about this. And slight generalization, but the
789160	793000	philosophers to their credit have kept the flame alive. They've been thinking
793000	795640	about these things. Yeah, yeah. It's sort of, you know, it's the same way that
795640	800240	Aristotle kind of had to be squirreled away in the Islamic world for a while and
800240	807600	then eventually found his way back. Yes, I do think that that really philosophy
807600	813080	has been a refuge. And in some cases, as you know, like David Albert got his
813080	816320	degree in theoretical physics at Rockefeller, his background was not in
816320	820200	philosophy, but he's in a philosophy department because these questions were
820200	824880	welcomed in philosophy departments and not welcomed in physics departments. Now,
825520	830720	my feeling, I've got a people around us and I have some concrete reason to
830720	835240	believe things are getting better. I actually got an email kind of out of the
835240	838880	blue from a chair of the physics department who said, we're thinking of
839120	843280	trying to introduce foundations of physics into our program. Can you give me
843280	848240	advice about, you know, what we might teach and how it might be done? This was
848240	851160	great. And this was somebody I'd never met. Just, you know,
851200	854600	I was literally just yesterday talking to an undergraduate thinking about
854640	859640	grad school, and she wasn't sure she likes the foundations of physics, but
859640	862640	she's a physics undergrad, so she thought it'd be better to go to a physics
862640	867000	department for grad school. I was asking for advice on where to go, and it was
867000	871600	hard for me to even come up with departments who would let you do that,
871600	875160	right? Right. But maybe it's changed. Yeah. And, you know, and at a certain time,
875160	879560	I guess, that you could say, well, you could go here because, yes, it's a normal
879560	883400	physics department, but at least one or two people on the weekends and a little
883400	887640	bit hiding from their colleagues are interested in these subjects, and we'll
887640	891320	talk to you about them if you catch them, you know, off their clock.
892200	896000	All right. So there's our sociology, but you already opened up the doors to what
896000	899520	we want to talk about, which is these mysteries of quantum mechanics. And
899960	904520	David Albert was on the show. David Wallace was on the show. We were mostly
904520	908200	talking about entropy in the era of time. Adam Becker gave us his wonderful
908200	913360	historical introduction. But when we were talking to David Albert, mostly we
913360	917840	criticized the Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics. I say read, we being
917840	922160	the boy, I was defending it, but I always let the guest talk. So David gave his
922200	929040	spiel. So what we didn't get time to get into is, OK, then what instead? So if
929320	932800	put it, let's not talk about Everett today, unless it unless it comes up, I
932800	939720	want to be like substantive and proactive and constructive. What do we do if
939720	942000	we're thinking about what are the what are the mysteries we're trying to solve
942000	945800	about quantum mechanics that got us into this trouble? And what are the avenues
945800	951600	open to solving? Good. So that's a really good question. And there are there
951600	957160	are several different dimensions to it. But let me start with a dimension. And I
957200	963640	am going to briefly bring in Everett, but then let it go. Everybody knows there's
963640	967800	this experiment. They say a thought experiment, although you could do it, it
967800	972960	would be cool to do it. That Schrodinger talked about with this cat that
972960	978840	penned up in a cage with a with a bit of radioactive material in a Geiger counter
978840	985200	and this diabolical device. Actually, that turns out that Schrodinger was
985240	990560	really just reconfiguring the same thought experiment that Einstein had
990560	995440	written to him just before, which had to do with a keg of gunpowder that either
995440	999560	would or would not explode in the next half hour. And you could calculate a
999560	1005160	quantum mechanical probability for it to explode and not explode. And what
1005160	1009720	Schrodinger was pointing out and what what Einstein was pointing out is that
1009720	1017160	you hold two views, which are very natural views you would like to hold. You
1017160	1022200	got into what seemed to them to be hopeless difficulties. And the two views
1022200	1026800	were first of all, when we do quantum mechanics, we describe a system with a
1026800	1031560	thing called a wave function mathematically. One of the questions is,
1031560	1037080	okay, that wave function, does it provide us a complete description of the
1037120	1042960	system? Meaning every physical fact about that system one way or another could
1042960	1047880	be extracted if you gave me the wave function. And this was when Einstein
1047880	1051960	Podolsky and Rosen wrote in 1935. And this is the same year as the cat paper. And
1051960	1057400	the cat paper was really a response or a reaction is better to say to the EPR
1057400	1061280	paper. The title of that paper is quantum mechanical description of reality
1061280	1064600	complete. This is what they were looking at. And they were arguing in that
1064640	1071920	paper. No, there's more, there's more to the world than wave functions. If that
1071920	1076880	were true, of course, then as a physicist, again, not as a philosopher, but as a
1076880	1080200	physicist, the question is, okay, what else is there? Tell me about the other
1080200	1085640	stuff. So there's one question is the wave function complete. And then there's
1085640	1089360	a question about how the wave function evolves through time, what its dynamics
1089360	1094480	is. And there's a Schrodinger wrote down this wonderful equation that has his
1094520	1100800	name, that has some nice mathematical properties, particularly linearity. And
1101360	1107400	people certainly wanted to say at least part of the dynamics is this Schrodinger
1107400	1112200	evolution. And you might say, well, why not just go whole hog and say all of it
1112200	1116440	is Schrodinger evolution? That's all it ever does. Okay. I like that idea. That
1116440	1121760	sounds promising. Yeah. So if you put those two together and you say, A, the
1121880	1126520	wave function is complete and B, it always evolves by Schrodinger evolution. Then
1126520	1130440	you get into this problem that Schrodinger was pointing out and that Einstein
1130440	1136280	was pointing out, which is that for the cat or for the gunpowder after an hour,
1136840	1141960	the wave function doesn't tell you either yes, it has exploded or no, it is not
1141960	1146480	exploded. Yes, the cat is dead or no, the cat isn't dead. The wave function goes
1146480	1152040	into this, we call superposition of different states, which normally you
1152040	1155600	dissociate one state with the exploded gunpowder and another with the unexploded,
1155600	1159160	but what the wave function gives you is not one or the other, but a kind of
1159160	1162880	combination of both. And if you say, well, that's a complete description, there
1162880	1168400	isn't no further fact that's left out. Then you say, but then the cat's neither
1168400	1173720	alive nor dead or the gunpowder is somehow, you know, weird, suspended state
1173760	1178640	between exploded and not exploded. And, you know, Schrodinger's view of that was
1178640	1184400	that that was ridiculous. And John Bell, when he writes about this, I mean, the
1184400	1189480	way he sums this up is he says, either the wave function as given by the
1189480	1196880	Schrodinger equation is not everything or it's not correct. And Everett, now I'm
1196880	1200120	just going to say the one thing about Everett is an attempt to say no, it is
1200120	1202960	both everything and correct. Hiking up with a way to make it both everything
1202960	1206200	correct. Right. So I would say that's the route that leads you to the many
1206200	1210280	worlds theory and you understand the motivation. It's to keep both of those
1210280	1216680	nice things, but it has this price to pay in terms of saying, you know, the idea
1216680	1220400	that that one cat you put into the cage and either ended up alive or dead. No,
1220400	1225800	that's not right. They're now, you know, and not just two cats, actually
1225800	1229400	infinitely many cats. People don't point this out that the there might be only
1229400	1233360	one live cat, but they're going to be a whole lot of dead cats because the thing
1233360	1237440	could have decayed at all these different times. Now, if you don't want to go
1237440	1241880	that way and so we won't spend our time talking about the price you have to pay
1241880	1245640	and what you have to do. I suppose let's just get our cards in the table for the
1245640	1250920	audience purposes. You're not a fan. I'm not, but it's a serious attempt. I mean,
1250920	1255240	you have to be very clear here. There are things I'm not a fan of, but I
1255280	1261320	appreciate the honesty of people who are fans. If they see the what they have to
1261320	1265800	confront and they, you know, straightforwardly say, yes, I by making
1265800	1269680	these commitments, I inherit these problems and I'm going to work on those,
1269680	1276360	right? And nobody should just turn their back in my view on a serious proposal. I
1276360	1279720	take it to be a serious proposal. I think there are other proposals out there,
1279720	1283880	which I will not name right now, which I do not think are serious. I don't think
1283880	1288920	that they have any chance. I would not put many worlds in that basket.
1288920	1294440	Gotcha. Okay. But if we take off the table, having the wave function be both
1294440	1300360	complete and always schrodinger, then your options are, all right, if it's not
1300360	1305240	complete, then there's something else in the world beside the wave function. And
1305240	1310200	then immediately you ask, okay, what is it? And what does it do? And why am I
1310200	1313960	talking about wave functions anyway? And things like that. Those are the natural
1313960	1320280	questions you ought to have answers at your fingertips. Or if you say, well, I
1320280	1324360	think something went wrong with the schrodinger evolution, then you can say,
1324360	1328280	well, I think the wave function doesn't always evolve in this way. It does this
1328280	1333800	other thing that people call collapsing, right, or reducing that looks very, very,
1333800	1338840	very unschrodinger like. This was the way that when John von Neumann wrote down
1338840	1344120	his understanding of the mathematical foundations of the theory had two processes
1344120	1349240	for the wave function, the schrodinger process and a collapse process. And that's
1349240	1354200	also kind of okay at a very high level. But as soon as you say that, you also now
1354200	1359480	inherit an obligation to tell me, all right, well, when and how does it deviate
1360280	1365080	from schrodinger evolution? And there are lots of details that can be put in in
1365080	1372920	different ways and different suggestions. Some people think early on that the
1372920	1378120	collapses had to be triggered by something. So things would go nice schrodinger wise
1378120	1383320	until X. What's the X? Oh, until a measurement is made or till an observation is made.
1383320	1387480	And then that, of course, astonished. This is something Einstein was very upset about.
1388840	1392440	Other people are upset about because they say, look, it's what do you mean an
1392440	1398760	observation? I mean, who can do the observing? Can a mouse observe? Can an amoeba observe?
1398760	1403320	Can they trigger a collapse of the wave function? If you go that direction in a certain way,
1403320	1406920	you end up with Wigner who says, oh, we have to talk about consciousness and now you're in the
1406920	1414040	mind body problem and you're in a mess. Other people have said, well, no, there's a kind of
1414040	1418920	trigger or something that affects collapse, but it's not measurement or observation.
1418920	1424920	It's like, say, gravity. I mean, this is something that Roger Penrose has been advocating
1424920	1431000	for a long time, not with as much precision as a theory as some other things, but that somehow
1431000	1437640	gravity, which is the one thing that is not well understood quantum mechanically, may come in here
1437640	1444920	as triggering this non schrodinger evolution. And then there's another idea, which is that,
1444920	1450520	no, it collapses and nothing triggers it. It just happens. It happens randomly from time to time
1450520	1455800	at a certain rate in a certain way. This is called the spontaneous collapse theories.
1456360	1460360	And there's a famous theory by a Gerardi-Rominian Weber, the GRW theory,
1460920	1464600	and they just put numbers to it. I mean, this was the great thing they did. They didn't just
1464600	1469640	wave their hands. They said, okay, yeah, it collapses every now and then. How often? Well,
1469640	1477240	once every 10 to the 15 seconds per particle, and how does it collapse? Well, you multiply
1477240	1485080	by a Gaussian of this width and put some math to it. This is what John Bell was so impressed by.
1485080	1489480	I know when I talked to him about that theory, was that, okay, for many years,
1489480	1495960	people have had this kind of general thought, but they took the step of turning it into clean
1496040	1500760	mathematics. Yeah. And also clean mathematics, but a real theory, physically, right? Yeah. Not
1500760	1505880	just an idea, not just a general suggestion. That's right. And it can be, in fact, experimentally
1505880	1511800	tested. Yes, it does. It makes, because the wave function evolution is different, and because
1511800	1517880	the predictions really depend on what the wave function does, it will make, it's easy to see,
1517880	1522840	in principle, it makes different predictions. It's harder to come up with the experimental
1522840	1527640	situations where you can see those differences, although people have been working at it for
1527640	1532760	some decades and making progress. The progress is mostly ruling out the theory. I mean, so far,
1532760	1536920	we have not seen a signature that the theory is correct, okay? We haven't ruled it out,
1536920	1540760	but you could have ruled it in. If you'd seen certain things, you could have really ruled
1540760	1546360	it in. It has not been ruled in. And ruling it in, these spontaneous collapse theories would count
1546360	1551960	as falsifying these other theories. That's right. If that were to happen, then the other
1551960	1556280	things on the table that we might talk about, including Everett, would, you know,
1556280	1559960	a lot of the motivation for Everett would go away, because one of the motivations is,
1559960	1565320	but gee, this Schrodinger evolution is so nice, right? So that is a motivation. I guess to a
1565320	1572920	physicist, there's a sort of, I don't want to say intuitive, but emotional objection to these
1572920	1577960	spontaneous collapse theories, like it just looks so ad hoc that the wave function just does this.
1577960	1584840	And I guess you could say, yeah, but we're fitting the data. Yeah. And ad hoc, it's not that I don't
1584840	1592120	have some sympathy, but when you realize how difficult these questions are and the weird extremes
1592120	1598280	that people have gone to say, oh, but I don't like this one because it's ad hoc, that is such weak
1598360	1607240	key, right? I mean, get over it. The physical world might look a little more ad hoc than you
1607240	1611960	prefer. You really shouldn't rule things out in a strong way for that reason.
1611960	1616920	I guess maybe following what you said about Einstein and EPR, the one thing that you can
1616920	1621160	say about quantum mechanics is that someone's going to have to give up on something that they
1621160	1633400	really want to be true. Yes, I think that's correct. I'm not sure. I would say, and now I'm
1633400	1639080	going to tip the hand, which you'd understand already, if you already know I'm not that sympathetic
1639080	1644920	to the many worlds because of the problems I see there. And I also have this feeling that I can only
1644920	1649240	say by saying the collapses don't smell right to me, right? I don't want to put too much weight on
1649320	1653800	that. But that's just the way I feel. I mean, when you're in this, you kind of make a judgment
1653800	1658440	about what looks more plausible to you. Then we have the last possibility where, okay, yeah,
1658440	1663080	there are no collapses. I agree. I like the Schrodinger evolution. It looks, it's clean. It's
1663080	1669960	pretty. It's linear. I want to keep that, but I want my cats to just, one cat goes in and one cat
1669960	1676680	comes out. That means I have to have something in addition to the wave function. And now the
1676680	1682760	question is what? And the amazing thing, and I think anybody, whatever you think about the theory
1682760	1688520	is at least just for the non-relativistic theory, there's some complications further on. For the
1688520	1694600	non-relativistic theory, this thought occurred immediately in 1926 already by Louis de Broglie.
1695320	1698680	And you say, what is this magical thing you're going to add to your physics? Answer
1698680	1704760	particles, point particles. Just the sort of thing you were already familiar with, the sort of thing
1705720	1710760	even democratists, well, his were a little thick, right? They had their shapes. These can be point
1710760	1715800	particles. So they're even slimmed down and more minimalistic than democratian particles.
1715800	1720920	But the idea, okay, there are some particles and they move around and they constitute cats and tables
1720920	1725000	and chairs. And if you want to know whether your cats alive or dead, tell me where it's,
1725000	1730120	what its particles are doing, and I'll give you a good idea, right? You might say that's such a
1730120	1736840	simple idea. It couldn't possibly be the case that you just add some particles and write down a
1736840	1743080	pretty simple looking equation for how they move and everything comes out right. But amazingly,
1743080	1749560	in the non-relativistic theory, it does. I don't really see that as giving up on anything. I mean,
1749560	1754600	because what you have to give up on is the completeness of the wave function, but it's not
1754600	1760280	clear what the motivation for believing that ever was, except Bohr and so on saying, look,
1760280	1766360	we know what to do with the wave function. If it's complete, then we're done. And we want to be done.
1766360	1771720	So don't tell us there's something else, right? So in other words, the basic idea is when we
1771720	1778120	invented quantum mechanics, we started saying, oh, electrons are like waves, right? They have
1778120	1783400	interference patterns under the right circumstances. They spread out in the atom. They are also like
1783400	1788600	particles in certain ways. We measure little dots on screens. And the brilliant breakthrough
1788600	1795160	from De Broglie is that's because they're both at the same time. Yeah. Or to put it as Bell,
1795160	1800520	again, I'm always quoting John Bell, he says, people were breaking their heads all the time,
1800520	1805000	wave or particle, wave or particle, you'd hear wave a coal, right? It's a new concept you don't
1805000	1810200	have. And he said, why didn't it occur to them the simple answer, wave and particle? There is a
1810200	1817080	wave that is a thing that obeys a wave equation, which is why you get interference. That's the
1817080	1821960	wave function or the quantum state, the thing described by the wave function. And in addition,
1821960	1827000	there is a particle which always has a location. So if you ask, but why do these little individual
1827000	1833480	spots form on my screen? It's because that's where the particle hit. No reason why you can't
1833480	1837960	explain the wave like behavior because there is a wave and the particle like behavior because
1838040	1844120	there is a particle and that and their dynamics is coupled in a way that the particles are guided
1844680	1849400	by a wave like thing. And so the interference in the wave will affect where the particles go.
1849400	1856040	So this table in front of us is in some legitimate sense made of particles. Yep. And the positions
1856040	1861240	of those particles are among other things being guided by the wave functions. Yes. Are they
1862120	1866280	separately interacting with each other, the particles? Well, of course, the word interaction
1866280	1872760	here is one of those words that different physical theories will give you different
1872760	1879880	accounts of what even counts as an interaction. Certainly, the particles can be in a situation
1879880	1886200	where what happens to one will make a difference to what happens to others, right? So the theory
1886200	1893560	will just tell you, gee, you turn on a magnetic field over here and now this particle gets deflected
1893560	1900520	down. And by the way, that particle, you know, will get deflected up. I mean, the example I
1900520	1905960	just gave you is a little bit misleading. But now, is that an interaction between the particles?
1905960	1910520	Well, it's certainly mediated by the wave function, right? The particles can't do anything to each
1910520	1916440	other. But in a way, already you have that in Newton, you say, well, how does one particle
1916440	1921800	affect another gravitationally? Well, not sort of directly, but you need a gravitational field
1921880	1925080	or something like that. There's a mediator, there's a physical mediator
1925640	1934280	that accounts for these relations between what they do. Is that interaction? It is,
1934280	1941640	but it's not quite like classical Newtonian interaction. One way to talk about this, people
1941640	1947800	get a little bit, maybe this will help or maybe not. But let me say it briefly. If you've studied
1947880	1952920	any physics, if you did any Newtonian physics, you'll remember that the fundamental equation
1952920	1960760	is f equals ma, where a is the acceleration. And the acceleration is the change in the velocity and
1960760	1966200	the velocity is already the change in the position. So it's a second time derivative. And what that
1966200	1971960	means for Newton is that to give you the initial conditions of a system, I both have to tell you
1971960	1977240	where everything is and what its momentum is, right? So I need both position and momentum.
1977240	1982440	And then the fundamental kind of physical interaction through f equals ma is changing the
1982440	1990280	momentum. But in this theory, it's not like that. It's a first order theory. Everything
1990280	1996280	is just done with one time derivative. So the initial condition only has to be the positions.
1997000	2002200	And then what the wave function does is guide the particles. It doesn't push them around
2003160	2009640	by producing Newtonian forces on them. It guides them as it were determines where they go.
2010520	2017480	More in the way, this is a kind of analogy that David Bohm used to use, as if you were piloting
2017480	2024280	by radio control a little boat out on the lake. And you say, yeah, as you turn the dial,
2025800	2029640	as it were sending information or telling the boat where to go, but you're not pushing the boat
2029640	2035880	around, right? And in fact, if the boat goes twice as far away, so your radio signal is half
2035880	2039880	as strong, still, as long as it's getting the signal, it's going to guide it the same way,
2039880	2044200	right? Whereas a Newtonian force, you'd sort of think, well, the further away you get,
2044200	2050840	the weaker the force has to become. So it's a different fundamental picture of physical interaction.
2051400	2058520	And I think many physicists object to it or have this intuitive emotional response to it because
2059080	2063880	the wave function is guiding the particles, but the particles don't influence the wave function
2063880	2068520	at all, right? Maybe part of that negative feeling is that they're still thinking of
2068520	2073000	the wave function as a Newtonian force field. They might be thinking that this is an objection
2073000	2079880	people have raised quite explicitly that this theory violates they call the generalized Newton's
2079880	2085560	third law of action and reaction, right? So they say, oh, well, in general, I think if A
2085560	2091240	has an influence on B, B should have a back influence or a reciprocal influence back on A.
2091240	2098040	And that, I have to say, strikes me as just silly. I mean, in a certain way, if you say to Newton,
2098040	2102600	look, doesn't the law of gravity somehow affect what particles do? He'd say, yeah, yeah, yeah,
2102600	2106360	and say, but what are the particles? Do they affect the law of gravity? He'd say, no, of course not,
2106360	2111800	right? The law of gravity doesn't change because of what the particles do, what the way the particles
2111800	2119160	behave is accounted for, as it were, by the law. So we don't usually think that if A affects B,
2119160	2125320	B has to have a reciprocal back effect on A. Lots of cases where even in physics,
2125320	2129480	we wouldn't say that at all. So this seems to me to be a bit special pleading of trying to
2129480	2133000	find something to complain about. I mean, certainly, it sounds like a very made up
2133000	2138360	metaphysical principle that they just made up. Okay, you mentioned David Bohm. Tell us his role
2138360	2143080	in this story. So it's an interesting, I mean, the history of this is very interesting because,
2143080	2149320	again, people were very concerned. There was the early quantum theory by Bohr, which had this very
2149320	2155480	classical looking idea of this planetary atom, and then these jumping kind of jumps, which were
2155480	2160760	unusual, and they didn't quite understand. And then the new quantum theory was developed in the
2160760	2167560	20s, mid 20s, and the mathematics of it came out first matrix mechanics by Heisenberg,
2167560	2171400	and then wave mechanics by Schrodinger. I'm just throwing some names out, but people have heard
2171400	2176360	these names. But they had the math in a way, they kind of knew how to manipulate the math to make
2176360	2183560	some predictions. But it wasn't at all clear what the physical picture was, right? What's the physical
2183560	2189640	theory here? And de Broglie early on looks at this and says, well, I can just, I can just put these
2189640	2194440	particles in these point particles and have them guided around by this quite simple equation,
2195000	2199240	you need a second equation because we needed an equation to tell us what the wave function does,
2199240	2203640	and we're just going to keep Schrodinger's equation for that. So we got that. No real dispute about
2203640	2207960	that. Then we need a second one, which tells me what the particles do, and that's going to be a
2207960	2215560	thing called the guidance equation. And just from mathematical simplicity and other very basic
2215560	2223000	physical considerations, I think I've seen claim 10 different ways that would lead you in the
2223080	2229560	non-relativistic theory to a very simple obvious equation, guidance equation for this. So lots
2229560	2236600	of ways to motivate it, you know, intuitively. And so de Broglie discovers this and he presents it,
2236600	2243880	he was very young at the time, and some rather bad objections were made to the theory, but de Broglie
2243880	2249080	on his feet couldn't answer them. And the story seems to be that he was just a bit traumatized
2249080	2252520	by the whole thing, because these were the big shots of physics. I mean, he's a young guy,
2252520	2257000	he's at the Solvay conference with the biggest names, Einstein is there, Boris there, and so on.
2257000	2260760	And, you know, they're Pauli, whoever they're beating up on him, and he just kind of
2261400	2267960	seems to have abandoned the theory a bit. As far as I can tell, and I've heard people tell me this
2267960	2273960	more recently who looked into it, it kind of lays fallow. Now, Einstein, who we know didn't like
2274760	2280520	the Copenhagen understanding of quantum theory, we know played around with this theory or very
2280520	2286200	similar theories in the intervening years. He didn't like it, but he didn't like it because it had
2286200	2292040	what he called in a very manifest, easy to see way, spooky action at a distance, this non-locality.
2292040	2297080	So we know why he didn't like the theory. And he could never come up with a satisfactory version
2297080	2302920	to him. But it's very possible that he came up with the version that other people think is
2302920	2307880	satisfactory. Exactly. He could have very well had it. And it sort of stayed that way. And then
2307880	2313240	the really interesting situation, if we get into this, is David Bohm is now a young physicist,
2314520	2320440	very well regarded at Princeton. He writes a book explaining quantum theory from the kind of
2320440	2327480	Copenhagen-Borian point of view. And he's in Princeton, Einstein's over at the Institute
2327480	2333880	for Advanced Study. And he's kind of saying, gosh, I would like to get my nerve to go ask
2333880	2338440	Einstein what he thinks of my book. And he's actually trying to get other people to approach
2338440	2343000	Einstein. And as this is going on, he gets a message from Einstein. And Einstein says,
2343000	2348920	I read your book. Would you like to come talk about it? And the story is he goes to talk to
2348920	2357080	Einstein. So it's like 1950, 51. Yeah, 51, I think. Einstein has read the book. And Einstein says,
2357080	2362920	I think this is the best, the clearest exposition of the Copenhagen approach that I've ever seen.
2362920	2369960	I mean, he was really trying hard. But Einstein raised some objections. And the story is, and I
2369960	2375080	think it was a young man who tells this story, it was Bohm's roommate at the time that Bohm goes,
2375080	2379400	meets Einstein, comes back, and he reports when he comes back, I'm back to square one.
2380280	2384600	He was convinced by Einstein's objections. He just, he couldn't answer Einstein's objections.
2384600	2389800	He realized that he really didn't understand what he himself had written. And within a year,
2389880	2393800	he discovers this other thing, which was the same thing that Boyd had done. And apparently
2393800	2397720	independently, as far as I can tell, I mean, I was told recently, I haven't done the research
2397720	2402520	myself. But again, it's not hard to find that theory if you're looking in a certain direction.
2403320	2408280	And then he publishes these papers, this two part paper in 1952,
2410040	2413960	a theory that introduces so-called hidden variables into quantum mechanics and gives
2413960	2419640	you all the right predictions. And this was something that people had believed had been proven
2419640	2426440	mathematically impossible by John von Neumann when von Neumann wrote his book. So this is,
2426440	2431000	of course, a shock. It's like, you're not supposed to be able to do that. And then
2431000	2435960	you look at the paper and you say, wait, it does look like you can do that. And we now understand
2436680	2440840	that von Neumann had made not a mathematical mistake, but a kind of conceptual mistake,
2440840	2446040	which was caught at the time by Greta Hermann. Greta Hermann, yeah.
2446040	2449480	And people pointed it out, but who's listening to Greta Hermann?
2450120	2452600	When Bohr and Heisenberg are saying the opposite.
2452600	2461320	So in 1952, the theory sort of gets reborn under Bohm's name and Bohm worked on expanding it to
2461320	2465000	cover spin and some other, I mean, it's a kind of very basic theory at the beginning. And then
2465000	2468680	you start adding bells and whistles to cover more and more phenomena.
2469480	2474120	And it might still have disappeared, but John Bell became a fan of it, right?
2474120	2481080	Well, Bell, it's not that Bell started out as a fan of it. Bell was a fan of this.
2481080	2486840	He was a fan of saying, I understand what this theory is claiming, right? There's no mystery
2486840	2491400	about it. There are these particles. There's this wave function. Here's what the wave function
2491400	2496040	does. Here's what the particles do, okay? This is a picture of the world, like it or lump it.
2496680	2501240	When I first learned about this theory, and I was very skeptical about it from Shelly Goldstein,
2501240	2505480	Shelly helped me a lot at one point in our discussions because I was being very obstreperous.
2505480	2509960	And he said, look, surely you'll admit this is a theory of something.
2512120	2516360	Okay. It says there are these particles. There's this other thing. Here's what they do.
2516360	2522360	Now, just in your mind, imagine a world as this theory describes. Wouldn't it be interesting if
2522360	2527800	that world looked very much like the world we live in? Which turns out to be true.
2528360	2533160	This is always good advice when people have trouble thinking about new theories because
2533160	2537400	they always want to fit it into their own boxes, right? And if you just ask what it would be like
2537400	2545400	if it were true, you'd make progress. And it addressed the problem that Einstein had raised
2545400	2552200	about locality by saying, yeah. Yes. So this is what I was going to say. And Bell tells a wonderful
2552200	2556840	story, right? Bell says when he first learned quantum mechanics, he was very puzzled by it.
2556840	2564760	He didn't understand what was going on. And he thought you need to add something to it. You
2564760	2569800	need these additional variables, the way functions, not the whole story. And he said he was told by
2569800	2575720	his physics professors, no, no, no. Von Neumann has proven it can't be done. Mathematically proven,
2575720	2581080	you can't add any additional variables and keep the same predictions. And Bell says at the time,
2581080	2585400	he didn't know any German and the book had not been translated. And so that's where it sat.
2586360	2591240	He just didn't know why he didn't understand. He couldn't read Von Neumann's proof, but he was
2591240	2598040	told there was a proof. And then Bell says he just gets up in 1952 and reads this paper that's been
2598040	2604520	published and says, wait, Bohm has just done what everybody's telling me Von Neumann proved
2604520	2611720	couldn't be done. Something's gone wrong here. He quickly convinces himself that the mistake
2611720	2618520	in that case was on Von Neumann's side. But he sees that the theory has this manifest nonlocality.
2619080	2625160	And he asks himself surely what Einstein must have been asking himself, can you get rid of it?
2625160	2632840	Can I have a kind of theory like this? But without the nonlocality in it, that still makes the right
2632840	2640440	predictions, the quantum mechanical predictions, that's the very precise thought that Bell had.
2640440	2644040	And when he finally got some time off on sabbatical to sit down.
2644040	2645640	Because he couldn't do it during his regular work.
2647320	2651880	But the amazing thing is, of course, when you see Bell's proof, it's a few lines of algebra.
2651880	2657160	It's not like proving Fermat's last theorem. It's not hard mathematically.
2658280	2663640	When I first read about this stuff, which was in the Scientific American in an article by Bernard
2663640	2671080	d'Espagnia back in 79, I guess, it's not looking back on it. It's not the greatest article in the
2671080	2676360	world. But it was enough was there that just with a little math, you could see, wait, wait,
2676360	2684680	I see the problem. I really, this just stands out at you. So what happens with Bell is Bell,
2684680	2689960	what Bell realizes is, wait a minute. No, you can't get rid of the nonlocality out of this
2689960	2694920	theory. You can't get rid of the nonlocality out of any theory. I mean, throw away quantum
2694920	2701000	mechanics and start from scratch from entirely different principles. Bell's proof is not about
2701000	2706840	quantum mechanics. It's just about certain experiments and the correlations that you see
2706840	2713880	in the outcomes. You can't have a theory that is local in a well-defined sense that won't predict
2713880	2719400	that. Quantum mechanics does predict it. And more importantly than quantum mechanics predicting it,
2720280	2727480	the world does it. That's why the Nobel Prize went to Clouser and Aspe and Zeilander recently
2727480	2732600	for doing the experiments that showed that the violation of Bell's inequality actually occurs.
2732600	2737800	And as you and I both complained about in separate occasions, the Nobel committee blew it in their
2737800	2743720	press release. Yes, they did. They said that what they had done was what proved that von Neumann
2743720	2749000	was right and you can't have hidden variables, which is just the irony there is so delicious.
2750040	2756680	Because Bell then became probably the strongest advocate of this
2757880	2761560	Bohm's theory or De Broglie's theory, which is a theory with additional variables.
2762360	2766920	Why? Because he could say, well, what's the objection? You can't object as Einstein did. I don't
2766920	2771400	like it because it's not local because now I understand, okay, the nonlocality is just in the
2771400	2777240	world. Suck it up. And it's a clear theory and so on. I mean, at one point, Bell says he's going
2777240	2781160	through all these different ways of approaching quantum mechanics and he says, well, the pilot
2781160	2788280	wave approach shows the best craftsmanship. But then he says, but is that he says then wonderfully,
2788280	2793320	I mean, he always made these cutting little remarks, is that is that a virtue in our time?
2794120	2798520	Right? Do people appreciate good craftsmanship anymore? Do they like just things that sound
2799480	2806040	amazing and blow your mind? Because at some level, it's a much more pedestrian kind of theory.
2806040	2809800	You say, yeah, there's some particles, they move around. Yeah, there's this wave function. That's
2809800	2814120	kind of funny thing. But I'll explain how it plays into the architecture here.
2814120	2817880	It was a rough time for the philosophy of quantum mechanics in certain ways.
2818440	2824200	But okay, so I think that there are any physicists out there who are not
2824200	2829400	into the foundations of quantum mechanics and they're listening. They're very confused because
2829400	2833720	one uses the word locality in different senses sometimes. I mean, if you asked a quantum field
2833720	2838600	theorist, is their field theory local? They would say, yes, it's very, very local. So what exactly
2838600	2844600	do you mean by this word? Good. So and there's even a technical mathematical condition that's
2844600	2850920	imposed in quantum field theory that they will call locality has to do with commuting operators.
2851560	2859960	Okay, so what's going on? Well, one thing to say is that there is there's bell prove there has to
2859960	2867720	be some kind of influence or effect. If Alice and Bob if I set up a pair of particles in a special
2867720	2871720	state called an entangled state and anybody who's heard about this at least have heard the word
2871720	2876440	entangled, but send the particles off way in different directions. So they're, you know,
2876440	2880520	hundreds of light years apart, one into Alice's lab and one into Bob's lab.
2882360	2887800	The intuition of causal locality basically says nothing that Alice does
2888520	2896040	can have any actual influence or effect on what Bob sees. Right? That doesn't mean there can't be
2896040	2901000	correlations between what they see. I mean, everybody knows people give this example, you
2901000	2905480	tear a dollar bill in half and send it to sides off in different directions. Of course,
2905480	2910120	Alice seeing one half immediately informs you that Bob will see the other half,
2910120	2916360	but that's not Alice doing anything that affects Bob at all. That's just true. Everybody understood
2916360	2920680	that. Everybody understands there could be correlations like that, but those correlations
2920680	2926200	are already explained by what happened at the source. And so nothing non local is going on in
2926200	2931880	that case. Bell showed no, you can't get the kinds of correlations you see in quantum mechanics by
2931880	2939160	that kind of local story. There has to be a sense in which what Alice does actually makes a difference
2939160	2946200	to what Bob sees or the other way around. That's causal non locality. Now the next question that
2946280	2954920	arises is, oh, could you implement that in some way to allow Alice to send a message to Bob,
2954920	2960600	signal Bob, right? Tell Bob whether they're going to meet for lunch today or not. And the really
2960600	2965720	interesting, I mean, a very interesting thing is that at least under certain pretty clear
2965720	2970760	idealizations, you can kind of look at the way quantum mechanics work and say, well, no,
2970760	2975960	actually, even though you can't get rid of this connection, you also can't use it to signal.
2976040	2981240	And the person who proved that first was also Bell. People like to call it the no bell telephone
2981240	2986040	theorem. So he was perfectly aware of it, right? You can't use the non locality to signal.
2987560	2994120	Sorry, that's a feature in Copenhagen, Everett, Bohm, whatever you want. You can never use it.
2994120	3000440	Well, okay, now I'm going to tread off into treacherous territory.
3001160	3009640	Okay. If you say, and I think it's just a bad thing to say, that the fundamental postulate
3009640	3015480	of, say, relativity has to do with signaling, that you can't signal faster than light. And you
3015480	3020520	say, oh, well, then this is still a local theory. But that just, I think, first of all, signaling
3020520	3024920	isn't even the right kind of concept that should be in the foundations of any theory, just as
3024920	3030120	measurement shouldn't and just as observation shouldn't. And, you know, Bell proved there is
3030120	3037000	this kind of non local causation. And maybe I can't use it to signal, but so what? But then
3037000	3043560	the next thought is, gosh, if there really is this real physical, non local connection somehow,
3044280	3049560	why can't I use it to signal? And you'd sort of offhand think there must be some clever way to
3049560	3056840	do it. Now I'm going to report something. To ask that question, of course, you really need a well
3056840	3062920	defined theory on the table in front of you, right? Because you have to ask, well, what can I do with
3062920	3070280	this physics? Quantum mechanics tends to use these things called Hermitian operators or,
3070280	3075880	or as they call them observables, and they sort of you, the mathematics of that is what they look
3075880	3080120	into to ask certain questions. But if you have an actual theory in front of you, you're not restricted
3080120	3083960	in that way, you know, you can just say, well, can I do something? Can I twiddle this and, you
3083960	3092520	know, see something? It looks like in the Bohmian theory with spin, there are reasons to believe
3092520	3098280	you could signal faster than light. Oh, this could be the most popular podcast ever.
3098280	3105400	You weren't expecting that, were you? I was not. It is, it is, I am, personally, I suspected there
3105400	3114200	should be a way. Sid Hunt Das, who's a young researcher, has been looking at something which
3114200	3121000	amazingly people had not looked carefully at, which is in this pilot wave theory, when you add spin,
3121720	3126600	okay, that's an additional physical degree of freedom, people usually just don't fiddle with it.
3126600	3130920	They kind of deal with spinless particles, you know, at this level to understand things. When
3130920	3138440	you add spin, and when you look at, there's a very specific thing you can look at that standard
3138440	3145240	quantum mechanics doesn't have an obvious way to even treat, right? This is the key to understanding
3145240	3155000	this. That is arrival times. So if I, if I... This is a well-known issue. Yes, it is a well-known
3155000	3159720	issue, although people just kind of put it out of their mind. So if I have an electron as it were
3159800	3165160	confined in a little box, which we kind of know how to do, and at some moment I open the box,
3165160	3170440	and then I've got a screen, and at some time a flash appears on the screen, one thing you can
3170440	3174600	ask is, well, what was the, what was the transit time? How long, what was the time gap between when
3174600	3180440	I opened the box and when the flash occurred? And it turns out, if you ask quantum mechanically,
3180440	3184280	and in quantum mechanics, you of course have to do experiments many, many times, and you get kind of
3184280	3191560	statistical results, you get a distribution of results. It's, nobody agrees how even to make
3191560	3196280	that prediction using standard quantum mechanics, because there is no Hermitian operator that
3196280	3203080	corresponds to arrival times. Okay? In the, in this pilot wave picture, because you have these
3203080	3208120	particles and they just move, it's kind of easy at least to ask the question, according to the
3208120	3213080	theory, how long did it, would it take a particle here to get there? So you can actually do these
3213080	3218360	calculations. And when you do them with spin, you start to see that there's a spin dependence
3219000	3227000	of the arrival times, which you really weren't expecting, but it shows up. And if that's right,
3227000	3230360	it's already a question of whether you'll see that. This is something you could check in the
3230360	3234520	lab. We're trying to find people who'll do it, but you need specialized equipment and you need the
3234520	3240280	motivation to do it. If, if there is that spin dependence of the arrival times, then there's a
3240360	3245560	very quick argument. Oh, you could signal. Now the signaling would be very subtle. I mean,
3245560	3250360	it's not like you could flip a switch and a light would go on there. But it would essentially say,
3250360	3257480	if Alice orients a magnet in her lab in a certain way, Bob will suddenly start seeing
3257480	3262360	a slightly different distribution of arrival times than if it's oriented another way.
3263320	3267720	And that would be any kind of information, right? It doesn't have to be a clean,
3267720	3274840	100% strong signal, any signal, right? Any Shannon information. Sure. And this suggests
3274840	3278680	that, yeah, you actually should be able to do that. Now there are lots of still,
3278680	3282600	there's lots of arguments within the community about whether this is right. How far do you have
3282600	3289400	to carry the analysis into the observing equipment? I mean, lots of stuff. Maybe in a couple years,
3289400	3294280	people will say, no, this argument breaks down for some reasons we don't quite understand yet.
3294280	3299400	So I don't want to say this is nailed down, but it's there and it's a really hot, interesting,
3299400	3305080	interesting topic and one that could be tested in a lab. Some of it you could do today.
3305080	3309160	I'm not completely surprised because both you and I have written papers about energy
3309160	3313560	conservation and its failure in quantum mechanics, which anyone could have done in the 1950s.
3313560	3318920	Yeah. I just didn't ask the question. But is this a fact that you're talking about now,
3318920	3322760	would it be a difference between well-meaning mechanics and other formulations of quantum?
3322760	3327960	Or is it just that you can't ask the question? Yeah, it's a little hard to say because, and again,
3327960	3331800	I'm now just reporting what Siddhant tells me and he's done all the research. He says,
3331800	3336840	if you go into the standard physics literature about arrival times, you'll find 20 different
3336840	3341880	suggestions about how to do it. They tend to agree with each other in the far field. That is,
3341880	3345960	if there's a long time between when you release it and when you detect it, all of these different
3345960	3351800	approaches converge on the same answers. But in the midfield, there are places where they
3351800	3359800	will not converge. What can you say? It's not clear what predictions the quote standard approach
3359800	3365880	even makes. Got it. You could say if the pilot wave approach makes a clean prediction, it's
3365880	3370280	clearly a different theory because, look, it's doing something precise where the arrival doesn't
3370280	3377000	even have anything precise to say. The other obvious question is you've been simultaneously
3377000	3381480	talking about whether you can send a signal faster than the speed of light, but also working
3381480	3384440	in the context of non-relativistic quantum mechanics where there is no speed of light.
3384440	3389560	So do we have to talk about relativistic quantum field theory to have this conversation?
3389560	3394520	Well, we certainly don't have to talk about it to have the conversation we've had up until now
3394520	3400760	because even before relativity, if you said, look, Alice is in a lab 100 billion billion miles away
3400760	3407320	from Bob, can Alice do anything in her lab that would make a difference to what shows up in Bob's
3407320	3415160	lab? The natural thought would be no. Even if there were some effect, even if there were a
3415160	3421480	fast effect, it would drop off with the square of the distance. It would tail off. So you can have
3421480	3426840	the discussion about non-locality even in a non-relativistic. Now, it becomes sharper in a
3426840	3433800	relativistic context because then you mean faster than light where there is a light cone
3433800	3439000	structure. There's kind of an objective thing you mean there that's very sharp. So you can sharpen
3439000	3444600	it up in the relativistic context, but I think you can still reasonably have it. It's not like
3444600	3449160	all of your discussion of the non-relativistic case just falls to the floor when you notice
3449160	3457720	there's relativity. My halfway informed feeling is that Bohmian mechanics looks quite natural
3457720	3463240	in the non-relativistic regime, and it's a little bit more of a challenge to see how we should just
3463240	3470120	do quantum field theory in that picture. Yeah, there is no doubt there are both conceptual
3470120	3476120	and technical challenges when you go from standard quantum mechanics and one of the
3476680	3482280	signals here for people who don't know is that in quantum mechanics, you talk about a system
3482280	3488280	having n particles, and that's it. Unless you add some or take some away, it's going to be n
3488360	3496040	particles forever. But that's not the world. That's not the world. We now know that there is some
3496040	3500200	phenomenon that we call particle creation annihilation, that particle numbers can change,
3500200	3507000	and so you need to account for that. I mean, there are lots of subtleties here. One subtlety is
3507000	3513000	the thing we call particle creation annihilation. Is it really? And what I mean by that is when
3513000	3519000	Dirac, and he's just a standard guy, was talking about this, he didn't have particles really come
3519000	3524840	into existence. He said, well, there are always infinitely many particles filling up negative
3524840	3530680	energy states. And what we call the creation of a new electron and a new anti-electron, a new
3530680	3536440	positron, is really just lifting an electron that was there all along in a negative energy state
3536440	3542840	up into a positive energy state and leaving a hole behind. So it looks like
3542840	3547800	there's a new electron and the hole is the thing we call the positron. Now that's a story that would
3547800	3552600	account for the phenomenon without really creating any new particles. It's just moving them around
3552600	3557160	in energy space as it were. So there's certainly you have to account for the phenomenon, right? You
3557160	3563160	have to account for the phenomenon. Yeah, I can take a really high energy photon and, gee, there
3563160	3571400	just appears now an electron and a positron or some things that satisfy certain conservation was.
3571400	3578120	We need to account for that phenomenon, whether it really deeply requires new particles or do you
3578120	3582840	want to give up the particle. The other thing to say is the pilot wave picture is not tied to
3582840	3590360	particles. It just says there's something that the wave function is guiding. It could be particles,
3590360	3595240	it could be a more field-like thing, right? There's a kind of way of doing Bohmian field theory
3595240	3599800	where you replace the particles with fields but the same kind of architecture.
3600520	3604520	And the other point to make, which at least needs to be made, is that people can say, gosh,
3604520	3609800	but there's no good Bohmian quantum field theory. Standard quantum field theory has been plagued
3610360	3617240	by mathematical problems and runaway singularities, numbers you try to calculate and they all come
3617240	3625000	out infinity. It's not as if it's all conceptual lightness and clarity in the so-called standard
3625000	3631800	picture. So you don't want to hold this picture to a higher standard of mathematical precision and
3631800	3636920	so on, then you're allowing for the theory that you happen to use. Okay, that's perfectly fair,
3636920	3642360	but I'm just trying to get straight for the listeners out there. If I'm a particle physicist
3642360	3647800	and I just calculated the rate of Higgs bosons decaying in the two photons and something like that,
3647800	3654600	is that stuff I can do just as well in the current Bohmian framework or is that work in progress?
3654680	3661400	Okay, so one of the things that people have looked at is suppose I remain, again, there are
3661400	3664520	different moves you could make. You could say, I'm going to give up the particles all together and
3664520	3669880	put something else more field like in or you can say, no, I'm going to stick with the particles,
3669880	3674040	but I am going to allow literally the number to change. I'm going to allow particle creation
3674040	3681000	and annihilation. You can do that. How you would work that out in a kind of pilot wave picture
3681000	3688600	was done, has been done for 30 years ago, I guess. And what you do is you say in the original
3688600	3691960	picture, you have a fixed number of particles and all they do is move around and change their
3691960	3699720	configuration. But now I say, no, no, the real space of possible states is there's a zero particle
3699720	3703560	state and a one particle state and then two particle states and then three. So this whole
3704920	3709480	thing called Fox space, which is familiar to any of the physicists you're talking about.
3709480	3713800	And you say, no, that's that's what I'm now going to say. The thing is always in a particular
3713800	3719320	location with a particular number of particles. Sometimes it just moves around in one of these
3719320	3723080	sectors and the number doesn't change. And sometimes it can jump up or jump down,
3723640	3729320	which corresponds to particle creation and annihilation. I now need a dynamics for that.
3729320	3733880	It turns out that dynamics tends instead of being deterministic to be indeterministic,
3733880	3737240	the easiest way to do it is say that at any given time, there's a certain chance
3737240	3742440	you'll jump up and create a new particle or jump down and lose particles. Okay, you can do that.
3742440	3748440	And what falls out of doing that is the mathematics of standard quantum field theory.
3748440	3755000	Okay. But so just just so I didn't lose it. Among people who are fans of Bohmian mechanics right
3755000	3761880	now, it's there's a camp that thinks maybe the hidden variables are field like and there's another
3761880	3765800	camp that thinks maybe there's just collection of particles that can change their number. So we're
3765800	3770440	not sure that's not a leading and there's a lot of things that are debated within it. So here's
3770440	3776680	another question. People when you start out, you're always treating electrons and gluons as
3776680	3783560	particles, but then they're all fermions, right? They're all half half. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.
3783560	3790360	I meant quarks. Then people ask, well, what about the photon? Is that a particle? Are there photon
3790360	3796120	trajectories? And it turns out you can try and develop a theory in which there are and a theory
3796120	3802200	in which there aren't. Okay. And people work on both sides and there's no agreement in the community.
3802200	3808120	And you ask, well, what would be the advantages of doing it this way? What would be the advantage
3808120	3816600	of doing it this way? So it's a general architecture of how to develop a theory that can be implemented,
3816600	3822680	of course, in many different ways. And so even within the big house, right, there's rooms in
3822680	3828440	the big mansion of people who are working in different directions. With regard to the idea of
3829240	3832760	sort of stepping back from the fields and going particles as your ontology,
3833640	3838040	two things come to mind, one of which is against that idea, one of which is for it. So which one
3838040	3846200	you want me to tell you first, then you can respond. The worry I have is something like
3846200	3852920	the Higgs mechanism, where it seems that the Higgs boson lurking as a field with an expectation
3852920	3857800	value throughout all of space is playing a crucially important role in explaining phenomenologically
3857800	3863160	observable properties. Is that something you could use? I mean, I think I just answered that,
3863160	3868760	which is it sounds like you're the kind of person who would say, I'd rather, yeah, I'll treat my
3868760	3874040	fermions as particles and I'll treat my bosons as fields, essentially, which is, yeah, I won't
3874040	3881240	introduce particles associated with the integer spin objects. That I think would make you happy,
3881240	3886760	right? I don't have to say there's a Higgs particle to work it into the theory. And there is a
3886760	3892200	reason to think that you're going to work bosons and fermions can enter into the theory in different
3892200	3896680	roles. Okay, this is going to undo the good news that I had. So I don't know if you know this,
3896680	3901480	because I only recently learned it, but Richard Feynman, when he was inventing Feynman diagrams,
3902040	3906760	part of his motivation was to get rid of quantum field theory and replace it with another theory
3906760	3911800	particles again. And we now think of Feynman diagrams as a tool for understanding quantum
3911800	3918120	field theory. So he changed his mind. But his motivation, I'm told, was the cosmological
3918120	3923640	constant problem. Really? Yeah. No, I did not know that. Yeah, I mean, I was told that I need to
3923640	3928520	find the reference for it. But the idea is if you have fields, they all have these zero point
3928520	3932280	energies, and they add up to infinity, or you cut it off, and it gives you a big vacuum energy.
3932280	3938040	But if you have particles, you don't have that problem. So if I were a Bohmian particle ontology
3938040	3942760	guy, I'd be claiming a solution to the cosmological constant. That'd be more nice.
3943880	3949400	Look, that's a connection I was unaware of. My understanding, and again, this is not based in
3949400	3955000	anything other than what I somehow picked up on the street, was that one way, anyway,
3955000	3958360	let me put it this way, how Feynman thought about it, I'm not sure, one way to think about
3958360	3965560	Feynman diagrams, which is runs contrary to way people often talk about them, is that they were
3965560	3972040	just a mnemonic device, right? I have a mathematical equation that has an infinite number of terms
3972040	3976680	that I need to sum up. And of course, the issue gets bad when that sum goes to infinity. But
3976680	3983640	anyway, I have this, all these terms I need to add up. And that the diagrams were just easy ways
3983640	3989720	to kind of remember what the different terms looked like, right? To figure out what integral
3989720	3995480	you had to do. Exactly. And now, the way I say people don't do that is they often point at those
3995480	4000760	things as if they are literal pictures of stuff going on. Oh, this is doing this and this is
4000760	4004280	doing this and all the stuff is going on. It's a blooming, buzzing confusion of virtual particles
4004280	4010200	that are running around. That talk, I don't think makes any sense on any view. I'm on your side.
4011080	4015640	So, if it's just a mnemonic technique, then you're really, it's as if I like to say,
4015640	4021640	suppose you wanted to calculate the volume of a sphere. And you just love cubes. And you say,
4021640	4026280	okay, look, I'm going to first of all, figure out the biggest cube I can sit inside a sphere and
4026280	4031880	calculate its volume. And now I've got these other little, you know, six round pieces sticking out.
4031880	4035960	Now I'm going to find the biggest cube I can get out of each of those and then add those and then
4035960	4039480	more cubes and more cubes and more cubes. And you can see, okay, there's going to be an infinite
4039480	4045720	sequence of these volumes that you now need to add up to get the total volume of the sphere.
4045720	4050280	But you'd say, but you shouldn't think that the sphere is this really complicated thing, right?
4050280	4054680	It's actually quite simple. And in fact, here's another way to do this calculation that is,
4054680	4058280	you know, is straightforward and you don't do an infinite sum and G. It's just, you know,
4058280	4063720	fourth or third pi r cube. No, I think that's actually an important point because
4064920	4071640	lots of modern physics is motivated beyond the standard model particle physics searches for our
4071640	4076680	next best theory is motivated by questions of naturalness, right? And fine tuning and so forth.
4076680	4080360	And I think I don't know what the right way to think about those problems is, but I think that
4080360	4084920	not only do people talk as if there really are virtual particles popping out of existence,
4084920	4091560	which there aren't. But they also think that somehow nature starts with a classical theory
4091560	4096520	and then adds quantum corrections on top of it. And nature doesn't do that. And that might change
4096520	4100840	our perspective here. Right. And I think there's a, I think you're exactly right. And I think there's
4100840	4108360	a methodological point here, which is that because we start out learning classical physics and it
4108360	4113880	feels familiar to us and we familiar with the math of it, there's this great temptation of someone
4113880	4118760	says, oh, the way to come up with a good quantum theory is to start with a classical theory and
4118760	4123240	then do this thing we call quantizing it, right? We put the hats on, we turn certain variables
4123240	4127880	into operators. And well, most of the time it's clear how to do that. Sometimes it's not quite
4127880	4132760	clear how to do that. But you think, but this doesn't make any sense, right? The world, yes,
4132760	4141000	the world behaves pretty well the way classical theory predicts at a certain scale. But that's
4141080	4146520	because something emerging out of a very non-classical physics. And there's no reason to think that the
4146520	4152920	right way into that physics is to start with the approximation and then twiddle with it, right?
4152920	4157880	It's got to go the other way around, right? You need the fundamental physics and then hopefully
4157880	4165160	you can understand why the classical approximations work as well as they do. But I think people are
4165160	4171880	tempted because you have this kind of algorithmic thing of, oh, just take a variable and put a hat
4171880	4177160	on it and turn it into an operator. But conceptually, that's just not the right way to think about it.
4177160	4182440	Yeah, that's right. So good. I'm glad we can find all of our points of agreement against the
4182440	4188360	consensus, despite the fact that we have some disagreements. But this question of the speed
4188360	4193880	of light, I'm going to go back to the experiment, the possible signaling, because I do not know about
4193880	4197800	that work. I don't know whether it's right. So that's okay. We're putting it on. Yeah, right there.
4197800	4204520	But the idea of looking hard for possible experiments to do, I think, is a crucially
4204520	4210360	important one. I mean, my impression is that your typical Bohmian on the street thinks there's no
4210360	4216200	experiment to do to test Bohm versus conventional quantum mechanics, whatever that is. Do you have
4216200	4223320	a feeling about that? I do. And this is a discussion I am in right now arising out of this work.
4224520	4230280	That is, a lot of people in the Bohmian camp will kind of say, oh, but we know that it won't make
4230280	4237640	different predictions than, quote, standard quantum mechanics. Now, I think that's just wrong. I think
4237640	4243480	there are kind of toy cases that make it obviously wrong, but leave those aside. I just tried to
4243480	4251240	understand what the argument was. And I can't get it, right? And so I think some of this is
4252120	4257720	defensive, right? Because there's this, and you stop back a second and you see this is so unfair.
4258360	4262440	You have standard quantum mechanics, whatever it is. Anyway, you can make lots of good predictions
4262440	4267560	with it. Then somebody comes up with a new theory, and then they say, oh, does your theory make any
4267560	4271400	new predictions? If not, why should I pay any attention to it? Now, the first thing you notice
4271400	4276120	is, but wait, if these two theories had been discovered in the opposite order, right, you
4276520	4281240	would be going the other way around. So this can't be, from a logical point of view, a good
4281240	4286680	objection. Why should I take your theory seriously? Because it makes all the same predictions as my
4286680	4294760	theory, because that doesn't make any sense. But I think that is an objection that physicists often
4294760	4300120	made. And so there were certain kinds of defensive procedures that were put up to say, oh, no, we're
4300200	4309560	not saying they're new predictions, right? And then you'd have to go on. My view is a sharp theory,
4309560	4316360	again, standard quantum mechanics has certain vaguenesses in it. If you have to talk about
4316360	4322520	measurement, if you have to talk about observation, because those are vague terms, these are the
4322520	4327480	objections that we had. And so you'd expect a sharp theory will certainly ought to differ
4327720	4332760	in some ways. And you should be looking hard at where those differences might be.
4334040	4339640	Is so the unfair question, what fraction of the Bohmians out there agree with you about that?
4341880	4346760	It's not an unfair question, but it's a sociological question, which I just can't answer. I
4346760	4353800	don't know. I don't know. And even as it were, the Bohmian camp is divided into sub-camps and
4353880	4358440	probably the statistics and the different ones are different. And probably my guess is
4358440	4365400	weirdly enough, it probably correlates with age. I think younger people are more open to certain
4365400	4371240	things than people who've been through a lot of battles. But I really don't know.
4371240	4374760	Where are these Bohmians of which you speak? Are they in philosophy departments or physics
4374760	4382120	departments or Europe? Well, a lot of them, yeah. So there were a lot of students
4384840	4389000	in Europe. And I'm sorry, this is going to be just a little hard for me.
4390040	4400120	Det Lefder, who was at the LMU in Munich, had always a dozen graduate students. Unbelievable
4400120	4406040	what he did that nobody else I know has ever done to promote young people and bring them into this.
4406600	4412360	And he was in a physics department. He was in the math department.
4414200	4421400	And he was just the most wonderful, caring Dr. Vater and looked after these students.
4421400	4427880	He could not get many of them jobs in academia. A lot of them have gone into other industry,
4427880	4434280	whatever. They did their work. But there are a lot of young people who came through that program
4434280	4442280	who know the theory and work on it. Siddhant Das, who I mentioned, was one of Det Lef's last students.
4443560	4448840	And some of his students, a couple of them are in Tubigan. So there are more of them
4449480	4455320	in Europe who have come through LMU and through his influence. Then the other thing that's happened
4455320	4463160	is a lot of physicists who realize they're interested in foundations notice that if you have
4464360	4470120	credentials as a philosopher, you can more literally more easily have an academic career
4470120	4474040	in a philosophy department as a philosopher of physics than you can in the physics department.
4474040	4480760	Still true, yes. So some of them have switched over. Also Det Lef's student, Dustin Lazarevich,
4480760	4487560	who's now in the Technion in Israel. There are people who are around. And it's more than there
4487560	4493320	used to be. I mean, the total number is up. What the effect of losing Det Lef because Det Lef died
4494120	4501320	during COVID? I don't know. I mean, nobody right now is doing what he was able to do. And we have
4501320	4510680	to hope that some dedicated person with the right psychology and so on can
4511080	4515880	kind of take his place and help people along. Do you think we started by talking about
4517720	4521080	why you don't need to make a sales pitch to philosophers? They get it. Yeah.
4521960	4529560	How deeply do they get it? How much has quantum mechanics changed what philosophers think about
4530120	4539000	metaphysics? So this is an interesting question. In philosophy, I would say there are three camps
4539080	4544520	of people who do what goes under the name metaphysics. I just gave this talk at Rutgers,
4544520	4549000	the undergraduates, about metaphysics and science. Are metaphysics and science enemies or friends or
4549000	4555160	what? Or the same thing? Yeah, exactly. That was my conclusion at the end. So you jumped right
4555160	4558920	to the end. Sorry. But no, there's an interesting history because really there's a certain point
4558920	4567800	where they're clearly considered to be enemies. I mean, Carnap. I would say that in metaphysicians,
4567800	4572440	people would self-identify as metaphysicians in philosophy now fall into kind of three camps.
4573080	4577880	There's a camp that's sometimes called analytic metaphysics, which tends to be doing things
4577880	4587000	which don't seem to care much about science. They're asking questions that don't... It's not
4587000	4593080	obvious that any scientific theory would bear one way or the other on the question.
4593960	4599400	Oh, are there... I mean, these are not just going to be words. Are there universals or tropes?
4599400	4603560	Okay, so this is the kind of thing that a philosopher of a certain kind will understand
4603560	4608120	and they'll be fighting with each other forever about universals and tropes. And it's very hard if
4608120	4612440	you say, well, did Newton believe in universal tropes? You'd say, well, the Newton didn't care.
4613640	4617960	It's just not an issue that is built into the guts of that theory in any obvious way.
4618120	4625800	Okay. Then there's another camp that goes by the name scientific metaphysics for the reason of
4625800	4631080	saying that what I think is obviously correct, metaphysics is about describing what exists
4631080	4634920	at the most general scales. And if you're interested in what exists in the physical world,
4634920	4640440	you better pay attention to science. Not to say that the scientists can just answer those questions,
4640440	4649080	but they do have relevant things to say to offer. But then that group kind of subdivides into two.
4649720	4655320	The ones who then specialize say to do philosophy of physics. Now that really requires learning
4655320	4663000	some math and some physics and at a reasonably good scale, some people have full PhDs in physics.
4664040	4669960	But you certainly have to devote some time to just studying math and physics to do this in a
4670520	4675320	specialized way. And then there's another group of people who clearly acknowledge the relevance
4675320	4680120	of the physics, but they're not experts. And so they like to listen to the experts and try
4680120	4685400	and figure what they can draw out of it without themselves delving so deeply into it. I would
4685400	4690920	say that's how the landscape goes. But do they talk to each other, these people? Or do they go
4690920	4700200	to the same conferences? Yeah, I mean, they're certainly, they do talk while they're in each
4700200	4706840	other's presence. I mean, there are a lot of specialized conferences, but there are conferences.
4706840	4711480	I mean, I was just invited to be on a panel at the Metaphysics Society of America. And I'll tell
4711480	4717400	you, the people in that society are not people you'll ever run into. And they were doing a very
4717400	4721480	different kind of metaphysics, but they were happy. I talked about what I do and the way I
4721480	4725720	think about it and they didn't throw bricks at me. It wasn't the way they thought about it. They
4725720	4729720	were interested. They were interested. Yeah, they were interested and they appreciated having the
4729720	4737320	conversation. And I mean, philosophers tend to be pretty open to talking about weird stuff,
4737320	4741240	because that's more of us comes with the territory. Whatever strikes them as weird,
4741240	4746920	you still don't just reject it, right? I guess what I'm getting at, and I'm not trying to presume
4746920	4752680	the right answer, because I honestly don't know. But to what extent can we imagine smoothing over
4752680	4757080	the conceptual differences between thinking about physics and thinking about metaphysics?
4757080	4761400	Like, it really should be thinking about reality is what we're doing, right?
4761400	4768600	Yeah. I mean, we do, you know, I do need to mention here that, again, you can be interested in
4768600	4774040	metaphysics and not be a physicalist. So you'd say, part of what I do really is not going to
4774040	4778360	be informed by physics. If I'm a mathematical Platonist and I'm worried about mathematical
4778360	4782360	reality and I say that's just not part of physical reality, so I don't care how your physics comes
4782360	4786520	out. That's a fair, you know, that's a fair thing. So not all of metaphysics has to be
4786520	4792440	hostage or all that. Interested depends on where you're focusing your attention.
4792440	4799400	Okay. We actually, Barry Lower was another person we had on recently and Barry, he said
4799400	4805160	something not on the podcast, sadly, but in informal conversation that was even stronger
4805160	4810120	than something I would say. I think he was being humorous about it, but he said he remembers very
4810120	4816600	vividly being struck the day he realized that most problems of philosophy could be cured or solved
4816600	4824840	by statistical mechanics. And I think that he has a different view about you than that. So we're
4824840	4829320	running out of time a little bit, but I wanted you to have a chance to give a little bit of
4829400	4836040	your view of the arrow of time and things like that, which is the other giant thing that people
4836040	4841320	who care about foundations of physics spend their time worrying about. Right. So let me actually
4841320	4848600	start with the last thing first and just get it out in the open so people at least be aware of it.
4848600	4855800	I would say it is kind of everybody has this idea of their space and it's kind of three-dimensional,
4855800	4863880	at least at large scales. And if I talked about, say, the north-south direction at a certain point,
4864520	4868600	if I went on to say, by the way, space goes north to south, it doesn't go south to north,
4868600	4872200	you'd look at me funny and say, what in the world are you talking about? Right?
4873640	4880120	The spatial thing, there are two directions and they're oppositely directed, but space itself
4880120	4884440	doesn't go more one way than the other. I don't even know what you mean. On the other hand, the
4884440	4889320	person in the street, you say time goes from past to future, doesn't go from future to past,
4889320	4894920	they will again nod at you and say, yeah, tell me something new. Now, I happen to agree with that,
4894920	4899400	that as I think time is fundamentally different from space, temporal structure is fundamentally
4899400	4903240	different from spatial structure in that temporal structure does have a fundamental
4903240	4908840	directionality to it and spatial structure doesn't. This turns out to be a very contentious view
4909800	4914520	among philosophers and physicists for funny reasons, I would say, I don't know that we have
4914520	4918920	the time to go into, but it surely is the minority view. And it's a little bit viewed,
4918920	4923800	just to clarify, it's a little bit different than there are physicists out there and philosophers
4923800	4929080	who will question whether or not time exists or whether it's fundamental, but here we're talking
4929080	4935960	about the direction of time, not time. Yes, that's right, that's right. It would be even harder to
4936040	4942760	deny the existence of time altogether, but certainly the directionality is hotly contested.
4942760	4949160	I think time itself has a direction. Now, it is clearly the case that there are temporal, manifest
4949160	4956520	temporal asymmetries on any view. If you give me two pictures of somebody 10 years apart,
4957240	4961640	usually I can look at them and figure, oh, this was the younger and this is the older,
4962120	4968840	because people tend to wrinkle up. Now, that's not, maybe they had cosmetic surgery. I could get
4968840	4975560	that wrong, but there are certainly lots of very reliable temporal asymmetries,
4976360	4982680	and those need an explanation, simply saying time has a direction would not explain all by itself
4983400	4988680	any of those observable temporal asymmetries or what people sometimes call arrows of time.
4989000	4995720	I think all of that is a perfectly good object of study, even if you believe as I do, that one of
4995720	5002200	the things that you can invoke is that time is itself directed. That doesn't give me these
5002200	5007640	observable asymmetries like that, but it might be part of the explanation. How does it help?
5009240	5014360	Since people like David Albert and Barry and myself think that you don't need an intrinsic
5014360	5017720	arrow if you just have an initial condition that is doing all the work?
5018760	5023560	Because a lot of the explanation, I mean, we can do this in different levels, but let me do the
5023560	5028600	first level. What do I mean by explaining something? Well, often I think it's a kind of causal
5028600	5032600	explanation. I talk about cause and effect, and now you say, okay, but what distinguishes cause
5032600	5038280	and effect? Offhand, in many cases, causes precede the effects. I mean, if people often
5038280	5043400	talk about running a movie backward or imagining that, which of course, you can literally run a
5043400	5049400	movie backward, but then the end sequence comes before the title sequence. You still have a direction
5049400	5055960	of time. If you took that seriously as a movie of something in the normal direction, also all the
5055960	5060360	causal structure would be reversed. What were causes would become effects, and therefore the
5060360	5069720	structure of causal explanation would be different. You have to get a bit deep, and statistical
5069720	5076040	mechanics does come into this here in a way that we couldn't get on the table clearly in a short
5076040	5083160	period of time, where you not only have causal explanations where you say this particular
5083160	5090280	precise physical state gives rise to this later one, but other kinds of statistical explanations
5090280	5097080	where you say this kind of physical state. I haven't precisely, but I'm going to constrain it in
5097080	5101640	certain ways. There's a class of various that gives rise to this kind of state. I mean, this is the
5101640	5107000	sort of thing that you take a box of gas, and you say, if you wait a while, it'll eventually relax to
5107000	5113960	an equilibrium. That of course shows a directionality to it, because from this initial state, you can
5113960	5120200	say in five minutes, it'll be equilibrium. If you look at the equilibrium state at a generic level,
5120200	5125560	kind of fuzzed out level, you couldn't say, oh, five minutes ago, it was in this non-equilibrium
5125560	5131960	state. There's a kind of asymmetry there, and that's connected to certain asymmetries in statistical
5131960	5138920	explanation, probabilistic explanation. It's a very interesting and deep, hard topic. A bit
5138920	5143480	different than worrying about, say, relativity, which you might say is about space-time structure,
5143480	5148760	quantum mechanics is about material structure. Statistical explanation is about a kind of
5148760	5155720	explanatory project, and what goes into it, and what succeeds as giving statistical explanations
5155720	5162360	of things. But I do think that reversing the direction of time, you might have a very good,
5162360	5167400	what you consider to be a very good statistical explanation of something as seen as it were
5167400	5171640	in one direction of time. If you look at the other direction, you say, wait, there's no explanation
5171640	5179400	at all. The explanatory part went away. All I can say is a massive coincidence, or else,
5179400	5186760	to be teleological and say the future is somehow affecting the present. But I take it to be one
5186760	5191560	of the great discoveries of the scientific revolution to get rid of that kind of teleology.
5192600	5198360	Does your view that time has an intrinsic direction affect what we would call microphysics,
5198360	5200840	the standard model of particle physics, for example, or could it?
5201880	5208440	Sure, it could. I mean, I think that it plays into your fundamental picture of space-time
5208440	5214360	structure. And of course, one needs an account of space-time structure to even begin to write down
5214360	5221080	what you think of as laws of physics. And I think there are very specific ways in which
5221880	5226680	having a direction, well, certainly having a direction, let me just give you a very
5226680	5233000	concrete thing one could say. Suppose I have a kind of grid, like a street grid, and I have
5233640	5238200	two points on it, and you ask me, okay, how many continuous paths are there that will
5238200	5242760	take me from A to B? And typically, the answer, if the grid goes on forever, it's infinitely many,
5242760	5248120	because it can kind of go short way or around or far around, go way out and come back. Now,
5248120	5254040	suppose I put some arrows on that grid, right? So they're one-way streets. Now it's not at all
5254040	5260040	clear that this number will always be infinite. Now it might be quite tightly constrained. The
5260040	5267800	directionality gives me a resource there that a lack of directionality doesn't have. And I think
5267800	5272360	that's actually quite important and plays out in trying to understand the laws of physics, but
5272360	5274840	it's much more complicated. It's much more complicated, but that's what you're thinking
5274840	5278600	about these days. That's one of the things I'm thinking about very hard. I mean, I've been working
5278600	5284120	on thinking about what space at time could be like if they were actually not continuous,
5284120	5290360	but discrete at fundamental scale. I worked a long time and did six chapters just on space,
5290360	5294920	and now I have to bring in time. And the time part really has to have a direction. Just for
5294920	5298360	it to work, it has to have a direction. You have to understand how the directionality comes
5298360	5304040	into it. Sorry, what do you say for it to work? For this scheme I have, to be a kind of thing
5304040	5307880	where you could do a plausible looking sort of physics with. Do you have a catchy name for your
5307880	5312920	scheme? Yeah, full discrete geometry. Full discrete geometry. Okay, good. And the time
5313720	5317560	directedness has to be part of the story. Yeah, it's fundamental in it. Yeah. Okay,
5317560	5321400	all right, good. Well, we're looking forward to that. We'll get some point. Yeah, I know.
5322280	5327960	I got really stuck. Yeah, I mean, well, I'm up on chapter eight now. I mean, the spatial part went
5327960	5333240	real well. And then it was like, okay, part two, let's bring in time. And then you realize it's a
5333240	5338200	tricky business. Is it quantum we're talking or classical? This is all this is all classical
5338200	5343320	geometry. But quantum field theory, there is a connection to quantum field theory, which I'll
5343320	5348440	just state briefly, we talked about problems just in doing quantum field theory, just mathematical
5348440	5353880	problems. One way that this kind of Bohmian or pilot wave approach for quantum field theory was
5353880	5358920	done was done by Bell, it's called Bell type quantum field theory. And one thing he does is he puts
5358920	5363800	it on a lattice, that is, he doesn't do it in continuous space, he does it on a kind of discrete
5363800	5368920	lattice. And you have these jumps from lattice points to lattice points. That turns out to be
5368920	5374760	very important to have a structure where you can do the math in a clean way. Okay, looking forward
5374760	5379480	to the book coming out, we will pre advertise it here. So here's the last, I'm not going to call
5379480	5385320	it a question thing to respond to. When we talk about quantum mechanics, and as we say, you have
5385320	5391320	to give up something maybe that was hopeful or intuitive or whatever. And even in relativity,
5391880	5395560	it seems like maybe the world is a little bit different. Is there hope for
5396360	5401320	fundamentally understanding why the world is this way? Like in retrospect, can you say, oh,
5401320	5404200	yes, it had to be quantum mechanics, or are we just stuck with it?
5404200	5409800	Yeah, I think people like to say that why the quantum, you know, you'll get this thing. I think,
5409880	5415960	oh, come on, just, you know, grow up. No, I mean, there's going to be foundations. It's going to be
5417400	5424520	one of the really hard questions in this whole topic is the question, where do I stop digging?
5425320	5430120	Right? Where is my spade turned? Where do I say, okay, I've hit a foundation here.
5431160	5437320	It looks like this is a plausible place to stop. And all you can say is, yeah, this is the way it
5437400	5441320	is. Could it have been some other way? Yeah, it could have been some other way. It isn't.
5441320	5445480	This looks like a plausible place to stop. If you think if you're never going to be satisfied,
5445480	5449560	okay, then you're never going to be satisfied. And the problem is, there are dangers in both
5449560	5455400	directions, right? If you're too easily satisfied, you'll stop digging when in fact you could
5455400	5459480	discover a lot of interesting structure lying underneath where you've stopped. But if you're
5459480	5463640	too pigheaded, you're going to get to the bottom and still be banging your head against it forever,
5463640	5470280	because there is nothing underneath it, right? So there's a kind of connoisseur's feel for where's
5470280	5476840	a reasonable place to stop. But I don't think you're going to be stopped by some master principle
5476840	5483400	that says it could only have been this way. How could you expect that? The world is kind of contingent.
5483960	5487960	Well, that seems like a reasonable place to stop. So Tim Wilden, thanks very much for being on the
5488600	5494680	Can I actually, before you do that, because I'm here and I have many voices, many years
5494680	5500200	that I ever kind of normally will have, and I'm going to just take advantage of you and say,
5501800	5505960	one of the things I'm doing is trying to promote foundations of physics in the way I'm doing it
5505960	5510360	is I've founded this thing called the John Bell Institute for the Foundations of Physics.
5510360	5515720	And we are at the very moment, a kind of critical moment where we're trying to buy a physical place
5515720	5522360	for us to live. And if anybody out there likes people who talk about this stuff and thinks
5522360	5527320	they should have a place to go where they can meet and talk to each other, we have a GoFundMe
5528120	5537080	or you could go to www.JohnBellInstitute.org. If anybody would like to help us out in any way,
5537080	5540840	it's our moment of need and we would appreciate it greatly.
5540840	5545400	Good to be reminded of that. I will also mention that in the intro and put links on
5545400	5550360	the web page. I can mention it because it's an audio podcast. Tim is wearing a very fetching
5550360	5555000	John Bell Institute polo shirt right now. So that could be swag. I don't know. Is that a GoFundMe?
5556120	5562920	This, to get the shirt, you got to come to the place. The only exception to that are my parents
5562920	5567960	who are 95. And I said, you can have shirts without actually going. But this is, you can only wear
5567960	5573320	the shirt if you've been there and you've seen this beautiful island in Croatia and enjoyed it
5573320	5577160	and then you get a shirt. But it is actually an important thing. I'm glad you mentioned it
5577160	5583080	because it's a reminder that ideas are great and conversations about them are great, but
5583080	5589080	institutions also matter for getting these ideas out. And this is the problem. This field is an
5589080	5595800	academic orphan. Foundations of physics doesn't fit. It kind of doesn't fit in physics departments
5595800	5601480	and it doesn't really fit in philosophy departments. And so if it's going to live,
5601480	5605880	a place has to be made for it. All right. Let's look it up on the internet. So in that case,
5605880	5611720	Tim Walson, thanks very much for being on the Mindscape Podcast. Thank you.
