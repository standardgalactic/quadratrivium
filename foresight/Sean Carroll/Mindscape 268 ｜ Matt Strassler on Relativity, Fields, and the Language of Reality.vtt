00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.200
One thing we do a lot here on Mindscape, or for that matter, I do in my life, otherwise,

00:09.200 --> 00:15.840
even off the podcast, is to try to explain difficult concepts in physics to a broad audience,

00:15.840 --> 00:21.520
right? Whether it's quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, relativity, cosmology, what have you,

00:21.520 --> 00:26.720
taking these ideas that have been developed by lots of smart people over many years and bringing

00:26.720 --> 00:31.840
them to a broader audience, which I think is very important and is absolutely doable if you put

00:31.840 --> 00:37.040
the effort into it. But many people try to do this. We're not the only ones who try to do this.

00:37.040 --> 00:43.680
And there are a couple of patterns which are kind of bad that many physicists or scientists more

00:43.680 --> 00:50.320
broadly fall into when they're trying to explain their concepts to a broader audience. One is,

00:50.320 --> 00:54.800
just from the fact that scientists, physicists, but also other kinds of scientists or other

00:54.880 --> 01:00.480
kinds of academics, for that matter, are typically professors. They are college professors. And they've

01:00.480 --> 01:07.760
developed a pretty good set of techniques for teaching students who are going to major in that

01:07.760 --> 01:14.000
area, right? So physics professors, as part of their job, will teach young undergraduates,

01:14.000 --> 01:19.840
and then up to graduate students, how to be a physicist. So they know what steps they have

01:19.840 --> 01:23.680
to go through. They've taken the courses themselves. They've taught the course or they've read the

01:23.680 --> 01:29.120
textbook or whatever. There's a set of ideas you have to march through. And one failure mode,

01:29.120 --> 01:35.680
I would say, for reaching out to the public is people try to take that way of teaching physics,

01:35.680 --> 01:40.800
the way that we teach our undergraduates, and just water it down, right? Teach exactly the same

01:40.800 --> 01:46.400
stuff, the exactly the same concepts in the same order, but try to remove some of the equations

01:46.400 --> 01:52.000
or something like that. And that's not always the right way to reach a different kind of audience.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.120
I've come across this, of course, in my recent attempts to write the biggest ideas in the universe

01:57.120 --> 02:03.200
where I'm trying to reach a broad audience with equations, but without any prior exposure to

02:03.200 --> 02:08.880
those equations or those ideas. It's even harder if you're trying to explain without any equations

02:08.880 --> 02:13.680
at all. It's really weird when you just take the usual steps that you would go through in an

02:13.680 --> 02:19.360
undergraduate physics education and demathify them and expect people to understand. Another

02:19.360 --> 02:26.800
failure mode is that sometimes we do search for analogies, stories, metaphors, allegories,

02:26.800 --> 02:34.240
pictures, ways of getting across the basic idea without going into the equations. And it's a

02:34.240 --> 02:40.560
little bit easy to forget that people take these analogies seriously, maybe more seriously than

02:40.560 --> 02:48.480
they should, right? When a physicist presents an analogy for a deep physical concept, they know

02:48.480 --> 02:54.160
which aspects of the analogy actually apply and which do not apply to this situation,

02:54.160 --> 02:59.120
and the poor person listening doesn't know that. So they just take the analogy at face value.

02:59.120 --> 03:05.520
So because of these failure modes, there's an enormous value to be placed on actually stepping

03:05.520 --> 03:11.280
back, thinking deeply about the ideas we want to convey, forgetting about how we teach our

03:11.280 --> 03:17.120
undergraduates, to really think about how we should just talk to people who are not going to become

03:17.760 --> 03:23.920
physicists down the line, but want to understand the ideas. And today's guest, Matt Strassler,

03:24.720 --> 03:29.840
is really, really good at exactly that. Matt is an accomplished physicist, someone I've known for a

03:29.840 --> 03:35.360
long time, but he's put an enormous amount of work. I can vouch for this. I've been talking to

03:35.360 --> 03:41.120
Matt for years about this book that is about to come out called Waves in an Impossible Sea,

03:41.120 --> 03:47.040
How Everyday Life Emerges from the Cosmic Ocean. And the cheap way of saying what the book is about

03:47.520 --> 03:52.880
is it's about quantum field theory and modern physics. But the real charm of the book is that

03:52.880 --> 04:00.480
he really takes seriously the challenge of talking about these ideas in a way that is

04:01.120 --> 04:10.640
as honest and true to the material as possible without just watering down the usual years-long

04:10.640 --> 04:16.240
physics curriculum or relying on analogies that give you some good ideas and some bad ideas at

04:16.240 --> 04:21.200
the same time. So it's a novel take on trying to understand these ideas. And we're going to go from

04:22.000 --> 04:28.400
basic ideas like relativity and quantum field theory to maybe some fun research level things,

04:28.400 --> 04:33.760
because Matt's a very good explainer of these things. So it's physics. It's the kind of stuff

04:33.760 --> 04:39.040
we talk about all the time, but maybe with a slightly fresh take on it. So let's go.

04:46.240 --> 04:58.320
Matt Straster, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.120
Thank you, Sean. It's a pleasure to be here.

05:01.120 --> 05:07.200
So you know, like I do, that a bit over a decade ago we discovered The Higgs Boson,

05:07.200 --> 05:12.800
and I wrote a whole book about The Higgs Boson. I remember this famous story, and apparently there

05:12.800 --> 05:20.640
was a competition, you know, it was inspired by some British government official who didn't

05:20.640 --> 05:24.240
understand The Higgs Boson. And so the physicist said, you know, who'd come up with the best

05:24.240 --> 05:29.600
metaphor for what it is? And they came up with this metaphor of people of different levels of fame

05:29.600 --> 05:36.640
walking through a party. I would start by asking you, like, what was that metaphor? Is it any good,

05:36.640 --> 05:43.760
or does it do more harm than good? Well, the image that was brought to mind

05:44.400 --> 05:51.280
by the winner of this competition has some, you know, it has some general merit to it,

05:51.280 --> 05:58.720
and that it gives a sense of perhaps what things might be like in that a person who is totally

05:58.720 --> 06:03.120
unknown can just make their way through the party. Nobody pays any attention. They just have to

06:03.440 --> 06:07.440
shove their way through. The people are in their way, and that's all there is to it.

06:08.240 --> 06:12.320
So that would be your experience in mind. But if Margaret Thatcher walks into the room,

06:12.320 --> 06:17.200
suddenly everybody wants to talk to her, and so she makes it in a meter or so, and then she finds

06:17.200 --> 06:22.560
herself stopped, and then she tries to go another few meters, and she stopped again. And so it just

06:22.560 --> 06:29.920
takes her a very long time. She's slowed down by all the people in the room. And so the image that

06:30.720 --> 06:36.240
this particular metaphor is trying to convey is that the Higgs field is like this substance

06:36.240 --> 06:41.920
that fills the room, and those things that interact with that substance are slowed down,

06:41.920 --> 06:47.120
and that has to do with why they have mass. And is that good?

06:48.480 --> 06:56.880
Well, no. It's pretty bad, actually. And again, this is not to criticize the inventors

06:56.880 --> 07:02.640
of this metaphor, because they were supposed to come up with something that fits in a paragraph.

07:03.440 --> 07:08.800
And the fact of the matter is that some aspects of the universe don't fit in a paragraph,

07:08.800 --> 07:16.800
and this is one of them. But what's unfortunate about this particular metaphor is not merely

07:16.800 --> 07:23.680
that it doesn't really capture the essence of what's going on, but it actually flies in the face

07:23.680 --> 07:30.160
of an even more important principle of nature. And that is the relationship between

07:31.360 --> 07:40.080
mass and motion. And if, as this metaphor suggests, you get the idea that, oh, mass has to do with

07:40.080 --> 07:47.120
slowing things down, with obstruction, with obstructing motion, then your conception of

07:47.120 --> 07:52.640
the world ends up back in the Middle Ages. And you really don't want to end up there.

07:52.640 --> 07:57.680
I mean, they were smart people, but they were very confused, and we would prefer to avoid

07:57.680 --> 08:03.360
that confusion. Now, what am I talking about here? What is going wrong with this metaphor

08:03.360 --> 08:10.320
is that it contradicts the principle of relativity, which if you even don't know much physics,

08:10.320 --> 08:14.400
you've never taken a class on it, you've never heard much about it, violating the principle

08:14.400 --> 08:21.840
of relativity sounds like a pretty bad idea, and it is. And the reason it's such an important

08:21.840 --> 08:29.360
principle is that it explains many of the fundamentally counterintuitive aspects of the

08:29.360 --> 08:38.000
basics of being in this world. For example, why it is that we're all, you know, I'm sitting down,

08:38.000 --> 08:42.720
you're sitting down, both of us feel like we're not going anywhere. But of course, we are. The

08:42.720 --> 08:47.680
earth is spinning, the earth is going around the sun, the sun is going around the galaxy,

08:48.400 --> 08:53.680
and the speeds involved are enormous. I mean, the earth is going, the earth and sun are going

08:53.680 --> 09:04.080
around the galaxy at 150 miles per second. Now, why don't we feel that? And why if the earth has

09:04.080 --> 09:12.000
so much mass and this metaphor we're right, why isn't it slowing down? This picture of Margaret

09:12.000 --> 09:16.320
Thatcher having a lot of mass because she's being slowed down by the crowd. Well, I mean,

09:16.320 --> 09:21.280
the earth has a lot more mass than she does. Why isn't the Higgs field slowing the earth down?

09:22.720 --> 09:28.320
Well, the answer is that the metaphor doesn't work. And you therefore have to try to find a way

09:29.200 --> 09:34.400
back to the principle of relativity to start the process of explaining what the Higgs field

09:34.400 --> 09:39.920
really does. And so that's why the book I've recently written starts at that place.

09:39.920 --> 09:44.960
I do like the fact that you can date the origin of the metaphor so precisely just by the fact that

09:44.960 --> 09:48.800
it was Margaret Thatcher who they picked as the famous person who would have trouble walking

09:48.800 --> 09:55.680
through the party. Yes. And you can imagine that today it would be Elon Musk, but

09:57.440 --> 10:02.160
he would certainly have trouble. But he's very wealthy, but his mass is not that big.

10:03.680 --> 10:09.040
Well, this is what I like about your book because, of course, quantum field theory is a mutual

10:09.040 --> 10:14.320
interest of ours. And I think that we both agree that it would be nice if everyone in the world

10:14.320 --> 10:18.880
understood quantum field theory a little bit better than they do. If I were to explain it,

10:18.880 --> 10:23.360
I would probably start with quantum mechanics and then say, OK, what if you do fields to it?

10:24.000 --> 10:30.080
And you take a very different approach, really starting with relativity and spacetime and mass

10:30.080 --> 10:37.040
and how those things work. So tell us what relativity is. It didn't come from Einstein originally.

10:37.040 --> 10:46.400
It did not. And indeed, Einstein, in a way, saved it more than created it as we understand it today.

10:46.400 --> 10:51.440
And the person who was perhaps most responsible, although clearly there were other people who were

10:51.440 --> 11:00.960
thinking about it, historically was Galileo. In the 1630s, Galileo wrote a famous passage into one

11:00.960 --> 11:08.640
of his texts in which he explained that if you're on a boat and you're inside the boat,

11:08.640 --> 11:14.160
so the wind isn't blowing in your hair, you're just inside in one of the rooms,

11:14.160 --> 11:20.160
and the boat is moving really steadily. It's not a wavy day. The boat is just smoothly moving

11:20.160 --> 11:26.320
through the water. You will have no idea that the boat is in motion. You will not be able to tell

11:26.320 --> 11:31.280
how fast it's going or which direction it's going. And he gives lots of examples of things

11:31.280 --> 11:36.960
that you could do to try to check it. You might think that, well, if I drop something and the

11:36.960 --> 11:42.640
boat is moving, then as I drop it, it will move towards the back of the boat. But that's not true.

11:43.920 --> 11:48.240
Maybe you might think the flies in the room will be all pushed to the back of the room.

11:49.120 --> 11:55.520
But that's not true. And when you think it through, he argued, you realize that there's

11:55.520 --> 12:00.080
nothing, absolutely nothing you can do, which would show that you are in motion as long as that

12:00.080 --> 12:09.840
motion is steady. And he infers from this that the laws of nature do not depend in any way on

12:09.840 --> 12:16.000
whether you are moving if that motion is steady. And when you think about it, that's the thin end

12:16.000 --> 12:22.400
of the wedge on the question of why you and I don't feel our motion. And so we go from

12:23.120 --> 12:30.800
a situation where even in 1600, 50 years after Copernicus, really great thinkers like Tycho Brahe,

12:31.840 --> 12:39.120
Kepler's boss, could write things down saying that it's just not possible that the earth is spinning

12:39.920 --> 12:45.040
and moving around the sun. That makes no sense. We would feel it. A heavy body like the earth

12:45.040 --> 12:51.280
shouldn't be moving. To the modern day where we realize that the earth, in fact, is flying

12:51.280 --> 12:56.720
through the heavens at extraordinary speed and doing all sorts of gyrations, and yet we are

12:56.720 --> 13:02.560
completely unaware of it here on earth. And the explanation for that is Galileo's realization

13:02.560 --> 13:10.240
about how motion is a relative thing. There is no such thing as absolute motion. You can't say

13:11.360 --> 13:17.520
in this universe whether you are moving or not. You can only say how fast you're moving relative

13:17.520 --> 13:23.440
to another object. You and I had a longer than it should have been conversation once about whether

13:23.440 --> 13:30.400
the earth goes around the sun. Or the sun around the earth. Well, or is it up to you because you

13:30.400 --> 13:35.200
can choose coordinate systems? Did you ever personally come down to the right answer in your

13:35.200 --> 13:41.600
mind there? I did. And this is a wonderful question, although it's a question fundamentally about

13:42.480 --> 13:45.600
Einstein's general notion of relativity. I know, skipping ahead, but that's okay. It's just a

13:45.600 --> 13:51.680
podcast. It's all right. But I'll give you the short answer. And of course, I wrote about this

13:51.680 --> 13:57.200
extensively on my blog because I thought, this is such an interesting question. And here there are

13:57.200 --> 14:02.320
professors at significant universities who actually argue that, no, you really can't say whether the

14:02.320 --> 14:08.400
earth goes around the sun or vice versa. And the reason that's a mistake, I believe, is that

14:09.040 --> 14:14.480
it's not just about two objects, one orbiting the other. You really are asking the question,

14:15.280 --> 14:20.960
is the earth orbiting the sun subject to gravity? In other words, it's not just a matter about what

14:20.960 --> 14:28.800
its path is, but why its path is the way it is. And you can easily tell that the earth is going

14:28.800 --> 14:34.960
around the sun in sun's gravity and not the other way around as simply as looking, but by simply

14:34.960 --> 14:45.040
looking at Kepler's third law of mechanics, which tells you that the planets have a rule by which

14:45.680 --> 14:51.760
their orbital times are related to their orbital distances from the sun. And the earth satisfies

14:51.760 --> 14:58.480
Kepler's law for the sun, whereas the earth also has a Kepler's like law. The moon satisfies it,

14:58.480 --> 15:05.120
the space station satisfies it, but the sun does not. And so, in a way, it's as simple as that.

15:05.120 --> 15:11.440
Now, you can go into more detail and talk about the fact that orbits are an entire class of motions

15:11.440 --> 15:16.720
and not just the earth's motion alone, and come up with all sorts of ways of saying this in more

15:16.720 --> 15:22.320
technical detail. But in the end, fundamentally, it's not true that the sun goes around the earth

15:22.320 --> 15:26.640
gravitationally. And that's really what's at stake here. The earth goes around the sun

15:26.640 --> 15:30.080
gravitationally and not the other way around. Yeah. And so, I am one of the people who would

15:30.080 --> 15:35.760
disagree with you about this. But of course, it's interesting precisely because you and I

15:35.760 --> 15:41.680
100% agree on the physics, right? It's just a matter of how to match up the words in the

15:41.680 --> 15:47.360
English language to the physics that we understand. And that's going to be a theme throughout your

15:47.360 --> 15:52.480
book and your attempts to discuss relativity and quantum mechanics and so forth. Yeah. I mean,

15:52.480 --> 15:58.080
I think just in the sense there's an even larger issue, which is the fact that scientists could

15:58.080 --> 16:04.000
agree on the physics and disagree on the way to talk about the physics, even colleagues like you

16:04.000 --> 16:13.280
and you and I, is a clear problem for a person who is not an expert trying to understand what

16:13.280 --> 16:21.840
scientists do know and what scientists are still disagreeing about. And so, I think,

16:21.920 --> 16:27.120
for both you and I and for other people who spend a lot of time trying to convey

16:27.840 --> 16:34.720
how science works, the important thing to do is be very clear about what it is we know

16:35.360 --> 16:41.120
and about why it is we are explaining it in the way that we are, so that a non-expert could

16:41.120 --> 16:46.320
read what I write about it and could read what you write about it and come away with a correct

16:46.320 --> 16:51.520
impression, namely, we're not disagreeing about the math. We're disagreeing about the way to look

16:51.600 --> 16:58.320
at the math, but that's not in the end what physics is. Physics is about prediction based

16:58.320 --> 17:03.520
on mathematics and the fact that you want to talk about it in a different way does not make it a

17:03.520 --> 17:09.040
contradiction. It simply makes it a different perspective on the same thing. Good. We'll see

17:09.040 --> 17:14.720
how that shows up as we go, but I don't want to leave Galileo behind entirely because I've made

17:14.720 --> 17:25.120
the case most clearly in my book, The Big Picture. To me, the specific idea that motion just continues

17:25.120 --> 17:29.840
on by itself, right, that the natural state of things is for things to keep moving at a constant

17:29.840 --> 17:34.960
velocity. If you want to promote that to conservation of momentum or something like that, you can,

17:34.960 --> 17:41.840
but to me, that is maybe the single biggest realization in the history of science because

17:41.920 --> 17:49.600
it removes the need for explaining why things are moving, right? In the middle ages point of view,

17:49.600 --> 17:56.080
it was weird when things were moving and you needed a force or a mover to do it and post Galileo

17:56.080 --> 18:01.680
and his other predecessors, like Ibn Sina, who set this up, now we can just think of the universe

18:01.680 --> 18:08.880
as kind of a mechanism following patterns. That's right. And there's a very close tie between

18:09.680 --> 18:18.480
the law of inertia or whatever, what comes up in physics classes as Newton's first law of motion,

18:18.480 --> 18:23.200
although he wasn't the first person to write it down by any means, and Galileo's principle,

18:23.200 --> 18:30.960
that these two are in some sense two sides of the same coin because what Galileo says is you

18:30.960 --> 18:37.200
can't tell the difference between steady motion and no motion. And so if you believe that if you

18:37.280 --> 18:40.960
are stationary, you will remain stationary unless something does something to you,

18:40.960 --> 18:45.200
then it must also be true that if you're in steady motion, you will remain in steady motion

18:45.200 --> 18:51.360
until somebody does something to you. So they are very closely tied together, these notions.

18:51.360 --> 18:56.160
Did either Galileo or Newton say those words that you just said, make that argument?

18:57.760 --> 19:02.880
That's a great question. I don't know the history enough to know of a precise point at which either

19:02.960 --> 19:08.240
one might have said that. It's something I should maybe look into. It's an interesting question.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.760
Of course, the way we learn history is we learn the history of the great thinkers,

19:13.760 --> 19:20.320
but there are always smaller personalities who have certain insights and write certain things

19:20.320 --> 19:26.000
down. And so to trace that back and find out which one or which set of people first have

19:26.000 --> 19:31.040
these insights would be a real challenge even for a historian of science since we're talking

19:31.040 --> 19:35.200
several hundred years ago. But it's probably known to the experts in that field.

19:35.200 --> 19:41.760
So we're already coming up across something even at this pretty easy to understand level of what

19:41.760 --> 19:47.760
Galileo was talking about, but something that's nevertheless pretty non-intuitive. The idea that

19:47.760 --> 19:54.240
there is no universal standard of rest. There is no way to just say, here is the speed of something

19:54.240 --> 19:58.000
full stop. This is going to be something we got to continue to fight against all the way up through

19:58.240 --> 20:06.160
modern physics, right? Absolutely. It's a fascinating thing that we teach physics to

20:06.160 --> 20:14.160
college students. And this is almost the first thing we teach them. And in the classes where I

20:14.160 --> 20:19.440
was taught and in the classes where I've been expected to teach, the idea is you teach Newton's

20:19.440 --> 20:24.080
first law maybe in the first week or maybe in the second week, and then you move on without

20:24.880 --> 20:30.000
grappling with the fact that this is a remarkably counterintuitive notion. We never

20:30.800 --> 20:37.120
see this, experience this in ordinary life. Anything that we want to move, we typically

20:37.120 --> 20:43.680
have to keep it moving. Cars need engines, planes need engines. We have to keep pushing,

20:43.680 --> 20:49.040
walking tires us out. We can't just sort of glide down a highway without doing anything.

20:49.520 --> 20:57.840
And that's because friction and other forms of drag are ubiquitous on the earth.

20:58.880 --> 21:07.600
And so we grow up in an environment and we have an intuition that motion requires

21:07.600 --> 21:13.520
activity. But it's only by understanding that motion does not require activity that we can

21:13.520 --> 21:18.160
understand astronomy, that we can understand why the earth does what it does and the moon does what

21:18.160 --> 21:23.600
it does. And so again, this is why astronomy was so counterintuitive. It took so many

21:24.480 --> 21:32.080
hundreds, thousands of years to understand. So yes, this is a profoundly counterintuitive notion

21:32.560 --> 21:41.200
and we don't fundamentally know why it should be true, why it has to be true. We just have

21:41.200 --> 21:46.480
experimental evidence that makes it seem that it appears that it's true throughout the universe.

21:46.480 --> 21:51.280
And yet, and this is in some sense where we get into the really interesting aspects of modern

21:51.280 --> 21:58.640
physics, it almost broke down. It was on the verge of breaking down when people tried to understand

21:58.640 --> 22:08.240
what light is. And we're going to get to that. Okay, good. Yeah, no, that's, it's always a back

22:08.240 --> 22:14.320
and forth, right? Like one generation's precious principle that we can't violate is another one's

22:14.320 --> 22:20.480
antiquated relic that we have to overcome. Absolutely. And speaking of which, a topic

22:20.480 --> 22:26.160
that you go into great detail in the book, you've mentioned Newton's first law, then there's,

22:26.160 --> 22:29.680
which says that we're going to go in straight lines if you don't act on us with a force,

22:29.680 --> 22:35.520
but the second law, that's where Newton really made his money, right? That's f equals ma, that's

22:35.520 --> 22:41.920
what made modern physics possible. And there's all three of those symbols, f and m and a,

22:41.920 --> 22:47.280
are kind of interesting. But let's talk about m. What is that parameter that appears in Newton's

22:47.280 --> 22:55.600
law? Was he the first to talk about that? Where did it come from? Well, in a way, it has a long

22:55.600 --> 23:04.880
complex history like most concepts, but the original confusion about what we now call mass

23:05.120 --> 23:14.400
is it's a conflation with the concept of weight. Yeah. And before Newton, people assumed these

23:14.400 --> 23:18.960
two concepts were essentially the same, as far as I understand. And Newton was the first to

23:18.960 --> 23:25.680
realize no, you have to separate them. And to talk about it in modern language, rather than try to

23:25.680 --> 23:31.920
confuse ourselves with the way people used to think about it. Mass is a property that tells

23:31.920 --> 23:37.680
you how hard it is to change an object's motion. Now, again, this is in contrast to that Higgs

23:37.680 --> 23:42.640
metaphor and Margaret Thatcher that we started with, which suggests that mass is about how quickly

23:42.640 --> 23:48.000
things slow down. It's quite the reverse. Things will continue in a straight line unless you do

23:48.000 --> 23:54.080
something to them. And mass is how hard it is to change something's direction or slow something

23:54.080 --> 24:01.440
down or speed it up. And so that is a that is a an aspect of an object which reflects

24:02.480 --> 24:07.680
not its motion, but it's in some sense, it's stubbornness that prevents change in motion.

24:08.320 --> 24:15.120
Now, what is weight? Weight is how heavy an object is literally how hard it is to hold an

24:15.120 --> 24:22.160
object up against the pull of gravity. And on earth, these two things are completely connected

24:22.160 --> 24:30.560
to each other. The more mass an object has, the more weight it has. But and so it was natural for

24:30.560 --> 24:33.760
people living on earth and never having gone anywhere else and never really having thought

24:33.760 --> 24:39.200
that hard about any place else to imagine these with the same thing. But Newton's key recognition

24:39.200 --> 24:49.360
was this couldn't be true. If there was some way to understand the moon's motion in terms of gravity

24:49.360 --> 24:55.600
or the planets in terms of gravity, it had to be that weight for something that's far enough away

24:55.600 --> 25:01.600
would be smaller, even though its mass remained the same. So the moon has an enormous mass,

25:02.320 --> 25:07.520
but its weight, that is to say, it's the degree to which it is pulled by the earth's gravity

25:07.520 --> 25:11.440
is much smaller than you would imagine if you thought mass and weight were the same thing.

25:12.240 --> 25:18.800
So and you know, we carry this conflation of mass and weight with us wherever we go.

25:18.800 --> 25:23.200
That's why we're always interested in, you know, watching our weight and keeping our weight under

25:23.200 --> 25:27.840
control. Whereas in fact, if you just wanted to lose weight, you could go to the moon. But I don't

25:27.840 --> 25:32.880
think your body shape would change at all. So one should keep in mind that one really wants to lose

25:32.880 --> 25:38.320
his mass. And I'm kind of surprised that physics teachers don't sort of teach this right at the

25:38.400 --> 25:44.560
beginning of the section on gravity. But it seems an obvious point to make that we conflate these

25:44.560 --> 25:50.560
two ideas. But to understand modern physics, even to understand Newtonian physics, you have to first

25:50.560 --> 25:56.000
pull these ideas apart. And what's interesting about that is that you need to bring in gravity

25:56.000 --> 26:00.720
into the discussion. And I think that, you know, from the Ask Me Anything questions I get for the

26:00.720 --> 26:07.680
podcast, etc. I think that this is a very natural confusion that people have, like is mass somehow

26:07.680 --> 26:12.560
intrinsically linked to the idea of gravity, or is it something separate? And the answer is implicit

26:12.560 --> 26:19.040
in what you said, but let's make it explicit. Well, it's even, it is, but it's a little subtle too,

26:19.040 --> 26:25.840
which is that when we get to Einstein, we're even going to have to keep track of the fact that what

26:25.840 --> 26:33.200
you mean by mass is ambiguous if you're not careful. But at the time of Newton, the idea was that

26:33.840 --> 26:38.800
mass has to do with motion, as we just described, has to do with preventing changes or getting in

26:38.800 --> 26:43.680
the way of changes of motion. But it also, for some reason that Newton did not understand,

26:43.680 --> 26:49.840
has to do with gravity in that the force between two objects involves the multiplying their two

26:49.840 --> 26:55.840
masses together. And the more mass things have, the more gravity they inflict on other things.

26:56.800 --> 27:03.360
What we know today is that the chain of logic, linking those different types of,

27:03.360 --> 27:10.240
those different aspects of mass is more complicated. And that in fact, gravity comes from energy and

27:10.240 --> 27:18.640
momentum, and not directly from what we would call rest mass, which is the type of mass that I've,

27:18.640 --> 27:24.160
that affects motion in the simplest sense. And also, most importantly, it's the type of mass

27:24.160 --> 27:30.320
called rest mass is what appears in Einstein's most famous formula, E equals mc squared, interpreted

27:30.320 --> 27:36.960
as saying that the mass of an object that's at rest, that's stationary, has to do with the amount

27:36.960 --> 27:44.480
of energy that's inside it. So what Einstein does, he says, well, look, mass, at least rest mass,

27:44.480 --> 27:51.920
the mass of a stationary object comes from its energy. And separately, gravity is an effect

27:51.920 --> 27:58.000
that comes from energy. So when you put those two things together in simple situations, you get

27:58.000 --> 28:04.720
Newton's notion that gravity comes from mass, because gravity comes from energy and mass is a

28:04.720 --> 28:09.120
form of energy. But when you pull them apart, you get the much more varied and much richer

28:09.760 --> 28:15.920
notion of what gravity can do that you know better than I in the context of general relativity and

28:15.920 --> 28:22.640
Einstein's theory of gravity. And speaking of, you know, Einstein's theory of gravity, he was

28:22.640 --> 28:27.920
led to his insights in part because of the principle of equivalence, which people give

28:27.920 --> 28:33.120
credit to Einstein for. But Newton noticed a version of the principle of equivalence, right?

28:34.800 --> 28:39.600
Sure. In the sense that all objects already just from the start, all objects fall to the

28:39.600 --> 28:44.400
earth at the same rate in a way, even Galileo knew this, and Newton in a way gave it an explanation.

28:44.960 --> 28:50.320
Because he noted that the acceleration of an object is related to the force on it divided

28:50.320 --> 28:58.480
by its mass. And in gravity, the force on it is proportional to its mass. And so in the acceleration,

28:58.480 --> 29:02.800
the mass cancels out. There's a mass in the numerator, there's a mass in the denominator,

29:02.800 --> 29:10.720
and so acceleration is the same for all objects falling on the earth. And so that means that if

29:10.720 --> 29:15.200
I take a little paperclip and I take a heavy book and I drop them at the same time, they land at

29:15.200 --> 29:20.240
the same time. And if you haven't ever seen this yourself, try it. It's amazing how many people

29:20.240 --> 29:24.960
sort of know this, but have never actually tried to drop something really light and something really

29:24.960 --> 29:30.080
heavy, making sure that that very light thing isn't affected by air resistance. And in that case,

29:30.080 --> 29:36.000
you'll really see it's as though it looks like magic. And it is in a way a sort of magic because

29:36.080 --> 29:42.960
it's what leads to Einstein's conception that gravity could be an aspect of the geometry of space

29:42.960 --> 29:49.680
and time rather than some just generalized force. It has some very special properties.

29:50.160 --> 29:57.840
Well, I think that's why Newton maybe didn't explain it as completely as Einstein did, right?

29:57.840 --> 30:03.200
I mean, yes, Newton noticed that the parameter mass that appears in his second law and the

30:03.280 --> 30:08.480
parameter mass that appears in the law of gravity are the same parameter. But why are they the same

30:08.480 --> 30:15.360
parameter? It was a little bit unclear and that was kind of mysterious. I'm not sure that Einstein

30:15.360 --> 30:20.000
does completely explain it. He accounts for it. It is a true fact in general relativity,

30:20.000 --> 30:24.880
but if someone just sat back and said, did it have to be that way? I'm not even sure what the

30:24.880 --> 30:32.240
right answer is. Well, that's a really good question because in a way, there is an explanation

30:32.240 --> 30:42.880
that comes out of quantum field theory if you accept that gravity comes from a gravitational

30:42.880 --> 30:48.320
field that is associated with what a particle physicist would call a particle of spin 2.

30:49.520 --> 30:56.720
And what's interesting about that is in Einstein's theory, yes, there is an association of

30:57.520 --> 31:04.640
gravity with a field with certain properties such that its particles have spin 2 and then

31:04.640 --> 31:11.680
it does follow from mathematical consistency that you must be able to interpret space and time

31:12.720 --> 31:17.040
in terms of interpret gravity in terms of the geometry of space and time.

31:17.040 --> 31:22.800
But one thing that's often forgotten, although I'm again, people like you know this very well,

31:22.800 --> 31:27.520
is that there was a competing theory of gravity at that time by a fellow named Nordstrom.

31:28.480 --> 31:35.760
And in Nordstrom's theory, instead of spin 2, there was a spin zero object and it was a perfectly

31:35.760 --> 31:44.960
good theory. But in retrospect, the mathematics would not have required it to have the properties

31:44.960 --> 31:52.000
that Einstein wanted it to have. Whereas with the spin 2 field, you are sort of forced into it by

31:52.000 --> 31:56.640
the math. That's not something Einstein knew at the time. That was something that was learned later.

31:56.640 --> 32:01.200
So in a way, Einstein got lucky. He had some principles. They led to a particular theory.

32:02.560 --> 32:07.520
It turns out that there weren't many options beyond the one he came up with that would be

32:07.520 --> 32:16.400
mathematically consistent. But at the time, you know, like any good theorist, he had some

32:16.400 --> 32:21.360
principles he was working with and it led him to an answer. But it wasn't obvious that it was

32:21.360 --> 32:27.920
the correct answer. That depended on experiment. I think that the idea of thinking of gravity

32:27.920 --> 32:33.600
is arising from a spin 2 particle is a really fun and important one. And we should talk about it

32:33.600 --> 32:39.360
again. But we have to eat our vegetables a little bit first and work our way up. So let's just remind

32:39.360 --> 32:44.560
ourselves what happened to the poor principle of relativity. I mean, Galileo put it out there.

32:45.360 --> 32:51.520
Newton had a theory that embodied it. But then something happened with electricity and

32:51.520 --> 32:59.600
magnetism and the world was never the same. Yes. In a way, we could certainly talk about

32:59.600 --> 33:04.800
electricity and magnetism in their details. But in a way, the problem is even deeper,

33:04.800 --> 33:11.840
which is the simple observation that light somehow makes it across the universe.

33:11.920 --> 33:19.040
Light can travel a very long distance, and it doesn't lose its oomph. It clearly maintains its

33:19.040 --> 33:25.040
color, its frequency as it goes. Somehow, you know, it has this property that somehow it can

33:25.040 --> 33:31.040
travel through the universe itself. And if you think light is just a bunch of particles, as Newton

33:31.040 --> 33:39.040
did, that might not be so surprising. If that if the universe is mostly empty, and you're sending

33:39.040 --> 33:42.560
bullets through it, well, the bullets will just keep going according to Newton's first law,

33:42.560 --> 33:48.160
nothing there to stop them or slow them down. But there was a debate for two centuries as to

33:48.160 --> 33:55.520
whether light was a wave or made of particles. And then around 1800, there was definitive evidence

33:55.520 --> 34:01.920
from interference effects that no, light is really a wave. And now we hit a puzzle,

34:02.880 --> 34:09.760
a very serious puzzle. Because, you know, sound waves are waves in air, they don't go through

34:09.760 --> 34:16.160
the universe. Why not? Because there's no air there. A sound wave is a vibration of the air.

34:16.160 --> 34:20.400
If there's no air, there's no sound waves. Same idea if you go to the beach, right,

34:20.400 --> 34:24.880
the ocean waves come to the beach, and they stop, they don't keep going because there's no war.

34:25.760 --> 34:31.520
So if light waves can go through the universe, there must be something out there. There must

34:31.520 --> 34:38.080
be a thing that you would naturally think that is vibrating that in which the waves are a vibration.

34:38.080 --> 34:43.280
So what is this thing? And why doesn't it slow the earth down?

34:45.840 --> 34:50.000
So we hit a puzzle. Don't keep us hanging here, Matt. Tell us what the answer is.

34:51.920 --> 34:58.240
Well, I mean, at a certain level, we don't entirely know the answer. What Einstein did was

34:58.240 --> 35:07.440
point out that, well, let me back up one step. The point that seems obvious is even if you're

35:07.440 --> 35:15.120
confused about what this stuff is, you should be able to measure whether you're moving through it or

35:15.120 --> 35:21.760
not. For example, if you're in a boat, you can easily tell if you're moving through the water

35:21.760 --> 35:27.760
or not. If you turn off your engine, if you're moving through the water, you will very quickly

35:27.840 --> 35:33.840
slow down. And although Galileo says you can't measure whether you're moving in a steady motion,

35:33.840 --> 35:43.200
if you're slowing down, you certainly feel that. So same thing for a plane that's flying through

35:43.200 --> 35:47.680
the air. If it were stationary, it would be doing one thing. And if it's flying through the air without

35:47.680 --> 35:52.480
an engine, it's going to slow down and so forth. So you can tell whether you are in motion and

35:52.480 --> 35:56.960
how you are in motion with respect to ordinary substances. So the basic idea was we ought to

35:56.960 --> 36:02.000
be able to tell if we're moving through this magical substance, which was called the luminiferous

36:02.000 --> 36:06.720
ether name, which has got lovely resonances to it. It's a great name compared to a lot of other

36:06.720 --> 36:10.800
dumb names physicists came up with. It's such a shame. It's too bad it doesn't exist. I know.

36:10.800 --> 36:16.000
Or maybe it is. We'll come back to that. But in any case, the idea was, all right,

36:16.000 --> 36:21.120
there should be some measurement we can make that can tell us something about this substance

36:21.200 --> 36:28.960
in which light is a wave. And in the 1880s, the right technology came along. And that was invented

36:28.960 --> 36:38.400
by Albert Michelson, who along with Edmund Morley, built a machine, a device, that could very

36:39.680 --> 36:45.840
accurately measure the speed of light in different directions. And if you think about it, if you're

36:45.840 --> 36:50.480
moving through the water and you're looking at ocean waves, ocean waves that are going in the

36:50.480 --> 36:56.240
same direction that you're going will seem relative to your boat to move more slowly than ocean waves

36:56.240 --> 37:03.040
going the other direction. And so it was a similar idea that Michelson had in mind that you should

37:03.040 --> 37:07.440
be able to tell that light moves at different speeds relative to this medium, depending on how

37:07.440 --> 37:10.960
fast the earth is going through the medium. And of course, the earth goes in different directions

37:10.960 --> 37:15.280
every, you know, as it goes around the sun. So if you measure this a few times a year, you measure

37:15.280 --> 37:19.360
this in different directions, you should be able to tell a difference. And famously, Michelson and

37:19.360 --> 37:24.160
Morley saw no difference at all. Speed of light seemed to be the same from all directions at all

37:24.160 --> 37:30.000
times. And that seems to be in contradiction with the idea that there's a substance in which light

37:30.000 --> 37:40.000
is a wave. Now, this is where we come back to Galileo, because if it had been true that Michelson's

37:40.000 --> 37:46.080
experiment had worked, if it were possible to tell how fast the earth were moving through this

37:46.160 --> 37:52.480
luminiferous ether, then it would not be true that all types of steady motion are the same.

37:52.480 --> 37:59.360
There would be experiments that you could do even in a closed room, even under the deck of a ship,

37:59.360 --> 38:04.320
as Galileo suggested, there would be experiments you could do. You could do Michelson's experiment

38:04.320 --> 38:10.640
and tell how fast you are moving through the ether. But since the ether apparently is everywhere in

38:10.640 --> 38:16.000
space after where, after all, light goes through the universe from all directions and from many

38:16.000 --> 38:21.520
places, then you would conclude that Galileo's idea, although it might apply to some things,

38:21.520 --> 38:30.080
is not fundamentally correct. And so Michelson's experiment, had it shown a difference in the

38:30.080 --> 38:34.240
speeds of light from different directions, would have been the death knell for Galileo's

38:34.240 --> 38:42.160
relativity. So now came a brief period of 25 years where people tried to explain what does

38:42.160 --> 38:47.120
Michelson's experiment mean? Why can't we detect this thing? And there were various ideas which

38:47.120 --> 38:52.320
we don't have to go into, but all of them would still have violated Galileo's relativity.

38:53.760 --> 39:02.880
And then Einstein pointed out, as a 26-year-old student, that actually if you insist that Galileo's

39:02.880 --> 39:08.960
relativity is correct, and you relinquish your notions of space and time as you always thought

39:08.960 --> 39:17.120
they worked, you can write down math that can both explain why light travels as a wave,

39:18.320 --> 39:24.560
particular a wave of the electromagnetic fields, and yet can travel from your perspective at the

39:24.560 --> 39:30.160
same speed from all directions independently of how you are moving or the object that's

39:30.160 --> 39:37.920
emitting the light is moving. And that was an extraordinary thing to point out. That's obviously

39:37.920 --> 39:46.800
one of the great ideas in scientific history, because it showed that the only way to reconcile

39:46.800 --> 39:52.400
light's amazing ability to travel the universe is to give up your notions of how space and time work.

39:52.560 --> 39:56.000
It seems like a big ask, but it paid off.

39:56.960 --> 40:03.520
It's a huge ask, and needless to say, people were curious, interested, but very skeptical.

40:04.400 --> 40:08.400
But in the end, it doesn't matter what people think. It matters what experiment says.

40:09.280 --> 40:12.640
Experiments said these ideas are correct.

40:12.640 --> 40:19.120
You make the case very nicely that Einstein's insight here really wasn't the word

40:19.120 --> 40:25.120
relativity in any sense at all. Relativity was already there, and then there was this

40:25.120 --> 40:29.440
experimental idea that the speed of light was constant to everyone. He figured out how to

40:29.440 --> 40:35.600
reconcile those two amazing facts that sound innocuous together, but have tension between them.

40:36.720 --> 40:41.040
Yeah, that's right. Einstein's theory of relativity is not the invention of the idea of

40:41.040 --> 40:47.040
relativity. It is a revision of the idea of relativity as Galileo had it, because Galileo

40:47.040 --> 40:51.920
didn't worry about time. Galileo just worried about how things move, but he assumed time is just

40:51.920 --> 40:59.520
time. And Einstein is now already, even before general relativity, starting to make us wonder

41:00.640 --> 41:05.200
how we should think about time and what it means if everybody who's moving around has a different

41:05.200 --> 41:12.000
clock than the notion of simultaneity and the notion of synchronized clocks. It's all starting

41:12.000 --> 41:16.480
to come at risk. And general relativity tears it all apart.

41:16.480 --> 41:23.840
Well, I got a question recently. Why don't people consider special relativity as one of the great

41:23.840 --> 41:29.360
triumphs of unification of physics, because it unified space and time together? And my result,

41:29.360 --> 41:33.840
my answer was, like, what do you mean? I always talk about it that way. That's exactly what it was.

41:34.400 --> 41:39.920
And many other unifications came with it. This is where we can now finally talk about

41:39.920 --> 41:43.760
E equals mc squared and how mass and energy are related to each other.

41:44.640 --> 41:51.040
Even in some sense, the unification of electricity and magnetism, which I think fairly can be

41:51.040 --> 41:58.480
attributed to Maxwell, there is a way in which that unification becomes not only true but necessary

41:59.120 --> 42:04.160
once you have Einstein's understanding of how it works. You simply can't talk about one without

42:04.160 --> 42:09.200
the other, because what is electric from one person's point of view can be part electric,

42:09.200 --> 42:12.960
part magnetic from another person's point of view. And that's deeply integrated into the

42:12.960 --> 42:19.200
math of the theory. And we're left with a picture where, I mean, eventually Einstein

42:19.200 --> 42:25.120
events general relativity, we don't need to go into great details about that. But it leaves

42:25.120 --> 42:30.320
us hanging a little bit with this issue of whether space or space time, if you want,

42:30.880 --> 42:37.120
is a medium by itself, right? It's not the ether, we can't measure our velocity with respect to it,

42:37.120 --> 42:42.320
but it's something, it has a geometry, et cetera. How are we supposed to think about space and

42:42.320 --> 42:47.120
space time? Well, I think that remains one of the great questions of modern physics today,

42:48.080 --> 42:52.640
in the sense that as you just to say what you said, but in a slightly different way,

42:54.240 --> 43:01.440
there is a fundamental tension that still remains conceptually. It's not a tension in

43:01.440 --> 43:08.240
the mathematics, but it's tension in how we think about it, in that we know today that,

43:08.240 --> 43:15.680
thanks to Einstein, that space and time somehow thought of together, they're kind of like a

43:15.680 --> 43:20.960
fabric in that they can stretch in the expanding universe, that's what's happening, they can warp,

43:20.960 --> 43:25.440
that's what gives us gravity, they can ripple, that's what gives us gravitational waves,

43:26.160 --> 43:32.320
which are the subject of a Nobel Prize just in the last few years. And yet,

43:34.160 --> 43:41.200
this fact that we can't measure this substance, whatever it is, we can't measure whether we're

43:41.200 --> 43:46.240
moving through it or not, because that would violate Galileo's principle. So to say it again,

43:46.240 --> 43:51.680
space is sort of a thing, it does stuff, but we are not able to measure whether we are moving

43:51.680 --> 43:57.520
through it. And more generally, we're not able to measure its presence, or we can see some of the

43:57.520 --> 44:02.800
things it does, and yet we can't see kind of what it is, we can't grab hold of it or bottle it,

44:02.800 --> 44:07.520
it's not like a substance the way water is a substance, or like any other substance we're

44:07.520 --> 44:15.360
used to. And so this conflict between a substance-like thing, which acts like it's there, and this

44:15.360 --> 44:20.320
thing which sometimes acts like it's nothingness, that fundamental conflict is a deep conceptual

44:20.320 --> 44:28.480
conflict for our brains, the math is okay with it, but it's such a deep problem that it might even

44:28.480 --> 44:37.120
make you wonder whether space is real. Good. Go ahead. And so, and physicists do really wonder

44:37.120 --> 44:41.280
about this. I mean, this is an active area of research, there are various reasons for that,

44:41.280 --> 44:48.160
which are kind of another discussion. But certainly, we live in a universe whose basic

44:48.160 --> 44:53.040
fundamental properties are very strange. Strange enough that we should certainly worry

44:53.600 --> 44:59.360
that maybe there's another level of understanding behind them that we have yet to encounter.

44:59.360 --> 45:03.840
I'm really glad that you put it that way, because it's very honest. You weren't trying to claim more

45:03.840 --> 45:10.560
certainty than we have, which some people will sometimes try to do. And also, I personally,

45:10.560 --> 45:15.920
at the research level, am increasingly sympathetic to notions where

45:17.520 --> 45:23.040
this lack of a rest frame, what we call Lorentz invariance in the technical lingo,

45:23.040 --> 45:28.960
is only an approximation. That in fact, it comes out in the wash at long wavelengths, low energies,

45:28.960 --> 45:34.000
things like that, like many other things do, but maybe it's actually not a fundamental feature

45:34.000 --> 45:38.560
of the universe. I'm not wedded to that idea, but I think it's absolutely on the table as a

45:38.560 --> 45:41.920
possibility and a very exciting one, both theoretically and experimentally.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.480
I've written this book as though we're sure about Galileo's principle of relativity. But of

45:50.480 --> 45:55.520
course, there are no principles about which we are sure. They're always subject to experimental

45:56.240 --> 46:02.400
verification at more and more precise levels as our technology improves. And it's always possible

46:02.400 --> 46:10.640
that something we have held as almost certainly true for hundreds of years may fall apart at some

46:10.640 --> 46:15.680
point, just as Newton's law of gravity did after more than 200 years. So we have to be humble about

46:15.680 --> 46:23.200
what we do and don't understand. But there is also the possibility that even the notion of space

46:23.760 --> 46:30.800
is an approximation to something far stranger. And those people who think about quantum of gravity

46:32.480 --> 46:39.280
along certain modern lines face that because we have found equations that not necessarily the

46:39.280 --> 46:46.000
equations that describe our universe, but we have found equations in which space is an epiphenomenon,

46:46.000 --> 46:52.560
an emergent concept. And the basic thing you start with is just a very large collection of

46:52.560 --> 46:59.760
objects that don't have any notion of space at all. So we know there's a lot we don't know,

46:59.760 --> 47:06.160
and any particular way of looking at the world that we have now has to be viewed as a

47:06.160 --> 47:10.560
progress report, a very successful progress report at the moment, but one which has plenty of holes

47:10.560 --> 47:17.200
in it that could turn out to be quite large in the end. Good. But this question of the realness

47:17.200 --> 47:22.800
of space, the thinginess of space, I don't know if you know, do you know about the Clark Leibniz

47:22.800 --> 47:27.680
correspondence? Have you heard these words before? Yes. You and I have spoken about this,

47:27.680 --> 47:31.520
and I recall it. Clark, you read about that in my book because you are a reader. Leibniz and

47:31.520 --> 47:36.320
Newton arguing for Clark, yes. Is space relational or a substantive title? Is it a thing or is it

47:36.320 --> 47:42.080
just a collection of relations? And we still don't know. Like in Einstein's world, it was a substance,

47:42.080 --> 47:47.760
but maybe we're post-Einstein now. But another fact to keep in the back of our minds when we're

47:47.760 --> 47:55.200
contemplating that question is that space isn't really empty or it's not featureless anyway,

47:55.200 --> 48:00.960
because it's filled with all of these fields like the electromagnetic field. So you do a great

48:00.960 --> 48:05.520
job in your book talking about what a field is, the idea of the fundamentality of fields,

48:05.520 --> 48:09.440
which is very bizarre to people. They always want to know what the fields are made of,

48:09.440 --> 48:13.120
and I gotta say, no, no, no. The things are made of fields, not the other way around.

48:16.480 --> 48:22.320
Part of the problem with talking about fields and what they are is that fundamentally we don't

48:22.320 --> 48:28.000
know. It's always harder to explain something you don't really understand. We understand what

48:28.000 --> 48:34.080
fields do with remarkable precision in many cases. We have math that describes what they

48:34.080 --> 48:38.640
will do in all sorts of circumstances we can predict, all sorts of wonderful details,

48:38.640 --> 48:42.640
but just because you can predict what something does doesn't mean you really understand fundamentally

48:42.640 --> 48:50.320
what it is. An analogy I like to use that I think is reflective of the right way to think about

48:50.320 --> 48:56.960
fields is that if you think about the atmosphere, just think about the air of the earth. It has all

48:56.960 --> 49:04.560
sorts of features that you can measure. It has pressure, it has temperature, it has wind, wind

49:04.560 --> 49:10.000
meaning how fast it's flowing in a particular location, and these things, pressure, temperature,

49:10.000 --> 49:14.240
wind, humidity, these are properties of the air that you can measure anywhere. There's some machine

49:14.240 --> 49:21.600
you can use for measuring the wind speed and direction, etc. But imagine that you didn't

49:21.600 --> 49:27.600
know what air was, and all you had was these measuring devices. You could measure this thing

49:27.600 --> 49:31.840
which you call pressure, but you don't have the conception that it is literally the pressure of

49:31.840 --> 49:36.560
a gas. You just call it P, and you measure this thing called T, it's temperature, but you don't

49:36.560 --> 49:41.760
know that, and something called W which is wind, but you don't know that. You have these things

49:41.760 --> 49:46.720
you can measure, and you can figure out equations which describe how they work,

49:47.360 --> 49:52.240
and you can even predict the weather if you're clever enough to figure out the right equations,

49:52.240 --> 49:56.240
because the equations stand on their own. They tell you how these things you can measure change

49:56.240 --> 50:04.640
over time and how they relate to each other, but if you don't know what air is, or even

50:04.640 --> 50:10.000
necessarily that it exists, then you don't know what pressure, how to think about pressure. You

50:10.000 --> 50:15.840
don't know what property of air it's referring to, and since you don't even know what air is,

50:15.840 --> 50:22.080
you can't even sort of talk about what property it might be. And this may be our situation with

50:22.080 --> 50:26.560
the fields of the universe, where the vast majority of the fields, with one interesting

50:26.560 --> 50:31.760
exception that I'll come back to, they seem to be properties of the universe the way pressure

50:31.760 --> 50:38.000
is a property of air. That might be the right way to think about them, but we have no idea which

50:38.000 --> 50:42.240
properties, and we have no idea what the substance of the universe is, and the one interesting

50:42.240 --> 50:47.600
exception is gravity, which is ironic, because in many ways gravity is the one we understand the

50:47.600 --> 50:55.040
least from the point of view of quantum physics, but in the case of gravity, the gravitational field

50:55.040 --> 51:01.440
is telling you about the property of space, which we call curvature, the degree to which it's worked.

51:02.000 --> 51:11.840
So it is possible that the electromagnetic field is telling us some property of space and time

51:11.840 --> 51:18.560
that is not obvious, some sort of hidden property that we have yet to learn. In string theory,

51:18.560 --> 51:25.120
for example, that's a common situation, not to say anything pro or con against string theory,

51:25.120 --> 51:32.480
but it is an example of a context in which the luminiferous ether does exist, it's a part of

51:32.480 --> 51:42.480
spacetime, and so it may be that this notion that space and time are a substance that has many

51:42.480 --> 51:47.680
properties and those properties are the fields of nature, that may be a perspective which

51:47.680 --> 51:52.880
is at least useful and maybe even somewhat fundamental, but we still have to deal with

51:52.880 --> 51:56.160
the fact that space is very strange because you can't measure your motion with respect to it,

51:56.160 --> 51:59.200
so if it's like a material, it's not like anything we've ever seen.

51:59.840 --> 52:05.520
I just want to be sure, because the audience has different levels of understanding here,

52:05.520 --> 52:11.040
if we put aside for the moment our desires to be super duper careful and clear and correct,

52:11.760 --> 52:12.560
what is a field?

52:13.360 --> 52:22.320
A field is something that is found, well, let me back up one step. A cosmic field,

52:22.320 --> 52:26.960
the field of the cosmos, is something that can be measured anywhere in the universe.

52:28.320 --> 52:34.960
It's some sort of property which has the feature that if you change it in one place,

52:35.920 --> 52:42.400
it has effects in other places in the future. In some sense, that's the most important

52:42.960 --> 52:47.520
aspect of what a field is. It's something which is everywhere, and it's not just

52:47.520 --> 52:53.200
randomly everywhere, it has this feature that it's somehow what you do at point A

52:53.200 --> 53:00.560
affects later what happens at point B and vice versa. So in the context of air as an analogy,

53:00.560 --> 53:08.000
the fields of air are found everywhere in the air, and if you change the wind in one place,

53:08.000 --> 53:11.440
it's going to cause the wind to change somewhere else, and in fact, that's what weather prediction

53:11.440 --> 53:17.120
is all about. It's about saying, okay, I know what the fields of air are today. I know what the

53:17.120 --> 53:23.200
pressure and the temperature and the wind are right now. Can I predict in the future what they

53:23.200 --> 53:30.080
will be? And the fact that the future depends in such detail on the past, and not just on the past

53:30.080 --> 53:36.320
at my current location, but on the past at all locations nearby, and the further back in time

53:36.320 --> 53:42.720
I go for my predictions, the more of these fields I need to know and further, further distances,

53:42.720 --> 53:46.080
this is what's characteristic of a field. So if you think about weather prediction

53:46.080 --> 53:51.840
and about the properties of the air and how they affect each other, and now you extend that to

53:51.840 --> 53:57.280
properties of the universe, now you're thinking about fields, I think, in a sensible way.

53:57.280 --> 54:03.840
Okay, that's very good. And if we were to add quantum mechanics to the mix, there's this wonderful

54:03.840 --> 54:09.280
fact that, and we don't need to talk about many worlds or measurement problem, that's okay,

54:09.280 --> 54:13.920
that's a different podcast, but we should talk about the fact that when you quantize a field,

54:13.920 --> 54:18.640
when you take fields and put them into your quantum mechanical brain, out pop particles.

54:18.640 --> 54:21.760
I don't know if you want to just take that for granted right now, or do you have a favorite

54:21.760 --> 54:28.480
way of thinking about that remarkable fact? Well, I think it's useful maybe to step back a moment.

54:28.480 --> 54:35.360
Obviously, the purpose of, I should say something about the reason why the book that I've just

54:35.360 --> 54:41.600
written is called Waves in an Impossible Sea. We've just been talking about the sea, that's the

54:41.600 --> 54:45.120
universe, and we've been talking about why it's impossible because it has these very strange

54:45.840 --> 54:50.640
features that it both seems to be there and seems not to be there, depending on what question you

54:50.640 --> 54:59.680
ask. But then there are the waves, and the reason to talk about waves is that fundamentally,

55:00.400 --> 55:06.960
the things we call elementary particles, electrons, quarks, photons, they are

55:08.800 --> 55:14.640
in the language of quantum field theory more wave-like than particle-like. And

55:15.920 --> 55:20.240
to understand what that means requires dealing with the fact that there's a history

55:20.240 --> 55:26.080
to the notion that electrons are both particles and waves. That's a trope that comes out of the

55:26.080 --> 55:32.960
1920s and 30s, but it's one that got modified over the decades and in ways that aren't always

55:33.600 --> 55:41.520
made explicit. It's a mess. And the word particle and the word field are again misleading in how

55:41.520 --> 55:50.160
we use them compared to how they're used in daily English. And so one has to really take a moment

55:50.160 --> 55:59.680
to just parcel that. So with that preamble, let me please start. So when we talk about particle

55:59.680 --> 56:06.080
in ordinary English, we always mean something like a grain of sand or a dust particle. Something

56:06.080 --> 56:12.720
that's like a little ball, maybe irregular shaped, but it's this little thing that moves

56:12.720 --> 56:19.760
around on some path. And when people first discovered electrons, that's what they thought

56:19.760 --> 56:24.080
they were. So they called them particles. And when it turned out that's not what they were,

56:24.080 --> 56:32.000
they still called them particles. So we often face this problem in science and science communication

56:32.000 --> 56:40.160
that things are named before they are understood. And very rarely are they renamed

56:41.040 --> 56:47.120
once it becomes clear what's actually going on. Very true. That's a problem. So there's that

56:47.120 --> 56:50.400
problem. We have to first take the word particle and understand that we're not going to use it the

56:50.400 --> 56:58.640
way our English conception of particle is used in ordinary language. And then wave is a problem too.

56:59.520 --> 57:06.400
When we say light is a wave, we do not mean that light is like a wave breaking at the beach.

57:07.440 --> 57:12.640
At the beach, we mean here comes a big wave. What we mean is here is a high point in the water

57:13.200 --> 57:18.320
separated from the next high point by a low point behind it and a low point in front of it.

57:19.440 --> 57:25.840
Whereas when we talk about sound waves coming from a musical instrument or from somebody's voice,

57:25.840 --> 57:32.080
or we talk about light waves coming from a light bulb, we're talking about a long sequence of high

57:32.080 --> 57:38.240
and low points, a long sequence of wave crests and wave troughs, which we often call in ordinary

57:38.240 --> 57:43.440
English, if we were at the beach, we would call it a wave set or a series of waves. So what we mean

57:43.440 --> 57:50.640
by wave singular in physics may have many crests and troughs, which is not the way we would talk

57:50.640 --> 57:56.880
about things at the beach. So that's important because when we say light is made from particles,

57:57.760 --> 58:02.960
don't want you to think about the individual particles as being individual crests in a

58:02.960 --> 58:14.240
wave train. That's the wrong picture. Okay, I won't. So now how do we understand that we are made

58:14.240 --> 58:20.960
from waves? This is a very strange thing. Again, it's such a strange thing that it took people

58:20.960 --> 58:26.480
a long time to make sense of it because we from ordinary life have a lot of intuition about waves

58:27.360 --> 58:33.600
and we have all seen houses made of bricks and made from stones and made from concrete,

58:33.600 --> 58:38.960
but you have never seen a house made from sound waves, you've never seen a house made from earthquake

58:38.960 --> 58:46.240
waves. Waves are not things that we think of as objects from which you can make structured

58:46.240 --> 58:56.080
objects that will stay together and stay organized for centuries. And so the idea that we and the

58:56.080 --> 59:02.000
walls and the table and so forth are made from waves requires already some sort of conceptual

59:02.000 --> 59:09.760
leap. And the conceptual leap is that, and again it's due to Einstein, although not in a single step,

59:10.640 --> 59:16.720
is that even the waves of light, which are definitely waves in the sense that they are

59:18.000 --> 59:22.480
there are crests and troughs, these things have a frequency and a wavelength just like

59:22.480 --> 59:30.960
sound waves do, nevertheless, they are made from, well, we call them particles, let's not call them

59:30.960 --> 59:36.000
particles, let's just say they're made from things, we'll call them photons, and now let's figure out

59:36.000 --> 59:43.600
what they are. And so the way I like to talk about this that I think is useful is that we have many

59:43.600 --> 59:50.720
examples of objects that we know are kind of granular or particulate, but not in the sense

59:50.720 --> 59:55.520
that they're made from particles per se. So yes, if you go to a beach, it looks continuous, but if

59:55.520 --> 59:59.440
you look closely, there's all sorts of sand grains that make it up. In that case, the objects are

59:59.440 --> 01:00:07.120
really particles of sand. But if you take a giant pile of spaghetti, dried spaghetti before you cook

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:11.680
it, well, if you look at it from far enough away, it just looks like a giant pile, but if you go in

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:16.400
there and dig around, you realize there's lots of individual strands of spaghetti there, or if you

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:21.120
take a giant stack of paper, you've never seen one before, it may not be obvious to you whether

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.160
it's continuous or discrete, whether it's what it's made of, but if you start taking it apart,

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:33.440
you will very quickly realize it's made from sheets of paper. And so when we look at a laser beam,

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:39.760
it is not obvious to us that it isn't a continuous thing. And then in fact, it's made

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:47.440
from individual strands, in a sense. The way a rope is made from individual strands of twine,

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:54.080
it's not that it's made literally from particle-like objects, but it can be disassembled

01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:00.800
into individual pieces. And those pieces of a light wave, again, they're not individual crests

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:08.400
and troughs. Each one of them is a series of crests and troughs. And we call those things photons.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:17.120
So photons are waves, but they are particulate. They cannot be divided into smaller pieces.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And they are the things out of which more dramatic waves, like those in a laser beam,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.520
are constructed. And this is far from obvious, just as it would not be obvious to a person

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:33.280
seeing a rope for the first time, that you could disassemble the rope into individual strands.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:42.080
And that's why people before the 20th century didn't have,

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:47.840
it wasn't obvious to people before the 20th century that this was true. You needed the technology

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.200
and you also needed the right set of experiments to give you a clue that this is something that

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:57.520
might be the case. And this is a specifically quantum mechanical aspect of light. Maxwell's

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:02.480
equations did a perfectly good job of talking about light waves in a classical way. And this

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.240
photon language only becomes relevant once quantum mechanics comes on the scene.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:12.640
In a way, you can say it's the definition of the first aspect of quantum physics.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:19.200
The statement that light is made from photons is a more general statement that there are large

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.840
classes of waves in our universe, and in particular, all of the waves of the elementary

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:29.520
fields of the universe are made from these individual pieces, which are called, generally,

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.600
quanta. That's where the word quantum initially comes from historically,

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.640
is Einstein trying to suggest that light is made from these individual strands or packets,

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:46.640
or whatever you want to call them. And it was only 15 to 20 years later that people gave these

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:52.640
bits of light the name photon. And even five years after that, that they realized that there

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:59.920
was an analogy between photons and electrons, that electrons were not actually these dot-like

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:04.960
particles, the ones we draw in the cartoon of atoms, but they're more like photons. They have

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:11.920
wave-like properties. They are particulate waves rather than being particles in the English sense.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:19.120
And so this is really the language of quantum field theory that comes out of the 1950s.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:26.000
And it's different from the language of the quantum mechanics physicists of the 1920s and 30s,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.800
whose famous statements such as an electron is both a wave and a particle, or sometimes it's a

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.600
wave, and sometimes it's a particle. That's a language which Niels Bohr popularized,

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:44.880
but it was left in historical dust as far as the math. And yet, it maintained a life of its own

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:51.040
in the culture. So most people who teach quantum physics still use this language

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.080
when they teach quantum mechanics to juniors in college. And it certainly has survived in most of

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:05.520
the popular science books. So that causes a lot of confusion. And that's one of the reasons why

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:12.640
in my book I spent a whole chapter trying to make this really clear, that we don't think about an

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:18.720
electron as a dot. And in fact, you can't understand its most critical properties, such as the fact

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:26.560
that it has mass, if you think of it as a dot. Because if it's really a dot, and it's really

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:31.840
true that E equals mc squared, and therefore the mass of the electron has something to do with the

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:38.400
energy that it carries with it, when it's stationary, well, why would a stationary dot have energy,

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:44.960
especially if it's really a point-like object in some sense? Where would that energy be?

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:51.520
But when you understand that an electron, even an electron that is stationary, is a wave-like

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:58.080
object, and like the wave on a guitar string, it is vibrating and is sitting in place. It's not

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:03.840
going anywhere. But nevertheless, there is vibration associated with it. Then you understand, ah,

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:11.280
there's energy associated with the vibration. And that's where the mass comes from. And if you

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:17.040
thought of an electron as a dot just sitting there, instead of thinking of it as a wave that's

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:22.560
vibrating, you have no way into this idea. And that's why it's so important that in quantum field

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:27.680
theory, we do not think about electrons as dots. And we do have an understanding of what their mass

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:33.520
is associated with. Not to mention the fact that, at least at face value, a dot-like electron would

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.960
collapse to be a black hole. Well, there is that problem too, but you know,

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:48.320
I think it's useful to understand that this particular problem is independent of gravity.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:54.240
And would be there even in the absence of gravity. So while it's certainly true that point-like

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:59.280
objects without some sort of wave-like structure have all sorts of conceptual issues associated

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:05.120
with them, there's an independent sort of conceptual problem, which is that if you carry

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:10.000
this notion of a dot-like electron with you too far, even if you take Bohr seriously, that some

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.920
of the time it's like a particle and some of the time it's like a wave, you've lost the fact that

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:20.880
its wave-like property, the fact that it's a vibrating object, is essential in its existence.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:29.280
And its basic properties, such as its mass, simply are not explicable if you somehow try

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:34.800
to make that point-like object work in your head. It doesn't work. And we see this in these

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.560
fundamental properties of electrons and all the other elementary particles too.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:45.040
For the listeners who have followed us this far into the podcast, we're allowed to get a little

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:52.400
more technical and wild here. So I'm going to fearlessly ask you about the difference between

01:06:52.400 --> 01:07:00.880
electron fields and photon fields. We have our fermions and our bosons, and they're fundamentally

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:06.720
different kinds of fields, and that contributes to why, conceptually, we tend to think of

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:11.280
matter and light as two different kinds of things.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:18.720
Right. And of course, you and I have, well, the word matter is another one of those words that

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.720
is really problematic. So let's be a little clearer.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.440
I'm just throwing it out just so because I know you'll get a rise out of here.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:30.480
Yeah. You went there, the target was right on. But let's just talk about atoms and light.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:41.760
And there is this, as you said, this remarkable feature of our world that is not to be taken

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:47.840
for granted. You have to work out in mathematics of quantum fields to show that there's only two

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:53.600
types of fields. Or rather, you can divide all of the fields that could possibly be part of our

01:07:53.600 --> 01:08:00.240
cosmos into two classes. One of those classes is called bosonic fields. The other class is called

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:10.400
fermionic fields. The particles, that is to say, the waves that are the minimal waves that you

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:16.000
can have in the electromagnetic field that we call photons, they are bosons. Then there is an

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.080
electron field, not to be confused with the electric field. There is an electron field,

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:29.120
that is fermionic, and it's minimal waves of what we call electrons. And all of the different

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:34.160
elementary particles of nature can be understood. Each one is a wave of a particular field, and

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:38.640
each field has to be either bosonic or fermionic, and each particle has to either be a boson or

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:45.440
fermion. Now, what's the key difference? The key difference, we already learned some of it in

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:52.960
undergraduate chemistry. Electrons cannot do the same thing at the same time. No two electrons can

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:59.200
do identical things. This is known as the Pauli exclusion principle, and it was discovered as

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:06.800
people tried to understand the properties of atoms back in the 1920s. And the whole structure of atoms

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:13.040
would be completely different if electrons were bosons, because bosons don't have an exclusion

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:18.240
principle. In fact, they are perfectly happy to do exactly the same thing, and that's why lasers can

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:25.520
be made out of photons. So you couldn't make atoms like ours if electrons were bosons instead of

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:33.200
fermions, and you couldn't make lasers out of light if light was made from fermions. So these are

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:40.240
very obvious differences, but the degree to which they affect our macroscopic experience

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:47.200
is a little less obvious. And so one of the remarkable things is that if electrons were

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:55.680
bosons, not only would atomic structure be very different, but if you tried now to pile a large

01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:03.360
number of atoms together, instead of forming crystals or blocky structures that you could make

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.840
tables and microphones and people out of, they would just sort of collapse in on themselves.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:18.240
And so the very basics of the macroscopic world depend on the fact that electrons are fermions,

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:23.280
but they also depend on something else, because the powerly exclusion principle would not apply

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:34.800
if electrons weren't literally identical. And why are electrons literally identical? Well,

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:41.200
that is one of the key predictions of quantum field theory. If electrons were just dots,

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:49.040
we would have no idea why they are identical, but they are waves in a field, and it's the same field,

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:56.000
right? There's just one electron field, and the minimal wave in an electron field is an electron,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.120
and it doesn't matter where you make it, it doesn't matter when you make it, it doesn't matter how

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:04.720
long it's been around for, it remains a minimal wave of the electron field, and so any two electrons

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:09.360
they're the same type of thing, they are literally identical, and because of that the

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:14.000
powerly exclusion principle can apply to them, and because of that our world can have macroscopic

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:20.560
objects in it that don't collapse. And it's really important and fascinating to me in the context

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:25.840
of quantum field theory that you have your electrons, you have your electromagnetic field,

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:32.800
but there's not an infinite variety of possible kinds of fields, right? There's a kind of a tiny

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:39.600
handful, and essentially almost all the ones that we think are possible are there between gravity

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:45.840
and Higgs, and electromagnetism, and other forest fields, and electrons and so forth. Like,

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:53.120
it's a really limited set to draw from. Well, this is an interesting feature of the

01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:01.360
discoveries that physicists on the theoretical side and mathematical physicists have made about

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:10.880
how quantum field theory can work. When you go into a subject which has some mathematical content,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:19.280
like physics, you could wonder whether the world that you see is just one example of

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:24.960
possible worlds, maybe there's an enormous number and you're living in just one for some reason,

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:29.120
or you can imagine maybe there's only one possible world that's consistent with quantum field theory,

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:34.240
or with quantum field theory and gravity together, and we live in it because there's

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:39.920
simply no other type of world that you could have. And the reality turns out to be somewhere

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:48.000
in between. It's remarkable how many mathematical constraints there are. When you try to combine

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:57.200
quantum physics and special relativity, that is, say, pre-gravity, and then when you try to combine

01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:02.480
it with gravity as well, you find that the mathematics is somewhat rigid. You can't do

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:08.160
anything you want. You can only do a relatively limited set of things. It's still a very big set,

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:14.960
but it's a lot smaller than you might have thought. And on your point that there's a limited set of

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:20.960
types of fields, that's true with a caveat, which is that this assumes that the fields have

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:28.880
particles either whose mass is zero or their mass has come from a limited set of possibilities.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:37.680
Once you allow for particles that get and get their mass any old way, you have a wider set

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:43.520
of possibilities. But experimentally, we find that all of the particles that we know of so far,

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:52.480
with one exception, their particles either don't have any mass like the photon, or if they do have

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:58.960
mass like the electron, they get it in a very special way. And that's from this strange substance

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.840
called the Higgs field that we started our discussion with. So it is true that once you know

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:08.480
experimentally that there are some limits to the types of fields we find in nature, then you find

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:14.480
that the possibilities are very limited indeed. And so it's some mix of theory and experiment

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:18.880
that tell us that we're in this strangely or maybe not strangely limited situation.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:26.720
Well, let's close the circle here by getting the Higgs boson right, because I think that

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.760
as we discussed with people with the best of intentions, physicists try to explain things,

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:37.840
and they smooth over some rough edges, and they say the Higgs field is responsible for mass.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:44.560
And I get very well intentioned members of the general public saying, well, mass creates gravity.

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:48.640
So without gravity, would there be no Higgs field or is the Higgs responsible for gravity or

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:53.600
something like that? Hopefully, everyone who's been following along with what you've said so far

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.080
knows why that's not right. But let's help them out a little bit. Well, indeed, it's a natural

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:04.320
confusion to have if you think that the Higgs field is responsible for mass. But that is not

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:11.520
correct. In fact, the Higgs field is not responsible for most of your mass. Because protons and

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:17.520
neutrons, which are the majority of the mass in an atom, do not get their mass from the Higgs field.

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:21.760
So we can dispense with that idea. The Higgs field is responsible for the mass of certain

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.640
elementary particles, but it's not responsible for the mass of protons and neutrons. And the story

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.640
of where they get their mass from, okay, I'm afraid that we'll have to leave that for the book.

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:36.240
But we don't have time for that right now. But now there's the question, okay, so electrons

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.800
do get their mass from the Higgs field. So do up quarks and down quarks. And so most of the

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.880
elementary particles that we're made from do get their masses from the Higgs field,

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:49.680
even if the more complicated objects, the protons and neutrons and therefore the atoms do not.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:55.280
So simply because of that, it's clear that the Higgs field and gravity

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.200
can't be directly linked because protons and neutrons have lots of gravity, but they're not

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:04.320
really getting much mass from the Higgs field. So, and there are other reasons which we could

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:11.280
discuss, but let's leave that aside for now. So they're independent ideas. And now the question

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:16.480
comes, well, all right, so we started with this Margaret Thatcher in a room analogy,

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:21.440
where the Higgs field is like a crowd that slows people down as they try to move through it. And

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:27.680
the more well known they are, the harder they have. Okay, well, what's, what's wrong with that

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.280
is partly that it is in conflict with the principle of relativity, and that's pretty bad.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:40.480
But in a way, the broader way in which it's wrong is that it suggests that the Higgs field has to do

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:46.960
with motion, and that it affects the properties of the motion of objects directly.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:54.400
But that's not how it works. And we have to go back a moment and remember that what are, you know,

01:16:54.400 --> 01:17:01.760
what electrons are electrons are waves in the electron field. And the Higgs field does not,

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:07.760
in some direct sense, give mass to electrons, it does not provide the energy

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:17.600
that an electron carries that gives it mass. What it actually does is it changes the properties

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:25.600
of the electron field. The Higgs field affects other fields. That's the real direct connection.

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:36.240
And the way in which it affects the electron field changes the way that the electron field vibrates.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:42.640
And since electrons are vibrations in the electron field, that changes the properties

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:52.560
of electrons. So it's that more indirect route that is the way that the Higgs field does its thing.

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:58.080
And so really, the fundamental story is not how does the electron, how does the, sorry,

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:02.080
how does the Higgs field affect elementary particles? It's really how does the Higgs field

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:06.720
affect the fields whose waves are elementary particles? And so it's the interactions between

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:14.640
fields, the Higgs field and other fields that is at the fundamental heart of how the Higgs

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:20.800
field is able to affect the world in such a dramatic way. And just to add one side comment

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:26.880
to that, again, to just make sure it's all clear. The big news in 2012 was the discovery of the

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:35.200
Higgs boson, a type of particle. The type of particle is itself a ripple, a minimal wave,

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:41.200
in something. What is it a ripple in? It's a ripple in the Higgs field. So the discovery of

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:47.040
the Higgs particle was really not the big story. It was the means to an end. The discovery of the

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:52.240
Higgs particle proved that there must be a Higgs field because, you know, particles are just

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:57.040
manifestations of ripples of fields. And so the discovery of the Higgs field, that was the big

01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:02.160
deal. The Higgs particle doesn't give mass to anything. And it doesn't affect anything. It's

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:07.120
despite the name God particle that's been given to it. It has essentially no role in the universe

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:12.400
at all. And if you make a Higgs particle, it's gone in a tiny fraction of a second. But the Higgs

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:16.720
field, that's another matter. It's present everywhere in the universe, just like the electromagnetic

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:22.960
field. But it has an additional feature that has allowed it to change the properties of other fields

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:27.840
and thereby the properties of elementary particles on which our lives fundamentally depend.

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:33.120
I'm fond of pointing out that we shouldn't call it the God particle anymore, because now we have

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:40.000
evidence that it exists. It goes over separately with different audiences, depending on who you're

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.760
talking to. But that was very helpful. Good. And I think that we can, you know, actually wind things

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:53.120
up with, this leads us directly to, you know, okay, mass, gravity, etc. You brought up the fact

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:57.920
that one way of thinking about gravity is through the gravitational field, which at the quantum

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:04.160
field theory level, looks like a spin two particle, the graviton. And I know that this is a lot of,

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:10.000
this is definitely an area where people struggle trying to understand what we physicists are

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.240
saying. Because on the one hand, we're saying, gravity is not a force, right? Einstein seemed

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:21.440
to imply that gravity is a feature of space time, not a force. On the other hand, it's a particle

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:28.880
just like the photon is a particle, which makes it seem kind of force like. And on the, well,

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:34.320
I mean, there's many hands we can go down here. But we don't understand gravity at the quantum

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:39.360
level. Is that an obstacle to talking about things like gravitons? Gravitons have never

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.040
been detected. Should we really be sure that they're there? I'm just going to dump all these

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:47.840
questions in your lap and give you 30 seconds to close it out. You get more than 30 seconds,

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:53.840
don't worry, but however long it takes. Well, I think the way to understand what we

01:20:54.880 --> 01:21:00.480
know and don't know about gravity and what we suspect about how it works is really to make

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:07.280
sure that your understanding of electromagnetism and the photon is complete. Because the analogies

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:19.040
are almost exact. The notion that the electric force has to do with the exchange of photons,

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:27.280
this is another phrase that's common in the world of science communication. I hate it,

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.880
because I think it really fundamentally miscommunicates what particles are.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:38.480
And what we learn in first year physics classes that electric forces are associated with the

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:43.760
electric field is still just as true as it was before people invented quantum mechanics. The

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:51.520
electric field does generate the effect that we call electric force. And to try to talk about it

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:56.560
in terms of photons moving back and forth is kind of a math trick and not fundamental from my

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:06.640
perspective to the actual physics. Photons, as we said, are the basic elements out of which

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:13.840
a light wave is constructed. Now, we can import these ideas to gravity, that gravity is caused

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:19.040
by the gravitational field, which itself, in this case, we have some idea of what it might be. It

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:23.040
reflects the curvature. It's the property of spacetime, which we call curvature.

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:31.600
And waves in the gravitational field, we call gravitational waves, just as a laser beam is a

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:36.640
very bright wave of light. The gravitational waves that were recently measured, they are very bright,

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:40.800
even though they are extraordinarily difficult to measure, and they're very dim by human standards.

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:46.240
They're extraordinarily bright by quantum standards. And if you could make a sufficiently dim

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:51.120
gravitational wave, you would discover that it's made from individual gravitons,

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:57.200
just as if you take a laser and make it sufficiently dim, you'll discover that it's made

01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:03.120
from photons. Now, that is still conjecture, but that is the analogy that we make, and we believe

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:09.520
it's likely true. Unfortunately, to test it experimentally is far beyond current technology.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:15.280
But as far as the math goes, that math analogy works just fine. The problems of quantum gravity

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:21.520
do not arise with that analogy. They arise when you try to make sense of the more quantum properties

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:29.440
of spacetime itself. And so that's sort of a more sophisticated application of quantum physics.

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:35.920
There's no problem with imagining gravitons. They can be put into the equations. They can be

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:40.240
calculated. One can even calculate things that they do, like scatter off of objects.

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:47.600
And so we have reason to think that gravitons may exist, but it's always possible that our

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:52.480
understanding of gravity is wrong and that some aspect of it will break down even before we get

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:56.640
to the quantum level. And if that's the case, then the story will be more complicated.

01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:03.040
That's for experiment to decide. I would still argue, maybe disagree, but I would still argue

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:09.920
that there's essentially zero credence we should put on gravitons not existing. Maybe they're not

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:17.600
fundamental, but even in the wind, there's sound waves and we can quantize them to get phonons,

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:23.280
right? I mean, there's going to be something that is the quantum of the gravitational field,

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:29.040
whether it's fundamental or not. Well, this is an interesting physics point that I

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:34.320
am not 100% sure my own understanding is as good as it should be. It's kind of one of those things

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:41.040
which I looked into at some point. It's certainly true that sound waves in a piece of metal

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:48.320
are made out of phonons in the same way that light waves are made from photons.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:59.520
But it is, I think, not the case that there are phonons in air. I think this is true.

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:03.200
This is something where I might be embarrassing myself here. The point is that

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:10.240
when the amplitude gets sufficiently low and you're trying to tell whether the

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:15.280
sound wave is really something you could pull apart, the whole structure of the material starts

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:24.560
to become important. So your ability to describe it as a collective wave breaks down before you

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:32.640
get to the quantum effects. I think it is possible that something similar is true for gravity.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:39.200
And that we will have to change the way we talk about it before we really get to individual

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:43.840
quanta. And that if you try to get to individual quanta, you would discover that there's something

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:49.280
wrong about the way you're thinking of space and time. Now, again, I don't say this with 100%

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:52.160
confidence because I haven't actually worked through the math and tried to understand this

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:56.560
in detail. I do remember reading something of this sort. And so I think both you and I have

01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:00.480
some reading to do to settle this issue. That's always true. And that's very helpful,

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:06.400
because that's a point I hadn't thought about. So that's useful. But maybe tell me if I'm

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:10.800
oversimplifying, but for the people out there who are still trying to get straight on whether

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:16.480
gravity is a force or not, I would say there's a language that says gravity is not a force,

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:22.480
it's the curvature of space time. There's another language that says gravity is a force that follows

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:27.200
the inverse square law, like Isaac Newton said. There's a third language that says gravity can

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:32.480
be thought of as a manifestation of a bunch of spin two particles grouped up into some condensate.

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:38.720
And all of these languages are correct. They're mutually incompatible. You had to choose one

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:44.000
at one time, but they all describe the same underlying phenomenon in slightly different

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:51.520
linguistic choices. Well, this is, I think, this reflects a very important aspect of physics and

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:57.600
mathematics that I view as one of the really important conceptual points that is

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:08.480
poorly understood outside of the experts. But even the experts forget about it. They know it.

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:18.480
And the first time we physicists learn that there's not going to be one unique language

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:25.920
for talking about anything is when we're learning Newtonian physics. Because we first learn everything

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:29.840
that everybody learns in first year of physics, which is that there are forces and there's

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:36.800
accelerations and that's the way you should describe things. And then we learn three entirely

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:43.600
different ways of saying the same thing. Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, Hamilton Jacobi theory, each one of

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:50.480
these is a different way of talking about Newton's laws. And you can prove mathematically that all

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:56.240
the predictions that you will get from these different ways of saying the same thing are identical.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:02.160
Which means that there are multiple conceptual languages based on multiple ways of writing

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:07.680
down the same math, which have exactly the same experimental consequences and cannot be

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:17.600
distinguished by an experiment. So how should we think about this? Math can be written in

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:24.640
different ways. Adding a positive number to a negative number can be thought of a subtraction,

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:29.440
subtracting a positive number from a positive number. So is it addition or is it subtraction?

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:37.760
Well, clearly you could do it either way and if you wanted to base your world on addition

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:42.640
and negative numbers, you could view the world that way. And if you wanted to think about no,

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:45.920
all numbers are positive, but I can do addition or subtraction, that would be a different way to

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:50.720
do it. And there's nothing wrong with either one. But it might change the way you talk.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.440
So the different languages which you described for talking about general relativity,

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:03.520
they are different ways of writing the math or viewing the math that have exactly the same

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:10.320
consequences. And so a professional will use any and all of them whenever a particular one is

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:15.120
convenient, will use that one. If it makes the calculation simpler, we'll use it. And what we

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:21.680
learn is that we should not be too wedded to a particular conceptual viewpoint. We simply can't

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:26.720
be. We can't decide on the basis of experiment which one of these viewpoints is correct, nor

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:32.400
should we try. The math is what we use to make predictions. The language in which we talk about

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.800
the math or the version of the math that we use, as long as they're literally identical in all

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:43.520
predictions, they are simply equivalent and common ways. Just like you can describe a table

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.560
using English or French or German, it doesn't make it any less a table.

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:51.760
I think that's a wonderful lesson to wrap up with. So Matt Straszler, thanks so much for being on

01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:54.800
the Winescape podcast. Thank you very much, Sean.
