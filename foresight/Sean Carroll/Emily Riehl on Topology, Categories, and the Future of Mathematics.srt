Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,200
We've done a lot of sort of science on the podcast over the years, as it were. The podcast is old

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,200
enough, I can now say over the years. Wow, that's pretty impressive. And doing science, when you

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,480
try to talk about science to an audience, which is not necessarily full of specialists in that

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,640
particular kind of science, what do you do? How do you talk about science to non-scientists? Well,

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,680
the very first thing you do is you strip out all the math, right? You assume that the people

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,560
listening are not necessarily familiar with the equations, the symbols, the manipulations that

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,840
the professional scientists have to go through to understand their field. But you can nevertheless,

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,160
even without the math, you can talk about the concepts that the scientists are dealing with.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,120
This raises a puzzle when the thing you want to talk about is math. We haven't talked about math

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,400
as a pure subject that much here on Mindscape. We did talk to Steven Strogatz, who's a professional

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,920
mathematician, but he's very close to being a physicist in many ways. We haven't quite ascended

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,560
to the truly abstract realms of very pure mathematics. So that's what we're doing here today.

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,320
Pure mathematics, no equations, but we're going to try to talk about the concepts that you come

15
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,160
across at the most elevated realms of mathematical thought. Our guest today is Emily Reel, who is

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,160
a topologist at Johns Hopkins, and she's a very big believer in being able to conceptualize these

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,160
deep mathematical ideas in the simplest and best way possible. So she's a great person to guide us

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,120
on this tour. And the foundational idea we're going to be talking about is topology.

19
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,960
Topology is the study of the properties of mathematical spaces that are invariant when

20
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,040
you smush them, when you smoothly deform them a little bit, right? Like if you have some clay

21
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,320
that is molded into a shape, you can talk about the number of holes in the shape of clay that you

22
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,280
have. And then if you move around the clay a little bit, if you don't rip it, the number of holes will

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,440
remain constant. So that's a topological invariant. It turns out, and this is where the fun part comes,

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:12,240
that as a mathematician you want to say, okay, what do we mean by characterizing the qualities

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,080
of a mathematical space that are invariant under smooth deformations? Well, you can count the

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,240
holes. You can also say, well, how many times can I make a path that wraps around the holes in

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,680
this particular system? Those kinds of structures turn out to be numbers or transformations or

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,160
other things that we can add together and multiply together. And we build these mathematical algebraic

29
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,320
structures by asking the question, how do we topologically characterize these kinds of spaces?

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,400
So we're led from topology into algebra. And Emily's going to take us there. We're going to discuss

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,480
things like homotopy, groups, rings, group oids, all these words that you're not supposed to have

32
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,600
necessarily been familiar with already. We're going to discuss them. And by the end, we're getting

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,960
into what is called category theory. Category theory is something where even the other mathematicians

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,960
go, oh, no, that's too abstract for me. Category theory is sort of a general theory of spaces and

35
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,560
structures and maps between them. It provides a different way of thinking about mathematics as a

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,000
whole. So I'm a big believer that, you know, math, just like physics, is part of the general

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,280
intellectual conversation we should be having. There should be history and economics and math

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,880
and physics. And it would be a mistake to exclude math from this overall intellectual discourse.

39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,920
And I think this conversation is a good example of how we can do it. You know, thinking like a

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,640
mathematician gives you new handles on the world just like thinking like a physicist does. And

41
00:03:44,640 --> 00:04:06,080
so I think it's going to be fun. Let's go. Emily Reel, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.

42
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,320
Thank you. You know, I know that as a physicist, as a theoretical physicist,

43
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,840
who thinks about the universe and the many worlds of quantum mechanics and so forth,

44
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,040
I'm often asked, like, what is the point of this? You know, are you making a better cell

45
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,280
phone or are you carrying cancer? Like, why are you doing this? And I have my own answers. But

46
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,240
as a mathematician who works on topology category, things like that, you must also

47
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,680
get this. So what is your, do you have a favorite answer to that kind of question?

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,320
Sure. I mean, my dad loves to ask me what the practical applications are about the math I

49
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,360
love to think about. And I think he knows that he's kind of needling me because, you know,

50
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,240
that's just, it's just not the point for all mathematicians. I mean, for some, of course,

51
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,360
it is, you know, there are very important uses of mathematics to make the world a better place.

52
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,280
But I guess a way that mathematics can make the world a better place is by making it a

53
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,280
more interesting place to be a conscious being. And that's how I, or that's what inspires me

54
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,360
to be a mathematician. Yeah. Good. No, I think I, I'm not going to say that's the right answer,

55
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,120
because like you say, different people have different answers, but that's analogous to my

56
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,120
answer. And people ask me about looking for the Higgs boson. And so many of my physics friends

57
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,320
will say like, well, it might someday inspire a new technological something. I'm like, no,

58
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,160
number one, no, it won't. And number two, that's not why we're doing it. We're doing it because

59
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,680
we want to find out what's going on. And if there's an application someday, that'll be a benefit.

60
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,600
The other preliminary question I wanted to ask, I just had a podcast episode a couple of weeks ago

61
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,840
about the philosophy of mathematics. And, you know, there's realism versus non realism,

62
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,400
Platonism versus, I don't know, anti-platonism. I'm told that most working mathematicians are

63
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,320
Platonists. They think of what they study as, in some sense, real. Do you, do you know or care

64
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,480
or have a take on that debate? I certainly don't know as much about it as some of your other

65
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:09,840
guests, but I agree with that instinct. I mean, the things that I think about and I dream about

66
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,720
and I talk about with my friends feel very real to me. And, you know, I don't expect that I'll

67
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,840
kind of trip over one on my walk to campus, but, you know, they feel as real to me as,

68
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,360
I mean, as anything else. I mean, I guess as I understand it, that, you know, a table that

69
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,840
seems like a solid real thing is not really real either. So, yes, I subscribe to Platonism.

70
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,800
Well, yeah, I mean, there's certainly some structure to math, right? Like we all agree,

71
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,520
given the axioms, where we go and so forth. So there's something there. I actually don't have

72
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,040
a strong opinion one way or the other. That's why I'm quizzing people these days. But

73
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,320
actually, I mean, there's a philosophy of mathematics that's maybe a little closer to

74
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,000
the point of view of category theory, which we'll get into later on, which goes by the name of

75
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,120
structuralism, which says that, you know, what a mathematical object really is, is determined by

76
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:11,920
the role that it plays within mathematics. So, for example, you know, you could ask,

77
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:19,040
what are the natural numbers, you know, zero, one, two, three, four, five, and a role that

78
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,520
the natural numbers play within mathematics, I could give it a fancy name, I could say they're

79
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,760
the kind of universal discrete dynamical system. But essentially what that means is,

80
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,120
you know, natural numbers are something you can recursively define functions on. If you have,

81
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,920
if you're trying to define a, you know, sort of a sequence of points or a sequence of real numbers,

82
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,120
what you, a strategy, you know, Fibonacci sequence, for instance, is a famous sequence,

83
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,480
one, one, two, three, five, eight, 13, 21, 34. The relative terms converge to the golden ratio,

84
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,720
there's a lot of fun properties in Fibonacci, but a strategy for defining a sequence

85
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,440
is you define the first term in the sequence, or maybe the first few terms, and then you give

86
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,640
formula or a strategy for producing the next term in the sequence from the terms you have

87
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:19,120
previously. And the fact that recursion is possible is telling us something very deep

88
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,280
about the role that natural numbers play in mathematics. And so I guess I'm of the point

89
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,800
of view of like, that's what the natural numbers are. They are sort of the thing that you can

90
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,200
recursively define functions on. How, quite how that fits with Platonism isn't entirely clear to me,

91
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,600
but yeah, I don't know, me neither. I did have a guest a while ago, James Ladiman, who's a philosopher,

92
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,040
who says the same thing about physics. He is a structural realist. He thinks that what really

93
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,680
matters are the different structures, not the objects that we attribute these structures to,

94
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,640
relating between. I don't, great. It sounds like he's a category theorist. So it could be.

95
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,800
Aren't we all a category theorist? We're moving in that direction. So we will get to there. But

96
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,720
I think that you had, as we were talking about what to discuss here, I think you had a strategy

97
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,480
that makes perfect sense of starting with topology, because topology is something everyone has heard

98
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,400
of, right? I mean, why don't I, rather than trying to guess, why don't you tell us what you think

99
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:21,680
the definition of topology is that we could all get our hands on? Great. So topology is the study

100
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,520
of spaces, both, you know, kind of physical geometrical spaces that we move in in the world,

101
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:34,240
but also spaces that you might imagine that, you know, have some resemblance to, you know,

102
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,840
Euclidean space, three dimensions, two dimensions, one dimension, but are somehow more exotic.

103
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:49,520
So a topological space could be, you know, for instance, the points on a plane is an example

104
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,280
of a topological space, or you can imagine the points that are on the surface of a sphere,

105
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,480
so the surface of a soccer ball, surface of the earth, or you can imagine the points that are

106
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,960
on the surface of a donut. You can imagine that you're an ant that sort of walks around a donut

107
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:13,120
and all the different configurations that ant could be in those describe points in a topological

108
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:20,160
space, and then you can start to compare what those worlds are like. Topology is a realm to do

109
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,520
that. Can I just ask very quickly, when mathematicians use the word space, obviously it doesn't

110
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,600
simply mean the three-dimensional space in which we live. What's the difference between space and set?

111
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:38,160
Right. So if I wanted to define a topological space formally in mathematics, I would start with a set

112
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:47,120
of points. So if I wanted to describe three-dimensional Euclidean space, I would start with the set

113
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,640
of points which are determined by three real coordinates, sort of a distance along the x-axis,

114
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,400
a distance along the y-axis, a distance along the z-axis. So that's a set of points. We can

115
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,680
think of them as the points in three-dimensional space. But then what turns a set into a topological

116
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,680
space is also a way to understand distances between points, or more generally understand when

117
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,920
points are nearby and when points are far apart. So that could be a function that tells you how

118
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,520
to compute the distance between two points. That's a metric space, which is an important type of

119
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,480
topological space, or there's a more abstract way to get at the same thing in the absence of a formula

120
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:35,760
for distances. Okay. And so a line is a space, a circle is a space, a sphere. So for mathematicians,

121
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,520
the sphere is just the surface of the sphere, right? It's not the interior. Like you said, the

122
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,600
two-dimensional sphere is the surface of the ball. And then you could have like a 100-dimensional

123
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,000
sphere or whatever. So there's a lot of spaces we have to play with. You can have Mobius bands. So

124
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:58,320
that's a space that's kind of like a cylinder. So it's like a toilet paper tube. But imagine you

125
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,800
cut the toilet paper tube sort of long ways from end to end. So now you have just a flat

126
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,960
strip, and then you twist it and then glue it back together. So that is also a space. It's

127
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:20,720
quite similar to the cylinder, but it's a non-orientable space. It's confusing in a Mobius

128
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,920
strip, whether you're on the inside or the outside. There's no way to decide that. Whereas on, you

129
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,440
know, the toilet paper tube, there's the outside where the toilet paper goes around, and then

130
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,240
there's the inside, which you sort of put on the roll, on the holder. Do you have one of those

131
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,840
Klein bottle sculptures? I have a Klein bottle sculpture. I don't, but right. So a Klein bottle

132
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,400
is a one-dimension higher version of this. And what's interesting about the Klein bottle is,

133
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,720
well, so it's a surface. It's kind of like the surface of a sphere. Let me describe how you

134
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:04,480
would build a Klein bottle. So you can start with a flat sheet of paper. You would glue two sides

135
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:12,000
of the paper together. So you're forming now a toilet paper tube. And then, so from there, kind of

136
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,760
a simpler construction that isn't the Klein bottle, as you could just sort of stretch the toilet paper

137
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,720
tube and glue the end circles together. And if you did that, you would get a surface of a doughnut

138
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,360
shape. So that's familiar. The torus. We can use the word torus. It's okay. Okay, we can use the

139
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,320
word torus. So if I want to get a Klein bottle, it's the same idea. I'm going to glue the two ends

140
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,680
of the toilet paper tube together, glue those two circular ends together. But I want to twist

141
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,520
the one. So if I'm gluing, if I'm walking around, when I glue them together, I'm sort of zipping up

142
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,440
the, going counterclockwise around one of the circles and clockwise around the other circle.

143
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,000
But I want to reverse the orientation on one of the circles before doing this. Now, you can't do

144
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
this in three-dimensional space. So if we were in a fourth dimension, you could actually embed a Klein

145
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,880
bottle into four-dimensional space and do this construction. But there are, there are these

146
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,280
toys that you should, you should just, everyone should just Google and there are these toy glass

147
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:17,040
versions. And what's fun about it is there's some ambiguity between what space is inside of a Klein

148
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,600
bottle and what is outside. So if you, you have a torus, like a glass doughnut, you could sort of

149
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,640
fill it with jelly. And the jelly is inside the torus. It's not outside, you know, until you bite

150
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,560
it, you're not going to get jelly everywhere. But if you have one of these Klein bottles,

151
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,160
you could try and put, you know, jelly or let's say Kool-Aid inside the Klein bottle. And if you're

152
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,640
not careful, if you sort of flip it upside down and flip it right side up again, it's going to get

153
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,400
all over your, your chest because there's no inside and outside. Yeah. And this is the stock and trade

154
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,480
of topologists, right? So you don't care so much about the individual bumps and wiggles like geometry

155
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,840
cares about. Topology is more loosey-goosey in what it cares about. Exactly. Yeah. Very loosey-goosey.

156
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,440
And so, but the, the other thing to get on the table, I guess, is that there are topological

157
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,960
spaces that we care about. Well, maybe they're inspired by real physical situations, but you

158
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,920
might think that, well, physical space is three dimensional and we can have subsets of that.

159
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,720
Therefore, you know, there's some topological spaces to think about, but not that many. But as

160
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,880
you point out, like there are complicated situations where the space of all possible

161
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,080
configurations of something is an interesting topological space. Yeah, totally. So, I mean,

162
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,840
one of my favorite sources of examples of topological spaces are something called configuration

163
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,080
spaces. And these come up in robotics. They come up in physics where they might be called

164
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,320
state spaces. And exactly as you point out, these can get very high dimension very quick. But let me

165
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,080
mention an example that's small enough that we can dream about it. So, you know, imagine you have

166
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:56,080
a factory and there's a sort of one-dimensional track on the floor in the factory. So there's a,

167
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:02,240
there's a strip, essentially. And, you know, maybe it's a kind of a wheel or like a train

168
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,400
track. You can move forward and backwards along that track. And we're going to have two robots

169
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:12,800
positioned on the track. There's a red robot and a blue robot. So, well, let's actually start with

170
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,960
one robot. So if you wanted to, if you had one robot on a track, then you can describe its positions,

171
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,400
you know, using just kind of a one dimension. It's like an interval. You can have the robot

172
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,400
all the way, one end or all the way at the other end or any place in between. It can move continuously.

173
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,520
So this one-dimensional interval is describing the space of configurations of that robot.

174
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,800
So now let's put two robots on the track, a red one and a blue one. And now there's a space that

175
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,560
describes the configurations of those two robots. I mean, you might think it's a one-dimensional space

176
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,440
because you're still, robots are still on this one-dimensional track. But actually, you know,

177
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,680
you should use kind of one coordinate to keep track of where the red robot is and another

178
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,280
coordinate to keep track of where the blue robot is. And so that is describing the space that's

179
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,440
formed by taking a product of an interval with itself. In other words, it's a square, including

180
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:12,160
the interior, except the two robots can't be in the same spot. You know, one, you know, that if

181
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,040
these are physical robots, they can't collide into each other. So you have to remove a diagonal

182
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:24,400
segment from that square. And what you're left is with these two triangular components. The bottom

183
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,880
triangle corresponds to the red robot being on the right of the blue robot. And the top triangle

184
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,000
corresponds to the red robot being on the left of the blue robot. And so what's interesting about

185
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,160
the space, what we can see already by visualizing the configuration space, which is this square

186
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,360
with a diagonal removed from it, is that it's disconnected. Once you've put your robots on the

187
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,400
track, you're not going to be able to swap their orientation with respect to each other.

188
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,360
That's right.

189
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,400
But, you know, if you're designing the factory, you might say, well, that's a little bit undesirable.

190
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,880
I don't have as much flexibility and improvement, perhaps in the design, depending, of course,

191
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,920
what you're trying to do with these robots on this track is you could make a circular track

192
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:08,880
instead of a, you know, straight track. And if you a circle is also a one dimensional object,

193
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,240
you just sort of move around it going clockwise. There's kind of one direction of motion.

194
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,360
But if you had two robots on a circular track, then what the way you describe their configuration

195
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,400
space is you would take, you know, each robot is some arbitrary point in the circle. We have two

196
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,320
circles, though. So we take the product of those two circles. And this is fun to think about that

197
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,440
actually, the product of two circles corresponds to the points on the surface of a torus again.

198
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,360
So S1 cross S1, the product of two circles are the points on the torus. Again, the robots can't

199
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,120
be on the same point. So what you have to do is you have to imagine you have the surface of a

200
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,480
torus, you built it by gluing together your toilet paper tube. Now you're going to make a diagonal

201
00:18:50,480 --> 00:19:00,320
cut that, it's a cut that goes around sort of both loops in the torus once. So you actually did

202
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,720
this at home last night to test it in the way my toilet paper tube was made. Had a seam exactly

203
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,920
there. So it was easy to see that cut. It's sort of a diagonal cut that moves once around in both

204
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,880
directions. And if you do that, you're left with a connected surface. And that corresponds to the

205
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,600
idea that if you have two robots on a circular track, they can really visit all configurations.

206
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:28,320
There's no sort of left and right anymore. You can have them in any position. So anyway, this is

207
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,880
just sort of baby, baby examples of a really rich and beautiful subject. Some of the most difficult

218
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,480
and conditions apply. Right, because it's good because what topologists care about are the features

219
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:47,920
that don't change by like small deformations of the space. So the fact that a space is in two

220
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,720
disconnected components like the original example versus just being one connected component like

221
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,440
the second example, that's the kind of thing that gets topologists very excited. Right, so when I

222
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,600
say circular track, it could be an oval track, it could be a square track, it could be a hexagonal

223
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,080
track from a topologist, those are all the same. The famous thing I bet many people have heard

224
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,040
that to a topologist, a coffee cup is the same as a donut, right? Because they're both tourists.

225
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,920
Right, right. I mean, that's not that's not my favorite example, because

226
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,680
so topologists have different notions of when things are the same that we're alluding to.

227
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:29,680
And one of the notions of sameness is if two spaces are what's called homeomorphic.

228
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,600
And what homeomorphic means is that there is a sort of one-to-one correspondence between the

229
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,560
points and the space. There's a way, you know, there are two invertible functions, invertible

230
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,040
continuous functions that map all the points on one space to the other and the other to the one.

231
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:51,760
And so if you have a solid tourist now built out of clay, and you have a solid coffee cup,

232
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,520
you can define one of these homeomorphisms, this sort of one-to-one correspondence between

233
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:04,640
the points and the tourists and the points in the mug that are continuous so that you're not

234
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,280
tearing the surface as a part or adding new holes where there weren't holes before, that sort of thing.

235
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,440
So, I mean, it's true that topologists consider tourists and a coffee mug to be the same, but

236
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,960
for like really kind of obvious reason, they're just so evidently the same. But there's another

237
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,440
notion of sameness, a weaker notion of sameness that also comes up in topology, which is called

238
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,960
homotopy equivalence. And here are the ideas, two spaces are homotopy equivalent if you can

239
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:40,240
continuously deform one to another. And so let me give you some examples. So, all of Euclidean

240
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,480
space, you know, three-dimensional Euclidean space is homotopy equivalent to a single point.

241
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,160
So, you could imagine, I think of this homotopy equivalence as like the reverse Big Bang. So,

242
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,360
you imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space, you know, so you have, let's imagine we have the

243
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,280
origin point, so the center of the universe and then all the other points in the universe. I

244
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,080
realize the universe is probably not three-dimensional, but let's just bear with me here.

245
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,640
Also, it doesn't have a center, but that's okay, we're gonna, your method.

246
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,840
And Orinor does have a center, but let's pretend there's a center of the universe and the universe

247
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,920
is three-dimensional. So, in the reverse Big Bang, what I'm going to do is I'm going to continuously

248
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,800
move all the points in the universe back in a straight line to the center of the universe,

249
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,680
to the origin. And they'll move kind of faster, slower depending on how far away they are. So,

250
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,840
at time zero, every point is where it is. And then at time one, they've all

251
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,600
crashed home into the center of the universe. So, that is describing a continuous deformation

252
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:39,520
that reveals that three-dimensional Euclidean space and the point are the same. So, here's an

253
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,920
example, sort of everyday example of a homotopy equivalence that feels more fun to me than the...

254
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,680
Let me just butt in there because, so just to get it clear, the reason why this is an

255
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,760
interesting example is because the point and three-dimensional space are homotopy equivalent.

256
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,800
They can be... One can be continuously deformed to the other, but they're not homeomorphic because

257
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,680
there's not sort of an equal number of points in them. Yeah, right. There's uncountably infinitely

258
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,200
many points in three-dimensional space, but there's one point in one point space. And yeah,

259
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,240
so this is a cooler, way more destructive notion. I mean, dimensions totally don't matter anymore.

260
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,160
You know, all n-dimensional Euclidean space is also homotopy equivalent to a point.

261
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:24,000
Yeah. So, an example, an everyday example that is kind of like that is to a topologist,

262
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,920
a pair of pants and a thong are the same. You can imagine a homotopy equivalence that sort of,

263
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,560
you know, shrinks sort of vertically, I guess, you know, and just leaves the thong from the

264
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,400
pair of pants. And this is the... So, the point is that there are different ways of expressing

265
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,040
the idea of sameness, depending on your sort of level of focus on what you care about.

266
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah, totally, totally. And this is very pervasive in mathematics. You know, mathematicians

267
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,560
love trying to understand the sense in which things are the same and it's often a pretty loose

268
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:02,240
sense. So, I had a very, very brief career, in fact, as a hack topologist when I was in graduate

269
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,760
school and I needed to calculate the homotopy of various things that appear in particle physics

270
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,760
because we have these things called topological defects, right, which are very important from

271
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,160
the early universe. None of the things I calculated turn it out to be relevant to the real world,

272
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,760
but, you know, that's the risk that we take when we do these things. But it gets us into, you know,

273
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,960
so far it's been fun, homotopy, you know, smoothly deforming things into each other,

274
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,960
but now we want to be a little bit more rigorous about it. We want to characterize,

275
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,360
we want to use this notion of smoothly deforming one thing into another to characterize the topology

276
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,600
of different spaces, right? I mean, is in some sense our job to sort of characterize all topological

277
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,240
spaces? Yeah, exactly. And a way to, a classical problem, which is a good way to visualize this,

278
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,320
is you can ask how many different surfaces are there, you know, sort of in this sort of very

279
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:03,680
flexible sense. So, not necessarily just, so for instance, is we've described a few different

280
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:10,400
surfaces. There's the sort of surface of a sphere. There's a surface of a torus. You can have many

281
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,800
hold, the torus was the donut shape. You can imagine having many hold donuts, they're like,

282
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,560
you know, you're baking a tray of donuts, but you've put them too close to each other. And so

283
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,480
they've all kind of congealed and there's, you know, one donut with three holes in it, you know,

284
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,960
that's another surface. And there's a classification question, you know, how can we tell that these

285
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,920
spaces are really different? I mean, they seem different, perhaps maybe I'm giving away my

286
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,520
intuition, but they seem different, you know, how, but how do we prove that they're different?

287
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,680
Because we've seen that these wildly different spaces are, in some sense, the same.

288
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,320
Yeah. So, so how do we do that?

289
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,640
So, yeah, so, so the idea is, I mean, this, this is a hard question to answer geometrically, because

290
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,040
just because you can't imagine a continuous deformation of one space to the other doesn't

291
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:08,880
mean it doesn't exist. So, strategy is to bring algebra into the story somehow and give a way to

292
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:18,000
assign a number or some other kind of algebraic structure to a topological space. And if,

293
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,440
in a way, that would give the same answer if the spaces were homotopy equivalent. So,

294
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,280
so the homology groups or homotopy groups that there are various different constructions you

295
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,560
can do. And it's, it's easy to prove that if the spaces have continuously deformable into each other,

296
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,400
they'll produce the same invariance. And so, if you happen to get different invariance,

297
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,920
then you know that they were different. Right. So, actually, go ahead.

298
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,080
Well, I can give an example of this. Yeah, exactly, do that.

299
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,240
So, what I'm going to try and argue for you is that the surface of a sphere,

300
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,840
so the surface of a soccer ball, is a different space than the surface of a donut. So, a torus

301
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,360
and a sphere are different topological spaces. And just to make sure we're imagining these spaces,

302
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:11,360
again, you know, imagine you're an ant walking around the surface of a sphere, that's one space,

303
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,360
the different positions the ant could be, or you can imagine an ant walking around the surface of

304
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,040
a donut. Not the interior in either case, just the surface. Not the interior in either case,

305
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,280
right. The ant, the ant can't eat the donut or eat the sphere, the ant is sort of stuck on the

306
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:32,080
surface. And it can't like jump off either, it's, you know, okay. So, right. So, the invariant that

307
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,400
I'm going to use to prove that these are different is something called the fundamental group,

308
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:43,360
that is, it's a, and what it's counting essentially. So, in each, it's for convenience,

309
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm going to pick a point on each of these spaces. These spaces are connected. So,

310
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,960
picking a point is not a big deal. So, pick whichever one you want. We'll take the north pole on the

311
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,040
sphere and any point at all on the torus. And what the fundamental group is going to

312
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:04,800
calculate is the number of essentially different ways that the ant can walk from this home base

313
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:12,480
point, walk around on the surface and come back to the home base point. So, the subtlety there,

314
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,720
as I said, the number of essentially different ways. So, I mean, they're uncountably infinitely

315
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,680
many ways an ant can walk around the surfaces, but what I'm asking are they essentially different?

316
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,520
And so, let's set aside the sphere example for now. Let's start by thinking about the surface

317
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,720
of the donut. Okay. So, an example of two ways that are essentially different is we can imagine

318
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:37,280
starting at our home base point and walking, you know, say in a counterclockwise direction

319
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,120
around the loop that goes through the sort of donut hole. If you put a donut hole inside the

320
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,800
donut, that's, you can imagine walking, it's sort of been a vertical. The short way around, basically.

321
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,040
The short way around, great. So, that's one way the ant could walk.

322
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:03,360
Or the ant could walk, let's say, tracing the same trajectory, but going in reverse orientation,

323
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,920
going backwards rather than forwards. So, those are fundamentally different. And what I mean

324
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,360
by fundamentally different is there's no way to continuously deform the first trajectory

325
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,640
into the second trajectory while staying on the surface of the donut. If I could sort of slice

326
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:29,680
through, you know, where the dough bit of the donut is, I could do that. I could sort of cut

327
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,400
through the bit that's not on the surface, but that's not allowed. So, walking in the surface,

328
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,440
once the ant decides it's going clockwise rather than counterclockwise,

329
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,560
those are different choices that the ant can make. In fact, they're homotopically

330
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,200
inequivalent, right? So, because you cannot continuously deform one into another.

331
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,720
What's cool is you can actually enumerate all of the different choices. So,

332
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,400
another different trajectory the ant could take is it could walk the long way around. So, let's say,

333
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,600
staying on the top and going clockwise or going counterclockwise. Or it can do some sort of

334
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,360
combination where it loops, you know, some number of times through the center circle while also

335
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:17,760
traversing the long way around. And there's a way to enumerate all of these essentially

336
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,000
different trajectories. What you need are two different integers, essentially. One integer

337
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,080
that's describing the number of times you go in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction around

338
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,280
the short loop. And then another integer is describing the number of ways to go counterclockwise

339
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,560
or clockwise depending on whether it's positive or negative around the long loop. And you can prove

340
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:48,800
that this pair of integers enumerates all possible trajectories. So, on the sphere,

341
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,120
it's actually quite a lot simpler. So, if you have, you can imagine any path the ant might

342
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,720
take on the surface of a sphere from the north pole to the north pole, kind of wandering around

343
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:06,320
any which way. And you could kind of shrink that trajectory in a continuous way.

344
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,880
Sort of so that it gets smaller and smaller and smaller. So, if it in fact goes all the way to

345
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,040
the south pole, maybe it shrinks a little bit so it only goes to the equator and then maybe it

346
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:22,400
shrinks a little more so it stays north of the Tropic of Cancer and so on and so forth. And

347
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,760
eventually all of the trajectories are deformable to just the ants sitting at the north pole and

348
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,920
never moving at all. So, there there's only one trajectory that the ant can make. And that's

349
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:39,840
the proof somehow that these two spaces are not the same. Which is wonderful because it took

350
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,480
us on a little journey. I actually want to dig into this because on the one hand we're not surprised

351
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,960
that the sphere and the tourists are topologically different, but it was a bit of an effort there

352
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,360
to actually show it, right? Even in that case where we had things under control. And in doing that,

353
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,280
you know, you stumble across, so you ask the question, how many different ways are there to

354
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:05,200
sort of do this path that returns to itself? A loop, right? A closed circle in this space.

355
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:12,720
And in the case of the tourists, you just uncovered this pair of integers, the number of

356
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,800
times you go around the short way, the number of times you go around the long way. And integers,

357
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,680
not to not to get too fancy about it, now that's algebra. That's not geometry or topology or

358
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:28,240
anything. Like, roughly speaking, mathematicians are either geometers and they like space or their

359
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,000
algebraists and they like equations, right? But an algebraic structure appeared here somehow.

360
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,560
Right. I think, you know, this is just the tale of complexity in the modern world. Like,

361
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,280
everybody has to be everything these days. So even if your heart isn't with geometry,

362
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,400
you have to use some algebra. Well, I want to just take advantage of your being here to dig

363
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,640
into this a little bit more. I mean, we asked this question about how many ways you can draw a

364
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,840
circle, roughly speaking, in the tourists. And there's a lot of ways, but then there's this

365
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:08,800
hidden structure in that if you have a circle going around once in one direction and another

366
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,760
circle just doing the same thing, you can add them together in some sense, right? And that's

367
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:20,320
the beginning of algebra. Am I too dramatic there? Yeah, that's exactly right. So a more,

368
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,680
I mean, I've described this in describing the fundamental group, I said, you know,

369
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:31,200
let's imagine we have a home base point where they, and we're going to consider the ant walking

370
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,200
in these little loops from the home base to the home base, but it's actually maybe more natural

371
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,400
to not have a home base point because, you know, I don't know where it would be on the surface of

372
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,360
a tourist, for instance. So another way to think about this sort of algebraic structure is you

373
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:51,760
can imagine an ant walking from any point P on the surface to any other point Q on the surface,

374
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,560
it, you know, takes some path. And then later, you know, maybe the ant is tired and it takes

375
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,800
a nap, but then later it wakes up and then it walks from the point Q to some other point R.

376
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,240
And what you're referring to is you could then compose those two paths, compose those two

377
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:11,920
trajectories and then get a path directly from P to R. So if you can walk from P to Q and walk

378
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,880
from Q to R, you can compose those two walks and get from P to R. And that's the beginning. So this

379
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:24,240
is a composition operation on the paths and the surface of a tourist or on any space, paths in

380
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:34,640
any space. And really the sort of invariant that more exactly describes the algebra that's hidden

381
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,080
in the geometry is something called the fundamental groupoid or the fundamental infinity groupoid,

382
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,280
which is not a group, which is a type of mathematical object we teach undergraduates,

383
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,720
but an sort of infinite dimensional analog of a group and infinity groupoid, which is a,

384
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,840
you know, sort of frontier of research level mathematics. Right. I think that it, look, if

385
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,720
people are going to listen to this entire podcast episode, I want them to come away knowing what

386
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,320
an infinity groupoid is. I think that's going to be something that they'll be able to impress their

387
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,640
friends with at cocktail parties and so forth. So you but to go very slowly to get there, you know,

388
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,920
you mentioned the fundamental group, which is the collection of the circles we started with. So

389
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:25,520
what's a group? Right. So a group is, I mean, a way to, I mean, this, like it, there's this,

390
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,040
there's this metaphor of the blind men and the elephant and, you know, somebody's holding,

391
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,360
somebody's touching the trunk, somebody's touching one of the legs, somebody's touching the tail and

392
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,480
have a completely different perspective of it. And that's, that's how I'm thinking about groups.

393
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:48,800
So it's like really hard to know how to start. But, you know, a group in this context is a set.

394
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Here it's the collection of all different loops that aunt could take walking through some space,

395
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,040
together with a composition operation. So it's performing one loop and then following it by

396
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,200
another loop that can be understood as a loop. Even though you come back through the center,

397
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:12,800
it's still a loop and then satisfying some, you know, sort of very natural axioms. So if you're

398
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,320
walking along a loop, you could always reverse your trajectory and walk back in the other direction.

399
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,120
And that's an undoing somehow of the process. So every element in a group has an inverse

400
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,520
that if you compose with it, it gets back to sort of where you started. And a few sort of simple

401
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,680
axioms like that. So it's kind of a, it's a stripped down version of, you know, the integers

402
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,680
or something like that, right? Where the integers, you can add them together. So the integers are

403
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,720
an example of a group, right? Right. Integers with addition is an example of a group. Absolutely.

404
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,400
That's right. Not with multiplication. Matrices with multiplication is an example of a group.

405
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,040
Matrices with addition is an example of a group. So I have to say something about the dimensions

406
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:02,320
to make those examples work. But okay. And the physicists love group theory because symmetries

407
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,120
are a group, right? Like rotations and translations and things like that. Yeah, absolutely. So another

408
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:13,600
perspective on groups, if we sort of move around the elephant is a group is an axiomatization of

409
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:20,960
the symmetries of an object. So, so, or the different configurations that an object might be.

410
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,960
So let me, let me explain what a symmetry is. So, so imagine you have a twin mattress and you know

411
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,480
that you're supposed to kind of flip your, your mattress occasionally, because I guess it's good

412
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,120
for the life of the mattress. And so you might wonder, like, how many different ways are there

413
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,360
to flip the mattress? How many different configurations could the mattress be in? And

414
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,760
well, it's the mattress, one option is whatever the mattress is when you start it. Then you could

415
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,680
sort of rotate it head to toe. So you're sort of switching the head and the toe, but the top

416
00:38:51,680 --> 00:39:00,720
stays the same. That's one move. You could also flip it sort of side to side. So I'm keeping the

417
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,680
head at the head and the toe at the toe, but I'm switching the top and the bottom. Yep. Or you

418
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,840
could combine those two operations. And the effect of this is the head is now where the toe was and

419
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:16,160
the toes were the head and the top and bottom surface has also flipped. So a group is recording

420
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,480
on the one hand, the four different positions that the mattress could be in, but also how these

421
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:28,080
different flipping operations that I described compose to each other. So each of those flips

422
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,360
is an order two element of the group, meaning if you perform the same move twice, you get the

423
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:39,600
mattress back to where you started. If you do any two different of the flips, you'll get the

424
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,400
third one, which is not a typical property of a group, but it's special to this one, which is,

425
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,000
goes by the name, the client for group. This group does not have a generator, meaning that

426
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,040
there's not one operation you can do over and over again that will take you all the way

427
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,880
through the group. And this is why it's hard to remember how to flip your mattress because

428
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,920
you have to remember sort of how you flipped it last month. So you don't just do the same operation

429
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,200
and again and get back to where you were the month before. So the integers do have a generator.

430
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,120
You just add one and then you can get all the integers either by doing that or undoing it.

431
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,680
Yeah. Add one or negative one, you get all the way through everything. So yes,

432
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,640
the integers are cyclic group, which have a single generator, absolutely, but client for group is not.

433
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,160
Right. So the integers may be two people who are not group theory,

434
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,120
Fischinados are a nice little paradigm, but it's important that groups can be very different. So

435
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:36,400
this is a finite group, this mattress flipping group, right? It's only how many elements are

436
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,680
there in the mattress? Yeah, four elements. Okay. Yeah. All right. And there's, so I mean,

437
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,800
these groups are super cool and really tell you something profound about geometry. So

438
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,120
you might have heard of the platonic solids, which are the three dimensional figures that you can get

439
00:40:53,120 --> 00:41:00,000
by gluing together regular two dimensional figures. So a regular two dimensional figure is like a

440
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,920
triangle or a square or pentagon or a hexagon where all the sides have the same length,

441
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,480
all the angles are the same and so on and so forth. And there are infinitely many of these

442
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,520
because there's a heptagon and an octagon and a nonagon for any natural number N,

443
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,200
you can get a plain figure with N sides. So you might wonder how many of these regular

444
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:29,920
platonic solids are, how many different shapes you can get by gluing together, say triangles or

445
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,800
gluing together squares or gluing together pentagons or gluing together hexagons maybe.

446
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,960
And you can prove in fact that there are only finitely many. In fact, there are five of them

447
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:48,320
using group theory by studying the symmetries, the sort of orthogonal groups, the special

448
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,320
orthogonal groups that describe the different configurations of these hypothetical shapes.

449
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,760
Before even knowing they exist, you can limit the possible configurations.

450
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,960
But clearly that's not what Plato did.

451
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:07,440
I don't know, maybe somewhere like buried in Plato's intuition. But another fun fact is,

452
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,080
so the five, there's something called the tetrahedron, which is built from triangles. And

453
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,560
then there's the cube, which is that's the most familiar one built from squares. Then there's

454
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:23,040
the octahedron also built from triangles. And then the dodecahedron and the icosahedron. And

455
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,280
even though I named five things, in a sense there's kind of only three of them because

456
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,480
there's this duality relationship between the platonic solids, which you might have seen. If

457
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:40,720
you take a cube, so it's got four, so it's sorry, its faces are squares, there are six of them,

458
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,080
and they are glued together along 12 different edges, and there are eight corners. And what I'm

459
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:52,240
going to do is I'm going to build a new platonic solid by replacing each of the corners by a face,

460
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:58,320
and each face by a corner. And what you get in that, just by kind of connecting everything up,

461
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:04,800
is an octahedron, so one of the other platonic solids. And so there's a duality relationship

462
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,280
between the cube and the octahedron, and also between the dodecahedron and the icosahedron,

463
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,680
and between the tetrahedron and itself. And those are reflected by their symmetry groups.

464
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,320
So because of this duality relationship, the symmetry group that describes the configurations

465
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:25,840
of the cube is the same isomorphic to, same shape as the symmetry group of the octahedron, and so

466
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,600
on. Anyone who played Dungeons and Dragons knows about the platonic solids because they have a

467
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,040
dice, but they don't know about the duality relations. So now that's good, that's something

468
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:39,520
else that they have in their bag now. I'm only going to do this at great risk, but I figure,

469
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,800
like, all right, while we've talked about groups, why don't we also explain rings and fields to

470
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,800
the audience, since these are the other sort of algebraic structures that mathematicians love to

471
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,480
throw around. Yeah, absolutely. So I mean, what's funny is, you know, after a while, you kind of

472
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,320
forget that these terms refer to other things. Sorry, when I say field, I mean, I definitely

473
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,600
think about the mathematical field before. I remember that's like also the thing that's

474
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:09,040
out the window, but right. So a group is describing a setting where you have, you know,

475
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,600
a collection of objects, and you have one composition operation to combine them together.

476
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:19,200
So if we have the integers, we can think about addition. If you add two integers, you get another

477
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,520
integer. But, you know, there are other binary operations on the integers that come up, you

478
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,560
know, multiplication, for instance. And a ring is a setting where you have two operations,

479
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,640
an addition operation or an addition like operation and a multiplication like operation.

480
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:44,800
And they interact in ways that are sort of familiar for the integers. So if I, you can

481
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,840
understand, there's a distributivity property that says if I add two integers together, and then I

482
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:57,200
multiply by something, it's the same as multiplying first and then adding. And there are a few axioms

483
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,480
like that. So what's cool about, I mean, you might ask, like, why do we bother we like everybody

484
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,840
knows what the integers are? Why do I need this abstract concept of a ring? And that's a totally

485
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:16,080
fair question. But a really fun, or it's kind of interesting fact is there's a very deep analogy

486
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:23,520
between the integers and polynomials. So, so a polynomial is like this, this is sort of the

487
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,920
thing that you would meet in a high school algebra class. So you have a variable X, an indeterminate

488
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:36,560
variable X, and then you can form a polynomial by sort of adding up X's and multiplying X's and

489
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:45,840
then throwing in real numbers as the coefficients. So the polynomial might be like 5x minus 5x plus,

490
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:52,560
I don't know, 17x squared plus pi x cubed, because we can have real numbers as coefficients,

491
00:45:52,560 --> 00:46:01,360
minus 3. So that's a polynomial in a single variable X. And polynomials also form a ring. If

492
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:07,120
you have two polynomials, you can add them together, you can multiply them. There's sort of rules for

493
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:12,400
doing this that you might have learned in a high school algebra class. And those ring, the ring of

494
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,200
polynomials with coefficients in a field, which we'll get to what a field is later on, coefficients

495
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,640
in the real numbers. And the ring of integers are very, are very quite similar as rings. They're

496
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:28,160
both, they have a division algorithm. You can do sort of long division with polynomials like with rings.

497
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,840
All the ideal elements are principles. And so, I mean, that's the sort of thing that's of interest

498
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,760
to mathematicians are these kind of deep analogies between structures that are superficially quite

499
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,680
different. Well, and what's the difference between a ring and a field? Because they're kind of similar.

500
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:51,920
Right. So a field is like a ring, it has two binary operations. But if we go back to the

501
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,160
ring of integers, there's a pretty big difference between the addition rule and the multiplication

502
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:05,040
rule. So if I, in that, every addition, every element has an additive inverse. So if I pick

503
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:11,680
my favorite integer, you know, 17, there's another integer, negative 17, that when I add them together,

504
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,640
I get zero, which is the identity for the addition operation. But that doesn't work for

505
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,760
multiplication. If I pick my favorite integer again, 17, there's no integer I can multiply

506
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:29,680
17 by to get back to one, which is the multiplicative identity. Right. So that's what distinguishes a

507
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,440
ring where you don't necessarily have multiplicative inverses from a field. In a field, you do have

508
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,680
an inverse to both the multiplication and the addition operation. You sort of assuming you're

509
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,400
not trying to divide by zero, that number quite works. So things like the rational numbers,

510
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,920
which throw in these multiplicative inverses or the real numbers are fields in addition to being

511
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:56,160
rings. And does the existence of the number zero get you in trouble? Because it doesn't have an

512
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:03,440
inverse? Yeah. So in a field, you have to treat zero as a kind of special case. So in a field,

513
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,800
you have to, your zero and your one can't be the same. Otherwise, the whole thing kind of collapses.

514
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,920
Zero will not have a multiplicative inverse, but every other element has to. Got it. Okay.

515
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,160
And so when we started, we started this little journey, this whole sidetrack, because we were

516
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:24,080
thinking about the torus and its topology. And we found that the space of all the little loops,

517
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:32,240
the ant could walk on, formed a group. Are there examples where we associate rings or fields with

518
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:39,680
topological invariance? That's a good question. I don't know that that's commonly done. And I

519
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:47,200
think the reason is that groups are just so rich, you know, but, you know, a single group will not

520
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,800
capture the full data of a topological space. I mean, really, what you have to do is have introduced

521
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,520
lots of different groups that are measuring lots of different things. So the fundamental group

522
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:03,920
tells you about sort of loops in the space and whether you can, if you sort of walk along a

523
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,800
circular path in the space, can you fill that in with a disk? You know, could you,

524
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,720
I guess I don't know how to say it any better than that. That's a good way to say it.

525
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,880
Can you contract it? You know, if you have sort of a wire ring, is there, could you put sort of a

526
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,680
soap bubble on it somehow so that the surface of the soap bubble lives within the space that you

527
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:29,280
were talking about? So that's not possible if you're walking the short way around on a torus,

528
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,760
because the soap bubble would have to kind of cut through the dough, and that's not on the surface.

529
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,880
But it is on the surface of a sphere, you could just kind of, you know, paint over the disk.

530
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,200
So that's measuring this kind of one-dimensional holds, I guess, is the

531
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,760
area that's bounded by a one-dimensional sphere. But as we mentioned, there are kind of spheres

532
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,360
in higher dimensions. So you could ask, if you have a balloon inside your surface,

533
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:02,320
can that be filled in with sand sort of staying within the surface? And that's a

534
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,520
two-dimensional analog of the same question. And there's a question like that in all

535
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:14,320
positive integer dimensions. And that family of groups describes the full homotopy type

536
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,560
of a space. A single group does not, but if you have this sort of infinitely many groups that

537
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,520
it does. One of the things that I say just very casually to people who are non-mathematicians is

538
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,040
that you might think that mathematicians spend all their time thinking about mathematical objects,

539
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,720
like spheres or toruses or whatever. But really, they're thinking about maps

540
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:38,480
between the different objects. So I guess it's fair to say that first thing, the fundamental group

541
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:46,720
is maps from circles into the space you care about. Then there's the set of maps from spheres,

542
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,280
and then the set of maps from three spheres, and it clearly generalizes to infinite numbers.

543
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:58,080
Yeah, absolutely. But there's something special about the groups. You don't get fields or rings,

544
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:02,880
which have two different binary operations on them. I guess the last thing that I have in that

545
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,080
angle is, is there something special about fields and rings that have two binary operations that

546
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:14,080
it's worth stopping there? Can we define three binary operations on a set and make hyper-rings

547
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:23,280
or something like that? Sure. Algebra is a very flexible subject. To define what an algebra is

548
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,760
in full generality, you need the collection of elements that you're considering, and then you

549
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,520
can specify arbitrarily many operations with arbitrary arities, and you can specify arbitrarily

550
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:39,840
many rules between them. The subject of universal algebra invites you to consider examples like that.

551
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:46,560
Let's invite listeners in the audience who are inclined in that direction to follow study universal

552
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:51,840
algebras. We're going to go back to the topology and the groups. You made a statement there.

553
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:59,520
I just want to make sure that I get it clear. If I figure out the set of all ways that I can map

554
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:09,040
circles and spheres and three-dimensional spheres, etc., into a space, I have not specified its

555
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:15,040
topology completely, but I have specified its homotopy type topology completely, which is a

556
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:20,640
slightly weaker thing. Is that right? That's right. Yeah. Okay. Do we know the answer to the

557
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:28,800
general question of how to completely specify the topology of a space? Right. The classical

558
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,200
approach to that, and it's kind of a topology, but let's imagine it's a theorem as opposed to a

559
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,480
topology. If you restrict to well-behaved spaces, it's a theorem, and if you take general spaces,

560
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:44,240
it's kind of a topology. The classical approach to this is exactly what you're saying. You describe

561
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:52,720
what's called the nth homotopy group as the collection of maps from the n sphere into your

562
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:58,720
space. Then because it's a group, you need a composition operation, which for two spheres,

563
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:07,680
I can describe the composition. If I have a map from a two-dimensional sphere into a space and a

564
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:12,880
map from another two-dimensional sphere into the space, and these maps are based so there's

565
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,640
the north pole and they send them to the same point in the space, you could imagine taking

566
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:24,400
another two-dimensional sphere and then collapsing the equator to a single point. If you had a balloon

567
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,280
and you collapse the points on the equator, you sort of squeeze at them carefully so it doesn't

568
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,360
pop. Now you have a single point. Now what you look like is something that's called a bouquet

569
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:38,480
of spheres. It's sort of two different spheres that are glued together along the point where

570
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,720
the equator used to be. You could sort of map from that into the space because you have two

571
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:49,680
different maps into the space that have a common point. The combination of that operation is how

572
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:55,040
you define the composition here. There's an analog of that in all dimensions. This is the

573
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:01,040
classical approach to saying what is a space algebraically? What are some algebra stuff that

574
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,960
tell you everything that you would want to know about the homotopy type of the space?

575
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:12,000
But a modern approach goes back to the idea of the fundamental group but replaces it by

576
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,280
something called the fundamental infinity groupoid. Since I promised I would tell

577
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:23,680
listeners what an infinity groupoid is, let me do it now. I like this because this feels like

578
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:31,040
a much more natural way to describe the space. Again, the fundamental groupoid,

579
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,440
depending on your point of view either is a theorem or it's a tautology,

580
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:42,640
really does capture the full homotopy type of the space. It's some algebraic structure where I'm

581
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:48,080
going to start with the set of all points in the space. The topology, I've forgotten about

582
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:53,600
distances and stuff. I'm just remembering the set of points because in algebra I have sets

583
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,560
and stuff I don't have geometry. I just remember the set of the points in the space.

584
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,400
Then what I'm going to throw in is the data of every possible path between any points in the space.

585
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:10,720
This is going to be a very big thing, by the way. We recover now every possible path that

586
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,000
an ant could take between points in the space plus the composition.

587
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,280
I mean, I gotta say that mathematicians use the word data in a different sense than physicists

588
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,320
Oh, yeah. I mean, all of our sets are infinite. It's fine. No problems here.

589
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,400
When you say the data of a path, you mean whatever information is required to

590
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,720
specify that path among the space of all the paths.

591
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,560
Right. We have all the points in the space. We have all the paths in the space.

592
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,880
When we were thinking about paths before, when we were talking about the torus, we were talking

593
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,080
about, well, we only want to consider paths up to being essentially the same,

594
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,760
sort of continuously deformable. We're not doing that here. We're literally remembering

595
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,120
every single path, every path as a distinct path. Good.

596
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,360
But we are also going to remember data of these continuous deformations.

597
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:02,240
There's a notion of path between paths. If a path is a map from an interval into the space,

598
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:07,440
this is a continuous map from a square into the space. An interval times an interval is a square.

599
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,400
So a map from a square into space can be understood as a path between paths,

600
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,400
sort of where one edge goes as one path, where the other edge goes as the other path,

601
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,960
and then the sort of other direction, the other dimension is giving the kind of path between

602
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,200
paths. So we're going to remember all of those as well, all of these paths between paths.

603
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,680
So these are called homotopies. And then there's no reason to stop at two dimensions.

604
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,160
So we could take three intervals, product it together. That's a cube. Remember all of those

605
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,000
maps into the space. These are paths between paths between paths. And then we could take

606
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,200
paths between paths between paths between paths, paths between paths, between paths,

607
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,480
between paths, between paths, and all the way up. And that goes to infinity. That's the infinity

608
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,680
groupoid. So that data, I mean, this feels like it's maybe not an improvement, but somehow...

609
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,120
Oh, yeah, it's something.

610
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:59,520
Somehow that algebraic structure, you know, both describes the full homotopy type of a space,

611
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:06,960
which is a useful way to think about it, but also invites you to imagine a generalization

612
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:12,480
to a different world that's further removed from the geometry, where you can imagine some

613
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:18,160
of these paths are no longer invertible anymore. These are sort of one-way paths, you know, you

614
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,640
might not be able to go backwards for whatever reason. And this is now the world of infinite

615
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,600
dimensional category theory. And that's really where I work, though.

616
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,040
Well, so, which brings up a couple, there's a couple of things I just got to clean up there.

617
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,840
You were on a roll, so I just wanted to let you keep going. But one thing is just to remind

618
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:41,200
folks, when you talked about the path between two paths, right? The cube, sorry, the square

619
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:47,600
that was a map into it, that path between two paths might not exist if the two paths are not

620
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,400
homotopically equivalent, that there won't be any path between them. So there's some structure in

621
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,200
the space of what paths between paths exist. Right, by what's present and what's absent,

622
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,840
that's a beautiful way to say it. Good. And the other one was, this is a little bit off topic,

623
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:08,160
but when you did the explanation of the sphere and you squeezed it down at the equator to get

624
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,800
the bouquet, not only is the language very beautiful, but the visualization is very compelling.

625
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:18,880
And one thing that always gets asked, how do you visualize the infinity groupoid? Is that

626
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:24,240
something that is necessary for you to do? Do you approximate infinity by two, or is there

627
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:31,520
some other trick? It's hard. I don't know. I mean, you sort of imagine a little piece of it at a

628
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:38,320
time and then I don't know. Yeah, it's hard. Okay, that's fair, completely fair. I basically

629
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:42,560
give the same answer. I say you don't. You do the two-dimensional or three-dimensional examples

630
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:47,280
you can get, but at some point you have to trust the equations you're pushing around.

631
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,080
And I don't think we've quite elaborated the difference between a group and a groupoid.

632
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,760
Right, so the difference between a group is, so the example of a fundamental group,

633
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:05,520
the elements of the group are actually the loops themselves. We've kind of fixed,

634
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:12,720
as prior we given data, the home base point for the ant, and then the only further data we record

635
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:21,920
are the loops in the space. So in a groupoid, you don't fix a base point. You allow different

636
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:28,000
base points, so the different points on the surface of, or in the space. And now, so now

637
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,640
you have kind of two levels of data. You have the collection of different points, and then

638
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:38,240
you also have the paths between the different points. Okay, is this, I mean, outside of the

639
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:44,880
world of topology and homotopy, are there group oids? I mean, groups, physicists use groups all

640
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,600
the time, right? SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 is the symmetry group of the standard model of particle

641
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:55,360
physics. We never use the word groupoid unless we're secretly mathematicians. So just in the

642
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:02,240
abstract sense, is there a difference? Yeah, sure. So your groups are all automorphism groups of some

643
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:07,520
object, and it's a fixed object. So, you know, you're thinking about automorphisms of R3 or

644
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:13,360
automorphisms of R4 or sort of R3 with a chosen orientation or something like that. So your groups

645
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:18,640
were all automorphism groups of a fixed object. In a groupoid, you have different objects. So

646
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,320
there's not just one object anymore, there are different objects, and it's exactly the mini

647
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:27,040
object analog of a group. Okay, I see. That's not so bad. And automorphism is just a map from a

648
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:33,840
space to itself. Is that right? Yeah. Okay, good. Yeah, sorry. We all know what automorphisms are.

649
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,560
So then, okay, good. Sorry, there's a lot of clarifying questions, but then let's get back

650
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:47,760
to the punchline here. The infinity groupoid, the sort of topological sense of all the different

651
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,280
paths that we can map into the space and the paths between the paths and the paths between

652
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,400
the paths of paths. So if we knew the infinity groupoid of a space, we would know what?

653
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:04,320
Everything. Well, everything if you only care about the space up to homotopy. I mean,

654
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:08,320
if you're willing to say that n-dimensional Euclidean space is the same as a point, there's no

655
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:12,960
difference whatsoever. Then yes, you know everything about the space. Now, I mean, if you care about

656
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,600
geometry or dimension or things like that, then this is not the right point of view.

657
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,360
But for the Taurus, when you said, you know, let's calculate the fundamental group,

658
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:27,600
and we noticed that it looked like, so for the sphere, the fundamental group is as trivial,

659
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:33,200
so it's one element. For the Taurus, it's two copies of the integers. So it's basically two

660
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:40,080
integers you just give me. How do I even express what the infinity groupoid of a space is?

661
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:47,440
Right. So let me move back to the sphere because the two sphere, because it's a little easier to

662
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:53,280
describe here. So if we're thinking about the loops in the two sphere or the paths in the two

663
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,840
sphere, there's kind of nothing interesting to say. If you have any two points on the, sorry,

664
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,360
the two spheres in the ordinary sphere, if you have any two points on the sphere, you can connect

665
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:05,520
them by a path, and there's a sense in which all paths are the same. You could continuously

666
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:12,960
deform any path from x to y into any other path from x to y. But now if we think about these

667
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,520
two-dimensional paths between paths, there are fundamentally different ones, and this is really

668
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:22,480
surprising. So in one dimension, all paths are somehow the same. But in two dimensions,

669
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:29,680
paths can be quite different. So I want to think about paths between paths, and so I should fix

670
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:38,320
the two paths first. So let's start at the north pole and the south pole. So these will be paths

671
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,560
from the north pole to the south pole. And one of the paths I want to take is the

672
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:47,120
international dateline, so somewhere through the Pacific Ocean. And the other path I want to take

673
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,480
is the prime meridian, which is, I don't know, it's through England or something like that.

674
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,120
Two-grenage, yeah.

675
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,760
Okay, somewhere else. So there's the Greenwich one and the Pacific Ocean. So those are both

676
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:01,360
paths from the north pole to the south pole. Now a path between paths is a continuous map

677
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:08,720
from a square onto the surface of the earth that sends one edge to the prime meridian and the other

678
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:14,800
edge to the international dateline. And one of them is the one that would cover Asia that would

679
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:19,120
go east from the prime meridian to the international dateline. And the other one is the one that would

680
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:26,480
cover the New World, so go west. And those are fundamentally different in the sense that there

681
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:33,680
is no three-dimensional path, no path between paths between paths that continuously deforms the one

682
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:39,120
to the other. If you could pass through the core of the earth, you could do that, but we have to

683
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:44,800
stay on the surface. It's not allowed. So in this sense, the fundamental group or the fundamental

684
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:49,280
group or sort of one-dimensional thing does not describe everything that's going on on the surface

685
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,680
of the sphere. But once we allow these higher-dimensional things, we do get everything.

686
01:03:54,240 --> 01:04:00,480
And is the kind of day job that you're involved in more actually calculating the

687
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:06,880
infinity groupoid of this or that, or is it more proving theorems about properties of infinity

688
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:12,240
groupoids? Right. So that's a great question, because those are both very active areas. There

689
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:17,520
are a lot of researchers working on both problems. I don't do the calculations myself. They're very

690
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:23,920
hard. I do kind of the theory side, but some of my colleagues work on the calculations.

691
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,640
I'm sure it makes everyone feel good that you don't really do the hard part. You're just doing

692
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:32,960
the simple part of proving theorems about infinity groupoids. And also, this discussion is wonderful

693
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:39,360
because it does, beneath the surface in the language that you use and the way you talk about it,

694
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:46,800
the role of the maps between the different spaces really shines through. Just think of all the

695
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,440
spaces you can invent and all the different ways you can map them in some sense. And that

696
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,840
sneaks us up into the topic of category theory, which is not really our focus here, but I don't

697
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,880
want to leave the audience completely bereft of category theory while we're here.

698
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:07,760
So how do we get from topology to category theory? Sure. I mean, again, there's lots of

699
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:12,320
different roots in, but maybe the one that's most relevant to this conversation. And this is

700
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:19,040
kind of back to the conversation and philosophy that we started off with is,

701
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:25,760
um, so the fundamental theorem in category theory or somehow that that's expressing the core

702
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:30,000
philosophy of category theory, this thing called the yinata lemma says that if you have any sort

703
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,680
of mathematical object, it could be a topological space or it could be a vector space or it could

704
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:40,880
be a ring or it could be a field or whatever, any sort of mathematical object. You can understand

705
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:46,160
everything that you want to know about it by considering the other objects of that same type.

706
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:52,000
So other spaces or other rings or other fields and the maps between them. So,

707
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:58,480
right. So what this is saying in the case of spaces is that if you have a unknown space x and

708
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,360
you're trying to understand that space, so we don't know sort of what its dimensions are,

709
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:08,000
what its points are, we don't know anything about it. Um, a theorem in category theory,

710
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,720
the yinata lemma says that you can completely characterize your unknown space by considering

711
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,520
the other spaces. So all these spheres and torii and other surfaces and whatever and all

712
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:23,200
dimensions and then the continuous maps from that into your space x. Well, okay, what's cool

713
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:28,480
about that result. So we were, we were using this idea in topology already to understand spaces,

714
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,440
but what's cool is it's completely independent of the mathematical context. So the same theorem

715
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:39,200
is true for rings. You can understand a ring by thinking about other rings and the ring

716
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,960
homomorphisms between them. You can understand a group by thinking about other groups and the

717
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:48,000
group homomorphisms between them. Um, this works in any mathematical context whatsoever.

718
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:54,080
It's again, a little bit, uh, related to some ideas in physics that we should always be talking

719
01:06:54,080 --> 01:07:00,320
about relations between different things rather than intrinsic essences of things themselves.

720
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:05,600
So yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And, and why is this called category theory? Like let's, let's just

721
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:10,080
bite the bullet and tell people what a category is maybe. Sure. So I mean, a category is kind of

722
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:15,040
like a very general template for a mathematical theory. So Barry Mazer has this metaphor. It's

723
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:20,880
like something with, uh, nouns and verbs. So a category is given by a collection of objects.

724
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,440
These are the nouns and what you should think of here are like all the rings, all the possible

725
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:30,720
rings. So the integers and the rationals and the polynomials and matrices and blah, blah, blah.

726
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:37,840
So all the rings. Um, and then you also have the sort of functions between them. So

727
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,400
in the case of rings, these would be functions that respect the addition and multiplication

728
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,280
laws. In the case of spaces, these would be continuous functions and sort of that totality

729
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:53,120
of information, the objects like the spaces and the functions, the continuous functions or maps

730
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:59,200
between them and their composition and so on. That's a category. And what's great about this is

731
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:04,240
every word you say makes perfect sense. And at the end, I'm left not quite knowing what the

732
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:08,800
implications of these ideas are. That's where that's the devil being the details, right? You've

733
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:14,160
ascended to this platonic realm of wonderful abstraction where there's just things and maps

734
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:19,200
between them. So how do you, what's the usefulness? What's the cashing out of this? What is the

735
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:25,440
free market value of a good category theory? Right. So, um, I mean, one nice thing about

736
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:30,560
category theory is you can just say when two categories are the same in a essential sense.

737
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,960
So there's a notion of equivalence between categories and I'll give you my favorite example. So

738
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:43,680
there's a category whose objects are vector spaces, which are something that are kind of

739
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:48,800
fundamental in, in sort of modern quantum physics. So a vector space is like a, you know, collection

740
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:53,760
of vectors with vector addition and scalar multiplication. And then the, the sort of

741
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:58,000
transformations between vector spaces are called linear transformations. So there's,

742
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,880
so this is kind of a bread and butter category objects or vector spaces, the maps or transformations,

743
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,960
which are some sort of functions between these vector spaces. Now there's another category

744
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:12,720
that's kind of a lot simpler to define. So the objects in this category are just natural numbers.

745
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:17,040
So there, I know exactly how many objects there are. Each natural number is an object,

746
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,600
there are no other objects. That's it. And now I need to say sort of what an

747
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:26,560
transformation is. The natural numbers are zero, one, two, three, the positive, not negative

748
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:32,720
integers. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. So, so now I need to say what a sort of transformation or what an

749
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:39,360
arrow is from one number, let's say five to another number eight. And what it is, is it's going to be

750
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:45,520
an eight by five matrix. Okay. So to make something a category, I need to tell you about the objects

751
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,040
and the arrows between them. And that's what I've done. The natural numbers are the objects,

752
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:53,680
the matrices are the arrows, but you also need a composition law. So I need a way to take a

753
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:58,480
five by eight matrix and an eight by seven matrix and produce a five by seven matrix.

754
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:04,480
But there's a thing for that. It's called matrix multiplication. It's an operation that satisfies

755
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:08,960
the axioms of category. So those are two very different sounding categories. On the one hand,

756
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,920
I have this like very abstract comp, you know, very large thing of all vector spaces and all

757
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,160
linear transformations between them. And then on the other hand, I have this kind of toy category

758
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:24,480
with natural numbers and matrices. And those categories are equivalent. So in other words,

759
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:31,200
you can think of the natural number as a stand in for a vector space, the number five corresponds

760
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:36,880
to five dimensional Euclidean space. I was going to guess that, I promise. Yes. Yeah. And you can

761
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:42,720
think of matrix as a stand in for a linear transformation. So if you have vector spaces

762
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:48,960
and you choose a basis, then you can use those bases to get a matrix of numbers that encodes the

763
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,800
full data of the linear transformation. And so in a mathematics department, we often teach linear

764
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,280
algebra and kind of two different tracks. There's a sort of computational linear algebra. If you're

765
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:04,080
going to be, you know, the next founder of Google, you need to learn how to use these matrix operations

766
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:08,880
and you'll take that sort of course. Or there's a theoretical linear algebra that's, you know,

767
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:15,360
taken maybe by more math majors. And this on the ground, the subjects feel very different because

768
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,960
one, you're learning a lot about matrices and reduction and operations. And then the other,

769
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,440
you're learning this theory about linear independence and bases and so on and so forth. But

770
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:29,040
it's the same subject because they're, these are equivalent categories. Okay, that is actually

771
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:33,280
a very good example of like a little useful bit of insight that you get from thinking this way.

772
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:38,000
So just, I know that this is sort of already been said by you, but let me try to say it again to

773
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,320
drive home this notion of a category to people who don't use it as a bread and butter. Because

774
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:46,960
when you say a vector space, let's just imagine, let's optimistically imagine everyone knows what

775
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:52,160
a vector space is, right? They have in their mind x y axes and little vectors. So a vector space is

776
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:56,640
itself a collection of things, right? The vectors, there's an infinite number of vectors in the vector

777
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:03,760
space. But the category is of vector spaces. So the individual elements of the category

778
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,280
are the whole vector space, a two dimensional vector space, a three dimensional vector space,

779
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:14,560
et cetera. And you're thinking about the maps between vector spaces and then extra maps between

780
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,680
the set of all vector spaces and the set of all integers and things like that. So it gets pretty

781
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,840
unvisualizable pretty quickly, but that's why you get paid the big bucks.

782
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,480
Well, the visual is you're sort of zooming out. You're really taking a bird's eye view of

783
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:36,560
mathematics. The objects that a group theorist would study are really just little atoms inside

784
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,560
the category of all groups. And what's fun is if you're a category theorist or a higher

785
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,640
dimensional category theorist, really the categories themselves become very small. So

786
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:49,120
in my work, I zoom out one other level and I think about categories whose objects are categories.

787
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,120
Inside those categories are things like the category of vector spaces and then the vector

788
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:57,120
space is an actual vector space, which has uncountably infinitely many vectors in it,

789
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,200
as you point out. And so at what point do we get to the infinity categories? There's an

790
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,200
infinity group, or there must be an infinity category, right?

791
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:15,440
Yeah, sure. I mean, yeah. As every decade, mathematicians invent more complicated objects

792
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:21,440
to study and the universes where those objects live are categories with more dimensions of

793
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,640
morphisms between them. And those are these infinity categories.

794
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,960
I mean, just knowing that, can you foresee what was going to be invented in the next decade?

795
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,160
Like what is the obvious thing to draw more arrows between?

796
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,760
Yeah. I mean, what I'm hoping happens in the future is that we change our foundation system

797
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:44,000
of mathematics. So it's kind of more suitable to these complicated up-to-homeotopy structures that

798
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,200
we're thinking about today. Well, maybe this is a good place to end up. Because

799
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:55,120
in some sense, like this all, it's kind of fun. Like you and I are both in the small group of

800
01:13:55,120 --> 01:14:01,280
people who just think it's fun thinking about this stuff. But it's also maybe a shift of

801
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:09,120
perspective on what math is in changing what we mean by equality and equivalence and things

802
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:14,400
like that. And so can you imagine that math is going to look very different down the road when

803
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,960
this really seeps in? Is it kind of like a shift from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics in

804
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:28,240
some sense? Yeah, I think so. I think we maybe see glimpses of it today. But I think every living

805
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:35,280
mathematician would be very surprised by 22nd century mathematics. And I hope to be around to

806
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:39,920
see some of it. Well, I was very interested to read. There's a wonderful interview with you in

807
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:45,760
Quantum Magazine. And one of the interesting things you're doing is writing books. I mean,

808
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,440
maybe you count them as textbooks, but anyway, technical mathematical books where,

809
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:56,880
correct me if I'm saying this wrong, but you were just as interested in reproving known theorems

810
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,600
in better ways as in improving new theorems, which is supposed to be the typical thing

811
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:08,720
mathematicians are paid to do. Right. And there's this Bill Thurston, who is this wonderful

812
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:16,480
topologist, Geometer, drew attention to kind of the role that mathematicians need to play in

813
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:22,800
making mathematics understandable to humans. So because something has been proven, that means

814
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:27,600
it's true, which a nice thing about mathematics is the theorems that were proven 2000 years ago

815
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,000
are equally true today. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's understandable by somebody who

816
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,840
wants to build on those ideas and use them to do something else. So I think it is worthwhile to do

817
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:47,280
a bit of kind of tidying up and repackaging, streamlining. A wonderful success in the history

818
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:52,400
of mathematics is that these cutting edge discoveries that were kind of very controversial

819
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:57,120
or inconceivable to somebody 100 years ago are now stuff we teach undergraduates in their first

820
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,960
and second year. True, right. I mean, there was a lot of controversy over calculus, right? That

821
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,600
was considered hard, yeah. Right. These pinnacles of human achievement are now something that

822
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:10,000
thousands and hundreds of thousands of students are learning every single year. And

823
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I hope we continue to progress in that way. We should check back 30 years from now. We'll have

824
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,840
you back on the podcast and we'll check to see whether or not category theory is taught to at

825
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,920
least undergraduates, at least first year students in the math classes. So that's something to look

826
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,160
forward to. Emily Reel, thanks very much for being on the Mindscape podcast. Great. Thanks for having me.
