Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll.

00:03.680 --> 00:09.200
We've done a lot of sort of science on the podcast over the years, as it were. The podcast is old

00:09.200 --> 00:13.200
enough, I can now say over the years. Wow, that's pretty impressive. And doing science, when you

00:13.200 --> 00:18.480
try to talk about science to an audience, which is not necessarily full of specialists in that

00:18.480 --> 00:24.640
particular kind of science, what do you do? How do you talk about science to non-scientists? Well,

00:24.640 --> 00:29.680
the very first thing you do is you strip out all the math, right? You assume that the people

00:29.680 --> 00:34.560
listening are not necessarily familiar with the equations, the symbols, the manipulations that

00:34.560 --> 00:39.840
the professional scientists have to go through to understand their field. But you can nevertheless,

00:39.840 --> 00:44.160
even without the math, you can talk about the concepts that the scientists are dealing with.

00:44.800 --> 00:51.120
This raises a puzzle when the thing you want to talk about is math. We haven't talked about math

00:51.120 --> 00:56.400
as a pure subject that much here on Mindscape. We did talk to Steven Strogatz, who's a professional

00:56.400 --> 01:01.920
mathematician, but he's very close to being a physicist in many ways. We haven't quite ascended

01:01.920 --> 01:08.560
to the truly abstract realms of very pure mathematics. So that's what we're doing here today.

01:08.560 --> 01:14.320
Pure mathematics, no equations, but we're going to try to talk about the concepts that you come

01:14.320 --> 01:20.160
across at the most elevated realms of mathematical thought. Our guest today is Emily Reel, who is

01:20.160 --> 01:26.160
a topologist at Johns Hopkins, and she's a very big believer in being able to conceptualize these

01:26.160 --> 01:32.160
deep mathematical ideas in the simplest and best way possible. So she's a great person to guide us

01:32.160 --> 01:37.120
on this tour. And the foundational idea we're going to be talking about is topology.

01:37.120 --> 01:42.960
Topology is the study of the properties of mathematical spaces that are invariant when

01:42.960 --> 01:49.040
you smush them, when you smoothly deform them a little bit, right? Like if you have some clay

01:49.040 --> 01:54.320
that is molded into a shape, you can talk about the number of holes in the shape of clay that you

01:54.320 --> 01:59.280
have. And then if you move around the clay a little bit, if you don't rip it, the number of holes will

01:59.280 --> 02:05.440
remain constant. So that's a topological invariant. It turns out, and this is where the fun part comes,

02:05.440 --> 02:12.240
that as a mathematician you want to say, okay, what do we mean by characterizing the qualities

02:12.240 --> 02:18.080
of a mathematical space that are invariant under smooth deformations? Well, you can count the

02:18.080 --> 02:24.240
holes. You can also say, well, how many times can I make a path that wraps around the holes in

02:24.240 --> 02:31.680
this particular system? Those kinds of structures turn out to be numbers or transformations or

02:31.680 --> 02:38.160
other things that we can add together and multiply together. And we build these mathematical algebraic

02:38.160 --> 02:44.320
structures by asking the question, how do we topologically characterize these kinds of spaces?

02:44.320 --> 02:50.400
So we're led from topology into algebra. And Emily's going to take us there. We're going to discuss

02:50.400 --> 02:56.480
things like homotopy, groups, rings, group oids, all these words that you're not supposed to have

02:56.480 --> 03:01.600
necessarily been familiar with already. We're going to discuss them. And by the end, we're getting

03:01.600 --> 03:06.960
into what is called category theory. Category theory is something where even the other mathematicians

03:06.960 --> 03:12.960
go, oh, no, that's too abstract for me. Category theory is sort of a general theory of spaces and

03:12.960 --> 03:18.560
structures and maps between them. It provides a different way of thinking about mathematics as a

03:18.560 --> 03:24.000
whole. So I'm a big believer that, you know, math, just like physics, is part of the general

03:24.000 --> 03:29.280
intellectual conversation we should be having. There should be history and economics and math

03:29.280 --> 03:34.880
and physics. And it would be a mistake to exclude math from this overall intellectual discourse.

03:34.880 --> 03:39.920
And I think this conversation is a good example of how we can do it. You know, thinking like a

03:40.000 --> 03:44.640
mathematician gives you new handles on the world just like thinking like a physicist does. And

03:44.640 --> 04:06.080
so I think it's going to be fun. Let's go. Emily Reel, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.

04:06.560 --> 04:10.320
Thank you. You know, I know that as a physicist, as a theoretical physicist,

04:10.320 --> 04:13.840
who thinks about the universe and the many worlds of quantum mechanics and so forth,

04:14.640 --> 04:19.040
I'm often asked, like, what is the point of this? You know, are you making a better cell

04:19.040 --> 04:23.280
phone or are you carrying cancer? Like, why are you doing this? And I have my own answers. But

04:23.280 --> 04:28.240
as a mathematician who works on topology category, things like that, you must also

04:28.240 --> 04:31.680
get this. So what is your, do you have a favorite answer to that kind of question?

04:32.000 --> 04:38.320
Sure. I mean, my dad loves to ask me what the practical applications are about the math I

04:38.320 --> 04:43.360
love to think about. And I think he knows that he's kind of needling me because, you know,

04:43.360 --> 04:48.240
that's just, it's just not the point for all mathematicians. I mean, for some, of course,

04:48.240 --> 04:55.360
it is, you know, there are very important uses of mathematics to make the world a better place.

04:55.360 --> 04:59.280
But I guess a way that mathematics can make the world a better place is by making it a

04:59.280 --> 05:05.280
more interesting place to be a conscious being. And that's how I, or that's what inspires me

05:05.280 --> 05:09.360
to be a mathematician. Yeah. Good. No, I think I, I'm not going to say that's the right answer,

05:09.360 --> 05:13.120
because like you say, different people have different answers, but that's analogous to my

05:13.120 --> 05:17.120
answer. And people ask me about looking for the Higgs boson. And so many of my physics friends

05:17.120 --> 05:22.320
will say like, well, it might someday inspire a new technological something. I'm like, no,

05:22.320 --> 05:26.160
number one, no, it won't. And number two, that's not why we're doing it. We're doing it because

05:26.240 --> 05:31.680
we want to find out what's going on. And if there's an application someday, that'll be a benefit.

05:32.960 --> 05:37.600
The other preliminary question I wanted to ask, I just had a podcast episode a couple of weeks ago

05:37.600 --> 05:43.840
about the philosophy of mathematics. And, you know, there's realism versus non realism,

05:43.840 --> 05:50.400
Platonism versus, I don't know, anti-platonism. I'm told that most working mathematicians are

05:50.400 --> 05:56.320
Platonists. They think of what they study as, in some sense, real. Do you, do you know or care

05:56.320 --> 06:02.480
or have a take on that debate? I certainly don't know as much about it as some of your other

06:02.480 --> 06:09.840
guests, but I agree with that instinct. I mean, the things that I think about and I dream about

06:09.840 --> 06:14.720
and I talk about with my friends feel very real to me. And, you know, I don't expect that I'll

06:14.720 --> 06:19.840
kind of trip over one on my walk to campus, but, you know, they feel as real to me as,

06:20.480 --> 06:25.360
I mean, as anything else. I mean, I guess as I understand it, that, you know, a table that

06:25.360 --> 06:31.840
seems like a solid real thing is not really real either. So, yes, I subscribe to Platonism.

06:32.400 --> 06:36.800
Well, yeah, I mean, there's certainly some structure to math, right? Like we all agree,

06:36.800 --> 06:41.520
given the axioms, where we go and so forth. So there's something there. I actually don't have

06:41.600 --> 06:45.040
a strong opinion one way or the other. That's why I'm quizzing people these days. But

06:45.600 --> 06:50.320
actually, I mean, there's a philosophy of mathematics that's maybe a little closer to

06:50.320 --> 06:54.000
the point of view of category theory, which we'll get into later on, which goes by the name of

06:54.000 --> 07:03.120
structuralism, which says that, you know, what a mathematical object really is, is determined by

07:03.120 --> 07:11.920
the role that it plays within mathematics. So, for example, you know, you could ask,

07:11.920 --> 07:19.040
what are the natural numbers, you know, zero, one, two, three, four, five, and a role that

07:20.720 --> 07:25.520
the natural numbers play within mathematics, I could give it a fancy name, I could say they're

07:25.520 --> 07:29.760
the kind of universal discrete dynamical system. But essentially what that means is,

07:30.640 --> 07:37.120
you know, natural numbers are something you can recursively define functions on. If you have,

07:37.120 --> 07:43.920
if you're trying to define a, you know, sort of a sequence of points or a sequence of real numbers,

07:44.560 --> 07:49.120
what you, a strategy, you know, Fibonacci sequence, for instance, is a famous sequence,

07:49.120 --> 07:56.480
one, one, two, three, five, eight, 13, 21, 34. The relative terms converge to the golden ratio,

07:56.720 --> 08:00.720
there's a lot of fun properties in Fibonacci, but a strategy for defining a sequence

08:00.720 --> 08:05.440
is you define the first term in the sequence, or maybe the first few terms, and then you give

08:06.320 --> 08:12.640
formula or a strategy for producing the next term in the sequence from the terms you have

08:12.640 --> 08:19.120
previously. And the fact that recursion is possible is telling us something very deep

08:19.120 --> 08:25.280
about the role that natural numbers play in mathematics. And so I guess I'm of the point

08:25.280 --> 08:28.800
of view of like, that's what the natural numbers are. They are sort of the thing that you can

08:28.800 --> 08:35.200
recursively define functions on. How, quite how that fits with Platonism isn't entirely clear to me,

08:35.200 --> 08:39.600
but yeah, I don't know, me neither. I did have a guest a while ago, James Ladiman, who's a philosopher,

08:39.600 --> 08:45.040
who says the same thing about physics. He is a structural realist. He thinks that what really

08:45.040 --> 08:49.680
matters are the different structures, not the objects that we attribute these structures to,

08:49.680 --> 08:54.640
relating between. I don't, great. It sounds like he's a category theorist. So it could be.

08:54.640 --> 08:58.800
Aren't we all a category theorist? We're moving in that direction. So we will get to there. But

08:58.800 --> 09:04.720
I think that you had, as we were talking about what to discuss here, I think you had a strategy

09:04.720 --> 09:10.480
that makes perfect sense of starting with topology, because topology is something everyone has heard

09:10.480 --> 09:14.400
of, right? I mean, why don't I, rather than trying to guess, why don't you tell us what you think

09:14.400 --> 09:21.680
the definition of topology is that we could all get our hands on? Great. So topology is the study

09:21.760 --> 09:27.520
of spaces, both, you know, kind of physical geometrical spaces that we move in in the world,

09:27.520 --> 09:34.240
but also spaces that you might imagine that, you know, have some resemblance to, you know,

09:34.240 --> 09:39.840
Euclidean space, three dimensions, two dimensions, one dimension, but are somehow more exotic.

09:40.640 --> 09:49.520
So a topological space could be, you know, for instance, the points on a plane is an example

09:49.600 --> 09:55.280
of a topological space, or you can imagine the points that are on the surface of a sphere,

09:55.280 --> 10:00.480
so the surface of a soccer ball, surface of the earth, or you can imagine the points that are

10:00.480 --> 10:06.960
on the surface of a donut. You can imagine that you're an ant that sort of walks around a donut

10:06.960 --> 10:13.120
and all the different configurations that ant could be in those describe points in a topological

10:13.120 --> 10:20.160
space, and then you can start to compare what those worlds are like. Topology is a realm to do

10:20.160 --> 10:25.520
that. Can I just ask very quickly, when mathematicians use the word space, obviously it doesn't

10:25.520 --> 10:29.600
simply mean the three-dimensional space in which we live. What's the difference between space and set?

10:30.640 --> 10:38.160
Right. So if I wanted to define a topological space formally in mathematics, I would start with a set

10:38.160 --> 10:47.120
of points. So if I wanted to describe three-dimensional Euclidean space, I would start with the set

10:47.120 --> 10:52.640
of points which are determined by three real coordinates, sort of a distance along the x-axis,

10:52.640 --> 10:58.400
a distance along the y-axis, a distance along the z-axis. So that's a set of points. We can

10:58.400 --> 11:03.680
think of them as the points in three-dimensional space. But then what turns a set into a topological

11:03.680 --> 11:09.680
space is also a way to understand distances between points, or more generally understand when

11:09.680 --> 11:15.920
points are nearby and when points are far apart. So that could be a function that tells you how

11:15.920 --> 11:21.520
to compute the distance between two points. That's a metric space, which is an important type of

11:21.520 --> 11:26.480
topological space, or there's a more abstract way to get at the same thing in the absence of a formula

11:26.560 --> 11:35.760
for distances. Okay. And so a line is a space, a circle is a space, a sphere. So for mathematicians,

11:35.760 --> 11:39.520
the sphere is just the surface of the sphere, right? It's not the interior. Like you said, the

11:39.520 --> 11:45.600
two-dimensional sphere is the surface of the ball. And then you could have like a 100-dimensional

11:45.600 --> 11:50.000
sphere or whatever. So there's a lot of spaces we have to play with. You can have Mobius bands. So

11:50.480 --> 11:58.320
that's a space that's kind of like a cylinder. So it's like a toilet paper tube. But imagine you

11:58.960 --> 12:04.800
cut the toilet paper tube sort of long ways from end to end. So now you have just a flat

12:05.440 --> 12:12.960
strip, and then you twist it and then glue it back together. So that is also a space. It's

12:12.960 --> 12:20.720
quite similar to the cylinder, but it's a non-orientable space. It's confusing in a Mobius

12:20.720 --> 12:25.920
strip, whether you're on the inside or the outside. There's no way to decide that. Whereas on, you

12:25.920 --> 12:29.440
know, the toilet paper tube, there's the outside where the toilet paper goes around, and then

12:29.440 --> 12:34.240
there's the inside, which you sort of put on the roll, on the holder. Do you have one of those

12:34.240 --> 12:41.840
Klein bottle sculptures? I have a Klein bottle sculpture. I don't, but right. So a Klein bottle

12:41.840 --> 12:46.400
is a one-dimension higher version of this. And what's interesting about the Klein bottle is,

12:49.680 --> 12:56.720
well, so it's a surface. It's kind of like the surface of a sphere. Let me describe how you

12:56.720 --> 13:04.480
would build a Klein bottle. So you can start with a flat sheet of paper. You would glue two sides

13:04.480 --> 13:12.000
of the paper together. So you're forming now a toilet paper tube. And then, so from there, kind of

13:12.000 --> 13:17.760
a simpler construction that isn't the Klein bottle, as you could just sort of stretch the toilet paper

13:17.760 --> 13:22.720
tube and glue the end circles together. And if you did that, you would get a surface of a doughnut

13:22.720 --> 13:27.360
shape. So that's familiar. The torus. We can use the word torus. It's okay. Okay, we can use the

13:27.360 --> 13:32.320
word torus. So if I want to get a Klein bottle, it's the same idea. I'm going to glue the two ends

13:32.320 --> 13:37.680
of the toilet paper tube together, glue those two circular ends together. But I want to twist

13:38.560 --> 13:45.520
the one. So if I'm gluing, if I'm walking around, when I glue them together, I'm sort of zipping up

13:45.520 --> 13:49.440
the, going counterclockwise around one of the circles and clockwise around the other circle.

13:49.440 --> 13:54.000
But I want to reverse the orientation on one of the circles before doing this. Now, you can't do

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
this in three-dimensional space. So if we were in a fourth dimension, you could actually embed a Klein

14:00.000 --> 14:04.880
bottle into four-dimensional space and do this construction. But there are, there are these

14:04.880 --> 14:09.280
toys that you should, you should just, everyone should just Google and there are these toy glass

14:09.280 --> 14:17.040
versions. And what's fun about it is there's some ambiguity between what space is inside of a Klein

14:17.040 --> 14:21.600
bottle and what is outside. So if you, you have a torus, like a glass doughnut, you could sort of

14:21.600 --> 14:26.640
fill it with jelly. And the jelly is inside the torus. It's not outside, you know, until you bite

14:26.800 --> 14:30.560
it, you're not going to get jelly everywhere. But if you have one of these Klein bottles,

14:31.520 --> 14:36.160
you could try and put, you know, jelly or let's say Kool-Aid inside the Klein bottle. And if you're

14:36.160 --> 14:40.640
not careful, if you sort of flip it upside down and flip it right side up again, it's going to get

14:40.640 --> 14:46.400
all over your, your chest because there's no inside and outside. Yeah. And this is the stock and trade

14:46.400 --> 14:52.480
of topologists, right? So you don't care so much about the individual bumps and wiggles like geometry

14:52.480 --> 14:57.840
cares about. Topology is more loosey-goosey in what it cares about. Exactly. Yeah. Very loosey-goosey.

14:58.560 --> 15:03.440
And so, but the, the other thing to get on the table, I guess, is that there are topological

15:03.440 --> 15:08.960
spaces that we care about. Well, maybe they're inspired by real physical situations, but you

15:08.960 --> 15:13.920
might think that, well, physical space is three dimensional and we can have subsets of that.

15:13.920 --> 15:18.720
Therefore, you know, there's some topological spaces to think about, but not that many. But as

15:18.720 --> 15:22.880
you point out, like there are complicated situations where the space of all possible

15:22.880 --> 15:28.080
configurations of something is an interesting topological space. Yeah, totally. So, I mean,

15:28.080 --> 15:33.840
one of my favorite sources of examples of topological spaces are something called configuration

15:33.840 --> 15:38.080
spaces. And these come up in robotics. They come up in physics where they might be called

15:38.640 --> 15:44.320
state spaces. And exactly as you point out, these can get very high dimension very quick. But let me

15:44.400 --> 15:50.080
mention an example that's small enough that we can dream about it. So, you know, imagine you have

15:50.080 --> 15:56.080
a factory and there's a sort of one-dimensional track on the floor in the factory. So there's a,

15:56.640 --> 16:02.240
there's a strip, essentially. And, you know, maybe it's a kind of a wheel or like a train

16:02.240 --> 16:06.400
track. You can move forward and backwards along that track. And we're going to have two robots

16:06.400 --> 16:12.800
positioned on the track. There's a red robot and a blue robot. So, well, let's actually start with

16:12.800 --> 16:18.960
one robot. So if you wanted to, if you had one robot on a track, then you can describe its positions,

16:19.920 --> 16:24.400
you know, using just kind of a one dimension. It's like an interval. You can have the robot

16:24.400 --> 16:28.400
all the way, one end or all the way at the other end or any place in between. It can move continuously.

16:28.400 --> 16:33.520
So this one-dimensional interval is describing the space of configurations of that robot.

16:34.160 --> 16:40.800
So now let's put two robots on the track, a red one and a blue one. And now there's a space that

16:40.880 --> 16:46.560
describes the configurations of those two robots. I mean, you might think it's a one-dimensional space

16:46.560 --> 16:51.440
because you're still, robots are still on this one-dimensional track. But actually, you know,

16:51.440 --> 16:55.680
you should use kind of one coordinate to keep track of where the red robot is and another

16:55.680 --> 17:01.280
coordinate to keep track of where the blue robot is. And so that is describing the space that's

17:01.280 --> 17:05.440
formed by taking a product of an interval with itself. In other words, it's a square, including

17:05.440 --> 17:12.160
the interior, except the two robots can't be in the same spot. You know, one, you know, that if

17:12.160 --> 17:17.040
these are physical robots, they can't collide into each other. So you have to remove a diagonal

17:17.040 --> 17:24.400
segment from that square. And what you're left is with these two triangular components. The bottom

17:24.400 --> 17:28.880
triangle corresponds to the red robot being on the right of the blue robot. And the top triangle

17:28.880 --> 17:34.000
corresponds to the red robot being on the left of the blue robot. And so what's interesting about

17:34.000 --> 17:38.160
the space, what we can see already by visualizing the configuration space, which is this square

17:38.160 --> 17:43.360
with a diagonal removed from it, is that it's disconnected. Once you've put your robots on the

17:43.360 --> 17:48.400
track, you're not going to be able to swap their orientation with respect to each other.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.360
That's right.

17:49.920 --> 17:54.400
But, you know, if you're designing the factory, you might say, well, that's a little bit undesirable.

17:54.400 --> 17:58.880
I don't have as much flexibility and improvement, perhaps in the design, depending, of course,

17:58.880 --> 18:01.920
what you're trying to do with these robots on this track is you could make a circular track

18:01.920 --> 18:08.880
instead of a, you know, straight track. And if you a circle is also a one dimensional object,

18:08.880 --> 18:12.240
you just sort of move around it going clockwise. There's kind of one direction of motion.

18:13.760 --> 18:19.360
But if you had two robots on a circular track, then what the way you describe their configuration

18:19.360 --> 18:24.400
space is you would take, you know, each robot is some arbitrary point in the circle. We have two

18:24.400 --> 18:30.320
circles, though. So we take the product of those two circles. And this is fun to think about that

18:30.320 --> 18:35.440
actually, the product of two circles corresponds to the points on the surface of a torus again.

18:36.480 --> 18:41.360
So S1 cross S1, the product of two circles are the points on the torus. Again, the robots can't

18:41.360 --> 18:45.120
be on the same point. So what you have to do is you have to imagine you have the surface of a

18:45.120 --> 18:50.480
torus, you built it by gluing together your toilet paper tube. Now you're going to make a diagonal

18:50.480 --> 19:00.320
cut that, it's a cut that goes around sort of both loops in the torus once. So you actually did

19:00.320 --> 19:06.720
this at home last night to test it in the way my toilet paper tube was made. Had a seam exactly

19:06.720 --> 19:11.920
there. So it was easy to see that cut. It's sort of a diagonal cut that moves once around in both

19:11.920 --> 19:16.880
directions. And if you do that, you're left with a connected surface. And that corresponds to the

19:16.960 --> 19:21.600
idea that if you have two robots on a circular track, they can really visit all configurations.

19:21.600 --> 19:28.320
There's no sort of left and right anymore. You can have them in any position. So anyway, this is

19:28.320 --> 19:34.880

and conditions apply. Right, because it's good because what topologists care about are the features

20:40.480 --> 20:47.920
that don't change by like small deformations of the space. So the fact that a space is in two

20:47.920 --> 20:52.720
disconnected components like the original example versus just being one connected component like

20:52.720 --> 20:57.440
the second example, that's the kind of thing that gets topologists very excited. Right, so when I

20:57.440 --> 21:01.600
say circular track, it could be an oval track, it could be a square track, it could be a hexagonal

21:01.600 --> 21:06.080
track from a topologist, those are all the same. The famous thing I bet many people have heard

21:06.080 --> 21:11.040
that to a topologist, a coffee cup is the same as a donut, right? Because they're both tourists.

21:11.760 --> 21:15.920
Right, right. I mean, that's not that's not my favorite example, because

21:17.360 --> 21:21.680
so topologists have different notions of when things are the same that we're alluding to.

21:21.680 --> 21:29.680
And one of the notions of sameness is if two spaces are what's called homeomorphic.

21:29.680 --> 21:35.600
And what homeomorphic means is that there is a sort of one-to-one correspondence between the

21:35.600 --> 21:40.560
points and the space. There's a way, you know, there are two invertible functions, invertible

21:40.560 --> 21:45.040
continuous functions that map all the points on one space to the other and the other to the one.

21:45.040 --> 21:51.760
And so if you have a solid tourist now built out of clay, and you have a solid coffee cup,

21:52.800 --> 21:57.520
you can define one of these homeomorphisms, this sort of one-to-one correspondence between

21:57.520 --> 22:04.640
the points and the tourists and the points in the mug that are continuous so that you're not

22:04.640 --> 22:09.280
tearing the surface as a part or adding new holes where there weren't holes before, that sort of thing.

22:10.720 --> 22:17.440
So, I mean, it's true that topologists consider tourists and a coffee mug to be the same, but

22:17.440 --> 22:22.960
for like really kind of obvious reason, they're just so evidently the same. But there's another

22:22.960 --> 22:27.440
notion of sameness, a weaker notion of sameness that also comes up in topology, which is called

22:27.520 --> 22:32.960
homotopy equivalence. And here are the ideas, two spaces are homotopy equivalent if you can

22:32.960 --> 22:40.240
continuously deform one to another. And so let me give you some examples. So, all of Euclidean

22:40.240 --> 22:44.480
space, you know, three-dimensional Euclidean space is homotopy equivalent to a single point.

22:45.360 --> 22:50.160
So, you could imagine, I think of this homotopy equivalence as like the reverse Big Bang. So,

22:50.720 --> 22:55.360
you imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space, you know, so you have, let's imagine we have the

22:55.360 --> 22:59.280
origin point, so the center of the universe and then all the other points in the universe. I

22:59.280 --> 23:02.080
realize the universe is probably not three-dimensional, but let's just bear with me here.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.640
Also, it doesn't have a center, but that's okay, we're gonna, your method.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.840
And Orinor does have a center, but let's pretend there's a center of the universe and the universe

23:07.840 --> 23:11.920
is three-dimensional. So, in the reverse Big Bang, what I'm going to do is I'm going to continuously

23:11.920 --> 23:16.800
move all the points in the universe back in a straight line to the center of the universe,

23:16.800 --> 23:21.680
to the origin. And they'll move kind of faster, slower depending on how far away they are. So,

23:21.760 --> 23:25.840
at time zero, every point is where it is. And then at time one, they've all

23:25.840 --> 23:31.600
crashed home into the center of the universe. So, that is describing a continuous deformation

23:31.600 --> 23:39.520
that reveals that three-dimensional Euclidean space and the point are the same. So, here's an

23:39.520 --> 23:43.920
example, sort of everyday example of a homotopy equivalence that feels more fun to me than the...

23:45.200 --> 23:49.680
Let me just butt in there because, so just to get it clear, the reason why this is an

23:49.680 --> 23:55.760
interesting example is because the point and three-dimensional space are homotopy equivalent.

23:55.760 --> 24:00.800
They can be... One can be continuously deformed to the other, but they're not homeomorphic because

24:00.800 --> 24:05.680
there's not sort of an equal number of points in them. Yeah, right. There's uncountably infinitely

24:05.680 --> 24:09.200
many points in three-dimensional space, but there's one point in one point space. And yeah,

24:09.200 --> 24:14.240
so this is a cooler, way more destructive notion. I mean, dimensions totally don't matter anymore.

24:14.240 --> 24:18.160
You know, all n-dimensional Euclidean space is also homotopy equivalent to a point.

24:18.560 --> 24:24.000
Yeah. So, an example, an everyday example that is kind of like that is to a topologist,

24:24.000 --> 24:29.920
a pair of pants and a thong are the same. You can imagine a homotopy equivalence that sort of,

24:30.800 --> 24:36.560
you know, shrinks sort of vertically, I guess, you know, and just leaves the thong from the

24:36.560 --> 24:42.400
pair of pants. And this is the... So, the point is that there are different ways of expressing

24:42.400 --> 24:47.040
the idea of sameness, depending on your sort of level of focus on what you care about.

24:47.040 --> 24:52.000
Yeah, totally, totally. And this is very pervasive in mathematics. You know, mathematicians

24:52.880 --> 24:56.560
love trying to understand the sense in which things are the same and it's often a pretty loose

24:56.560 --> 25:02.240
sense. So, I had a very, very brief career, in fact, as a hack topologist when I was in graduate

25:02.240 --> 25:07.760
school and I needed to calculate the homotopy of various things that appear in particle physics

25:07.760 --> 25:11.760
because we have these things called topological defects, right, which are very important from

25:11.760 --> 25:16.160
the early universe. None of the things I calculated turn it out to be relevant to the real world,

25:16.160 --> 25:21.760
but, you know, that's the risk that we take when we do these things. But it gets us into, you know,

25:22.800 --> 25:26.960
so far it's been fun, homotopy, you know, smoothly deforming things into each other,

25:26.960 --> 25:30.960
but now we want to be a little bit more rigorous about it. We want to characterize,

25:31.760 --> 25:37.360
we want to use this notion of smoothly deforming one thing into another to characterize the topology

25:37.360 --> 25:43.600
of different spaces, right? I mean, is in some sense our job to sort of characterize all topological

25:43.600 --> 25:50.240
spaces? Yeah, exactly. And a way to, a classical problem, which is a good way to visualize this,

25:50.240 --> 25:56.320
is you can ask how many different surfaces are there, you know, sort of in this sort of very

25:56.320 --> 26:03.680
flexible sense. So, not necessarily just, so for instance, is we've described a few different

26:03.680 --> 26:10.400
surfaces. There's the sort of surface of a sphere. There's a surface of a torus. You can have many

26:10.400 --> 26:14.800
hold, the torus was the donut shape. You can imagine having many hold donuts, they're like,

26:14.800 --> 26:18.560
you know, you're baking a tray of donuts, but you've put them too close to each other. And so

26:18.560 --> 26:22.480
they've all kind of congealed and there's, you know, one donut with three holes in it, you know,

26:22.480 --> 26:28.960
that's another surface. And there's a classification question, you know, how can we tell that these

26:28.960 --> 26:35.920
spaces are really different? I mean, they seem different, perhaps maybe I'm giving away my

26:35.920 --> 26:39.520
intuition, but they seem different, you know, how, but how do we prove that they're different?

26:39.520 --> 26:43.680
Because we've seen that these wildly different spaces are, in some sense, the same.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.320
Yeah. So, so how do we do that?

26:48.080 --> 26:54.640
So, yeah, so, so the idea is, I mean, this, this is a hard question to answer geometrically, because

26:55.200 --> 26:59.040
just because you can't imagine a continuous deformation of one space to the other doesn't

26:59.040 --> 27:08.880
mean it doesn't exist. So, strategy is to bring algebra into the story somehow and give a way to

27:08.960 --> 27:18.000
assign a number or some other kind of algebraic structure to a topological space. And if,

27:18.720 --> 27:23.440
in a way, that would give the same answer if the spaces were homotopy equivalent. So,

27:24.480 --> 27:31.280
so the homology groups or homotopy groups that there are various different constructions you

27:31.280 --> 27:36.560
can do. And it's, it's easy to prove that if the spaces have continuously deformable into each other,

27:36.560 --> 27:40.400
they'll produce the same invariance. And so, if you happen to get different invariance,

27:40.400 --> 27:43.920
then you know that they were different. Right. So, actually, go ahead.

27:45.040 --> 27:48.080
Well, I can give an example of this. Yeah, exactly, do that.

27:48.640 --> 27:54.240
So, what I'm going to try and argue for you is that the surface of a sphere,

27:54.240 --> 27:59.840
so the surface of a soccer ball, is a different space than the surface of a donut. So, a torus

27:59.840 --> 28:05.360
and a sphere are different topological spaces. And just to make sure we're imagining these spaces,

28:05.360 --> 28:11.360
again, you know, imagine you're an ant walking around the surface of a sphere, that's one space,

28:11.360 --> 28:15.360
the different positions the ant could be, or you can imagine an ant walking around the surface of

28:15.360 --> 28:19.040
a donut. Not the interior in either case, just the surface. Not the interior in either case,

28:19.040 --> 28:23.280
right. The ant, the ant can't eat the donut or eat the sphere, the ant is sort of stuck on the

28:23.280 --> 28:32.080
surface. And it can't like jump off either, it's, you know, okay. So, right. So, the invariant that

28:32.160 --> 28:36.400
I'm going to use to prove that these are different is something called the fundamental group,

28:36.400 --> 28:43.360
that is, it's a, and what it's counting essentially. So, in each, it's for convenience,

28:43.360 --> 28:48.000
I'm going to pick a point on each of these spaces. These spaces are connected. So,

28:48.000 --> 28:52.960
picking a point is not a big deal. So, pick whichever one you want. We'll take the north pole on the

28:54.320 --> 28:59.040
sphere and any point at all on the torus. And what the fundamental group is going to

28:59.040 --> 29:04.800
calculate is the number of essentially different ways that the ant can walk from this home base

29:04.800 --> 29:12.480
point, walk around on the surface and come back to the home base point. So, the subtlety there,

29:12.480 --> 29:16.720
as I said, the number of essentially different ways. So, I mean, they're uncountably infinitely

29:16.720 --> 29:21.680
many ways an ant can walk around the surfaces, but what I'm asking are they essentially different?

29:21.680 --> 29:25.520
And so, let's set aside the sphere example for now. Let's start by thinking about the surface

29:25.520 --> 29:30.720
of the donut. Okay. So, an example of two ways that are essentially different is we can imagine

29:31.280 --> 29:37.280
starting at our home base point and walking, you know, say in a counterclockwise direction

29:38.000 --> 29:43.120
around the loop that goes through the sort of donut hole. If you put a donut hole inside the

29:43.120 --> 29:48.800
donut, that's, you can imagine walking, it's sort of been a vertical. The short way around, basically.

29:49.280 --> 29:53.040
The short way around, great. So, that's one way the ant could walk.

29:55.920 --> 30:03.360
Or the ant could walk, let's say, tracing the same trajectory, but going in reverse orientation,

30:03.360 --> 30:09.920
going backwards rather than forwards. So, those are fundamentally different. And what I mean

30:09.920 --> 30:15.360
by fundamentally different is there's no way to continuously deform the first trajectory

30:16.000 --> 30:22.640
into the second trajectory while staying on the surface of the donut. If I could sort of slice

30:22.640 --> 30:29.680
through, you know, where the dough bit of the donut is, I could do that. I could sort of cut

30:29.680 --> 30:34.400
through the bit that's not on the surface, but that's not allowed. So, walking in the surface,

30:34.400 --> 30:37.440
once the ant decides it's going clockwise rather than counterclockwise,

30:39.440 --> 30:44.560
those are different choices that the ant can make. In fact, they're homotopically

30:44.560 --> 30:49.200
inequivalent, right? So, because you cannot continuously deform one into another.

30:50.480 --> 30:54.720
What's cool is you can actually enumerate all of the different choices. So,

30:54.720 --> 30:58.400
another different trajectory the ant could take is it could walk the long way around. So, let's say,

30:58.400 --> 31:03.600
staying on the top and going clockwise or going counterclockwise. Or it can do some sort of

31:04.240 --> 31:09.360
combination where it loops, you know, some number of times through the center circle while also

31:09.360 --> 31:17.760
traversing the long way around. And there's a way to enumerate all of these essentially

31:17.760 --> 31:22.000
different trajectories. What you need are two different integers, essentially. One integer

31:22.000 --> 31:28.080
that's describing the number of times you go in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction around

31:28.080 --> 31:33.280
the short loop. And then another integer is describing the number of ways to go counterclockwise

31:33.280 --> 31:38.560
or clockwise depending on whether it's positive or negative around the long loop. And you can prove

31:38.560 --> 31:48.800
that this pair of integers enumerates all possible trajectories. So, on the sphere,

31:49.600 --> 31:55.120
it's actually quite a lot simpler. So, if you have, you can imagine any path the ant might

31:55.120 --> 31:58.720
take on the surface of a sphere from the north pole to the north pole, kind of wandering around

31:58.720 --> 32:06.320
any which way. And you could kind of shrink that trajectory in a continuous way.

32:06.640 --> 32:12.880
Sort of so that it gets smaller and smaller and smaller. So, if it in fact goes all the way to

32:12.880 --> 32:17.040
the south pole, maybe it shrinks a little bit so it only goes to the equator and then maybe it

32:17.040 --> 32:22.400
shrinks a little more so it stays north of the Tropic of Cancer and so on and so forth. And

32:22.960 --> 32:27.760
eventually all of the trajectories are deformable to just the ants sitting at the north pole and

32:27.760 --> 32:33.920
never moving at all. So, there there's only one trajectory that the ant can make. And that's

32:33.920 --> 32:39.840
the proof somehow that these two spaces are not the same. Which is wonderful because it took

32:39.840 --> 32:44.480
us on a little journey. I actually want to dig into this because on the one hand we're not surprised

32:44.480 --> 32:48.960
that the sphere and the tourists are topologically different, but it was a bit of an effort there

32:48.960 --> 32:55.360
to actually show it, right? Even in that case where we had things under control. And in doing that,

32:55.360 --> 32:59.280
you know, you stumble across, so you ask the question, how many different ways are there to

32:59.280 --> 33:05.200
sort of do this path that returns to itself? A loop, right? A closed circle in this space.

33:05.200 --> 33:12.720
And in the case of the tourists, you just uncovered this pair of integers, the number of

33:12.720 --> 33:16.800
times you go around the short way, the number of times you go around the long way. And integers,

33:16.800 --> 33:21.680
not to not to get too fancy about it, now that's algebra. That's not geometry or topology or

33:21.680 --> 33:28.240
anything. Like, roughly speaking, mathematicians are either geometers and they like space or their

33:28.240 --> 33:34.000
algebraists and they like equations, right? But an algebraic structure appeared here somehow.

33:35.840 --> 33:40.560
Right. I think, you know, this is just the tale of complexity in the modern world. Like,

33:40.560 --> 33:45.280
everybody has to be everything these days. So even if your heart isn't with geometry,

33:45.280 --> 33:50.400
you have to use some algebra. Well, I want to just take advantage of your being here to dig

33:50.400 --> 33:56.640
into this a little bit more. I mean, we asked this question about how many ways you can draw a

33:56.640 --> 34:01.840
circle, roughly speaking, in the tourists. And there's a lot of ways, but then there's this

34:01.840 --> 34:08.800
hidden structure in that if you have a circle going around once in one direction and another

34:08.800 --> 34:13.760
circle just doing the same thing, you can add them together in some sense, right? And that's

34:13.760 --> 34:20.320
the beginning of algebra. Am I too dramatic there? Yeah, that's exactly right. So a more,

34:22.240 --> 34:25.680
I mean, I've described this in describing the fundamental group, I said, you know,

34:25.680 --> 34:31.200
let's imagine we have a home base point where they, and we're going to consider the ant walking

34:31.200 --> 34:35.200
in these little loops from the home base to the home base, but it's actually maybe more natural

34:35.200 --> 34:40.400
to not have a home base point because, you know, I don't know where it would be on the surface of

34:40.400 --> 34:45.360
a tourist, for instance. So another way to think about this sort of algebraic structure is you

34:45.360 --> 34:51.760
can imagine an ant walking from any point P on the surface to any other point Q on the surface,

34:51.840 --> 34:56.560
it, you know, takes some path. And then later, you know, maybe the ant is tired and it takes

34:56.560 --> 35:00.800
a nap, but then later it wakes up and then it walks from the point Q to some other point R.

35:01.760 --> 35:06.240
And what you're referring to is you could then compose those two paths, compose those two

35:07.120 --> 35:11.920
trajectories and then get a path directly from P to R. So if you can walk from P to Q and walk

35:11.920 --> 35:16.880
from Q to R, you can compose those two walks and get from P to R. And that's the beginning. So this

35:16.880 --> 35:24.240
is a composition operation on the paths and the surface of a tourist or on any space, paths in

35:24.240 --> 35:34.640
any space. And really the sort of invariant that more exactly describes the algebra that's hidden

35:34.640 --> 35:40.080
in the geometry is something called the fundamental groupoid or the fundamental infinity groupoid,

35:40.080 --> 35:45.280
which is not a group, which is a type of mathematical object we teach undergraduates,

35:45.840 --> 35:50.720
but an sort of infinite dimensional analog of a group and infinity groupoid, which is a,

35:50.720 --> 35:55.840
you know, sort of frontier of research level mathematics. Right. I think that it, look, if

35:55.840 --> 36:00.720
people are going to listen to this entire podcast episode, I want them to come away knowing what

36:00.720 --> 36:04.320
an infinity groupoid is. I think that's going to be something that they'll be able to impress their

36:04.320 --> 36:08.640
friends with at cocktail parties and so forth. So you but to go very slowly to get there, you know,

36:08.640 --> 36:13.920
you mentioned the fundamental group, which is the collection of the circles we started with. So

36:13.920 --> 36:25.520
what's a group? Right. So a group is, I mean, a way to, I mean, this, like it, there's this,

36:28.400 --> 36:33.040
there's this metaphor of the blind men and the elephant and, you know, somebody's holding,

36:33.040 --> 36:37.360
somebody's touching the trunk, somebody's touching one of the legs, somebody's touching the tail and

36:37.360 --> 36:40.480
have a completely different perspective of it. And that's, that's how I'm thinking about groups.

36:40.480 --> 36:48.800
So it's like really hard to know how to start. But, you know, a group in this context is a set.

36:48.800 --> 36:54.800
Here it's the collection of all different loops that aunt could take walking through some space,

36:55.520 --> 37:01.040
together with a composition operation. So it's performing one loop and then following it by

37:01.040 --> 37:05.200
another loop that can be understood as a loop. Even though you come back through the center,

37:05.200 --> 37:12.800
it's still a loop and then satisfying some, you know, sort of very natural axioms. So if you're

37:12.800 --> 37:18.320
walking along a loop, you could always reverse your trajectory and walk back in the other direction.

37:18.320 --> 37:23.120
And that's an undoing somehow of the process. So every element in a group has an inverse

37:23.760 --> 37:29.520
that if you compose with it, it gets back to sort of where you started. And a few sort of simple

37:29.520 --> 37:35.680
axioms like that. So it's kind of a, it's a stripped down version of, you know, the integers

37:35.680 --> 37:39.680
or something like that, right? Where the integers, you can add them together. So the integers are

37:39.680 --> 37:44.720
an example of a group, right? Right. Integers with addition is an example of a group. Absolutely.

37:44.720 --> 37:48.400
That's right. Not with multiplication. Matrices with multiplication is an example of a group.

37:49.280 --> 37:55.040
Matrices with addition is an example of a group. So I have to say something about the dimensions

37:55.040 --> 38:02.320
to make those examples work. But okay. And the physicists love group theory because symmetries

38:02.320 --> 38:07.120
are a group, right? Like rotations and translations and things like that. Yeah, absolutely. So another

38:07.120 --> 38:13.600
perspective on groups, if we sort of move around the elephant is a group is an axiomatization of

38:15.120 --> 38:20.960
the symmetries of an object. So, so, or the different configurations that an object might be.

38:20.960 --> 38:26.960
So let me, let me explain what a symmetry is. So, so imagine you have a twin mattress and you know

38:26.960 --> 38:30.480
that you're supposed to kind of flip your, your mattress occasionally, because I guess it's good

38:30.480 --> 38:35.120
for the life of the mattress. And so you might wonder, like, how many different ways are there

38:35.120 --> 38:39.360
to flip the mattress? How many different configurations could the mattress be in? And

38:40.560 --> 38:45.760
well, it's the mattress, one option is whatever the mattress is when you start it. Then you could

38:46.400 --> 38:51.680
sort of rotate it head to toe. So you're sort of switching the head and the toe, but the top

38:51.680 --> 39:00.720
stays the same. That's one move. You could also flip it sort of side to side. So I'm keeping the

39:00.720 --> 39:05.680
head at the head and the toe at the toe, but I'm switching the top and the bottom. Yep. Or you

39:05.680 --> 39:09.840
could combine those two operations. And the effect of this is the head is now where the toe was and

39:09.840 --> 39:16.160
the toes were the head and the top and bottom surface has also flipped. So a group is recording

39:16.160 --> 39:22.480
on the one hand, the four different positions that the mattress could be in, but also how these

39:22.480 --> 39:28.080
different flipping operations that I described compose to each other. So each of those flips

39:29.120 --> 39:33.360
is an order two element of the group, meaning if you perform the same move twice, you get the

39:33.360 --> 39:39.600
mattress back to where you started. If you do any two different of the flips, you'll get the

39:39.680 --> 39:44.400
third one, which is not a typical property of a group, but it's special to this one, which is,

39:44.400 --> 39:50.000
goes by the name, the client for group. This group does not have a generator, meaning that

39:50.720 --> 39:55.040
there's not one operation you can do over and over again that will take you all the way

39:55.040 --> 39:58.880
through the group. And this is why it's hard to remember how to flip your mattress because

39:59.520 --> 40:03.920
you have to remember sort of how you flipped it last month. So you don't just do the same operation

40:03.920 --> 40:09.200
and again and get back to where you were the month before. So the integers do have a generator.

40:09.280 --> 40:13.120
You just add one and then you can get all the integers either by doing that or undoing it.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.680
Yeah. Add one or negative one, you get all the way through everything. So yes,

40:15.680 --> 40:20.640
the integers are cyclic group, which have a single generator, absolutely, but client for group is not.

40:22.400 --> 40:26.160
Right. So the integers may be two people who are not group theory,

40:26.160 --> 40:31.120
Fischinados are a nice little paradigm, but it's important that groups can be very different. So

40:31.120 --> 40:36.400
this is a finite group, this mattress flipping group, right? It's only how many elements are

40:36.400 --> 40:41.680
there in the mattress? Yeah, four elements. Okay. Yeah. All right. And there's, so I mean,

40:41.680 --> 40:46.800
these groups are super cool and really tell you something profound about geometry. So

40:47.360 --> 40:53.120
you might have heard of the platonic solids, which are the three dimensional figures that you can get

40:53.120 --> 41:00.000
by gluing together regular two dimensional figures. So a regular two dimensional figure is like a

41:00.000 --> 41:05.920
triangle or a square or pentagon or a hexagon where all the sides have the same length,

41:05.920 --> 41:10.480
all the angles are the same and so on and so forth. And there are infinitely many of these

41:10.480 --> 41:15.520
because there's a heptagon and an octagon and a nonagon for any natural number N,

41:15.520 --> 41:21.200
you can get a plain figure with N sides. So you might wonder how many of these regular

41:21.200 --> 41:29.920
platonic solids are, how many different shapes you can get by gluing together, say triangles or

41:29.920 --> 41:34.800
gluing together squares or gluing together pentagons or gluing together hexagons maybe.

41:35.360 --> 41:40.960
And you can prove in fact that there are only finitely many. In fact, there are five of them

41:41.600 --> 41:48.320
using group theory by studying the symmetries, the sort of orthogonal groups, the special

41:48.320 --> 41:52.320
orthogonal groups that describe the different configurations of these hypothetical shapes.

41:52.320 --> 41:55.760
Before even knowing they exist, you can limit the possible configurations.

41:57.200 --> 41:58.960
But clearly that's not what Plato did.

41:59.200 --> 42:07.440
I don't know, maybe somewhere like buried in Plato's intuition. But another fun fact is,

42:07.440 --> 42:12.080
so the five, there's something called the tetrahedron, which is built from triangles. And

42:12.080 --> 42:16.560
then there's the cube, which is that's the most familiar one built from squares. Then there's

42:16.560 --> 42:23.040
the octahedron also built from triangles. And then the dodecahedron and the icosahedron. And

42:23.040 --> 42:27.280
even though I named five things, in a sense there's kind of only three of them because

42:28.240 --> 42:32.480
there's this duality relationship between the platonic solids, which you might have seen. If

42:32.480 --> 42:40.720
you take a cube, so it's got four, so it's sorry, its faces are squares, there are six of them,

42:40.720 --> 42:46.080
and they are glued together along 12 different edges, and there are eight corners. And what I'm

42:46.080 --> 42:52.240
going to do is I'm going to build a new platonic solid by replacing each of the corners by a face,

42:52.320 --> 42:58.320
and each face by a corner. And what you get in that, just by kind of connecting everything up,

42:58.320 --> 43:04.800
is an octahedron, so one of the other platonic solids. And so there's a duality relationship

43:04.800 --> 43:09.280
between the cube and the octahedron, and also between the dodecahedron and the icosahedron,

43:09.280 --> 43:13.680
and between the tetrahedron and itself. And those are reflected by their symmetry groups.

43:13.680 --> 43:18.320
So because of this duality relationship, the symmetry group that describes the configurations

43:18.320 --> 43:25.840
of the cube is the same isomorphic to, same shape as the symmetry group of the octahedron, and so

43:25.840 --> 43:29.600
on. Anyone who played Dungeons and Dragons knows about the platonic solids because they have a

43:29.600 --> 43:33.040
dice, but they don't know about the duality relations. So now that's good, that's something

43:33.040 --> 43:39.520
else that they have in their bag now. I'm only going to do this at great risk, but I figure,

43:39.520 --> 43:44.800
like, all right, while we've talked about groups, why don't we also explain rings and fields to

43:44.800 --> 43:48.800
the audience, since these are the other sort of algebraic structures that mathematicians love to

43:48.800 --> 43:54.480
throw around. Yeah, absolutely. So I mean, what's funny is, you know, after a while, you kind of

43:54.480 --> 43:58.320
forget that these terms refer to other things. Sorry, when I say field, I mean, I definitely

43:58.320 --> 44:01.600
think about the mathematical field before. I remember that's like also the thing that's

44:01.600 --> 44:09.040
out the window, but right. So a group is describing a setting where you have, you know,

44:09.040 --> 44:13.600
a collection of objects, and you have one composition operation to combine them together.

44:13.600 --> 44:19.200
So if we have the integers, we can think about addition. If you add two integers, you get another

44:19.200 --> 44:25.520
integer. But, you know, there are other binary operations on the integers that come up, you

44:25.520 --> 44:30.560
know, multiplication, for instance. And a ring is a setting where you have two operations,

44:30.560 --> 44:36.640
an addition operation or an addition like operation and a multiplication like operation.

44:36.640 --> 44:44.800
And they interact in ways that are sort of familiar for the integers. So if I, you can

44:44.800 --> 44:51.840
understand, there's a distributivity property that says if I add two integers together, and then I

44:51.840 --> 44:57.200
multiply by something, it's the same as multiplying first and then adding. And there are a few axioms

44:57.200 --> 45:02.480
like that. So what's cool about, I mean, you might ask, like, why do we bother we like everybody

45:02.480 --> 45:07.840
knows what the integers are? Why do I need this abstract concept of a ring? And that's a totally

45:07.840 --> 45:16.080
fair question. But a really fun, or it's kind of interesting fact is there's a very deep analogy

45:16.080 --> 45:23.520
between the integers and polynomials. So, so a polynomial is like this, this is sort of the

45:23.520 --> 45:29.920
thing that you would meet in a high school algebra class. So you have a variable X, an indeterminate

45:29.920 --> 45:36.560
variable X, and then you can form a polynomial by sort of adding up X's and multiplying X's and

45:36.560 --> 45:45.840
then throwing in real numbers as the coefficients. So the polynomial might be like 5x minus 5x plus,

45:45.840 --> 45:52.560
I don't know, 17x squared plus pi x cubed, because we can have real numbers as coefficients,

45:52.560 --> 46:01.360
minus 3. So that's a polynomial in a single variable X. And polynomials also form a ring. If

46:01.360 --> 46:07.120
you have two polynomials, you can add them together, you can multiply them. There's sort of rules for

46:07.120 --> 46:12.400
doing this that you might have learned in a high school algebra class. And those ring, the ring of

46:12.400 --> 46:17.200
polynomials with coefficients in a field, which we'll get to what a field is later on, coefficients

46:17.200 --> 46:22.640
in the real numbers. And the ring of integers are very, are very quite similar as rings. They're

46:22.640 --> 46:28.160
both, they have a division algorithm. You can do sort of long division with polynomials like with rings.

46:30.000 --> 46:35.840
All the ideal elements are principles. And so, I mean, that's the sort of thing that's of interest

46:35.840 --> 46:39.760
to mathematicians are these kind of deep analogies between structures that are superficially quite

46:39.760 --> 46:43.680
different. Well, and what's the difference between a ring and a field? Because they're kind of similar.

46:44.320 --> 46:51.920
Right. So a field is like a ring, it has two binary operations. But if we go back to the

46:51.920 --> 46:56.160
ring of integers, there's a pretty big difference between the addition rule and the multiplication

46:56.160 --> 47:05.040
rule. So if I, in that, every addition, every element has an additive inverse. So if I pick

47:05.040 --> 47:11.680
my favorite integer, you know, 17, there's another integer, negative 17, that when I add them together,

47:11.760 --> 47:16.640
I get zero, which is the identity for the addition operation. But that doesn't work for

47:16.640 --> 47:21.760
multiplication. If I pick my favorite integer again, 17, there's no integer I can multiply

47:23.360 --> 47:29.680
17 by to get back to one, which is the multiplicative identity. Right. So that's what distinguishes a

47:29.680 --> 47:35.440
ring where you don't necessarily have multiplicative inverses from a field. In a field, you do have

47:35.440 --> 47:39.680
an inverse to both the multiplication and the addition operation. You sort of assuming you're

47:39.680 --> 47:44.400
not trying to divide by zero, that number quite works. So things like the rational numbers,

47:44.400 --> 47:49.920
which throw in these multiplicative inverses or the real numbers are fields in addition to being

47:49.920 --> 47:56.160
rings. And does the existence of the number zero get you in trouble? Because it doesn't have an

47:56.160 --> 48:03.440
inverse? Yeah. So in a field, you have to treat zero as a kind of special case. So in a field,

48:03.440 --> 48:08.800
you have to, your zero and your one can't be the same. Otherwise, the whole thing kind of collapses.

48:09.440 --> 48:13.920
Zero will not have a multiplicative inverse, but every other element has to. Got it. Okay.

48:13.920 --> 48:18.160
And so when we started, we started this little journey, this whole sidetrack, because we were

48:18.160 --> 48:24.080
thinking about the torus and its topology. And we found that the space of all the little loops,

48:24.080 --> 48:32.240
the ant could walk on, formed a group. Are there examples where we associate rings or fields with

48:32.240 --> 48:39.680
topological invariance? That's a good question. I don't know that that's commonly done. And I

48:39.680 --> 48:47.200
think the reason is that groups are just so rich, you know, but, you know, a single group will not

48:47.200 --> 48:52.800
capture the full data of a topological space. I mean, really, what you have to do is have introduced

48:52.800 --> 48:57.520
lots of different groups that are measuring lots of different things. So the fundamental group

48:57.520 --> 49:03.920
tells you about sort of loops in the space and whether you can, if you sort of walk along a

49:03.920 --> 49:08.800
circular path in the space, can you fill that in with a disk? You know, could you,

49:11.840 --> 49:14.720
I guess I don't know how to say it any better than that. That's a good way to say it.

49:14.720 --> 49:18.880
Can you contract it? You know, if you have sort of a wire ring, is there, could you put sort of a

49:18.880 --> 49:23.680
soap bubble on it somehow so that the surface of the soap bubble lives within the space that you

49:23.680 --> 49:29.280
were talking about? So that's not possible if you're walking the short way around on a torus,

49:29.280 --> 49:33.760
because the soap bubble would have to kind of cut through the dough, and that's not on the surface.

49:33.760 --> 49:38.880
But it is on the surface of a sphere, you could just kind of, you know, paint over the disk.

49:40.720 --> 49:45.200
So that's measuring this kind of one-dimensional holds, I guess, is the

49:47.280 --> 49:51.760
area that's bounded by a one-dimensional sphere. But as we mentioned, there are kind of spheres

49:51.760 --> 49:57.360
in higher dimensions. So you could ask, if you have a balloon inside your surface,

49:57.360 --> 50:02.320
can that be filled in with sand sort of staying within the surface? And that's a

50:02.320 --> 50:05.520
two-dimensional analog of the same question. And there's a question like that in all

50:06.400 --> 50:14.320
positive integer dimensions. And that family of groups describes the full homotopy type

50:14.320 --> 50:18.560
of a space. A single group does not, but if you have this sort of infinitely many groups that

50:18.560 --> 50:23.520
it does. One of the things that I say just very casually to people who are non-mathematicians is

50:23.520 --> 50:29.040
that you might think that mathematicians spend all their time thinking about mathematical objects,

50:29.040 --> 50:32.720
like spheres or toruses or whatever. But really, they're thinking about maps

50:32.720 --> 50:38.480
between the different objects. So I guess it's fair to say that first thing, the fundamental group

50:38.480 --> 50:46.720
is maps from circles into the space you care about. Then there's the set of maps from spheres,

50:46.720 --> 50:51.280
and then the set of maps from three spheres, and it clearly generalizes to infinite numbers.

50:51.840 --> 50:58.080
Yeah, absolutely. But there's something special about the groups. You don't get fields or rings,

50:58.080 --> 51:02.880
which have two different binary operations on them. I guess the last thing that I have in that

51:02.880 --> 51:08.080
angle is, is there something special about fields and rings that have two binary operations that

51:08.080 --> 51:14.080
it's worth stopping there? Can we define three binary operations on a set and make hyper-rings

51:14.080 --> 51:23.280
or something like that? Sure. Algebra is a very flexible subject. To define what an algebra is

51:23.280 --> 51:27.760
in full generality, you need the collection of elements that you're considering, and then you

51:27.760 --> 51:33.520
can specify arbitrarily many operations with arbitrary arities, and you can specify arbitrarily

51:33.520 --> 51:39.840
many rules between them. The subject of universal algebra invites you to consider examples like that.

51:40.160 --> 51:46.560
Let's invite listeners in the audience who are inclined in that direction to follow study universal

51:46.560 --> 51:51.840
algebras. We're going to go back to the topology and the groups. You made a statement there.

51:51.840 --> 51:59.520
I just want to make sure that I get it clear. If I figure out the set of all ways that I can map

52:00.800 --> 52:09.040
circles and spheres and three-dimensional spheres, etc., into a space, I have not specified its

52:09.120 --> 52:15.040
topology completely, but I have specified its homotopy type topology completely, which is a

52:15.040 --> 52:20.640
slightly weaker thing. Is that right? That's right. Yeah. Okay. Do we know the answer to the

52:20.640 --> 52:28.800
general question of how to completely specify the topology of a space? Right. The classical

52:28.800 --> 52:33.200
approach to that, and it's kind of a topology, but let's imagine it's a theorem as opposed to a

52:33.200 --> 52:38.480
topology. If you restrict to well-behaved spaces, it's a theorem, and if you take general spaces,

52:38.480 --> 52:44.240
it's kind of a topology. The classical approach to this is exactly what you're saying. You describe

52:44.240 --> 52:52.720
what's called the nth homotopy group as the collection of maps from the n sphere into your

52:52.720 --> 52:58.720
space. Then because it's a group, you need a composition operation, which for two spheres,

52:58.720 --> 53:07.680
I can describe the composition. If I have a map from a two-dimensional sphere into a space and a

53:07.680 --> 53:12.880
map from another two-dimensional sphere into the space, and these maps are based so there's

53:12.880 --> 53:18.640
the north pole and they send them to the same point in the space, you could imagine taking

53:18.640 --> 53:24.400
another two-dimensional sphere and then collapsing the equator to a single point. If you had a balloon

53:24.960 --> 53:29.280
and you collapse the points on the equator, you sort of squeeze at them carefully so it doesn't

53:29.280 --> 53:33.360
pop. Now you have a single point. Now what you look like is something that's called a bouquet

53:33.360 --> 53:38.480
of spheres. It's sort of two different spheres that are glued together along the point where

53:38.480 --> 53:42.720
the equator used to be. You could sort of map from that into the space because you have two

53:42.720 --> 53:49.680
different maps into the space that have a common point. The combination of that operation is how

53:49.680 --> 53:55.040
you define the composition here. There's an analog of that in all dimensions. This is the

53:55.040 --> 54:01.040
classical approach to saying what is a space algebraically? What are some algebra stuff that

54:01.040 --> 54:04.960
tell you everything that you would want to know about the homotopy type of the space?

54:05.760 --> 54:12.000
But a modern approach goes back to the idea of the fundamental group but replaces it by

54:13.040 --> 54:17.280
something called the fundamental infinity groupoid. Since I promised I would tell

54:17.280 --> 54:23.680
listeners what an infinity groupoid is, let me do it now. I like this because this feels like

54:23.920 --> 54:31.040
a much more natural way to describe the space. Again, the fundamental groupoid,

54:32.240 --> 54:35.440
depending on your point of view either is a theorem or it's a tautology,

54:35.440 --> 54:42.640
really does capture the full homotopy type of the space. It's some algebraic structure where I'm

54:42.640 --> 54:48.080
going to start with the set of all points in the space. The topology, I've forgotten about

54:48.080 --> 54:53.600
distances and stuff. I'm just remembering the set of points because in algebra I have sets

54:53.600 --> 54:58.560
and stuff I don't have geometry. I just remember the set of the points in the space.

54:59.200 --> 55:04.400
Then what I'm going to throw in is the data of every possible path between any points in the space.

55:05.040 --> 55:10.720
This is going to be a very big thing, by the way. We recover now every possible path that

55:10.720 --> 55:14.000
an ant could take between points in the space plus the composition.

55:14.560 --> 55:19.280
I mean, I gotta say that mathematicians use the word data in a different sense than physicists

55:20.160 --> 55:24.320
Oh, yeah. I mean, all of our sets are infinite. It's fine. No problems here.

55:24.320 --> 55:28.400
When you say the data of a path, you mean whatever information is required to

55:28.400 --> 55:30.720
specify that path among the space of all the paths.

55:31.440 --> 55:34.560
Right. We have all the points in the space. We have all the paths in the space.

55:34.560 --> 55:38.880
When we were thinking about paths before, when we were talking about the torus, we were talking

55:38.880 --> 55:44.080
about, well, we only want to consider paths up to being essentially the same,

55:44.080 --> 55:47.760
sort of continuously deformable. We're not doing that here. We're literally remembering

55:47.760 --> 55:51.120
every single path, every path as a distinct path. Good.

55:51.120 --> 55:55.360
But we are also going to remember data of these continuous deformations.

55:56.160 --> 56:02.240
There's a notion of path between paths. If a path is a map from an interval into the space,

56:02.240 --> 56:07.440
this is a continuous map from a square into the space. An interval times an interval is a square.

56:09.120 --> 56:12.400
So a map from a square into space can be understood as a path between paths,

56:12.400 --> 56:16.400
sort of where one edge goes as one path, where the other edge goes as the other path,

56:16.400 --> 56:20.960
and then the sort of other direction, the other dimension is giving the kind of path between

56:20.960 --> 56:25.200
paths. So we're going to remember all of those as well, all of these paths between paths.

56:25.200 --> 56:29.680
So these are called homotopies. And then there's no reason to stop at two dimensions.

56:29.680 --> 56:34.160
So we could take three intervals, product it together. That's a cube. Remember all of those

56:34.160 --> 56:38.000
maps into the space. These are paths between paths between paths. And then we could take

56:38.000 --> 56:41.200
paths between paths between paths between paths, paths between paths, between paths,

56:41.200 --> 56:44.480
between paths, between paths, and all the way up. And that goes to infinity. That's the infinity

56:44.480 --> 56:49.680
groupoid. So that data, I mean, this feels like it's maybe not an improvement, but somehow...

56:49.680 --> 56:51.120
Oh, yeah, it's something.

56:51.840 --> 56:59.520
Somehow that algebraic structure, you know, both describes the full homotopy type of a space,

56:59.520 --> 57:06.960
which is a useful way to think about it, but also invites you to imagine a generalization

57:06.960 --> 57:12.480
to a different world that's further removed from the geometry, where you can imagine some

57:12.480 --> 57:18.160
of these paths are no longer invertible anymore. These are sort of one-way paths, you know, you

57:18.160 --> 57:22.640
might not be able to go backwards for whatever reason. And this is now the world of infinite

57:22.640 --> 57:25.600
dimensional category theory. And that's really where I work, though.

57:26.240 --> 57:29.040
Well, so, which brings up a couple, there's a couple of things I just got to clean up there.

57:29.040 --> 57:33.840
You were on a roll, so I just wanted to let you keep going. But one thing is just to remind

57:33.840 --> 57:41.200
folks, when you talked about the path between two paths, right? The cube, sorry, the square

57:41.200 --> 57:47.600
that was a map into it, that path between two paths might not exist if the two paths are not

57:47.600 --> 57:52.400
homotopically equivalent, that there won't be any path between them. So there's some structure in

57:52.400 --> 57:57.200
the space of what paths between paths exist. Right, by what's present and what's absent,

57:57.200 --> 58:01.840
that's a beautiful way to say it. Good. And the other one was, this is a little bit off topic,

58:01.840 --> 58:08.160
but when you did the explanation of the sphere and you squeezed it down at the equator to get

58:08.160 --> 58:12.800
the bouquet, not only is the language very beautiful, but the visualization is very compelling.

58:12.800 --> 58:18.880
And one thing that always gets asked, how do you visualize the infinity groupoid? Is that

58:18.880 --> 58:24.240
something that is necessary for you to do? Do you approximate infinity by two, or is there

58:24.240 --> 58:31.520
some other trick? It's hard. I don't know. I mean, you sort of imagine a little piece of it at a

58:31.520 --> 58:38.320
time and then I don't know. Yeah, it's hard. Okay, that's fair, completely fair. I basically

58:38.320 --> 58:42.560
give the same answer. I say you don't. You do the two-dimensional or three-dimensional examples

58:42.560 --> 58:47.280
you can get, but at some point you have to trust the equations you're pushing around.

58:47.280 --> 58:52.080
And I don't think we've quite elaborated the difference between a group and a groupoid.

58:54.000 --> 58:59.760
Right, so the difference between a group is, so the example of a fundamental group,

59:00.320 --> 59:05.520
the elements of the group are actually the loops themselves. We've kind of fixed,

59:05.520 --> 59:12.720
as prior we given data, the home base point for the ant, and then the only further data we record

59:12.720 --> 59:21.920
are the loops in the space. So in a groupoid, you don't fix a base point. You allow different

59:21.920 --> 59:28.000
base points, so the different points on the surface of, or in the space. And now, so now

59:28.000 --> 59:32.640
you have kind of two levels of data. You have the collection of different points, and then

59:32.640 --> 59:38.240
you also have the paths between the different points. Okay, is this, I mean, outside of the

59:38.240 --> 59:44.880
world of topology and homotopy, are there group oids? I mean, groups, physicists use groups all

59:44.880 --> 59:49.600
the time, right? SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 is the symmetry group of the standard model of particle

59:49.600 --> 59:55.360
physics. We never use the word groupoid unless we're secretly mathematicians. So just in the

59:55.360 --> 01:00:02.240
abstract sense, is there a difference? Yeah, sure. So your groups are all automorphism groups of some

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:07.520
object, and it's a fixed object. So, you know, you're thinking about automorphisms of R3 or

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:13.360
automorphisms of R4 or sort of R3 with a chosen orientation or something like that. So your groups

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:18.640
were all automorphism groups of a fixed object. In a groupoid, you have different objects. So

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:22.320
there's not just one object anymore, there are different objects, and it's exactly the mini

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:27.040
object analog of a group. Okay, I see. That's not so bad. And automorphism is just a map from a

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:33.840
space to itself. Is that right? Yeah. Okay, good. Yeah, sorry. We all know what automorphisms are.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.560
So then, okay, good. Sorry, there's a lot of clarifying questions, but then let's get back

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:47.760
to the punchline here. The infinity groupoid, the sort of topological sense of all the different

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:53.280
paths that we can map into the space and the paths between the paths and the paths between

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:58.400
the paths of paths. So if we knew the infinity groupoid of a space, we would know what?

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.320
Everything. Well, everything if you only care about the space up to homotopy. I mean,

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.320
if you're willing to say that n-dimensional Euclidean space is the same as a point, there's no

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:12.960
difference whatsoever. Then yes, you know everything about the space. Now, I mean, if you care about

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.600
geometry or dimension or things like that, then this is not the right point of view.

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.360
But for the Taurus, when you said, you know, let's calculate the fundamental group,

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.600
and we noticed that it looked like, so for the sphere, the fundamental group is as trivial,

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:33.200
so it's one element. For the Taurus, it's two copies of the integers. So it's basically two

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:40.080
integers you just give me. How do I even express what the infinity groupoid of a space is?

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.440
Right. So let me move back to the sphere because the two sphere, because it's a little easier to

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:53.280
describe here. So if we're thinking about the loops in the two sphere or the paths in the two

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:57.840
sphere, there's kind of nothing interesting to say. If you have any two points on the, sorry,

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.360
the two spheres in the ordinary sphere, if you have any two points on the sphere, you can connect

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:05.520
them by a path, and there's a sense in which all paths are the same. You could continuously

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:12.960
deform any path from x to y into any other path from x to y. But now if we think about these

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.520
two-dimensional paths between paths, there are fundamentally different ones, and this is really

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.480
surprising. So in one dimension, all paths are somehow the same. But in two dimensions,

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:29.680
paths can be quite different. So I want to think about paths between paths, and so I should fix

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:38.320
the two paths first. So let's start at the north pole and the south pole. So these will be paths

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:42.560
from the north pole to the south pole. And one of the paths I want to take is the

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:47.120
international dateline, so somewhere through the Pacific Ocean. And the other path I want to take

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:50.480
is the prime meridian, which is, I don't know, it's through England or something like that.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.120
Two-grenage, yeah.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.760
Okay, somewhere else. So there's the Greenwich one and the Pacific Ocean. So those are both

01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:01.360
paths from the north pole to the south pole. Now a path between paths is a continuous map

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:08.720
from a square onto the surface of the earth that sends one edge to the prime meridian and the other

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:14.800
edge to the international dateline. And one of them is the one that would cover Asia that would

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:19.120
go east from the prime meridian to the international dateline. And the other one is the one that would

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:26.480
cover the New World, so go west. And those are fundamentally different in the sense that there

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:33.680
is no three-dimensional path, no path between paths between paths that continuously deforms the one

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:39.120
to the other. If you could pass through the core of the earth, you could do that, but we have to

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:44.800
stay on the surface. It's not allowed. So in this sense, the fundamental group or the fundamental

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:49.280
group or sort of one-dimensional thing does not describe everything that's going on on the surface

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:53.680
of the sphere. But once we allow these higher-dimensional things, we do get everything.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:00.480
And is the kind of day job that you're involved in more actually calculating the

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:06.880
infinity groupoid of this or that, or is it more proving theorems about properties of infinity

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:12.240
groupoids? Right. So that's a great question, because those are both very active areas. There

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:17.520
are a lot of researchers working on both problems. I don't do the calculations myself. They're very

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:23.920
hard. I do kind of the theory side, but some of my colleagues work on the calculations.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.640
I'm sure it makes everyone feel good that you don't really do the hard part. You're just doing

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:32.960
the simple part of proving theorems about infinity groupoids. And also, this discussion is wonderful

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:39.360
because it does, beneath the surface in the language that you use and the way you talk about it,

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:46.800
the role of the maps between the different spaces really shines through. Just think of all the

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:51.440
spaces you can invent and all the different ways you can map them in some sense. And that

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:55.840
sneaks us up into the topic of category theory, which is not really our focus here, but I don't

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:00.880
want to leave the audience completely bereft of category theory while we're here.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:07.760
So how do we get from topology to category theory? Sure. I mean, again, there's lots of

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:12.320
different roots in, but maybe the one that's most relevant to this conversation. And this is

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:19.040
kind of back to the conversation and philosophy that we started off with is,

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:25.760
um, so the fundamental theorem in category theory or somehow that that's expressing the core

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:30.000
philosophy of category theory, this thing called the yinata lemma says that if you have any sort

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.680
of mathematical object, it could be a topological space or it could be a vector space or it could

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:40.880
be a ring or it could be a field or whatever, any sort of mathematical object. You can understand

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:46.160
everything that you want to know about it by considering the other objects of that same type.

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:52.000
So other spaces or other rings or other fields and the maps between them. So,

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:58.480
right. So what this is saying in the case of spaces is that if you have a unknown space x and

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:03.360
you're trying to understand that space, so we don't know sort of what its dimensions are,

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:08.000
what its points are, we don't know anything about it. Um, a theorem in category theory,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.720
the yinata lemma says that you can completely characterize your unknown space by considering

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:17.520
the other spaces. So all these spheres and torii and other surfaces and whatever and all

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:23.200
dimensions and then the continuous maps from that into your space x. Well, okay, what's cool

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:28.480
about that result. So we were, we were using this idea in topology already to understand spaces,

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:33.440
but what's cool is it's completely independent of the mathematical context. So the same theorem

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:39.200
is true for rings. You can understand a ring by thinking about other rings and the ring

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:42.960
homomorphisms between them. You can understand a group by thinking about other groups and the

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.000
group homomorphisms between them. Um, this works in any mathematical context whatsoever.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:54.080
It's again, a little bit, uh, related to some ideas in physics that we should always be talking

01:06:54.080 --> 01:07:00.320
about relations between different things rather than intrinsic essences of things themselves.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:05.600
So yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And, and why is this called category theory? Like let's, let's just

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:10.080
bite the bullet and tell people what a category is maybe. Sure. So I mean, a category is kind of

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:15.040
like a very general template for a mathematical theory. So Barry Mazer has this metaphor. It's

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:20.880
like something with, uh, nouns and verbs. So a category is given by a collection of objects.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:25.440
These are the nouns and what you should think of here are like all the rings, all the possible

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:30.720
rings. So the integers and the rationals and the polynomials and matrices and blah, blah, blah.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:37.840
So all the rings. Um, and then you also have the sort of functions between them. So

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:42.400
in the case of rings, these would be functions that respect the addition and multiplication

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:47.280
laws. In the case of spaces, these would be continuous functions and sort of that totality

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:53.120
of information, the objects like the spaces and the functions, the continuous functions or maps

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:59.200
between them and their composition and so on. That's a category. And what's great about this is

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:04.240
every word you say makes perfect sense. And at the end, I'm left not quite knowing what the

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:08.800
implications of these ideas are. That's where that's the devil being the details, right? You've

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:14.160
ascended to this platonic realm of wonderful abstraction where there's just things and maps

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:19.200
between them. So how do you, what's the usefulness? What's the cashing out of this? What is the

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:25.440
free market value of a good category theory? Right. So, um, I mean, one nice thing about

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:30.560
category theory is you can just say when two categories are the same in a essential sense.

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.960
So there's a notion of equivalence between categories and I'll give you my favorite example. So

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:43.680
there's a category whose objects are vector spaces, which are something that are kind of

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:48.800
fundamental in, in sort of modern quantum physics. So a vector space is like a, you know, collection

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:53.760
of vectors with vector addition and scalar multiplication. And then the, the sort of

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.000
transformations between vector spaces are called linear transformations. So there's,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.880
so this is kind of a bread and butter category objects or vector spaces, the maps or transformations,

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:06.960
which are some sort of functions between these vector spaces. Now there's another category

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:12.720
that's kind of a lot simpler to define. So the objects in this category are just natural numbers.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:17.040
So there, I know exactly how many objects there are. Each natural number is an object,

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:21.600
there are no other objects. That's it. And now I need to say sort of what an

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.560
transformation is. The natural numbers are zero, one, two, three, the positive, not negative

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:32.720
integers. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. So, so now I need to say what a sort of transformation or what an

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:39.360
arrow is from one number, let's say five to another number eight. And what it is, is it's going to be

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:45.520
an eight by five matrix. Okay. So to make something a category, I need to tell you about the objects

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:49.040
and the arrows between them. And that's what I've done. The natural numbers are the objects,

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:53.680
the matrices are the arrows, but you also need a composition law. So I need a way to take a

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:58.480
five by eight matrix and an eight by seven matrix and produce a five by seven matrix.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:04.480
But there's a thing for that. It's called matrix multiplication. It's an operation that satisfies

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.960
the axioms of category. So those are two very different sounding categories. On the one hand,

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.920
I have this like very abstract comp, you know, very large thing of all vector spaces and all

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:18.160
linear transformations between them. And then on the other hand, I have this kind of toy category

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:24.480
with natural numbers and matrices. And those categories are equivalent. So in other words,

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:31.200
you can think of the natural number as a stand in for a vector space, the number five corresponds

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:36.880
to five dimensional Euclidean space. I was going to guess that, I promise. Yes. Yeah. And you can

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:42.720
think of matrix as a stand in for a linear transformation. So if you have vector spaces

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:48.960
and you choose a basis, then you can use those bases to get a matrix of numbers that encodes the

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:54.800
full data of the linear transformation. And so in a mathematics department, we often teach linear

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.280
algebra and kind of two different tracks. There's a sort of computational linear algebra. If you're

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:04.080
going to be, you know, the next founder of Google, you need to learn how to use these matrix operations

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.880
and you'll take that sort of course. Or there's a theoretical linear algebra that's, you know,

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:15.360
taken maybe by more math majors. And this on the ground, the subjects feel very different because

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:18.960
one, you're learning a lot about matrices and reduction and operations. And then the other,

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:23.440
you're learning this theory about linear independence and bases and so on and so forth. But

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:29.040
it's the same subject because they're, these are equivalent categories. Okay, that is actually

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:33.280
a very good example of like a little useful bit of insight that you get from thinking this way.

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:38.000
So just, I know that this is sort of already been said by you, but let me try to say it again to

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.320
drive home this notion of a category to people who don't use it as a bread and butter. Because

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:46.960
when you say a vector space, let's just imagine, let's optimistically imagine everyone knows what

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:52.160
a vector space is, right? They have in their mind x y axes and little vectors. So a vector space is

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.640
itself a collection of things, right? The vectors, there's an infinite number of vectors in the vector

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:03.760
space. But the category is of vector spaces. So the individual elements of the category

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:07.280
are the whole vector space, a two dimensional vector space, a three dimensional vector space,

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:14.560
et cetera. And you're thinking about the maps between vector spaces and then extra maps between

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.680
the set of all vector spaces and the set of all integers and things like that. So it gets pretty

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.840
unvisualizable pretty quickly, but that's why you get paid the big bucks.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:28.480
Well, the visual is you're sort of zooming out. You're really taking a bird's eye view of

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:36.560
mathematics. The objects that a group theorist would study are really just little atoms inside

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.560
the category of all groups. And what's fun is if you're a category theorist or a higher

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.640
dimensional category theorist, really the categories themselves become very small. So

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:49.120
in my work, I zoom out one other level and I think about categories whose objects are categories.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.120
Inside those categories are things like the category of vector spaces and then the vector

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:57.120
space is an actual vector space, which has uncountably infinitely many vectors in it,

01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.200
as you point out. And so at what point do we get to the infinity categories? There's an

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.200
infinity group, or there must be an infinity category, right?

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:15.440
Yeah, sure. I mean, yeah. As every decade, mathematicians invent more complicated objects

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:21.440
to study and the universes where those objects live are categories with more dimensions of

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.640
morphisms between them. And those are these infinity categories.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.960
I mean, just knowing that, can you foresee what was going to be invented in the next decade?

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.160
Like what is the obvious thing to draw more arrows between?

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:37.760
Yeah. I mean, what I'm hoping happens in the future is that we change our foundation system

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:44.000
of mathematics. So it's kind of more suitable to these complicated up-to-homeotopy structures that

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.200
we're thinking about today. Well, maybe this is a good place to end up. Because

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:55.120
in some sense, like this all, it's kind of fun. Like you and I are both in the small group of

01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:01.280
people who just think it's fun thinking about this stuff. But it's also maybe a shift of

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:09.120
perspective on what math is in changing what we mean by equality and equivalence and things

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.400
like that. And so can you imagine that math is going to look very different down the road when

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.960
this really seeps in? Is it kind of like a shift from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics in

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:28.240
some sense? Yeah, I think so. I think we maybe see glimpses of it today. But I think every living

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:35.280
mathematician would be very surprised by 22nd century mathematics. And I hope to be around to

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:39.920
see some of it. Well, I was very interested to read. There's a wonderful interview with you in

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:45.760
Quantum Magazine. And one of the interesting things you're doing is writing books. I mean,

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:49.440
maybe you count them as textbooks, but anyway, technical mathematical books where,

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:56.880
correct me if I'm saying this wrong, but you were just as interested in reproving known theorems

01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:01.600
in better ways as in improving new theorems, which is supposed to be the typical thing

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:08.720
mathematicians are paid to do. Right. And there's this Bill Thurston, who is this wonderful

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:16.480
topologist, Geometer, drew attention to kind of the role that mathematicians need to play in

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:22.800
making mathematics understandable to humans. So because something has been proven, that means

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:27.600
it's true, which a nice thing about mathematics is the theorems that were proven 2000 years ago

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:32.000
are equally true today. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's understandable by somebody who

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.840
wants to build on those ideas and use them to do something else. So I think it is worthwhile to do

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:47.280
a bit of kind of tidying up and repackaging, streamlining. A wonderful success in the history

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:52.400
of mathematics is that these cutting edge discoveries that were kind of very controversial

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.120
or inconceivable to somebody 100 years ago are now stuff we teach undergraduates in their first

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:00.960
and second year. True, right. I mean, there was a lot of controversy over calculus, right? That

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:05.600
was considered hard, yeah. Right. These pinnacles of human achievement are now something that

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:10.000
thousands and hundreds of thousands of students are learning every single year. And

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
I hope we continue to progress in that way. We should check back 30 years from now. We'll have

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.840
you back on the podcast and we'll check to see whether or not category theory is taught to at

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:21.920
least undergraduates, at least first year students in the math classes. So that's something to look

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.160
forward to. Emily Reel, thanks very much for being on the Mindscape podcast. Great. Thanks for having me.
