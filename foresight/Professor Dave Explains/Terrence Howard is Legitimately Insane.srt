1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hey everyone!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,380
I've been getting a lot of requests lately as to who to debunk next, and several dozen

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,880
of you have asked me to address the complete insanity that was Terrence Howard's recent

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,120
appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,360
While I normally avoid lunatics of this caliber, I felt this one was worth addressing for a

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,400
few reasons, so let's take a closer look.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,120
If you don't know who Terrence Howard is, he's an actor.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,760
I'll be honest, I've never seen him act in anything.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,440
He was in a really popular TV show that I didn't watch, and I've never seen any of

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,440
his movies.

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,320
If he might be a great actor, he might suck.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,080
I don't know, and I don't care.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,680
What's more important is his extracurricular activities as a delusional narcissist who

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,440
thinks he's the smartest person in human history.

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,420
I don't know exactly when he started showing the world his God complex, but he was away

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,800
before the Rogan appearance, so let's go back just a bit.

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,400
Here he is making a total fool of himself on the red carpet at the Emmys in 2019.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:59,040
I've made some discoveries in my own personal life with the science that, you know, Pythagoras

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,040
was searching for.

20
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,920
I was able to open up the flower of life properly and find the real wave conjugations that we've

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,080
been looking for for 10,000 years.

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,880
Why would I continue, you know, walking on water for tips when I've got an entire generation

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,240
to teach a whole new world?

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,560
That's a big remark.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,600
Okay, let's break this down.

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,840
The science that Pythagoras was searching for.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,880
Pythagoras was a philosopher and mathematician.

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,160
The only things he did that could be considered part of the embryonic stages of science were

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,960
ideas like the harmony of the spheres, where the planets moved according to the frequencies

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,080
of musical notes, which of course was just baseless conjecture and whimsy, coincidentally

31
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,880
Terry's two favorite things.

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,360
He says he was able to open up the flower of life properly.

33
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
That's this.

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,760
The idea of opening this up doesn't mean anything, it's just 19 overlapping circles.

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,160
If you pull them apart, you get 19 circles.

36
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,440
Yes, it's nice and pretty looking.

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,680
Shapes are neat.

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,120
Real wave conjugations, meaningless.

39
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,680
Conjugation is something you do to a verb in an inflected language according to tense,

40
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,920
number, and person.

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,280
Here's a conjugated Italian verb.

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,560
In biology, the word is used to describe horizontal transfer of genetic material between bacteria.

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,040
You can't conjugate a ham sandwich and you can't conjugate a wave.

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,640
10,000 years is a random number that goes farther back than all of recorded history.

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,440
He tosses out walking on water to foreshadow his blatant messiah complex, and he has absolutely

46
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,560
nothing to teach even a small child, let alone an entire generation.

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,960
That's a big remark, says the interviewer, clearly pretty desperate to get out of this

48
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,240
ridiculous conversation without directly insulting him.

49
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,920
What do you intend to do?

50
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,120
Well let me put it this way.

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,920
All energy in the universe is expressed in motion.

52
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,960
All motion is expressed in waves.

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
All waves are curved.

54
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,880
And where does the straight lines come from to make the platonic solids?

55
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,760
There are no straight lines.

56
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,680
So when I took the flower of life and opened it properly, I found all new wave conjugations

57
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,880
that expose the in-between spaces.

58
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,440
That's, it's the thing that holds us all together.

59
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,280
Okay, we're ready to look up the grid.

60
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,280
I didn't do it too well.

61
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
Trigonometry was the...

62
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,080
Platonic solids?

63
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,880
How is energy expressed exactly by motion?

64
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,960
Whatever he could mean by that, he's wrong.

65
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,400
For example, potential energy is the energy held by an object by virtue of its position

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,160
in a field, like a gravitational or electromagnetic field.

67
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,320
No motion, yet energy.

68
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,960
Matter can be converted to energy.

69
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,280
No motion required.

70
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,560
No, not all motion is expressed in waves.

71
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,960
The motion of a wave is a wave.

72
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,000
Periodic motion can be expressed with a wave.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Linear motion also exists, hence straight lines exist.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,720
What are platonic solids?

75
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,080
It's these, convex regular polyhedra in three-dimensional Euclidean space.

76
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,680
Regular polyhedron means that all the sides are the exact same shape, that shape being

77
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,400
a particular regular polygon, which means a two-dimensional shape with all the sides

78
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,840
and angles being equal.

79
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,760
There are five of them, and they were conceived of as hypothetical abstractions, just like

80
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,640
everything else in geometry.

81
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,080
And just for fun, if you take a simple cubic lattice structure for an ionic solid, you

82
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,920
can get those straight lines he said don't exist.

83
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,160
Again, he did not open any flower of life, he did not conjugate any waves, he doesn't

84
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,600
specify what these spaces are and what they are between, or how they hold anything together.

85
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,840
In short, it's pseudo-spiritual bullshit and these anchors are justifiably laughing their

86
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
asses off.

87
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Let's get one more tidbit.

88
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,340
I'm sharing that.

89
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,800
On Tuesday when I receive my star, I'm going to be able to prove that gravity is only an

90
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,560
effect and not a force.

91
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,040
I'm putting something on YouTube where I will build the planet Saturn without gravity

92
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,480
and build the Milky Way galaxy without gravity.

93
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,800
Did you also say you're getting your star on the walk of fame?

94
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Interestingly enough, in the context of general relativity, you can argue that gravity is

95
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,360
an effect and not a force.

96
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,240
But it does not follow then that gravity isn't real, and it gets much worse from there.

97
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,680
He's going to build Saturn and build the Milky Way galaxy?

98
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,960
How exactly?

99
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,560
Like in a simulation?

100
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,800
That needs gravity.

101
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,400
If he built a planet or a galaxy with his hands, I would worship him as the one true

102
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
God.

103
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,120
But something tells me that in reality, he's been watching some electric universe frauds

104
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,440
on YouTube and now he thinks he's smarter than Einstein.

105
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,280
And we've come to find that the universe, they are abandoning the standard model.

106
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,440
The ideas of black holes in dark matter for an electric model of the universe that is

107
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,240
in response to the Birkeland current and all these things, it's a better version, a better

108
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,440
vision of how we should see the universe.

109
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,200
That's how I see it and I think it should be explored.

110
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Bingo!

111
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,400
Terry binged some Thunderbolts project videos and is repeating what he heard as though he

112
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,560
thought of it.

113
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,280
Then this woman tries to change the subject again and he starts whining about not ever

114
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,320
having been nominated for an Emmy.

115
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,280
Anyway, this is the magnitude of nut job we are dealing with, but it gets much worse.

116
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Around that same time, Terrence started yapping about his new form of math, which he dubbed,

117
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:25,480
I shit you not, teriology, and which included the startling new revelation that one times

118
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,960
one is two.

119
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,680
Which prestigious mathematics journal did he select to announce this groundbreaking development?

120
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
The View.

121
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
Let's take a look.

122
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,680
And when I was at Oxford, now this is the point where four bubbles meet equally and

123
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
oppositely.

124
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Can I touch it?

125
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
Yes.

126
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,880
And it's where 12 planes meet.

127
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,560
This is an undiscovered geometry that I'm now making known to the world here on this

128
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
show.

129
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
Isn't that fantastic?

130
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
I know.

131
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
What was the reception?

132
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Well, when I was at Oxford, they were so upset because how can a man that didn't graduate

133
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,980
from one of their prestigious schools come and tell them that the square root of two was

134
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,980
a rational number?

135
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,320
And I said, I didn't come to tell you guys this, I just came to prove to you that it's

136
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,120
a rational number and they were, they didn't like it.

137
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
You heard right.

138
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,360
Terrence presented his bullshit at Oxford and the smart people laughed at him.

139
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,780
But why would they laugh at poor old Terry?

140
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,480
Do you think the ladies of the View will be a more receptive audience?

141
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,800
Well you have to remember our entire world economy is based on one times one equaling

142
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
one.

143
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,400
Yeah, our entire economy is based on one times one equaling one.

144
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,840
Well, economics does involve numbers, so it should obey the basic logic surrounding numbers

145
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,000
that even children can understand.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,280
So what's the problem?

147
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,720
So if you can prove that an action times an action equals a reaction, which science proves,

148
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,840
then one times one must equal more than one.

149
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,000
And to have the physical proof of it, that kind of shakes things up a bit.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,640
Well you're a shaker up for me.

151
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:12,460
Wow, if you can prove that an action times an action equals a reaction, okay, numbers

152
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,160
are not actions, they're numbers.

153
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,800
So that doesn't mean anything.

154
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,480
An action times an action also doesn't mean anything because actions are not numbers.

155
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,480
So no, two actions do not necessarily cause a reaction, no matter what he could possibly

156
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,320
mean by reaction.

157
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,480
If two forces are acting on an object that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction,

158
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,360
the object won't move.

159
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,960
Two actions, no reaction.

160
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,280
Sorry, Terry.

161
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,320
But more importantly than demonstrating how everything he just said is bananas idiotic,

162
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,200
let's review what multiplication is.

163
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,200
One is an elementary arithmetic operation, which is essentially repeated addition.

164
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:01,240
One times four literally means the number one four times, and then you add them up.

165
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,440
One plus one plus one plus one equals four.

166
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,440
One times three, write one three times, add them up, you get three.

167
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,300
One times two, one twice, one plus one is two.

168
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:23,060
One times one means you write one one time, so it's one.

169
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,700
There's nothing to add.

170
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,540
His revolutionary discovery is just him being dumber than a toddler, and toddlers do like

171
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,300
to shake things, so this lady isn't wrong.

172
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,980
Well you're a shaker up there.

173
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,980
Let's be clear, there are only two possibilities.

174
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,020
One, Terrence Howard is doing a Joaquin Phoenix style extended piece of performance art and

175
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,100
is therefore profoundly brilliant.

176
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,340
Or two, he's a delusional narcissist incapable of living his life without pretending that

177
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,780
he's the smartest person in human history.

178
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,700
Or let's be honest, a god.

179
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,620
I'm putting my money on the ladder because I've seen this all before.

180
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,380
Pick your favorite flat earther.

181
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,620
This is their defense mechanism too.

182
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,920
The smallest of minds can't face a world that doesn't recognize their self-proclaimed brilliance,

183
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,200
so unleash a word salad, convince yourself it's science, and hope that nobody challenges

184
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
you on it.

185
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,720
Everything inherently is dielectric because it has matter and then it has a relationship

186
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,480
within the medium, the universal background, the absolute frame of reference, the field

187
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,780
of energy that is the ether, it receives energy from that.

188
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:32,300
These types of people enact the most impressive mental gymnastics imaginable to maintain their

189
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,760
own ego, and the more I encounter it, the less I find it cute or entertaining.

190
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,520
It's a disease that infects impressionable people and measurably worsens society.

191
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,720
It's not something to simply laugh at, although we are going to laugh quite a bit more before

192
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,080
I return to this thread in my conclusion.

193
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,240
So as promised, let's dive into his very recent appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast.

194
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,640
It's three hours long, so we aren't going to hit every moment.

195
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,120
Rest assured, he was completely insane from top to bottom, but let's just go through

196
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,360
some highlights.

197
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:12,200
My first memory was almost like when you're dreaming and you're falling, and you hit the

198
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,520
bottom and you wake up, that was my first memory, but I didn't wake up here.

199
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,840
I was inside my mother's womb, and I was about maybe six months inside the womb.

200
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,120
He comes out hot in the first 30 seconds, claiming that he remembers being in his mother's

201
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
womb.

202
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,520
I'll remove the suspense for you.

203
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
No, he didn't.

204
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,200
That's physically impossible.

205
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,880
Is that any proof, Terry?

206
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,320
I remember all of that coming out.

207
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:45,040
Remember being compressed, being born, I remember being circumcised, I remember the whole nine

208
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,000
and the proof of it was when my wife, Mira, that you just met, when she was six months

209
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,680
pregnant with my son, Karen, I wanted to prove to her what I was talking about.

210
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,960
So I put a light on her stomach every day at six o'clock at night, and I would move

211
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,080
that light back and forth, and I'd put a song on for a week straight.

212
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,040
First thing he wanted to do is see light.

213
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,760
He loved light from that early stage, and I can ask him the square root of two, the square

214
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,560
root of five, the square root of that, the square root of pi, the square, and he will

215
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,940
run it off.

216
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:29,120
So his proof of him remembering being born is a random anecdote about his wife's pregnancy,

217
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,160
his kid liking light, and a lie about his son being able to do math that Terry himself

218
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,280
can't do.

219
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
But there's more.

220
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:43,600
And then when I was about five years old, I had another dream, and it was this mansion,

221
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,100
and he would hand me these shapes, and each shape was different and amazing, and I had

222
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,880
access to all the knowledge.

223
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,880
The proof of it is the 97 patents that I have now.

224
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,800
The proof of it is the industries that I've innovated.

225
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:06,520
Yes, the proof that he has access to all the universe's knowledge is that he has some patents,

226
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,760
something that anybody can get for anything and proves absolutely nothing except that

227
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,360
he likes to waste money.

228
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
He's never innovated any industry.

229
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,240
That's why he doesn't actually do anything except ramble like a lunatic on podcasts.

230
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,400
You know, I had the Grand Unified Field equation.

231
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:29,360
I had already put that together, and at seven, eight, I was working with these things, and

232
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
then I went through all of the hell that I had to go through.

233
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,520
Yes, he had a Grand Unified Field equation at seven years old, but he wrote it down once

234
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,280
in the dog ate it, and then he forgot what it was.

235
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,840
That's why he didn't get the Nobel Prize for physics.

236
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,360
Also, his girlfriend goes to another school.

237
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,680
That's why you don't know her.

238
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,400
But my intention was to rebuild the periodic table, build a new periodic table, because

239
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,560
the stuff I had learned in college, I went to school for chemical engineering the first

240
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:07,480
year over at Pratt, and at the time, I think it was like 108 elements, and I told the teacher,

241
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:15,400
the professor, about the relationship between hydrogen on the spectrometer and carbon and

242
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:21,240
silicon and cobalt, and I was like, it's the same exact color, same tone, just doubled

243
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,000
in each octave, and he was like, no, each element is the same element, and it will always be

244
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
that element.

245
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And I was like, you don't see the relationship, so I left school.

246
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,960
Did you leave school or did you flunk out because you kept writing, cobalt is an octave

247
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,720
of carbon on your exams instead of answering the questions?

248
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,800
And I was going to spend 40 years rebuilding the periodic table, and I found out that Walter

249
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,320
Russell had already did that, and he did it based upon the natural curvature of everything.

250
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,360
Walter Russell, who was not a chemist, made this in the 1920s, and it doesn't mean anything.

251
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,200
The chemical elements display periodicity.

252
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,920
You can illustrate that periodicity in rows, or you can make spirals and other shapes.

253
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,280
It's arbitrary, and listing elements this way doesn't offer any novel insight into chemistry

254
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,600
or any predictive power whatsoever.

255
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,080
Terry just likes the shape as much as he likes pretending to understand chemistry better

256
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,000
than chemists, or 10th graders for that matter.

257
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,480
And when you say rebuild the periodic table, what do you mean specifically?

258
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,200
Well the way the periodic table is laid out, you'll see hydrogen sitting all the way over

259
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,840
there by itself, but they don't show that hydrogen has the same tone as carbon.

260
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,160
What do you mean by tone?

261
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,160
Same tone, same key of E, same key of E. 40.5 Hertz, the next one would be like 80.5 Hertz.

262
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:49,920
81 Hertz, you go to silicon, it will double up and would be 162 Hertz, you'll go to cobalt,

263
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,240
and it'll be 324 Hertz.

264
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,200
It's in that base, if you were to take the angles of incidence, or the tones that they

265
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,600
create, their color, like you can turn color back into sound.

266
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,160
Joe wants to know what the hell he's talking about, and Terry is off to the races rambling

267
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,920
about tones.

268
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:16,160
These are not tones, they're not notes, they're not keys, they're not anything related to

269
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,640
music whatsoever, they're atoms with a particular number of protons in the nucleus.

270
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,280
He's throwing out random terminology and random numbers.

271
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,680
Angle of incidence has to do with light, sounds are not colors, and there's nothing

272
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,680
more to say about this unparalleled gibberish.

273
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:40,680
You'll see there's a relationship between hydrogen, carbon, silicon, cobalt, rhodium.

274
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:47,160
They're all bonded, they're all as the middle point between two noble gases.

275
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,920
So those things don't really exist, it's only one substance.

276
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,840
No Terry, those elements exist.

277
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,520
Hydrogen and carbon and silicon and cobalt and rhodium are different elements, they

278
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,760
are not the same thing.

279
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,800
Hydrogen gas is not the same as a hunk of coal, which is not the same as a sample of

280
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,720
silicon and so forth.

281
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,640
They're just the halfway point of their respective periods, which is irrelevant.

282
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,560
Now the problem is, the first thing that we're able to perceive is hydrogen.

283
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:26,120
That's the first visible element, because before it is too dense for us to perceive it.

284
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,840
You understand what I'm saying?

285
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:35,880
No, hydrogen is the first element because it's the element with one proton in its nucleus.

286
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,240
Hydrogen has one.

287
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,640
That's the smallest positive integer.

288
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,480
Of course you're so insane that even something as trivial as one being the smallest positive

289
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,360
integer can no longer be taken for granted in your illustrious presence.

290
00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:00,040
But as you reach into the next octave, the carbon octave, and they call that a bisexual

291
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,080
tone, because the carbon has two tones to it.

292
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,400
It has a negative side and a positive side, the part where lithium behaves.

293
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Lithium is contractive, beryllium is contractive, boron is contractive, but the moment you

294
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,200
get to carbon, you balance it out.

295
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,400
It gets to a perfect balance of plus and minus four, so it's a double tone.

296
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,920
Carbon is bisexual, you guys.

297
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,040
Atoms have sexuality.

298
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,680
Elements being contractive is also meaningless.

299
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,720
Everything he is saying is meaningless.

300
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,240
What they've tried to keep from us, if you want to break water into its component parts

301
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:50,720
of hydrogen and oxygen, all you have to do is introduce beryllium, or the sound of beryllium.

302
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:58,520
And will violently break away from any other thing, even hydrogen, to bond with that beryllium.

303
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,800
Ah yes, the infamous they.

304
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,040
What are they trying to keep from us now?

305
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,560
You want to perform electrolysis on water, but how?

306
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,800
Not electricity, heavens know.

307
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,000
Use beryllium.

308
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,680
But wait, not even beryllium itself, just the sound of beryllium.

309
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
What's that sound again?

310
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,160
Yep, that's what beryllium sounds like, startling, no?

311
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,840
I'm sorry that I made all the water in your body turn into hydrogen and oxygen gas and

312
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,400
you're dead now.

313
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,680
Elements don't have sounds, but even funnier than that, beryllium is the only alkaline

314
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,160
earth metal that does not react with water.

315
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:41,080
Every time he speaks, he's wrong in so many ways simultaneously that it's almost impressive.

316
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:48,680
The reason that arsenic kills us is because our DNA has nitrogen and it has phosphorus

317
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:54,680
in it because nitrogen unwinds into the next octave right after silicone and becomes phosphorus.

318
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,800
Our DNA has both of those in there, but it's going by tone.

319
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:06,000
So the moment arsenic, which sits as a minus three on the next octave, the moment arsenic

320
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,800
is introduced, the body thinks that, oh, this is my thing that I need.

321
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,640
And it tries to wrap itself around the arsenic, but it causes the DNA to unravel.

322
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,560
Wow, arsenic is harmful because it interferes with biochemical pathways.

323
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,840
For example, it enacts allosteric inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is an enzyme

324
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,040
involved in aerobic respiration.

325
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,480
That means it binds to the enzyme, in this case not specifically at the active site,

326
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,880
and the interaction changes the shape of the enzyme just enough to render it incapable of

327
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,560
carrying out its function.

328
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,480
The cell can't make ATP, so it enacts apoptosis and dies.

329
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,160
There are similar effects on other enzymes involved with signaling, DNA repair, and so

330
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
forth.

331
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,360
Virtually anything that's harmful to biological systems is harmful because of sophisticated

332
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,020
interactions with the cellular machinery, which require knowledge of molecular biology

333
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,520
to understand.

334
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,240
No, DNA does not wrap around arsenic, nor does it unravel.

335
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,800
Terry has no clue what DNA is, what it does, or literally anything about molecules in general.

336
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:17,000
But nature doesn't allow us to unravel that, but now with the wave conjugations, we can.

337
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,480
We couldn't do that before because we didn't know the angles of incidence that were necessary

338
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,280
to open these things up, and you couldn't do that with the platonic solids because the

339
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,240
platonic solids were averages and approximations.

340
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,240
It really is just breathtaking the way he throws together totally unrelated terminology

341
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,140
with this much confidence.

342
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,280
What does one even do with this?

343
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:46,240
Wave conjugation, angle of incidence, platonic solids, these don't go together.

344
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,480
It's like saying you need 6 hammer the ice cream to monkey of 11 dizzy.

345
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,560
Your reaction to these two statements should be the same.

346
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,480
And the platonic solids are specifically the opposites of averages and approximations.

347
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,840
They are hypothetical idealized structures.

348
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,400
Reality consists of approximations.

349
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,160
Again, it's just breathtaking.

350
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,840
It's legitimately challenging to come up with sentences that are as wrong as everything

351
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
he says.

352
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,280
It took me several minutes to write the monkey sentence because I kept wanting to write things

353
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,040
like monkey of fire, which accidentally make more sense than I wanted.

354
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,120
He has a gift for gibberish.

355
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:32,400
Because the universe is based off of equanimity, which Einstein left out in his theory of relativity.

356
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:39,880
The balancing side of the gravity, gravity was caused by electric force.

357
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,880
Electricity is always seeking a higher pressure condition.

358
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,960
It spins northeast as trying to get to the center of an area, the center of a cone.

359
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,120
But the next electric wave is coming, so it gets pushed out, and as it's pushed out,

360
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,840
it gets to the vortices.

361
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah, gravity is not electric, matter specifically disperses from higher to lower pressure.

362
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,760
You can't spin northeast, that's a cardinal direction.

363
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,000
Center of an area can't mean center of a cone, since areas are two-dimensional and

364
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,640
a cone is three-dimensional.

365
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,520
And what is pushed out to what vortices?

366
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,520
How does this guy do this?

367
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,240
We are only 19 minutes in, and it's all like this.

368
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,000
But instead of following the natural curvature of these 64 circles overlapping, they averaged

369
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:34,000
the space where they met, and they invented straight lines.

370
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,520
Why did they do that?

371
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,160
Because they believed that the world was flat.

372
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,840
The irony here is that figures like Pythagoras and Parmenides were the first people in recorded

373
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,200
history to propose that the Earth is a sphere, and substantiated logically.

374
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,600
But more importantly, the Platonic solids are just derived from playing with polygons

375
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,400
and making polyhedra.

376
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,040
And even more importantly than that, none of this geometry has any correlation with

377
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,680
any of the bullshit he's spewing about chemistry and physics.

378
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,720
They're utterly separate realms.

379
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,920
Then we get to the fancy animations.

380
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:14,840
This is hydrogen, and as I was saying, electricity is always trying to get to the center of that

381
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,600
triangle, but it gets pushed out.

382
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,920
That's not hydrogen.

383
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,520
It's not even a triangle.

384
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,000
And where's the electricity exactly?

385
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Eight bubbles me.

386
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,160
They gave me the patents to that.

387
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,240
I called that the tetraion.

388
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,520
Don't worry guys, he patented the shape.

389
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,120
You can patent shapes now.

390
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,640
I know the guy who has the patent on the rhombus.

391
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,200
He's a billionaire.

392
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,600
Spheres that's going around this, but the greater attractor has grabbed the two weaker attractors.

393
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,160
And this looks just like a photon, and guess what, it has 30 poles.

394
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,800
Yeah, it looks just like a photon.

395
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,320
Massless, chargeless photons look like this dumb shape he made up, because he says so.

396
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,480
This is where 12 bubbles meet the arboreans.

397
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,400
And then I put five of them together and they make these natural starfish.

398
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:08,480
But then when I put 10 of them together, they lay themselves out and they predict all distribution

399
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,240
of matter within the electric field.

400
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,280
Hey, he used the magic word, prediction.

401
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
What do they predict?

402
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,840
The distribution of matter, what?

403
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
Where?

404
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,160
Show us a prediction, Terry.

405
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
No?

406
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,280
Back to gibberish.

407
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,160
One of the first things, but when Walter Russell came out with his book and he introduced

408
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:33,480
his periodic table, he watched as different people went up and collected Nobel prizes

409
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:40,280
for deuterium, for tritium, for all these things that he had discovered.

410
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:46,120
And I was like, okay, let me wait until the patents are granted before I'll talk about

411
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
it.

412
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,800
Walter Russell wasn't a chemist.

413
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,680
He was an artist and he was delusional.

414
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,880
That's why you worship him, Terry.

415
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,640
People aren't awarded Nobel prizes in chemistry for drawing pretty pictures.

416
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,680
Yuri got a Nobel for discovering deuterium because that actually matters.

417
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,800
You just don't know what isotopes are, even though you use that word all the time.

418
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:12,920
Back to Neil deGrasse, when he wrote his response to my paper and he said, if you have

419
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,960
any other questions, you're going to have to see somebody else and he wouldn't take

420
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
my calls anymore.

421
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,880
I was like, okay, so I wrote the book based off of those responses and I reached out to

422
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,520
another guy, Dr. David Tong.

423
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,160
That would be very interesting that that would be his take as a public educator, that

424
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,520
he wouldn't want to talk to you anymore.

425
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,080
Yeah, Terry sent his ramblings to Neil deGrasse Tyson since everyone who knows zero things

426
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,320
about science assumes that Neil is the president of science and Neil was gracious enough to

427
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,480
explain to him how everything he says is wrong, probably more politely than I would.

428
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:53,000
But Terry, the narcissist, presses forward, shocked that an intelligent, busy person wouldn't

429
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,160
want to waste his time placating a toddler.

430
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:02,800
Joe seems surprised too, forgetting that educators enjoy educating people, not spending time

431
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,880
and energy trying to show an insane person how insane they are.

432
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,040
Why this fixation with Neil?

433
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,280
The reason I wanted to talk to him was because of his show, The Cosmos, that he was doing

434
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,760
after that incredible guy Carl Sagan did.

435
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:25,440
The very first episode he had was talking about Giorgiano Bruno and he said that Giorgiano

436
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,360
Bruno was looking for that grand unified field equation and maybe one day somebody is going

437
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,320
to do it and when they do it, it's going to change the world and I'm like, dude, I've

438
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,640
done it, I've got it here.

439
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,520
Giorgiano Bruno was not looking for a grand unified field equation.

440
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,000
Quantum physics didn't exist in the 16th century.

441
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,080
The concept of fields didn't exist in general.

442
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,420
The term was coined by Faraday in the 19th century.

443
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,180
This is the problem with science illiterate morons like Terry.

444
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,740
They have no respect for science whatsoever.

445
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:08,740
They have no interest in learning basic scientific principles, the history of science, what any

446
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:15,020
scientist did, what scientists are doing now, how to do science, none of it.

447
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:21,340
They are singularly obsessed with the lofty idea of one brilliant insight that can change

448
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,460
the world.

449
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,580
It doesn't matter what it's called.

450
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,260
That's why he keeps saying grand unified field equation because it doesn't mean anything

451
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,260
to him.

452
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,580
It's a fun phrase, nothing more.

453
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,820
That's what everyone was trying to do since antiquity because he says so and he's the

454
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,340
one who's done it because he says so.

455
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,860
Walter Russell talked about the fact that the sun gave birth to the earth, that it didn't

456
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:47,260
coalesce from some field and the proof of this.

457
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,460
Do you guys know that the earth is drifting away from the sun and all of the planets in

458
00:28:52,700 --> 00:29:02,700
every solar system is drifting away from their primary at the same exact rate, like 1.5 centimeters.

459
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:09,260
This is a universal expansion that's happening with everything moving away.

460
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:15,980
Them saying and the web telescope have proven that those galaxies couldn't have formed 13,

461
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,260
14 billion years ago.

462
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:25,180
If you would just add up linearly, how long it would take the earth to go from the sun

463
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:33,180
to 93 million miles away, it's 9 trillion, hold on, let's go.

464
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,460
This is what I'm talking about.

465
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,700
He can't be bothered to learn literally anything about astronomy.

466
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,260
The expansion of the universe has nothing to do with the dynamics of an individual solar

467
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
system.

468
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:50,100
Sun did not give birth to the earth, as though our planet emerged from inside of a star.

469
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,580
He knows nothing about planetary formation, and the idea that we have measured this for

470
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,300
all other systems, how exactly would that work?

471
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,740
We can detect an exoplanet's orbit increasing by a centimeter, how?

472
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,860
But sure, play with your calculator that you already told us shouldn't be used because

473
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,500
it lies about arithmetic.

474
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,220
Well, because I know they're watching me right now, and they're mad at me.

475
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,740
Who's day?

476
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:25,100
The people that want that, our entire world economy is based off of the politicians and

477
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,300
the authorities that give the politicians their accreditation.

478
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:34,260
And those authorities, those universities are all based, their entire curriculum is based

479
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,300
off the platonic solids.

480
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:47,900
Look at the level of paranoia beyond the simple delusions.

481
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,460
The shadow government is watching Terry because he debunked the platonic solids which are

482
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,580
the basis of every economics course in every Rockefeller-Jesuit institution.

483
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,860
I'm shocked that he's not a flatterther because this is exactly how they talk.

484
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,580
But don't worry, he's an anti-vaxxer, obviously, and Joe is too.

485
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:12,180
You took a bold stand, no, years ago when the governments were trying to poison their

486
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,340
citizens.

487
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,220
You took a very bold stand that nobody else took.

488
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,420
That's what I was like, wow, I appreciate you because I lost three, four jobs because

489
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,220
I refuse to take it.

490
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,220
I refuse to take it.

491
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,420
I bet you feel better about it now, especially when you know all these people that have health

492
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,020
problems because of it.

493
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,540
Cancers has increased 300 percent.

494
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,220
All cause mortality, up 40 percent in some age groups.

495
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,220
Pulmonary embolisms almost up like 500 percent.

496
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,220
Yeah, what caused that?

497
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,060
No, none of those things are true.

498
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:45,540
You heard them on the internet and believed them, but Terry has a little bit of biochemistry

499
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,060
knowledge he wants to share.

500
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:54,100
I can walk you through what the spike protein did to the BRCA1 gene, that's the gene inside

501
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:59,700
of our DNA that tells us that there's a damage, there's damage that's happening almost like

502
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,540
the crews that go along the highway and they immediately put up cones every time there's

503
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,540
a problem.

504
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:12,420
Well, the spike protein, which is never, no protein has ever been able to enter into

505
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,260
the nucleus of a cell.

506
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:19,140
Not only did it go to the ribosomes and say, hey, you know what, I don't want you to produce

507
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:24,060
whatever protein like if it was a skin cell, you're not going to produce keratin anymore.

508
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,980
You're just going to produce these spike proteins.

509
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:33,180
That spike protein went into the DNA and it tells the BRCA1 gene turn off and that's

510
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:38,140
the gene that says, hey, there's a mutation here, let's scrap that thing.

511
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,300
And so now the cancers are building up.

512
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,300
The spike protein doesn't do anything to any gene.

513
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,300
He doesn't know what genes are.

514
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,220
Genes don't tell us things.

515
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,580
They are instructions for protein assembly.

516
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,380
That's why he goes to his pathetic analogy of something he saw on the highway because

517
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,420
he doesn't know how transcription and translation work.

518
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:02,180
There is nothing unique about this spike protein and he doesn't know what ribosomes do.

519
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,660
They translate any mRNA transcript that binds.

520
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:10,100
Making a spike protein doesn't render it incapable of producing other proteins.

521
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,260
Spike proteins can't go into DNA.

522
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,220
They can't tell a gene anything.

523
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,420
They can't turn off genes.

524
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,260
Genes don't detect mutations.

525
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,960
The enzymes they code for are what do that and he doesn't know what cancer is.

526
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,340
This is really pathetic.

527
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,340
Let's skip ahead.

528
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,740
So is he saying that just by doing these calculations he created the exact form of Saturn including

529
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,740
the rings?

530
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,300
Just the exact form of it.

531
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,300
Just with the calculations.

532
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,500
So you change the angles of incidence that these linchpins, because remember each one

533
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,060
of these are opposing vortices.

534
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,500
So there's 12 vortices to this that are opposing.

535
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:51,780
So once the angles of incidence change, you change the motion and pressure conditions,

536
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,180
you can now change the condition or the crystallization.

537
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:02,180
So he's pretending to explain planetary formation without gravity and without explaining literally

538
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,460
anything about what he's doing.

539
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,060
Click a button, the planet is there.

540
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,420
What are the dots?

541
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,960
Where did the matter come from?

542
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,100
How did it arrange itself?

543
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,100
Planetary formation is a process.

544
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,500
This just materialized that of thin air.

545
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
How?

546
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,860
There are no vortices.

547
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,860
Nothing is opposing.

548
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,900
There is no angle of incidence.

549
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,800
There is no crystallization.

550
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,220
He is just listing random buzzwords.

551
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:31,340
Now because we have the angles of incidence, material engineering can now separate the

552
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:38,620
space between carbon and nitrogen or carbon and boron and have the same elements of titanium,

553
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:45,060
vanadium, chromium, magnesay and iron or nickel, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, gallium

554
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,380
or germanium in those higher octaves.

555
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,260
We can do that between silicone and phosphorus or silicone and aluminum.

556
00:34:53,260 --> 00:35:00,180
So the transparent aluminum now becomes possible because we can now control the pressure and

557
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:05,540
change the pressure and motion conditions where we couldn't do that before because they

558
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:12,100
were going by Cartesian space at 90 degrees and 45 degrees straight lines, the Euclidean

559
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:17,580
space that they've made up, this orthogonal or church like space that they've generated

560
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,500
because they wanted to promote that cross.

561
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,700
He doesn't even know the names of the elements.

562
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,980
He's saying mangasane instead of manganese.

563
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,500
He says silicone instead of silicon because he doesn't know that silicone is a different

564
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,500
material.

565
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,300
He can't pronounce orthogonal.

566
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:38,660
He's never even heard these words spoken before and he is doing nothing whatsoever to actually

567
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,220
explain anything about what he just showed to Joe.

568
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:49,860
He's practically speaking in tongues and Joe is lapping it up.

569
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:54,940
And as the cherry on top, he pretends that this brilliance was hidden because the Catholic

570
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,740
church loves the straight lines from the cross.

571
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,260
Does he not know how much power this symbol still has over normal people even today who

572
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,860
would never fall for any of this bullshit?

573
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:11,540
He just knows that churching up the story gives it a Da Vinci code vibe that ensnares

574
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,540
gullible people.

575
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:18,100
Can you tell me how a planet is formed under this theory?

576
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:22,340
So you have a sun and how does the sun give birth to these planets?

577
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:52,140
90 minutes in, Joe finally asks him to actually explain something and Terry's

578
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,180
response is astounding.

579
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,540
Stars crap out planets the way we take a dump on the toilet.

580
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,540
Case closed everyone.

581
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,260
Planets are fecal matter.

582
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,080
And the red spot on Jupiter will be a planet leader.

583
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,260
Of course this is meaningless since it's a storm, it's a cyclone.

584
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,500
How does a bunch of wind form a planet exactly?

585
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,140
And he's just so objectively wrong about every trivial detail.

586
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,500
The red spot is not at the equator, it's 22 degrees below the equator.

587
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:27,300
And the human anus is not located on the waist.

588
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,820
This is such a stunning example of the difference between real science and insane ramblings.

589
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,380
Ask this question of an astrophysicist.

590
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:40,580
You'll get mountains of data, explanations, equations, predictions, confirmations of those

591
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,820
predictions through observation.

592
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,980
Ask Terry at what do you get?

593
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,060
The sun takes a crap.

594
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,180
The end.

595
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,220
Who falls for this stuff?

596
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,740
Everything is just one great being, we're all God.

597
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:01,740
That's what Jesus was talking about, that's what Buddha was talking about, it's recognizing

598
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,700
the divinity in you.

599
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,500
Actually neither of those people said anything like that, Buddha didn't proclaim to be divine

600
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,900
and in Christian mythology Jesus didn't say I'm God and so are all of you.

601
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,140
He just said that he was God.

602
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,140
That's kind of why the Romans killed him.

603
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:24,620
Terry is just looking for excuses to call himself God and he's as dumb with theology

604
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,260
as he is with science.

605
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:32,180
Here I've invented, here I'm an Oscar nominated actor that is known all around the world,

606
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,140
face recognition, vocal recognition all around the world.

607
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:40,820
I've invented a new form of flight, tangential flight, the ability to fly around your own

608
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:47,460
center of mass, something they've never been able to do and you don't hear anything about

609
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,460
it.

610
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:54,100
Harsicism is oozing out of every pore of his body and congealing into little origami cranes

611
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,740
in front of our eyes.

612
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:01,340
He's world famous kind of so his imaginary invention must be brilliant.

613
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,660
Tangential flight, tangent to what?

614
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:08,580
He doesn't know what a tangent is and of course his little toddler toy doesn't actually fly

615
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,980
or do anything, he just has cute animations.

616
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,260
Instead of all the props having to turn themselves around to stop and turn in opposite directions

617
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:22,860
they just switch the direction, they just, so it's a collective pitch and it changes

618
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,260
and so now instead of going up you're going down but now five of them will come together.

619
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,620
So I was trying to reach out to Elon Musk, I was trying to reach out to Jeff Bezos, I

620
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:36,500
was trying because my main goal was I was building these to clean up the upper atmosphere,

621
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:44,820
all of that debris that's up there and ultimately to mine the asteroid belt.

622
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,900
You can immediately see that someone is clicking on a screen to trigger an animation so it's

623
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,340
anyone's guess as to why Elon Musk should care about this crappy video game.

624
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:58,340
Terry is not only smarter than every physicist in history but he's better at building space

625
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:02,460
crafts than everyone alive despite never having built anything.

626
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,780
The hubris is off the charts.

627
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:09,380
It's not worth listening to this entire rant but he genuinely believes that he has invented

628
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:14,500
revolutionary technology and that he's being ignored for literally no reason.

629
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:22,380
And so it's just going to react and immediately it converts into a plasma and so we can project

630
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,020
anything into space.

631
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,460
All of that has been accomplished and it's ignored.

632
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:34,580
Delusional narcissists always have this precise brand of persecution complex.

633
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:39,020
James Tore, Ben Davidson, they all do the same thing.

634
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:44,780
All the experts are morons because they ignore my super brilliant revolutionary insights.

635
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:49,100
The whole establishment is against me because they're afraid of my truth.

636
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,980
Honestly, I think we've had enough.

637
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:56,300
I got 2 hours into the 3 hour podcast and there's just no point in continuing.

638
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:02,100
It's the epitome of manic hogwash with virtually nothing to even sink your teeth into and there's

639
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:06,020
only so many times I can point out that what he's saying is meaningless.

640
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,780
In the end, there's only one point that needs to be made.

641
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:14,060
Pretentious tools like Terry can hope to fool as many people as they can by speaking confidently

642
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,460
and using jargon they hope the listener doesn't understand.

643
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,020
But what can they do with it?

644
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,740
What can they physically achieve with it?

645
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:26,860
Terry thinks he's reinvented physics but that's because he never learned any physics

646
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,180
in the first place.

647
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,420
Take this free body problem for example.

648
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,060
This is something he was supposed to learn in high school.

649
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,300
You use Newton's Laws, plug in some numbers and you get an answer that correlates with

650
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
reality.

651
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,320
You can predict what will happen when you let go of the block.

652
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,500
And guess what?

653
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,340
When you let go of the block, that thing does happen.

654
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,100
Terry's gibberish doesn't have that power.

655
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:56,060
His ramblings have no utility, no predictive power, no technological application.

656
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,380
It's a parlor trick.

657
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,220
It's basically hypnotism.

658
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,320
But as I mentioned before, it's not harmless.

659
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:07,280
His way of thinking is dangerous and these types of people are often dangerous.

660
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,880
Do you want some evidence?

661
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,880
Because I was angry.

662
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,040
I was really angry.

663
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:19,760
And I was going to use all of the knowledge that I had and I was going to destroy mankind.

664
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,160
Oh my God, right out of Marvel.

665
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,760
I was like, yeah, I was about to, but then...

666
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,320
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

667
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,280
Things like these are very revealing.

668
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,400
It's not a joke.

669
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:39,040
He genuinely believes he has this kind of power and he has contemplated exercising it in a

670
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,380
violent, destructive way.

671
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:45,400
Do you know who else has had such thoughts and acted on them?

672
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,000
Go and read the Manifesto of the Unabomber.

673
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,040
It's the exact same self-aggrandizing tone, the same superiority complex, the same incessant

674
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,400
rambling.

675
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,720
This is the psyche of cult leaders and domestic terrorists.

676
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,680
I'm not saying that Terrence Howard necessarily would or will blow something up in murder

677
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:10,220
people, but those who blow things up in murder people tend to think this way.

678
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,560
They have this strain of delusional narcissism in them that enables them to first think they're

679
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:21,600
better than everyone else and also that they deserve the right to exercise power over others.

680
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,600
Terry is mentally ill.

681
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,800
He should be checked into a mental institution to get treatment for his personality disorder.

682
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,120
Cue the onslaught of people saying I have no right to diagnose anyone based on a podcast

683
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,120
appearance.

684
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,960
Yeah, technically, you're right.

685
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,800
But also, he is a delusional narcissist with a personality disorder that should be committed

686
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,480
to a mental institution.

687
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,480
Sorry.

688
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,160
And if the people in his life really cared about him, they'd have done that a while ago.

689
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,720
Now let's pivot to Joe.

690
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,280
In my video on Tucker Carlson, I gave Joe a bit of a pass.

691
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:59,080
But here, Joe just fails miserably and his failure is twofold.

692
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,840
First, Joe desperately needs a better bullshit detector.

693
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:09,480
Anybody who can't tell that Terrence is completely full of shit within a few sentences has terrible

694
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,600
judgment end of story.

695
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,400
You don't even need to be able to articulate with clarity how he is wrong.

696
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,400
It's just blatantly apparent in his manner of presenting ideas, the way he vomits esoteric

697
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:27,040
terminology rapid fire, the way he overperforms to give the impression of profundity.

698
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,920
It's immediately apparent to any rational person.

699
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,520
But the other problem is a more pernicious type of mental defect, which I've mentioned

700
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,400
many times, and that is the anti-establishment bias.

701
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,120
Joe has that in spades.

702
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:46,000
This is not something like your explanation of these things and your description of the

703
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,960
very nature of reality itself is not something that should be taken lightly.

704
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
No.

705
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,280
It's something that, like...

706
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,280
Thank you for saying that.

707
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,760
It needs to be laid out and it needs to be slowly examined because you've obviously spent

708
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,720
a lot of time working on this.

709
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:10,240
People with this bias can hear any ridiculous story from any unqualified, clueless weirdo

710
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:15,320
and they will immediately give it far more credence than it deserves simply because it

711
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:20,480
feeds their desire to see established knowledge arbitrarily overturned.

712
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,280
Joe is psychologically incapable of seeing how stupid this all is because he desperately

713
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,200
wants this story to be true.

714
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,200
Wow.

715
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:35,000
I wish I could really truly understand exactly what you're saying because I'm kind of getting

716
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,560
it and you're doing a great job explaining it.

717
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:44,800
But if you're right, that really changes everything and it accounts for why physics

718
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,880
kind of hits a stalling point.

719
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,320
It doesn't matter that Joe has no clue what he's saying.

720
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:56,880
Instead of entertaining the idea that he isn't really saying anything, he just blindly asserts

721
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,360
that the emperor has all his clothes on and that the imaginary garments must be so much

722
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:07,560
better than the drab and outdated clothing that establishment science provides.

723
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,880
A field which obviously must be stalling just because he refuses to lift a finger to learn

724
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,480
how vibrant the field really is.

725
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:22,320
It's contrarianism on steroids to the point where even the most trivial self-evident facts

726
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,960
can be called into question just because of their addiction to perceiving themselves

727
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,240
as superior to the masses.

728
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:34,280
Even something as trivial as 1 times 1 equals 1.

729
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:41,400
This insistence that the dissenting voice should instantly be taken more seriously than substantiated

730
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:47,900
knowledge is an infantile attitude that is destroying our culture and I'm tired of everyone

731
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:52,440
looking the other way for fear of making waves or insulting people.

732
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,400
Terrence should be mocked to his face on a daily basis.

733
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,440
He may not be evil or deserve severe punishment, but these are the checks and balances that

734
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,840
maintain civic responsibility.

735
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,520
If you act like social poison, there should be an antidote.

736
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:14,240
Everyone in his vicinity should be constantly showing him how delusional he is until something

737
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,740
registers and he takes it upon himself to change.

738
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:23,040
Because as insane as he is, his ramblings have an impact.

739
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,400
Certain people listen.

740
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,880
Their minds warp.

741
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:31,040
They choose to further disregard the body of human knowledge or any concept of expertise

742
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,580
and we all suffer the consequences of the poor choices they make as a result.

743
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,640
But what's the one thing we can say for certain about Terry?

744
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:45,640
This is what you'll be remembered for and your acting will be just a footnote.

745
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,920
That about sums it up.

746
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,900
He will be remembered as a pointless lunatic no matter how badly the contrarians want to

747
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,280
delude themselves.

748
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,520
So that's it for Terrence Howard, it is genuinely astounding to me that anyone would listen

749
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:03,680
to this guy for more than 30 seconds and subjecting myself to several hours of his ramblings has

750
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,400
probably taken a few months off of my life.

751
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,040
So I hope you got something out of it.

752
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:08,920
I'll see you next time.
