0	1000	Hey everyone!
1000	5380	I've been getting a lot of requests lately as to who to debunk next, and several dozen
5380	9880	of you have asked me to address the complete insanity that was Terrence Howard's recent
9880	12120	appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast.
12120	16360	While I normally avoid lunatics of this caliber, I felt this one was worth addressing for a
16360	19400	few reasons, so let's take a closer look.
19400	22120	If you don't know who Terrence Howard is, he's an actor.
22120	24760	I'll be honest, I've never seen him act in anything.
24760	28440	He was in a really popular TV show that I didn't watch, and I've never seen any of
28440	29440	his movies.
29440	31320	If he might be a great actor, he might suck.
31320	33080	I don't know, and I don't care.
33080	37680	What's more important is his extracurricular activities as a delusional narcissist who
37680	40440	thinks he's the smartest person in human history.
40440	44420	I don't know exactly when he started showing the world his God complex, but he was away
44420	47800	before the Rogan appearance, so let's go back just a bit.
47800	52400	Here he is making a total fool of himself on the red carpet at the Emmys in 2019.
52400	59040	I've made some discoveries in my own personal life with the science that, you know, Pythagoras
59040	60040	was searching for.
60040	65920	I was able to open up the flower of life properly and find the real wave conjugations that we've
65920	68080	been looking for for 10,000 years.
68080	73880	Why would I continue, you know, walking on water for tips when I've got an entire generation
73880	76240	to teach a whole new world?
76240	77560	That's a big remark.
77560	79600	Okay, let's break this down.
79600	82840	The science that Pythagoras was searching for.
82840	85880	Pythagoras was a philosopher and mathematician.
85880	90160	The only things he did that could be considered part of the embryonic stages of science were
90160	94960	ideas like the harmony of the spheres, where the planets moved according to the frequencies
94960	100080	of musical notes, which of course was just baseless conjecture and whimsy, coincidentally
100080	101880	Terry's two favorite things.
101880	106360	He says he was able to open up the flower of life properly.
106360	107360	That's this.
107360	112760	The idea of opening this up doesn't mean anything, it's just 19 overlapping circles.
112760	115160	If you pull them apart, you get 19 circles.
115440	117440	Yes, it's nice and pretty looking.
117440	118680	Shapes are neat.
118680	122120	Real wave conjugations, meaningless.
122120	126680	Conjugation is something you do to a verb in an inflected language according to tense,
126680	127920	number, and person.
127920	130280	Here's a conjugated Italian verb.
130280	135560	In biology, the word is used to describe horizontal transfer of genetic material between bacteria.
135560	140040	You can't conjugate a ham sandwich and you can't conjugate a wave.
140040	144640	10,000 years is a random number that goes farther back than all of recorded history.
144640	150440	He tosses out walking on water to foreshadow his blatant messiah complex, and he has absolutely
150440	154560	nothing to teach even a small child, let alone an entire generation.
154560	158960	That's a big remark, says the interviewer, clearly pretty desperate to get out of this
158960	163240	ridiculous conversation without directly insulting him.
163240	165920	What do you intend to do?
165920	167120	Well let me put it this way.
167120	169920	All energy in the universe is expressed in motion.
169920	171960	All motion is expressed in waves.
171960	172960	All waves are curved.
172960	176880	And where does the straight lines come from to make the platonic solids?
176880	178760	There are no straight lines.
178760	184680	So when I took the flower of life and opened it properly, I found all new wave conjugations
184680	187880	that expose the in-between spaces.
187880	191440	That's, it's the thing that holds us all together.
191440	194280	Okay, we're ready to look up the grid.
194280	195280	I didn't do it too well.
195280	196280	Trigonometry was the...
196280	198080	Platonic solids?
198080	201880	How is energy expressed exactly by motion?
201880	203960	Whatever he could mean by that, he's wrong.
203960	208400	For example, potential energy is the energy held by an object by virtue of its position
208400	212160	in a field, like a gravitational or electromagnetic field.
212160	214320	No motion, yet energy.
214320	215960	Matter can be converted to energy.
215960	217280	No motion required.
217280	220560	No, not all motion is expressed in waves.
220560	222960	The motion of a wave is a wave.
222960	226000	Periodic motion can be expressed with a wave.
226000	230000	Linear motion also exists, hence straight lines exist.
230000	231720	What are platonic solids?
231720	237080	It's these, convex regular polyhedra in three-dimensional Euclidean space.
237080	241680	Regular polyhedron means that all the sides are the exact same shape, that shape being
241680	246400	a particular regular polygon, which means a two-dimensional shape with all the sides
246400	247840	and angles being equal.
247840	251760	There are five of them, and they were conceived of as hypothetical abstractions, just like
251760	253640	everything else in geometry.
253640	258080	And just for fun, if you take a simple cubic lattice structure for an ionic solid, you
258080	260920	can get those straight lines he said don't exist.
260920	266160	Again, he did not open any flower of life, he did not conjugate any waves, he doesn't
266160	271600	specify what these spaces are and what they are between, or how they hold anything together.
271600	275840	In short, it's pseudo-spiritual bullshit and these anchors are justifiably laughing their
275840	276840	asses off.
276840	277840	Let's get one more tidbit.
277840	279340	I'm sharing that.
279340	284800	On Tuesday when I receive my star, I'm going to be able to prove that gravity is only an
284800	286560	effect and not a force.
286560	292040	I'm putting something on YouTube where I will build the planet Saturn without gravity
292040	295480	and build the Milky Way galaxy without gravity.
295480	299800	Did you also say you're getting your star on the walk of fame?
299800	303800	Interestingly enough, in the context of general relativity, you can argue that gravity is
303800	305360	an effect and not a force.
305360	310240	But it does not follow then that gravity isn't real, and it gets much worse from there.
310240	314680	He's going to build Saturn and build the Milky Way galaxy?
314680	315960	How exactly?
315960	317560	Like in a simulation?
317560	318800	That needs gravity.
318800	323400	If he built a planet or a galaxy with his hands, I would worship him as the one true
323400	324400	God.
324400	328120	But something tells me that in reality, he's been watching some electric universe frauds
328120	331440	on YouTube and now he thinks he's smarter than Einstein.
331440	337280	And we've come to find that the universe, they are abandoning the standard model.
337280	344440	The ideas of black holes in dark matter for an electric model of the universe that is
344440	350240	in response to the Birkeland current and all these things, it's a better version, a better
350240	352440	vision of how we should see the universe.
352440	356200	That's how I see it and I think it should be explored.
356200	357200	Bingo!
357200	361400	Terry binged some Thunderbolts project videos and is repeating what he heard as though he
361400	362560	thought of it.
362560	366280	Then this woman tries to change the subject again and he starts whining about not ever
366280	368320	having been nominated for an Emmy.
368320	373280	Anyway, this is the magnitude of nut job we are dealing with, but it gets much worse.
373280	378280	Around that same time, Terrence started yapping about his new form of math, which he dubbed,
378280	385480	I shit you not, teriology, and which included the startling new revelation that one times
385480	387960	one is two.
387960	393680	Which prestigious mathematics journal did he select to announce this groundbreaking development?
393680	394680	The View.
394680	395680	Let's take a look.
395960	400680	And when I was at Oxford, now this is the point where four bubbles meet equally and
400680	401680	oppositely.
401680	402680	Can I touch it?
402680	403680	Yes.
403680	405880	And it's where 12 planes meet.
405880	411560	This is an undiscovered geometry that I'm now making known to the world here on this
411560	412560	show.
412560	413560	Isn't that fantastic?
413560	414560	I know.
414560	415560	What was the reception?
415560	425560	Well, when I was at Oxford, they were so upset because how can a man that didn't graduate
425560	429980	from one of their prestigious schools come and tell them that the square root of two was
429980	430980	a rational number?
430980	435320	And I said, I didn't come to tell you guys this, I just came to prove to you that it's
435320	440120	a rational number and they were, they didn't like it.
440120	441120	You heard right.
441120	445360	Terrence presented his bullshit at Oxford and the smart people laughed at him.
445360	447780	But why would they laugh at poor old Terry?
447780	451480	Do you think the ladies of the View will be a more receptive audience?
451480	455800	Well you have to remember our entire world economy is based on one times one equaling
455800	456800	one.
456800	461400	Yeah, our entire economy is based on one times one equaling one.
461400	467840	Well, economics does involve numbers, so it should obey the basic logic surrounding numbers
467840	470000	that even children can understand.
470000	471280	So what's the problem?
471280	476720	So if you can prove that an action times an action equals a reaction, which science proves,
476720	479840	then one times one must equal more than one.
479840	484000	And to have the physical proof of it, that kind of shakes things up a bit.
484000	485640	Well you're a shaker up for me.
485640	492460	Wow, if you can prove that an action times an action equals a reaction, okay, numbers
492460	495160	are not actions, they're numbers.
495160	496800	So that doesn't mean anything.
496800	502480	An action times an action also doesn't mean anything because actions are not numbers.
502480	507480	So no, two actions do not necessarily cause a reaction, no matter what he could possibly
507480	509320	mean by reaction.
509320	514480	If two forces are acting on an object that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction,
514480	516360	the object won't move.
516360	518960	Two actions, no reaction.
518960	520280	Sorry, Terry.
520280	525320	But more importantly than demonstrating how everything he just said is bananas idiotic,
525320	529200	let's review what multiplication is.
529200	534200	One is an elementary arithmetic operation, which is essentially repeated addition.
534200	541240	One times four literally means the number one four times, and then you add them up.
541240	545440	One plus one plus one plus one equals four.
545440	551440	One times three, write one three times, add them up, you get three.
551440	556300	One times two, one twice, one plus one is two.
556300	563060	One times one means you write one one time, so it's one.
563060	564700	There's nothing to add.
564700	570540	His revolutionary discovery is just him being dumber than a toddler, and toddlers do like
570540	573300	to shake things, so this lady isn't wrong.
573300	574980	Well you're a shaker up there.
574980	577980	Let's be clear, there are only two possibilities.
577980	584020	One, Terrence Howard is doing a Joaquin Phoenix style extended piece of performance art and
584020	587100	is therefore profoundly brilliant.
587100	592340	Or two, he's a delusional narcissist incapable of living his life without pretending that
592340	594780	he's the smartest person in human history.
594780	596700	Or let's be honest, a god.
596700	600620	I'm putting my money on the ladder because I've seen this all before.
600620	602380	Pick your favorite flat earther.
602380	604620	This is their defense mechanism too.
604620	609920	The smallest of minds can't face a world that doesn't recognize their self-proclaimed brilliance,
609920	615200	so unleash a word salad, convince yourself it's science, and hope that nobody challenges
615200	616200	you on it.
616200	619720	Everything inherently is dielectric because it has matter and then it has a relationship
619720	623480	within the medium, the universal background, the absolute frame of reference, the field
623480	626780	of energy that is the ether, it receives energy from that.
626780	632300	These types of people enact the most impressive mental gymnastics imaginable to maintain their
632300	637760	own ego, and the more I encounter it, the less I find it cute or entertaining.
637760	643520	It's a disease that infects impressionable people and measurably worsens society.
643520	647720	It's not something to simply laugh at, although we are going to laugh quite a bit more before
647720	650080	I return to this thread in my conclusion.
650080	655240	So as promised, let's dive into his very recent appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast.
655240	658640	It's three hours long, so we aren't going to hit every moment.
658640	663120	Rest assured, he was completely insane from top to bottom, but let's just go through
663120	664360	some highlights.
664360	672200	My first memory was almost like when you're dreaming and you're falling, and you hit the
672200	677520	bottom and you wake up, that was my first memory, but I didn't wake up here.
677520	683840	I was inside my mother's womb, and I was about maybe six months inside the womb.
683840	689120	He comes out hot in the first 30 seconds, claiming that he remembers being in his mother's
689120	690120	womb.
690120	691520	I'll remove the suspense for you.
691520	692520	No, he didn't.
692520	694200	That's physically impossible.
694200	695880	Is that any proof, Terry?
695880	699320	I remember all of that coming out.
699320	705040	Remember being compressed, being born, I remember being circumcised, I remember the whole nine
705040	712000	and the proof of it was when my wife, Mira, that you just met, when she was six months
712000	717680	pregnant with my son, Karen, I wanted to prove to her what I was talking about.
717680	722960	So I put a light on her stomach every day at six o'clock at night, and I would move
722960	728080	that light back and forth, and I'd put a song on for a week straight.
728080	730040	First thing he wanted to do is see light.
730040	735760	He loved light from that early stage, and I can ask him the square root of two, the square
735760	740560	root of five, the square root of that, the square root of pi, the square, and he will
740560	741940	run it off.
741940	749120	So his proof of him remembering being born is a random anecdote about his wife's pregnancy,
749120	754160	his kid liking light, and a lie about his son being able to do math that Terry himself
754160	755280	can't do.
755280	756280	But there's more.
756280	763600	And then when I was about five years old, I had another dream, and it was this mansion,
763600	769100	and he would hand me these shapes, and each shape was different and amazing, and I had
769100	771880	access to all the knowledge.
771880	775880	The proof of it is the 97 patents that I have now.
775880	779800	The proof of it is the industries that I've innovated.
779800	786520	Yes, the proof that he has access to all the universe's knowledge is that he has some patents,
786520	790760	something that anybody can get for anything and proves absolutely nothing except that
790760	792360	he likes to waste money.
792360	794360	He's never innovated any industry.
794360	799240	That's why he doesn't actually do anything except ramble like a lunatic on podcasts.
799240	803400	You know, I had the Grand Unified Field equation.
803400	809360	I had already put that together, and at seven, eight, I was working with these things, and
809360	812480	then I went through all of the hell that I had to go through.
812480	818520	Yes, he had a Grand Unified Field equation at seven years old, but he wrote it down once
818520	821280	in the dog ate it, and then he forgot what it was.
821280	823840	That's why he didn't get the Nobel Prize for physics.
823840	826360	Also, his girlfriend goes to another school.
826360	827680	That's why you don't know her.
827680	834400	But my intention was to rebuild the periodic table, build a new periodic table, because
834400	838560	the stuff I had learned in college, I went to school for chemical engineering the first
838560	847480	year over at Pratt, and at the time, I think it was like 108 elements, and I told the teacher,
847480	855400	the professor, about the relationship between hydrogen on the spectrometer and carbon and
855400	861240	silicon and cobalt, and I was like, it's the same exact color, same tone, just doubled
861240	866000	in each octave, and he was like, no, each element is the same element, and it will always be
866000	867000	that element.
867000	871000	And I was like, you don't see the relationship, so I left school.
871000	875960	Did you leave school or did you flunk out because you kept writing, cobalt is an octave
875960	879720	of carbon on your exams instead of answering the questions?
879720	883800	And I was going to spend 40 years rebuilding the periodic table, and I found out that Walter
884240	890320	Russell had already did that, and he did it based upon the natural curvature of everything.
890320	895360	Walter Russell, who was not a chemist, made this in the 1920s, and it doesn't mean anything.
895360	898200	The chemical elements display periodicity.
898200	903920	You can illustrate that periodicity in rows, or you can make spirals and other shapes.
903920	909280	It's arbitrary, and listing elements this way doesn't offer any novel insight into chemistry
909280	911600	or any predictive power whatsoever.
911840	916080	Terry just likes the shape as much as he likes pretending to understand chemistry better
916080	919000	than chemists, or 10th graders for that matter.
919000	922480	And when you say rebuild the periodic table, what do you mean specifically?
922480	927200	Well the way the periodic table is laid out, you'll see hydrogen sitting all the way over
927200	932840	there by itself, but they don't show that hydrogen has the same tone as carbon.
932840	934160	What do you mean by tone?
934160	941160	Same tone, same key of E, same key of E. 40.5 Hertz, the next one would be like 80.5 Hertz.
941600	949920	81 Hertz, you go to silicon, it will double up and would be 162 Hertz, you'll go to cobalt,
949920	952240	and it'll be 324 Hertz.
952240	959200	It's in that base, if you were to take the angles of incidence, or the tones that they
959200	964600	create, their color, like you can turn color back into sound.
964600	969160	Joe wants to know what the hell he's talking about, and Terry is off to the races rambling
969160	970920	about tones.
970920	976160	These are not tones, they're not notes, they're not keys, they're not anything related to
976160	981640	music whatsoever, they're atoms with a particular number of protons in the nucleus.
981640	985280	He's throwing out random terminology and random numbers.
985280	989680	Angle of incidence has to do with light, sounds are not colors, and there's nothing
989680	992680	more to say about this unparalleled gibberish.
992680	1000680	You'll see there's a relationship between hydrogen, carbon, silicon, cobalt, rhodium.
1000680	1007160	They're all bonded, they're all as the middle point between two noble gases.
1007160	1010920	So those things don't really exist, it's only one substance.
1010920	1013840	No Terry, those elements exist.
1013840	1018520	Hydrogen and carbon and silicon and cobalt and rhodium are different elements, they
1018520	1020760	are not the same thing.
1020760	1025800	Hydrogen gas is not the same as a hunk of coal, which is not the same as a sample of
1025800	1027720	silicon and so forth.
1027720	1031640	They're just the halfway point of their respective periods, which is irrelevant.
1031640	1038560	Now the problem is, the first thing that we're able to perceive is hydrogen.
1038560	1046120	That's the first visible element, because before it is too dense for us to perceive it.
1046120	1048840	You understand what I'm saying?
1048840	1055880	No, hydrogen is the first element because it's the element with one proton in its nucleus.
1056600	1061240	Hydrogen has one.
1061240	1063640	That's the smallest positive integer.
1063640	1068480	Of course you're so insane that even something as trivial as one being the smallest positive
1068480	1073360	integer can no longer be taken for granted in your illustrious presence.
1073360	1080040	But as you reach into the next octave, the carbon octave, and they call that a bisexual
1080040	1085080	tone, because the carbon has two tones to it.
1085080	1090400	It has a negative side and a positive side, the part where lithium behaves.
1090400	1098400	Lithium is contractive, beryllium is contractive, boron is contractive, but the moment you
1098400	1101200	get to carbon, you balance it out.
1101200	1107400	It gets to a perfect balance of plus and minus four, so it's a double tone.
1107400	1109920	Carbon is bisexual, you guys.
1109920	1112040	Atoms have sexuality.
1112040	1114680	Elements being contractive is also meaningless.
1114680	1116720	Everything he is saying is meaningless.
1116720	1123240	What they've tried to keep from us, if you want to break water into its component parts
1123240	1130720	of hydrogen and oxygen, all you have to do is introduce beryllium, or the sound of beryllium.
1130720	1138520	And will violently break away from any other thing, even hydrogen, to bond with that beryllium.
1138520	1140800	Ah yes, the infamous they.
1140800	1143040	What are they trying to keep from us now?
1143040	1146560	You want to perform electrolysis on water, but how?
1146560	1148800	Not electricity, heavens know.
1148800	1150000	Use beryllium.
1150000	1154680	But wait, not even beryllium itself, just the sound of beryllium.
1154680	1156680	What's that sound again?
1157640	1161160	Yep, that's what beryllium sounds like, startling, no?
1161160	1165840	I'm sorry that I made all the water in your body turn into hydrogen and oxygen gas and
1165840	1167400	you're dead now.
1167400	1171680	Elements don't have sounds, but even funnier than that, beryllium is the only alkaline
1171680	1175160	earth metal that does not react with water.
1175160	1181080	Every time he speaks, he's wrong in so many ways simultaneously that it's almost impressive.
1181080	1188680	The reason that arsenic kills us is because our DNA has nitrogen and it has phosphorus
1188680	1194680	in it because nitrogen unwinds into the next octave right after silicone and becomes phosphorus.
1194680	1198800	Our DNA has both of those in there, but it's going by tone.
1198800	1206000	So the moment arsenic, which sits as a minus three on the next octave, the moment arsenic
1206000	1210800	is introduced, the body thinks that, oh, this is my thing that I need.
1210800	1216640	And it tries to wrap itself around the arsenic, but it causes the DNA to unravel.
1216640	1221560	Wow, arsenic is harmful because it interferes with biochemical pathways.
1221560	1226840	For example, it enacts allosteric inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is an enzyme
1226840	1229040	involved in aerobic respiration.
1229040	1233480	That means it binds to the enzyme, in this case not specifically at the active site,
1233480	1237880	and the interaction changes the shape of the enzyme just enough to render it incapable of
1237880	1239560	carrying out its function.
1239560	1243480	The cell can't make ATP, so it enacts apoptosis and dies.
1243480	1248160	There are similar effects on other enzymes involved with signaling, DNA repair, and so
1248160	1249160	forth.
1249160	1253360	Virtually anything that's harmful to biological systems is harmful because of sophisticated
1253360	1258020	interactions with the cellular machinery, which require knowledge of molecular biology
1258020	1259520	to understand.
1259520	1264240	No, DNA does not wrap around arsenic, nor does it unravel.
1264240	1269800	Terry has no clue what DNA is, what it does, or literally anything about molecules in general.
1269800	1277000	But nature doesn't allow us to unravel that, but now with the wave conjugations, we can.
1277000	1282480	We couldn't do that before because we didn't know the angles of incidence that were necessary
1282480	1287280	to open these things up, and you couldn't do that with the platonic solids because the
1287280	1291240	platonic solids were averages and approximations.
1291240	1296240	It really is just breathtaking the way he throws together totally unrelated terminology
1296240	1298140	with this much confidence.
1298140	1300280	What does one even do with this?
1300280	1306240	Wave conjugation, angle of incidence, platonic solids, these don't go together.
1306240	1311480	It's like saying you need 6 hammer the ice cream to monkey of 11 dizzy.
1311480	1314560	Your reaction to these two statements should be the same.
1314560	1319480	And the platonic solids are specifically the opposites of averages and approximations.
1319480	1322840	They are hypothetical idealized structures.
1322840	1325400	Reality consists of approximations.
1325400	1328160	Again, it's just breathtaking.
1328160	1332840	It's legitimately challenging to come up with sentences that are as wrong as everything
1332840	1333840	he says.
1333840	1338280	It took me several minutes to write the monkey sentence because I kept wanting to write things
1338280	1343040	like monkey of fire, which accidentally make more sense than I wanted.
1343040	1345120	He has a gift for gibberish.
1345120	1352400	Because the universe is based off of equanimity, which Einstein left out in his theory of relativity.
1352400	1359880	The balancing side of the gravity, gravity was caused by electric force.
1359880	1362880	Electricity is always seeking a higher pressure condition.
1362880	1367960	It spins northeast as trying to get to the center of an area, the center of a cone.
1367960	1372120	But the next electric wave is coming, so it gets pushed out, and as it's pushed out,
1372120	1373840	it gets to the vortices.
1373840	1380000	Yeah, gravity is not electric, matter specifically disperses from higher to lower pressure.
1380000	1383760	You can't spin northeast, that's a cardinal direction.
1383760	1388000	Center of an area can't mean center of a cone, since areas are two-dimensional and
1388000	1389640	a cone is three-dimensional.
1389640	1392520	And what is pushed out to what vortices?
1392520	1394520	How does this guy do this?
1394520	1398240	We are only 19 minutes in, and it's all like this.
1398240	1404000	But instead of following the natural curvature of these 64 circles overlapping, they averaged
1404000	1414000	the space where they met, and they invented straight lines.
1414000	1415520	Why did they do that?
1415520	1418160	Because they believed that the world was flat.
1418160	1422840	The irony here is that figures like Pythagoras and Parmenides were the first people in recorded
1422840	1428200	history to propose that the Earth is a sphere, and substantiated logically.
1428200	1432600	But more importantly, the Platonic solids are just derived from playing with polygons
1432600	1434400	and making polyhedra.
1434400	1439040	And even more importantly than that, none of this geometry has any correlation with
1439040	1442680	any of the bullshit he's spewing about chemistry and physics.
1442680	1444720	They're utterly separate realms.
1444720	1446920	Then we get to the fancy animations.
1446920	1454840	This is hydrogen, and as I was saying, electricity is always trying to get to the center of that
1454840	1458600	triangle, but it gets pushed out.
1458600	1459920	That's not hydrogen.
1459920	1461520	It's not even a triangle.
1461520	1464000	And where's the electricity exactly?
1464000	1465000	Eight bubbles me.
1465000	1466160	They gave me the patents to that.
1466160	1468240	I called that the tetraion.
1468240	1470520	Don't worry guys, he patented the shape.
1470520	1472120	You can patent shapes now.
1472120	1474640	I know the guy who has the patent on the rhombus.
1474640	1476200	He's a billionaire.
1476200	1482600	Spheres that's going around this, but the greater attractor has grabbed the two weaker attractors.
1482600	1486160	And this looks just like a photon, and guess what, it has 30 poles.
1486160	1488800	Yeah, it looks just like a photon.
1488800	1494320	Massless, chargeless photons look like this dumb shape he made up, because he says so.
1494320	1497480	This is where 12 bubbles meet the arboreans.
1497480	1501400	And then I put five of them together and they make these natural starfish.
1501400	1508480	But then when I put 10 of them together, they lay themselves out and they predict all distribution
1508480	1511240	of matter within the electric field.
1511240	1514280	Hey, he used the magic word, prediction.
1514280	1515280	What do they predict?
1515280	1517840	The distribution of matter, what?
1517840	1518840	Where?
1518840	1520160	Show us a prediction, Terry.
1520160	1521160	No?
1521160	1522280	Back to gibberish.
1522280	1527160	One of the first things, but when Walter Russell came out with his book and he introduced
1527160	1533480	his periodic table, he watched as different people went up and collected Nobel prizes
1533480	1540280	for deuterium, for tritium, for all these things that he had discovered.
1540280	1546120	And I was like, okay, let me wait until the patents are granted before I'll talk about
1546120	1547120	it.
1547120	1548800	Walter Russell wasn't a chemist.
1548800	1551680	He was an artist and he was delusional.
1551680	1553880	That's why you worship him, Terry.
1553880	1558640	People aren't awarded Nobel prizes in chemistry for drawing pretty pictures.
1558640	1562680	Yuri got a Nobel for discovering deuterium because that actually matters.
1562680	1566800	You just don't know what isotopes are, even though you use that word all the time.
1566800	1572920	Back to Neil deGrasse, when he wrote his response to my paper and he said, if you have
1572920	1575960	any other questions, you're going to have to see somebody else and he wouldn't take
1575960	1576960	my calls anymore.
1576960	1581880	I was like, okay, so I wrote the book based off of those responses and I reached out to
1581880	1584520	another guy, Dr. David Tong.
1584520	1589160	That would be very interesting that that would be his take as a public educator, that
1589160	1591520	he wouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
1591520	1597080	Yeah, Terry sent his ramblings to Neil deGrasse Tyson since everyone who knows zero things
1597080	1602320	about science assumes that Neil is the president of science and Neil was gracious enough to
1602320	1607480	explain to him how everything he says is wrong, probably more politely than I would.
1607480	1613000	But Terry, the narcissist, presses forward, shocked that an intelligent, busy person wouldn't
1613000	1616160	want to waste his time placating a toddler.
1616280	1622800	Joe seems surprised too, forgetting that educators enjoy educating people, not spending time
1622800	1626880	and energy trying to show an insane person how insane they are.
1626880	1629040	Why this fixation with Neil?
1629040	1633280	The reason I wanted to talk to him was because of his show, The Cosmos, that he was doing
1633280	1637760	after that incredible guy Carl Sagan did.
1637760	1645440	The very first episode he had was talking about Giorgiano Bruno and he said that Giorgiano
1645520	1651360	Bruno was looking for that grand unified field equation and maybe one day somebody is going
1651360	1656320	to do it and when they do it, it's going to change the world and I'm like, dude, I've
1656320	1660640	done it, I've got it here.
1660640	1665520	Giorgiano Bruno was not looking for a grand unified field equation.
1665520	1669000	Quantum physics didn't exist in the 16th century.
1669000	1672080	The concept of fields didn't exist in general.
1672080	1675420	The term was coined by Faraday in the 19th century.
1675420	1679180	This is the problem with science illiterate morons like Terry.
1679180	1682740	They have no respect for science whatsoever.
1682740	1688740	They have no interest in learning basic scientific principles, the history of science, what any
1688740	1695020	scientist did, what scientists are doing now, how to do science, none of it.
1695020	1701340	They are singularly obsessed with the lofty idea of one brilliant insight that can change
1701340	1702460	the world.
1702460	1704580	It doesn't matter what it's called.
1704580	1709260	That's why he keeps saying grand unified field equation because it doesn't mean anything
1709260	1710260	to him.
1710260	1712580	It's a fun phrase, nothing more.
1712580	1716820	That's what everyone was trying to do since antiquity because he says so and he's the
1716820	1719340	one who's done it because he says so.
1719340	1722860	Walter Russell talked about the fact that the sun gave birth to the earth, that it didn't
1722860	1727260	coalesce from some field and the proof of this.
1727260	1732460	Do you guys know that the earth is drifting away from the sun and all of the planets in
1732700	1742700	every solar system is drifting away from their primary at the same exact rate, like 1.5 centimeters.
1742700	1749260	This is a universal expansion that's happening with everything moving away.
1749260	1755980	Them saying and the web telescope have proven that those galaxies couldn't have formed 13,
1755980	1758260	14 billion years ago.
1758260	1765180	If you would just add up linearly, how long it would take the earth to go from the sun
1765180	1773180	to 93 million miles away, it's 9 trillion, hold on, let's go.
1773180	1774460	This is what I'm talking about.
1774460	1778700	He can't be bothered to learn literally anything about astronomy.
1778700	1783260	The expansion of the universe has nothing to do with the dynamics of an individual solar
1783260	1784260	system.
1784420	1790100	Sun did not give birth to the earth, as though our planet emerged from inside of a star.
1790100	1794580	He knows nothing about planetary formation, and the idea that we have measured this for
1794580	1798300	all other systems, how exactly would that work?
1798300	1803740	We can detect an exoplanet's orbit increasing by a centimeter, how?
1803740	1807860	But sure, play with your calculator that you already told us shouldn't be used because
1807860	1809500	it lies about arithmetic.
1809620	1814220	Well, because I know they're watching me right now, and they're mad at me.
1814220	1816740	Who's day?
1816740	1825100	The people that want that, our entire world economy is based off of the politicians and
1825100	1829300	the authorities that give the politicians their accreditation.
1829300	1834260	And those authorities, those universities are all based, their entire curriculum is based
1834260	1836300	off the platonic solids.
1837100	1847900	Look at the level of paranoia beyond the simple delusions.
1847900	1853460	The shadow government is watching Terry because he debunked the platonic solids which are
1853460	1858580	the basis of every economics course in every Rockefeller-Jesuit institution.
1858580	1862860	I'm shocked that he's not a flatterther because this is exactly how they talk.
1862860	1866580	But don't worry, he's an anti-vaxxer, obviously, and Joe is too.
1866580	1872180	You took a bold stand, no, years ago when the governments were trying to poison their
1872180	1873340	citizens.
1873340	1876220	You took a very bold stand that nobody else took.
1876220	1880420	That's what I was like, wow, I appreciate you because I lost three, four jobs because
1880420	1882220	I refuse to take it.
1882220	1883220	I refuse to take it.
1883220	1886420	I bet you feel better about it now, especially when you know all these people that have health
1886420	1888020	problems because of it.
1888020	1890540	Cancers has increased 300 percent.
1890540	1894220	All cause mortality, up 40 percent in some age groups.
1894220	1897220	Pulmonary embolisms almost up like 500 percent.
1897220	1899220	Yeah, what caused that?
1899220	1901060	No, none of those things are true.
1901060	1905540	You heard them on the internet and believed them, but Terry has a little bit of biochemistry
1905540	1907060	knowledge he wants to share.
1907060	1914100	I can walk you through what the spike protein did to the BRCA1 gene, that's the gene inside
1914100	1919700	of our DNA that tells us that there's a damage, there's damage that's happening almost like
1919700	1925540	the crews that go along the highway and they immediately put up cones every time there's
1925540	1926540	a problem.
1926540	1932420	Well, the spike protein, which is never, no protein has ever been able to enter into
1932420	1934260	the nucleus of a cell.
1934260	1939140	Not only did it go to the ribosomes and say, hey, you know what, I don't want you to produce
1939140	1944060	whatever protein like if it was a skin cell, you're not going to produce keratin anymore.
1944060	1945980	You're just going to produce these spike proteins.
1945980	1953180	That spike protein went into the DNA and it tells the BRCA1 gene turn off and that's
1953180	1958140	the gene that says, hey, there's a mutation here, let's scrap that thing.
1958140	1961300	And so now the cancers are building up.
1961300	1964300	The spike protein doesn't do anything to any gene.
1964300	1966300	He doesn't know what genes are.
1966300	1968220	Genes don't tell us things.
1968220	1970580	They are instructions for protein assembly.
1970580	1974380	That's why he goes to his pathetic analogy of something he saw on the highway because
1974380	1977420	he doesn't know how transcription and translation work.
1977420	1982180	There is nothing unique about this spike protein and he doesn't know what ribosomes do.
1982180	1985660	They translate any mRNA transcript that binds.
1985660	1990100	Making a spike protein doesn't render it incapable of producing other proteins.
1990100	1993260	Spike proteins can't go into DNA.
1993260	1996220	They can't tell a gene anything.
1996220	1998420	They can't turn off genes.
1998420	2000260	Genes don't detect mutations.
2000260	2004960	The enzymes they code for are what do that and he doesn't know what cancer is.
2004960	2006340	This is really pathetic.
2006340	2007340	Let's skip ahead.
2007340	2011740	So is he saying that just by doing these calculations he created the exact form of Saturn including
2011740	2012740	the rings?
2012740	2014300	Just the exact form of it.
2014300	2015300	Just with the calculations.
2015300	2019500	So you change the angles of incidence that these linchpins, because remember each one
2019500	2022060	of these are opposing vortices.
2022060	2025500	So there's 12 vortices to this that are opposing.
2025500	2031780	So once the angles of incidence change, you change the motion and pressure conditions,
2031780	2036180	you can now change the condition or the crystallization.
2036180	2042180	So he's pretending to explain planetary formation without gravity and without explaining literally
2042180	2044460	anything about what he's doing.
2044460	2047060	Click a button, the planet is there.
2047060	2048420	What are the dots?
2048420	2049960	Where did the matter come from?
2049960	2052100	How did it arrange itself?
2052100	2054100	Planetary formation is a process.
2054100	2056500	This just materialized that of thin air.
2056500	2057500	How?
2057500	2058860	There are no vortices.
2058860	2059860	Nothing is opposing.
2059860	2061900	There is no angle of incidence.
2061900	2063800	There is no crystallization.
2063800	2066220	He is just listing random buzzwords.
2066220	2071340	Now because we have the angles of incidence, material engineering can now separate the
2071340	2078620	space between carbon and nitrogen or carbon and boron and have the same elements of titanium,
2078620	2085060	vanadium, chromium, magnesay and iron or nickel, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, gallium
2085060	2089380	or germanium in those higher octaves.
2089380	2093260	We can do that between silicone and phosphorus or silicone and aluminum.
2093260	2100180	So the transparent aluminum now becomes possible because we can now control the pressure and
2100180	2105540	change the pressure and motion conditions where we couldn't do that before because they
2105540	2112100	were going by Cartesian space at 90 degrees and 45 degrees straight lines, the Euclidean
2112100	2117580	space that they've made up, this orthogonal or church like space that they've generated
2117580	2120500	because they wanted to promote that cross.
2120500	2122700	He doesn't even know the names of the elements.
2122700	2125980	He's saying mangasane instead of manganese.
2125980	2130500	He says silicone instead of silicon because he doesn't know that silicone is a different
2130500	2131500	material.
2131500	2133300	He can't pronounce orthogonal.
2133300	2138660	He's never even heard these words spoken before and he is doing nothing whatsoever to actually
2138660	2142220	explain anything about what he just showed to Joe.
2142220	2149860	He's practically speaking in tongues and Joe is lapping it up.
2149860	2154940	And as the cherry on top, he pretends that this brilliance was hidden because the Catholic
2154940	2158740	church loves the straight lines from the cross.
2158740	2164260	Does he not know how much power this symbol still has over normal people even today who
2164260	2166860	would never fall for any of this bullshit?
2166860	2171540	He just knows that churching up the story gives it a Da Vinci code vibe that ensnares
2171540	2172540	gullible people.
2172540	2178100	Can you tell me how a planet is formed under this theory?
2178100	2182340	So you have a sun and how does the sun give birth to these planets?
2182340	2212140	90 minutes in, Joe finally asks him to actually explain something and Terry's
2212860	2215180	response is astounding.
2215180	2219540	Stars crap out planets the way we take a dump on the toilet.
2219540	2221540	Case closed everyone.
2221540	2223260	Planets are fecal matter.
2223260	2226080	And the red spot on Jupiter will be a planet leader.
2226080	2230260	Of course this is meaningless since it's a storm, it's a cyclone.
2230260	2233500	How does a bunch of wind form a planet exactly?
2233500	2237140	And he's just so objectively wrong about every trivial detail.
2237140	2241500	The red spot is not at the equator, it's 22 degrees below the equator.
2241860	2247300	And the human anus is not located on the waist.
2247300	2252820	This is such a stunning example of the difference between real science and insane ramblings.
2252820	2255380	Ask this question of an astrophysicist.
2255380	2260580	You'll get mountains of data, explanations, equations, predictions, confirmations of those
2260580	2262820	predictions through observation.
2262820	2264980	Ask Terry at what do you get?
2264980	2267060	The sun takes a crap.
2267060	2268180	The end.
2268180	2270220	Who falls for this stuff?
2270220	2274740	Everything is just one great being, we're all God.
2274740	2281740	That's what Jesus was talking about, that's what Buddha was talking about, it's recognizing
2281740	2283700	the divinity in you.
2283700	2288500	Actually neither of those people said anything like that, Buddha didn't proclaim to be divine
2288500	2293900	and in Christian mythology Jesus didn't say I'm God and so are all of you.
2293900	2296140	He just said that he was God.
2296140	2299140	That's kind of why the Romans killed him.
2299140	2304620	Terry is just looking for excuses to call himself God and he's as dumb with theology
2304620	2306260	as he is with science.
2306260	2312180	Here I've invented, here I'm an Oscar nominated actor that is known all around the world,
2312180	2316140	face recognition, vocal recognition all around the world.
2316140	2320820	I've invented a new form of flight, tangential flight, the ability to fly around your own
2320820	2327460	center of mass, something they've never been able to do and you don't hear anything about
2327460	2328460	it.
2328460	2334100	Harsicism is oozing out of every pore of his body and congealing into little origami cranes
2334100	2335740	in front of our eyes.
2335740	2341340	He's world famous kind of so his imaginary invention must be brilliant.
2341340	2343660	Tangential flight, tangent to what?
2343660	2348580	He doesn't know what a tangent is and of course his little toddler toy doesn't actually fly
2348580	2351980	or do anything, he just has cute animations.
2351980	2356260	Instead of all the props having to turn themselves around to stop and turn in opposite directions
2356260	2362860	they just switch the direction, they just, so it's a collective pitch and it changes
2362860	2367260	and so now instead of going up you're going down but now five of them will come together.
2367260	2371620	So I was trying to reach out to Elon Musk, I was trying to reach out to Jeff Bezos, I
2371620	2376500	was trying because my main goal was I was building these to clean up the upper atmosphere,
2376500	2384820	all of that debris that's up there and ultimately to mine the asteroid belt.
2384820	2388900	You can immediately see that someone is clicking on a screen to trigger an animation so it's
2388900	2393340	anyone's guess as to why Elon Musk should care about this crappy video game.
2393340	2398340	Terry is not only smarter than every physicist in history but he's better at building space
2398340	2402460	crafts than everyone alive despite never having built anything.
2402460	2404780	The hubris is off the charts.
2404780	2409380	It's not worth listening to this entire rant but he genuinely believes that he has invented
2409380	2414500	revolutionary technology and that he's being ignored for literally no reason.
2414500	2422380	And so it's just going to react and immediately it converts into a plasma and so we can project
2422380	2425020	anything into space.
2425020	2429460	All of that has been accomplished and it's ignored.
2429460	2434580	Delusional narcissists always have this precise brand of persecution complex.
2434580	2439020	James Tore, Ben Davidson, they all do the same thing.
2439020	2444780	All the experts are morons because they ignore my super brilliant revolutionary insights.
2444780	2449100	The whole establishment is against me because they're afraid of my truth.
2449100	2450980	Honestly, I think we've had enough.
2450980	2456300	I got 2 hours into the 3 hour podcast and there's just no point in continuing.
2456300	2462100	It's the epitome of manic hogwash with virtually nothing to even sink your teeth into and there's
2462100	2466020	only so many times I can point out that what he's saying is meaningless.
2466020	2468780	In the end, there's only one point that needs to be made.
2468780	2474060	Pretentious tools like Terry can hope to fool as many people as they can by speaking confidently
2474060	2477460	and using jargon they hope the listener doesn't understand.
2477460	2480020	But what can they do with it?
2480020	2482740	What can they physically achieve with it?
2482740	2486860	Terry thinks he's reinvented physics but that's because he never learned any physics
2486860	2488180	in the first place.
2488180	2490420	Take this free body problem for example.
2490420	2493060	This is something he was supposed to learn in high school.
2493060	2497300	You use Newton's Laws, plug in some numbers and you get an answer that correlates with
2497300	2498300	reality.
2498300	2502320	You can predict what will happen when you let go of the block.
2502320	2503500	And guess what?
2503500	2507340	When you let go of the block, that thing does happen.
2507340	2510100	Terry's gibberish doesn't have that power.
2510100	2516060	His ramblings have no utility, no predictive power, no technological application.
2516060	2517380	It's a parlor trick.
2517380	2519220	It's basically hypnotism.
2519220	2522320	But as I mentioned before, it's not harmless.
2522320	2527280	His way of thinking is dangerous and these types of people are often dangerous.
2527280	2528880	Do you want some evidence?
2528880	2529880	Because I was angry.
2529880	2532040	I was really angry.
2532040	2539760	And I was going to use all of the knowledge that I had and I was going to destroy mankind.
2539760	2545160	Oh my God, right out of Marvel.
2545160	2547760	I was like, yeah, I was about to, but then...
2547760	2549320	Well, I'm glad you didn't.
2549320	2551280	Things like these are very revealing.
2551280	2552400	It's not a joke.
2552400	2559040	He genuinely believes he has this kind of power and he has contemplated exercising it in a
2559040	2561380	violent, destructive way.
2561380	2565400	Do you know who else has had such thoughts and acted on them?
2565400	2568000	Go and read the Manifesto of the Unabomber.
2568000	2574040	It's the exact same self-aggrandizing tone, the same superiority complex, the same incessant
2574040	2575400	rambling.
2575400	2579720	This is the psyche of cult leaders and domestic terrorists.
2579720	2584680	I'm not saying that Terrence Howard necessarily would or will blow something up in murder
2584680	2590220	people, but those who blow things up in murder people tend to think this way.
2590220	2595560	They have this strain of delusional narcissism in them that enables them to first think they're
2595560	2601600	better than everyone else and also that they deserve the right to exercise power over others.
2601600	2603600	Terry is mentally ill.
2603600	2608800	He should be checked into a mental institution to get treatment for his personality disorder.
2608800	2614120	Cue the onslaught of people saying I have no right to diagnose anyone based on a podcast
2614120	2615120	appearance.
2615120	2616960	Yeah, technically, you're right.
2616960	2621800	But also, he is a delusional narcissist with a personality disorder that should be committed
2621800	2623480	to a mental institution.
2623480	2624480	Sorry.
2624480	2629160	And if the people in his life really cared about him, they'd have done that a while ago.
2629160	2630720	Now let's pivot to Joe.
2630720	2634280	In my video on Tucker Carlson, I gave Joe a bit of a pass.
2634280	2639080	But here, Joe just fails miserably and his failure is twofold.
2639080	2643840	First, Joe desperately needs a better bullshit detector.
2643840	2649480	Anybody who can't tell that Terrence is completely full of shit within a few sentences has terrible
2649480	2651600	judgment end of story.
2651600	2655400	You don't even need to be able to articulate with clarity how he is wrong.
2655760	2661400	It's just blatantly apparent in his manner of presenting ideas, the way he vomits esoteric
2661400	2667040	terminology rapid fire, the way he overperforms to give the impression of profundity.
2667040	2670920	It's immediately apparent to any rational person.
2670920	2675520	But the other problem is a more pernicious type of mental defect, which I've mentioned
2675520	2679400	many times, and that is the anti-establishment bias.
2679400	2681120	Joe has that in spades.
2681120	2686000	This is not something like your explanation of these things and your description of the
2686000	2691960	very nature of reality itself is not something that should be taken lightly.
2691960	2692960	No.
2692960	2694280	It's something that, like...
2694280	2695280	Thank you for saying that.
2695280	2701760	It needs to be laid out and it needs to be slowly examined because you've obviously spent
2701760	2703720	a lot of time working on this.
2703720	2710240	People with this bias can hear any ridiculous story from any unqualified, clueless weirdo
2710360	2715320	and they will immediately give it far more credence than it deserves simply because it
2715320	2720480	feeds their desire to see established knowledge arbitrarily overturned.
2720480	2726280	Joe is psychologically incapable of seeing how stupid this all is because he desperately
2726280	2728200	wants this story to be true.
2728200	2730200	Wow.
2730200	2735000	I wish I could really truly understand exactly what you're saying because I'm kind of getting
2735000	2737560	it and you're doing a great job explaining it.
2737560	2744800	But if you're right, that really changes everything and it accounts for why physics
2744800	2747880	kind of hits a stalling point.
2747880	2751320	It doesn't matter that Joe has no clue what he's saying.
2751320	2756880	Instead of entertaining the idea that he isn't really saying anything, he just blindly asserts
2756880	2762360	that the emperor has all his clothes on and that the imaginary garments must be so much
2762360	2767560	better than the drab and outdated clothing that establishment science provides.
2767560	2772880	A field which obviously must be stalling just because he refuses to lift a finger to learn
2772880	2775480	how vibrant the field really is.
2775480	2782320	It's contrarianism on steroids to the point where even the most trivial self-evident facts
2782320	2786960	can be called into question just because of their addiction to perceiving themselves
2786960	2789240	as superior to the masses.
2789240	2794280	Even something as trivial as 1 times 1 equals 1.
2794280	2801400	This insistence that the dissenting voice should instantly be taken more seriously than substantiated
2801400	2807900	knowledge is an infantile attitude that is destroying our culture and I'm tired of everyone
2807900	2812440	looking the other way for fear of making waves or insulting people.
2812440	2816400	Terrence should be mocked to his face on a daily basis.
2816400	2821440	He may not be evil or deserve severe punishment, but these are the checks and balances that
2821440	2823840	maintain civic responsibility.
2823840	2828520	If you act like social poison, there should be an antidote.
2828520	2834240	Everyone in his vicinity should be constantly showing him how delusional he is until something
2834240	2838740	registers and he takes it upon himself to change.
2838740	2843040	Because as insane as he is, his ramblings have an impact.
2843040	2844400	Certain people listen.
2844400	2845880	Their minds warp.
2845880	2851040	They choose to further disregard the body of human knowledge or any concept of expertise
2851040	2856580	and we all suffer the consequences of the poor choices they make as a result.
2856580	2859640	But what's the one thing we can say for certain about Terry?
2859640	2865640	This is what you'll be remembered for and your acting will be just a footnote.
2865640	2866920	That about sums it up.
2866920	2871900	He will be remembered as a pointless lunatic no matter how badly the contrarians want to
2871900	2874280	delude themselves.
2874280	2878520	So that's it for Terrence Howard, it is genuinely astounding to me that anyone would listen
2878520	2883680	to this guy for more than 30 seconds and subjecting myself to several hours of his ramblings has
2883680	2886400	probably taken a few months off of my life.
2886400	2888040	So I hope you got something out of it.
2888040	2888920	I'll see you next time.
