WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Hey everyone!

00:01.000 --> 00:05.380
I've been getting a lot of requests lately as to who to debunk next, and several dozen

00:05.380 --> 00:09.880
of you have asked me to address the complete insanity that was Terrence Howard's recent

00:09.880 --> 00:12.120
appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast.

00:12.120 --> 00:16.360
While I normally avoid lunatics of this caliber, I felt this one was worth addressing for a

00:16.360 --> 00:19.400
few reasons, so let's take a closer look.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.120
If you don't know who Terrence Howard is, he's an actor.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.760
I'll be honest, I've never seen him act in anything.

00:24.760 --> 00:28.440
He was in a really popular TV show that I didn't watch, and I've never seen any of

00:28.440 --> 00:29.440
his movies.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.320
If he might be a great actor, he might suck.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.080
I don't know, and I don't care.

00:33.080 --> 00:37.680
What's more important is his extracurricular activities as a delusional narcissist who

00:37.680 --> 00:40.440
thinks he's the smartest person in human history.

00:40.440 --> 00:44.420
I don't know exactly when he started showing the world his God complex, but he was away

00:44.420 --> 00:47.800
before the Rogan appearance, so let's go back just a bit.

00:47.800 --> 00:52.400
Here he is making a total fool of himself on the red carpet at the Emmys in 2019.

00:52.400 --> 00:59.040
I've made some discoveries in my own personal life with the science that, you know, Pythagoras

00:59.040 --> 01:00.040
was searching for.

01:00.040 --> 01:05.920
I was able to open up the flower of life properly and find the real wave conjugations that we've

01:05.920 --> 01:08.080
been looking for for 10,000 years.

01:08.080 --> 01:13.880
Why would I continue, you know, walking on water for tips when I've got an entire generation

01:13.880 --> 01:16.240
to teach a whole new world?

01:16.240 --> 01:17.560
That's a big remark.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.600
Okay, let's break this down.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.840
The science that Pythagoras was searching for.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.880
Pythagoras was a philosopher and mathematician.

01:25.880 --> 01:30.160
The only things he did that could be considered part of the embryonic stages of science were

01:30.160 --> 01:34.960
ideas like the harmony of the spheres, where the planets moved according to the frequencies

01:34.960 --> 01:40.080
of musical notes, which of course was just baseless conjecture and whimsy, coincidentally

01:40.080 --> 01:41.880
Terry's two favorite things.

01:41.880 --> 01:46.360
He says he was able to open up the flower of life properly.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.360
That's this.

01:47.360 --> 01:52.760
The idea of opening this up doesn't mean anything, it's just 19 overlapping circles.

01:52.760 --> 01:55.160
If you pull them apart, you get 19 circles.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.440
Yes, it's nice and pretty looking.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.680
Shapes are neat.

01:58.680 --> 02:02.120
Real wave conjugations, meaningless.

02:02.120 --> 02:06.680
Conjugation is something you do to a verb in an inflected language according to tense,

02:06.680 --> 02:07.920
number, and person.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.280
Here's a conjugated Italian verb.

02:10.280 --> 02:15.560
In biology, the word is used to describe horizontal transfer of genetic material between bacteria.

02:15.560 --> 02:20.040
You can't conjugate a ham sandwich and you can't conjugate a wave.

02:20.040 --> 02:24.640
10,000 years is a random number that goes farther back than all of recorded history.

02:24.640 --> 02:30.440
He tosses out walking on water to foreshadow his blatant messiah complex, and he has absolutely

02:30.440 --> 02:34.560
nothing to teach even a small child, let alone an entire generation.

02:34.560 --> 02:38.960
That's a big remark, says the interviewer, clearly pretty desperate to get out of this

02:38.960 --> 02:43.240
ridiculous conversation without directly insulting him.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.920
What do you intend to do?

02:45.920 --> 02:47.120
Well let me put it this way.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.920
All energy in the universe is expressed in motion.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.960
All motion is expressed in waves.

02:51.960 --> 02:52.960
All waves are curved.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.880
And where does the straight lines come from to make the platonic solids?

02:56.880 --> 02:58.760
There are no straight lines.

02:58.760 --> 03:04.680
So when I took the flower of life and opened it properly, I found all new wave conjugations

03:04.680 --> 03:07.880
that expose the in-between spaces.

03:07.880 --> 03:11.440
That's, it's the thing that holds us all together.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.280
Okay, we're ready to look up the grid.

03:14.280 --> 03:15.280
I didn't do it too well.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.280
Trigonometry was the...

03:16.280 --> 03:18.080
Platonic solids?

03:18.080 --> 03:21.880
How is energy expressed exactly by motion?

03:21.880 --> 03:23.960
Whatever he could mean by that, he's wrong.

03:23.960 --> 03:28.400
For example, potential energy is the energy held by an object by virtue of its position

03:28.400 --> 03:32.160
in a field, like a gravitational or electromagnetic field.

03:32.160 --> 03:34.320
No motion, yet energy.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.960
Matter can be converted to energy.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.280
No motion required.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.560
No, not all motion is expressed in waves.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.960
The motion of a wave is a wave.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.000
Periodic motion can be expressed with a wave.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Linear motion also exists, hence straight lines exist.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.720
What are platonic solids?

03:51.720 --> 03:57.080
It's these, convex regular polyhedra in three-dimensional Euclidean space.

03:57.080 --> 04:01.680
Regular polyhedron means that all the sides are the exact same shape, that shape being

04:01.680 --> 04:06.400
a particular regular polygon, which means a two-dimensional shape with all the sides

04:06.400 --> 04:07.840
and angles being equal.

04:07.840 --> 04:11.760
There are five of them, and they were conceived of as hypothetical abstractions, just like

04:11.760 --> 04:13.640
everything else in geometry.

04:13.640 --> 04:18.080
And just for fun, if you take a simple cubic lattice structure for an ionic solid, you

04:18.080 --> 04:20.920
can get those straight lines he said don't exist.

04:20.920 --> 04:26.160
Again, he did not open any flower of life, he did not conjugate any waves, he doesn't

04:26.160 --> 04:31.600
specify what these spaces are and what they are between, or how they hold anything together.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.840
In short, it's pseudo-spiritual bullshit and these anchors are justifiably laughing their

04:35.840 --> 04:36.840
asses off.

04:36.840 --> 04:37.840
Let's get one more tidbit.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.340
I'm sharing that.

04:39.340 --> 04:44.800
On Tuesday when I receive my star, I'm going to be able to prove that gravity is only an

04:44.800 --> 04:46.560
effect and not a force.

04:46.560 --> 04:52.040
I'm putting something on YouTube where I will build the planet Saturn without gravity

04:52.040 --> 04:55.480
and build the Milky Way galaxy without gravity.

04:55.480 --> 04:59.800
Did you also say you're getting your star on the walk of fame?

04:59.800 --> 05:03.800
Interestingly enough, in the context of general relativity, you can argue that gravity is

05:03.800 --> 05:05.360
an effect and not a force.

05:05.360 --> 05:10.240
But it does not follow then that gravity isn't real, and it gets much worse from there.

05:10.240 --> 05:14.680
He's going to build Saturn and build the Milky Way galaxy?

05:14.680 --> 05:15.960
How exactly?

05:15.960 --> 05:17.560
Like in a simulation?

05:17.560 --> 05:18.800
That needs gravity.

05:18.800 --> 05:23.400
If he built a planet or a galaxy with his hands, I would worship him as the one true

05:23.400 --> 05:24.400
God.

05:24.400 --> 05:28.120
But something tells me that in reality, he's been watching some electric universe frauds

05:28.120 --> 05:31.440
on YouTube and now he thinks he's smarter than Einstein.

05:31.440 --> 05:37.280
And we've come to find that the universe, they are abandoning the standard model.

05:37.280 --> 05:44.440
The ideas of black holes in dark matter for an electric model of the universe that is

05:44.440 --> 05:50.240
in response to the Birkeland current and all these things, it's a better version, a better

05:50.240 --> 05:52.440
vision of how we should see the universe.

05:52.440 --> 05:56.200
That's how I see it and I think it should be explored.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.200
Bingo!

05:57.200 --> 06:01.400
Terry binged some Thunderbolts project videos and is repeating what he heard as though he

06:01.400 --> 06:02.560
thought of it.

06:02.560 --> 06:06.280
Then this woman tries to change the subject again and he starts whining about not ever

06:06.280 --> 06:08.320
having been nominated for an Emmy.

06:08.320 --> 06:13.280
Anyway, this is the magnitude of nut job we are dealing with, but it gets much worse.

06:13.280 --> 06:18.280
Around that same time, Terrence started yapping about his new form of math, which he dubbed,

06:18.280 --> 06:25.480
I shit you not, teriology, and which included the startling new revelation that one times

06:25.480 --> 06:27.960
one is two.

06:27.960 --> 06:33.680
Which prestigious mathematics journal did he select to announce this groundbreaking development?

06:33.680 --> 06:34.680
The View.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.680
Let's take a look.

06:35.960 --> 06:40.680
And when I was at Oxford, now this is the point where four bubbles meet equally and

06:40.680 --> 06:41.680
oppositely.

06:41.680 --> 06:42.680
Can I touch it?

06:42.680 --> 06:43.680
Yes.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.880
And it's where 12 planes meet.

06:45.880 --> 06:51.560
This is an undiscovered geometry that I'm now making known to the world here on this

06:51.560 --> 06:52.560
show.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.560
Isn't that fantastic?

06:53.560 --> 06:54.560
I know.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.560
What was the reception?

06:55.560 --> 07:05.560
Well, when I was at Oxford, they were so upset because how can a man that didn't graduate

07:05.560 --> 07:09.980
from one of their prestigious schools come and tell them that the square root of two was

07:09.980 --> 07:10.980
a rational number?

07:10.980 --> 07:15.320
And I said, I didn't come to tell you guys this, I just came to prove to you that it's

07:15.320 --> 07:20.120
a rational number and they were, they didn't like it.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.120
You heard right.

07:21.120 --> 07:25.360
Terrence presented his bullshit at Oxford and the smart people laughed at him.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.780
But why would they laugh at poor old Terry?

07:27.780 --> 07:31.480
Do you think the ladies of the View will be a more receptive audience?

07:31.480 --> 07:35.800
Well you have to remember our entire world economy is based on one times one equaling

07:35.800 --> 07:36.800
one.

07:36.800 --> 07:41.400
Yeah, our entire economy is based on one times one equaling one.

07:41.400 --> 07:47.840
Well, economics does involve numbers, so it should obey the basic logic surrounding numbers

07:47.840 --> 07:50.000
that even children can understand.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.280
So what's the problem?

07:51.280 --> 07:56.720
So if you can prove that an action times an action equals a reaction, which science proves,

07:56.720 --> 07:59.840
then one times one must equal more than one.

07:59.840 --> 08:04.000
And to have the physical proof of it, that kind of shakes things up a bit.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.640
Well you're a shaker up for me.

08:05.640 --> 08:12.460
Wow, if you can prove that an action times an action equals a reaction, okay, numbers

08:12.460 --> 08:15.160
are not actions, they're numbers.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.800
So that doesn't mean anything.

08:16.800 --> 08:22.480
An action times an action also doesn't mean anything because actions are not numbers.

08:22.480 --> 08:27.480
So no, two actions do not necessarily cause a reaction, no matter what he could possibly

08:27.480 --> 08:29.320
mean by reaction.

08:29.320 --> 08:34.480
If two forces are acting on an object that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction,

08:34.480 --> 08:36.360
the object won't move.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.960
Two actions, no reaction.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.280
Sorry, Terry.

08:40.280 --> 08:45.320
But more importantly than demonstrating how everything he just said is bananas idiotic,

08:45.320 --> 08:49.200
let's review what multiplication is.

08:49.200 --> 08:54.200
One is an elementary arithmetic operation, which is essentially repeated addition.

08:54.200 --> 09:01.240
One times four literally means the number one four times, and then you add them up.

09:01.240 --> 09:05.440
One plus one plus one plus one equals four.

09:05.440 --> 09:11.440
One times three, write one three times, add them up, you get three.

09:11.440 --> 09:16.300
One times two, one twice, one plus one is two.

09:16.300 --> 09:23.060
One times one means you write one one time, so it's one.

09:23.060 --> 09:24.700
There's nothing to add.

09:24.700 --> 09:30.540
His revolutionary discovery is just him being dumber than a toddler, and toddlers do like

09:30.540 --> 09:33.300
to shake things, so this lady isn't wrong.

09:33.300 --> 09:34.980
Well you're a shaker up there.

09:34.980 --> 09:37.980
Let's be clear, there are only two possibilities.

09:37.980 --> 09:44.020
One, Terrence Howard is doing a Joaquin Phoenix style extended piece of performance art and

09:44.020 --> 09:47.100
is therefore profoundly brilliant.

09:47.100 --> 09:52.340
Or two, he's a delusional narcissist incapable of living his life without pretending that

09:52.340 --> 09:54.780
he's the smartest person in human history.

09:54.780 --> 09:56.700
Or let's be honest, a god.

09:56.700 --> 10:00.620
I'm putting my money on the ladder because I've seen this all before.

10:00.620 --> 10:02.380
Pick your favorite flat earther.

10:02.380 --> 10:04.620
This is their defense mechanism too.

10:04.620 --> 10:09.920
The smallest of minds can't face a world that doesn't recognize their self-proclaimed brilliance,

10:09.920 --> 10:15.200
so unleash a word salad, convince yourself it's science, and hope that nobody challenges

10:15.200 --> 10:16.200
you on it.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.720
Everything inherently is dielectric because it has matter and then it has a relationship

10:19.720 --> 10:23.480
within the medium, the universal background, the absolute frame of reference, the field

10:23.480 --> 10:26.780
of energy that is the ether, it receives energy from that.

10:26.780 --> 10:32.300
These types of people enact the most impressive mental gymnastics imaginable to maintain their

10:32.300 --> 10:37.760
own ego, and the more I encounter it, the less I find it cute or entertaining.

10:37.760 --> 10:43.520
It's a disease that infects impressionable people and measurably worsens society.

10:43.520 --> 10:47.720
It's not something to simply laugh at, although we are going to laugh quite a bit more before

10:47.720 --> 10:50.080
I return to this thread in my conclusion.

10:50.080 --> 10:55.240
So as promised, let's dive into his very recent appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast.

10:55.240 --> 10:58.640
It's three hours long, so we aren't going to hit every moment.

10:58.640 --> 11:03.120
Rest assured, he was completely insane from top to bottom, but let's just go through

11:03.120 --> 11:04.360
some highlights.

11:04.360 --> 11:12.200
My first memory was almost like when you're dreaming and you're falling, and you hit the

11:12.200 --> 11:17.520
bottom and you wake up, that was my first memory, but I didn't wake up here.

11:17.520 --> 11:23.840
I was inside my mother's womb, and I was about maybe six months inside the womb.

11:23.840 --> 11:29.120
He comes out hot in the first 30 seconds, claiming that he remembers being in his mother's

11:29.120 --> 11:30.120
womb.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.520
I'll remove the suspense for you.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.520
No, he didn't.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.200
That's physically impossible.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.880
Is that any proof, Terry?

11:35.880 --> 11:39.320
I remember all of that coming out.

11:39.320 --> 11:45.040
Remember being compressed, being born, I remember being circumcised, I remember the whole nine

11:45.040 --> 11:52.000
and the proof of it was when my wife, Mira, that you just met, when she was six months

11:52.000 --> 11:57.680
pregnant with my son, Karen, I wanted to prove to her what I was talking about.

11:57.680 --> 12:02.960
So I put a light on her stomach every day at six o'clock at night, and I would move

12:02.960 --> 12:08.080
that light back and forth, and I'd put a song on for a week straight.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.040
First thing he wanted to do is see light.

12:10.040 --> 12:15.760
He loved light from that early stage, and I can ask him the square root of two, the square

12:15.760 --> 12:20.560
root of five, the square root of that, the square root of pi, the square, and he will

12:20.560 --> 12:21.940
run it off.

12:21.940 --> 12:29.120
So his proof of him remembering being born is a random anecdote about his wife's pregnancy,

12:29.120 --> 12:34.160
his kid liking light, and a lie about his son being able to do math that Terry himself

12:34.160 --> 12:35.280
can't do.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.280
But there's more.

12:36.280 --> 12:43.600
And then when I was about five years old, I had another dream, and it was this mansion,

12:43.600 --> 12:49.100
and he would hand me these shapes, and each shape was different and amazing, and I had

12:49.100 --> 12:51.880
access to all the knowledge.

12:51.880 --> 12:55.880
The proof of it is the 97 patents that I have now.

12:55.880 --> 12:59.800
The proof of it is the industries that I've innovated.

12:59.800 --> 13:06.520
Yes, the proof that he has access to all the universe's knowledge is that he has some patents,

13:06.520 --> 13:10.760
something that anybody can get for anything and proves absolutely nothing except that

13:10.760 --> 13:12.360
he likes to waste money.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.360
He's never innovated any industry.

13:14.360 --> 13:19.240
That's why he doesn't actually do anything except ramble like a lunatic on podcasts.

13:19.240 --> 13:23.400
You know, I had the Grand Unified Field equation.

13:23.400 --> 13:29.360
I had already put that together, and at seven, eight, I was working with these things, and

13:29.360 --> 13:32.480
then I went through all of the hell that I had to go through.

13:32.480 --> 13:38.520
Yes, he had a Grand Unified Field equation at seven years old, but he wrote it down once

13:38.520 --> 13:41.280
in the dog ate it, and then he forgot what it was.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.840
That's why he didn't get the Nobel Prize for physics.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.360
Also, his girlfriend goes to another school.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.680
That's why you don't know her.

13:47.680 --> 13:54.400
But my intention was to rebuild the periodic table, build a new periodic table, because

13:54.400 --> 13:58.560
the stuff I had learned in college, I went to school for chemical engineering the first

13:58.560 --> 14:07.480
year over at Pratt, and at the time, I think it was like 108 elements, and I told the teacher,

14:07.480 --> 14:15.400
the professor, about the relationship between hydrogen on the spectrometer and carbon and

14:15.400 --> 14:21.240
silicon and cobalt, and I was like, it's the same exact color, same tone, just doubled

14:21.240 --> 14:26.000
in each octave, and he was like, no, each element is the same element, and it will always be

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
that element.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
And I was like, you don't see the relationship, so I left school.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.960
Did you leave school or did you flunk out because you kept writing, cobalt is an octave

14:35.960 --> 14:39.720
of carbon on your exams instead of answering the questions?

14:39.720 --> 14:43.800
And I was going to spend 40 years rebuilding the periodic table, and I found out that Walter

14:44.240 --> 14:50.320
Russell had already did that, and he did it based upon the natural curvature of everything.

14:50.320 --> 14:55.360
Walter Russell, who was not a chemist, made this in the 1920s, and it doesn't mean anything.

14:55.360 --> 14:58.200
The chemical elements display periodicity.

14:58.200 --> 15:03.920
You can illustrate that periodicity in rows, or you can make spirals and other shapes.

15:03.920 --> 15:09.280
It's arbitrary, and listing elements this way doesn't offer any novel insight into chemistry

15:09.280 --> 15:11.600
or any predictive power whatsoever.

15:11.840 --> 15:16.080
Terry just likes the shape as much as he likes pretending to understand chemistry better

15:16.080 --> 15:19.000
than chemists, or 10th graders for that matter.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.480
And when you say rebuild the periodic table, what do you mean specifically?

15:22.480 --> 15:27.200
Well the way the periodic table is laid out, you'll see hydrogen sitting all the way over

15:27.200 --> 15:32.840
there by itself, but they don't show that hydrogen has the same tone as carbon.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.160
What do you mean by tone?

15:34.160 --> 15:41.160
Same tone, same key of E, same key of E. 40.5 Hertz, the next one would be like 80.5 Hertz.

15:41.600 --> 15:49.920
81 Hertz, you go to silicon, it will double up and would be 162 Hertz, you'll go to cobalt,

15:49.920 --> 15:52.240
and it'll be 324 Hertz.

15:52.240 --> 15:59.200
It's in that base, if you were to take the angles of incidence, or the tones that they

15:59.200 --> 16:04.600
create, their color, like you can turn color back into sound.

16:04.600 --> 16:09.160
Joe wants to know what the hell he's talking about, and Terry is off to the races rambling

16:09.160 --> 16:10.920
about tones.

16:10.920 --> 16:16.160
These are not tones, they're not notes, they're not keys, they're not anything related to

16:16.160 --> 16:21.640
music whatsoever, they're atoms with a particular number of protons in the nucleus.

16:21.640 --> 16:25.280
He's throwing out random terminology and random numbers.

16:25.280 --> 16:29.680
Angle of incidence has to do with light, sounds are not colors, and there's nothing

16:29.680 --> 16:32.680
more to say about this unparalleled gibberish.

16:32.680 --> 16:40.680
You'll see there's a relationship between hydrogen, carbon, silicon, cobalt, rhodium.

16:40.680 --> 16:47.160
They're all bonded, they're all as the middle point between two noble gases.

16:47.160 --> 16:50.920
So those things don't really exist, it's only one substance.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.840
No Terry, those elements exist.

16:53.840 --> 16:58.520
Hydrogen and carbon and silicon and cobalt and rhodium are different elements, they

16:58.520 --> 17:00.760
are not the same thing.

17:00.760 --> 17:05.800
Hydrogen gas is not the same as a hunk of coal, which is not the same as a sample of

17:05.800 --> 17:07.720
silicon and so forth.

17:07.720 --> 17:11.640
They're just the halfway point of their respective periods, which is irrelevant.

17:11.640 --> 17:18.560
Now the problem is, the first thing that we're able to perceive is hydrogen.

17:18.560 --> 17:26.120
That's the first visible element, because before it is too dense for us to perceive it.

17:26.120 --> 17:28.840
You understand what I'm saying?

17:28.840 --> 17:35.880
No, hydrogen is the first element because it's the element with one proton in its nucleus.

17:36.600 --> 17:41.240
Hydrogen has one.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.640
That's the smallest positive integer.

17:43.640 --> 17:48.480
Of course you're so insane that even something as trivial as one being the smallest positive

17:48.480 --> 17:53.360
integer can no longer be taken for granted in your illustrious presence.

17:53.360 --> 18:00.040
But as you reach into the next octave, the carbon octave, and they call that a bisexual

18:00.040 --> 18:05.080
tone, because the carbon has two tones to it.

18:05.080 --> 18:10.400
It has a negative side and a positive side, the part where lithium behaves.

18:10.400 --> 18:18.400
Lithium is contractive, beryllium is contractive, boron is contractive, but the moment you

18:18.400 --> 18:21.200
get to carbon, you balance it out.

18:21.200 --> 18:27.400
It gets to a perfect balance of plus and minus four, so it's a double tone.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.920
Carbon is bisexual, you guys.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.040
Atoms have sexuality.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.680
Elements being contractive is also meaningless.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.720
Everything he is saying is meaningless.

18:36.720 --> 18:43.240
What they've tried to keep from us, if you want to break water into its component parts

18:43.240 --> 18:50.720
of hydrogen and oxygen, all you have to do is introduce beryllium, or the sound of beryllium.

18:50.720 --> 18:58.520
And will violently break away from any other thing, even hydrogen, to bond with that beryllium.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.800
Ah yes, the infamous they.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.040
What are they trying to keep from us now?

19:03.040 --> 19:06.560
You want to perform electrolysis on water, but how?

19:06.560 --> 19:08.800
Not electricity, heavens know.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.000
Use beryllium.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.680
But wait, not even beryllium itself, just the sound of beryllium.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.680
What's that sound again?

19:17.640 --> 19:21.160
Yep, that's what beryllium sounds like, startling, no?

19:21.160 --> 19:25.840
I'm sorry that I made all the water in your body turn into hydrogen and oxygen gas and

19:25.840 --> 19:27.400
you're dead now.

19:27.400 --> 19:31.680
Elements don't have sounds, but even funnier than that, beryllium is the only alkaline

19:31.680 --> 19:35.160
earth metal that does not react with water.

19:35.160 --> 19:41.080
Every time he speaks, he's wrong in so many ways simultaneously that it's almost impressive.

19:41.080 --> 19:48.680
The reason that arsenic kills us is because our DNA has nitrogen and it has phosphorus

19:48.680 --> 19:54.680
in it because nitrogen unwinds into the next octave right after silicone and becomes phosphorus.

19:54.680 --> 19:58.800
Our DNA has both of those in there, but it's going by tone.

19:58.800 --> 20:06.000
So the moment arsenic, which sits as a minus three on the next octave, the moment arsenic

20:06.000 --> 20:10.800
is introduced, the body thinks that, oh, this is my thing that I need.

20:10.800 --> 20:16.640
And it tries to wrap itself around the arsenic, but it causes the DNA to unravel.

20:16.640 --> 20:21.560
Wow, arsenic is harmful because it interferes with biochemical pathways.

20:21.560 --> 20:26.840
For example, it enacts allosteric inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is an enzyme

20:26.840 --> 20:29.040
involved in aerobic respiration.

20:29.040 --> 20:33.480
That means it binds to the enzyme, in this case not specifically at the active site,

20:33.480 --> 20:37.880
and the interaction changes the shape of the enzyme just enough to render it incapable of

20:37.880 --> 20:39.560
carrying out its function.

20:39.560 --> 20:43.480
The cell can't make ATP, so it enacts apoptosis and dies.

20:43.480 --> 20:48.160
There are similar effects on other enzymes involved with signaling, DNA repair, and so

20:48.160 --> 20:49.160
forth.

20:49.160 --> 20:53.360
Virtually anything that's harmful to biological systems is harmful because of sophisticated

20:53.360 --> 20:58.020
interactions with the cellular machinery, which require knowledge of molecular biology

20:58.020 --> 20:59.520
to understand.

20:59.520 --> 21:04.240
No, DNA does not wrap around arsenic, nor does it unravel.

21:04.240 --> 21:09.800
Terry has no clue what DNA is, what it does, or literally anything about molecules in general.

21:09.800 --> 21:17.000
But nature doesn't allow us to unravel that, but now with the wave conjugations, we can.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.480
We couldn't do that before because we didn't know the angles of incidence that were necessary

21:22.480 --> 21:27.280
to open these things up, and you couldn't do that with the platonic solids because the

21:27.280 --> 21:31.240
platonic solids were averages and approximations.

21:31.240 --> 21:36.240
It really is just breathtaking the way he throws together totally unrelated terminology

21:36.240 --> 21:38.140
with this much confidence.

21:38.140 --> 21:40.280
What does one even do with this?

21:40.280 --> 21:46.240
Wave conjugation, angle of incidence, platonic solids, these don't go together.

21:46.240 --> 21:51.480
It's like saying you need 6 hammer the ice cream to monkey of 11 dizzy.

21:51.480 --> 21:54.560
Your reaction to these two statements should be the same.

21:54.560 --> 21:59.480
And the platonic solids are specifically the opposites of averages and approximations.

21:59.480 --> 22:02.840
They are hypothetical idealized structures.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.400
Reality consists of approximations.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.160
Again, it's just breathtaking.

22:08.160 --> 22:12.840
It's legitimately challenging to come up with sentences that are as wrong as everything

22:12.840 --> 22:13.840
he says.

22:13.840 --> 22:18.280
It took me several minutes to write the monkey sentence because I kept wanting to write things

22:18.280 --> 22:23.040
like monkey of fire, which accidentally make more sense than I wanted.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.120
He has a gift for gibberish.

22:25.120 --> 22:32.400
Because the universe is based off of equanimity, which Einstein left out in his theory of relativity.

22:32.400 --> 22:39.880
The balancing side of the gravity, gravity was caused by electric force.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.880
Electricity is always seeking a higher pressure condition.

22:42.880 --> 22:47.960
It spins northeast as trying to get to the center of an area, the center of a cone.

22:47.960 --> 22:52.120
But the next electric wave is coming, so it gets pushed out, and as it's pushed out,

22:52.120 --> 22:53.840
it gets to the vortices.

22:53.840 --> 23:00.000
Yeah, gravity is not electric, matter specifically disperses from higher to lower pressure.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.760
You can't spin northeast, that's a cardinal direction.

23:03.760 --> 23:08.000
Center of an area can't mean center of a cone, since areas are two-dimensional and

23:08.000 --> 23:09.640
a cone is three-dimensional.

23:09.640 --> 23:12.520
And what is pushed out to what vortices?

23:12.520 --> 23:14.520
How does this guy do this?

23:14.520 --> 23:18.240
We are only 19 minutes in, and it's all like this.

23:18.240 --> 23:24.000
But instead of following the natural curvature of these 64 circles overlapping, they averaged

23:24.000 --> 23:34.000
the space where they met, and they invented straight lines.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.520
Why did they do that?

23:35.520 --> 23:38.160
Because they believed that the world was flat.

23:38.160 --> 23:42.840
The irony here is that figures like Pythagoras and Parmenides were the first people in recorded

23:42.840 --> 23:48.200
history to propose that the Earth is a sphere, and substantiated logically.

23:48.200 --> 23:52.600
But more importantly, the Platonic solids are just derived from playing with polygons

23:52.600 --> 23:54.400
and making polyhedra.

23:54.400 --> 23:59.040
And even more importantly than that, none of this geometry has any correlation with

23:59.040 --> 24:02.680
any of the bullshit he's spewing about chemistry and physics.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.720
They're utterly separate realms.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.920
Then we get to the fancy animations.

24:06.920 --> 24:14.840
This is hydrogen, and as I was saying, electricity is always trying to get to the center of that

24:14.840 --> 24:18.600
triangle, but it gets pushed out.

24:18.600 --> 24:19.920
That's not hydrogen.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.520
It's not even a triangle.

24:21.520 --> 24:24.000
And where's the electricity exactly?

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Eight bubbles me.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.160
They gave me the patents to that.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.240
I called that the tetraion.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.520
Don't worry guys, he patented the shape.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.120
You can patent shapes now.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.640
I know the guy who has the patent on the rhombus.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.200
He's a billionaire.

24:36.200 --> 24:42.600
Spheres that's going around this, but the greater attractor has grabbed the two weaker attractors.

24:42.600 --> 24:46.160
And this looks just like a photon, and guess what, it has 30 poles.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.800
Yeah, it looks just like a photon.

24:48.800 --> 24:54.320
Massless, chargeless photons look like this dumb shape he made up, because he says so.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.480
This is where 12 bubbles meet the arboreans.

24:57.480 --> 25:01.400
And then I put five of them together and they make these natural starfish.

25:01.400 --> 25:08.480
But then when I put 10 of them together, they lay themselves out and they predict all distribution

25:08.480 --> 25:11.240
of matter within the electric field.

25:11.240 --> 25:14.280
Hey, he used the magic word, prediction.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.280
What do they predict?

25:15.280 --> 25:17.840
The distribution of matter, what?

25:17.840 --> 25:18.840
Where?

25:18.840 --> 25:20.160
Show us a prediction, Terry.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.160
No?

25:21.160 --> 25:22.280
Back to gibberish.

25:22.280 --> 25:27.160
One of the first things, but when Walter Russell came out with his book and he introduced

25:27.160 --> 25:33.480
his periodic table, he watched as different people went up and collected Nobel prizes

25:33.480 --> 25:40.280
for deuterium, for tritium, for all these things that he had discovered.

25:40.280 --> 25:46.120
And I was like, okay, let me wait until the patents are granted before I'll talk about

25:46.120 --> 25:47.120
it.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.800
Walter Russell wasn't a chemist.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.680
He was an artist and he was delusional.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.880
That's why you worship him, Terry.

25:53.880 --> 25:58.640
People aren't awarded Nobel prizes in chemistry for drawing pretty pictures.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.680
Yuri got a Nobel for discovering deuterium because that actually matters.

26:02.680 --> 26:06.800
You just don't know what isotopes are, even though you use that word all the time.

26:06.800 --> 26:12.920
Back to Neil deGrasse, when he wrote his response to my paper and he said, if you have

26:12.920 --> 26:15.960
any other questions, you're going to have to see somebody else and he wouldn't take

26:15.960 --> 26:16.960
my calls anymore.

26:16.960 --> 26:21.880
I was like, okay, so I wrote the book based off of those responses and I reached out to

26:21.880 --> 26:24.520
another guy, Dr. David Tong.

26:24.520 --> 26:29.160
That would be very interesting that that would be his take as a public educator, that

26:29.160 --> 26:31.520
he wouldn't want to talk to you anymore.

26:31.520 --> 26:37.080
Yeah, Terry sent his ramblings to Neil deGrasse Tyson since everyone who knows zero things

26:37.080 --> 26:42.320
about science assumes that Neil is the president of science and Neil was gracious enough to

26:42.320 --> 26:47.480
explain to him how everything he says is wrong, probably more politely than I would.

26:47.480 --> 26:53.000
But Terry, the narcissist, presses forward, shocked that an intelligent, busy person wouldn't

26:53.000 --> 26:56.160
want to waste his time placating a toddler.

26:56.280 --> 27:02.800
Joe seems surprised too, forgetting that educators enjoy educating people, not spending time

27:02.800 --> 27:06.880
and energy trying to show an insane person how insane they are.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.040
Why this fixation with Neil?

27:09.040 --> 27:13.280
The reason I wanted to talk to him was because of his show, The Cosmos, that he was doing

27:13.280 --> 27:17.760
after that incredible guy Carl Sagan did.

27:17.760 --> 27:25.440
The very first episode he had was talking about Giorgiano Bruno and he said that Giorgiano

27:25.520 --> 27:31.360
Bruno was looking for that grand unified field equation and maybe one day somebody is going

27:31.360 --> 27:36.320
to do it and when they do it, it's going to change the world and I'm like, dude, I've

27:36.320 --> 27:40.640
done it, I've got it here.

27:40.640 --> 27:45.520
Giorgiano Bruno was not looking for a grand unified field equation.

27:45.520 --> 27:49.000
Quantum physics didn't exist in the 16th century.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.080
The concept of fields didn't exist in general.

27:52.080 --> 27:55.420
The term was coined by Faraday in the 19th century.

27:55.420 --> 27:59.180
This is the problem with science illiterate morons like Terry.

27:59.180 --> 28:02.740
They have no respect for science whatsoever.

28:02.740 --> 28:08.740
They have no interest in learning basic scientific principles, the history of science, what any

28:08.740 --> 28:15.020
scientist did, what scientists are doing now, how to do science, none of it.

28:15.020 --> 28:21.340
They are singularly obsessed with the lofty idea of one brilliant insight that can change

28:21.340 --> 28:22.460
the world.

28:22.460 --> 28:24.580
It doesn't matter what it's called.

28:24.580 --> 28:29.260
That's why he keeps saying grand unified field equation because it doesn't mean anything

28:29.260 --> 28:30.260
to him.

28:30.260 --> 28:32.580
It's a fun phrase, nothing more.

28:32.580 --> 28:36.820
That's what everyone was trying to do since antiquity because he says so and he's the

28:36.820 --> 28:39.340
one who's done it because he says so.

28:39.340 --> 28:42.860
Walter Russell talked about the fact that the sun gave birth to the earth, that it didn't

28:42.860 --> 28:47.260
coalesce from some field and the proof of this.

28:47.260 --> 28:52.460
Do you guys know that the earth is drifting away from the sun and all of the planets in

28:52.700 --> 29:02.700
every solar system is drifting away from their primary at the same exact rate, like 1.5 centimeters.

29:02.700 --> 29:09.260
This is a universal expansion that's happening with everything moving away.

29:09.260 --> 29:15.980
Them saying and the web telescope have proven that those galaxies couldn't have formed 13,

29:15.980 --> 29:18.260
14 billion years ago.

29:18.260 --> 29:25.180
If you would just add up linearly, how long it would take the earth to go from the sun

29:25.180 --> 29:33.180
to 93 million miles away, it's 9 trillion, hold on, let's go.

29:33.180 --> 29:34.460
This is what I'm talking about.

29:34.460 --> 29:38.700
He can't be bothered to learn literally anything about astronomy.

29:38.700 --> 29:43.260
The expansion of the universe has nothing to do with the dynamics of an individual solar

29:43.260 --> 29:44.260
system.

29:44.420 --> 29:50.100
Sun did not give birth to the earth, as though our planet emerged from inside of a star.

29:50.100 --> 29:54.580
He knows nothing about planetary formation, and the idea that we have measured this for

29:54.580 --> 29:58.300
all other systems, how exactly would that work?

29:58.300 --> 30:03.740
We can detect an exoplanet's orbit increasing by a centimeter, how?

30:03.740 --> 30:07.860
But sure, play with your calculator that you already told us shouldn't be used because

30:07.860 --> 30:09.500
it lies about arithmetic.

30:09.620 --> 30:14.220
Well, because I know they're watching me right now, and they're mad at me.

30:14.220 --> 30:16.740
Who's day?

30:16.740 --> 30:25.100
The people that want that, our entire world economy is based off of the politicians and

30:25.100 --> 30:29.300
the authorities that give the politicians their accreditation.

30:29.300 --> 30:34.260
And those authorities, those universities are all based, their entire curriculum is based

30:34.260 --> 30:36.300
off the platonic solids.

30:37.100 --> 30:47.900
Look at the level of paranoia beyond the simple delusions.

30:47.900 --> 30:53.460
The shadow government is watching Terry because he debunked the platonic solids which are

30:53.460 --> 30:58.580
the basis of every economics course in every Rockefeller-Jesuit institution.

30:58.580 --> 31:02.860
I'm shocked that he's not a flatterther because this is exactly how they talk.

31:02.860 --> 31:06.580
But don't worry, he's an anti-vaxxer, obviously, and Joe is too.

31:06.580 --> 31:12.180
You took a bold stand, no, years ago when the governments were trying to poison their

31:12.180 --> 31:13.340
citizens.

31:13.340 --> 31:16.220
You took a very bold stand that nobody else took.

31:16.220 --> 31:20.420
That's what I was like, wow, I appreciate you because I lost three, four jobs because

31:20.420 --> 31:22.220
I refuse to take it.

31:22.220 --> 31:23.220
I refuse to take it.

31:23.220 --> 31:26.420
I bet you feel better about it now, especially when you know all these people that have health

31:26.420 --> 31:28.020
problems because of it.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.540
Cancers has increased 300 percent.

31:30.540 --> 31:34.220
All cause mortality, up 40 percent in some age groups.

31:34.220 --> 31:37.220
Pulmonary embolisms almost up like 500 percent.

31:37.220 --> 31:39.220
Yeah, what caused that?

31:39.220 --> 31:41.060
No, none of those things are true.

31:41.060 --> 31:45.540
You heard them on the internet and believed them, but Terry has a little bit of biochemistry

31:45.540 --> 31:47.060
knowledge he wants to share.

31:47.060 --> 31:54.100
I can walk you through what the spike protein did to the BRCA1 gene, that's the gene inside

31:54.100 --> 31:59.700
of our DNA that tells us that there's a damage, there's damage that's happening almost like

31:59.700 --> 32:05.540
the crews that go along the highway and they immediately put up cones every time there's

32:05.540 --> 32:06.540
a problem.

32:06.540 --> 32:12.420
Well, the spike protein, which is never, no protein has ever been able to enter into

32:12.420 --> 32:14.260
the nucleus of a cell.

32:14.260 --> 32:19.140
Not only did it go to the ribosomes and say, hey, you know what, I don't want you to produce

32:19.140 --> 32:24.060
whatever protein like if it was a skin cell, you're not going to produce keratin anymore.

32:24.060 --> 32:25.980
You're just going to produce these spike proteins.

32:25.980 --> 32:33.180
That spike protein went into the DNA and it tells the BRCA1 gene turn off and that's

32:33.180 --> 32:38.140
the gene that says, hey, there's a mutation here, let's scrap that thing.

32:38.140 --> 32:41.300
And so now the cancers are building up.

32:41.300 --> 32:44.300
The spike protein doesn't do anything to any gene.

32:44.300 --> 32:46.300
He doesn't know what genes are.

32:46.300 --> 32:48.220
Genes don't tell us things.

32:48.220 --> 32:50.580
They are instructions for protein assembly.

32:50.580 --> 32:54.380
That's why he goes to his pathetic analogy of something he saw on the highway because

32:54.380 --> 32:57.420
he doesn't know how transcription and translation work.

32:57.420 --> 33:02.180
There is nothing unique about this spike protein and he doesn't know what ribosomes do.

33:02.180 --> 33:05.660
They translate any mRNA transcript that binds.

33:05.660 --> 33:10.100
Making a spike protein doesn't render it incapable of producing other proteins.

33:10.100 --> 33:13.260
Spike proteins can't go into DNA.

33:13.260 --> 33:16.220
They can't tell a gene anything.

33:16.220 --> 33:18.420
They can't turn off genes.

33:18.420 --> 33:20.260
Genes don't detect mutations.

33:20.260 --> 33:24.960
The enzymes they code for are what do that and he doesn't know what cancer is.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.340
This is really pathetic.

33:26.340 --> 33:27.340
Let's skip ahead.

33:27.340 --> 33:31.740
So is he saying that just by doing these calculations he created the exact form of Saturn including

33:31.740 --> 33:32.740
the rings?

33:32.740 --> 33:34.300
Just the exact form of it.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.300
Just with the calculations.

33:35.300 --> 33:39.500
So you change the angles of incidence that these linchpins, because remember each one

33:39.500 --> 33:42.060
of these are opposing vortices.

33:42.060 --> 33:45.500
So there's 12 vortices to this that are opposing.

33:45.500 --> 33:51.780
So once the angles of incidence change, you change the motion and pressure conditions,

33:51.780 --> 33:56.180
you can now change the condition or the crystallization.

33:56.180 --> 34:02.180
So he's pretending to explain planetary formation without gravity and without explaining literally

34:02.180 --> 34:04.460
anything about what he's doing.

34:04.460 --> 34:07.060
Click a button, the planet is there.

34:07.060 --> 34:08.420
What are the dots?

34:08.420 --> 34:09.960
Where did the matter come from?

34:09.960 --> 34:12.100
How did it arrange itself?

34:12.100 --> 34:14.100
Planetary formation is a process.

34:14.100 --> 34:16.500
This just materialized that of thin air.

34:16.500 --> 34:17.500
How?

34:17.500 --> 34:18.860
There are no vortices.

34:18.860 --> 34:19.860
Nothing is opposing.

34:19.860 --> 34:21.900
There is no angle of incidence.

34:21.900 --> 34:23.800
There is no crystallization.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.220
He is just listing random buzzwords.

34:26.220 --> 34:31.340
Now because we have the angles of incidence, material engineering can now separate the

34:31.340 --> 34:38.620
space between carbon and nitrogen or carbon and boron and have the same elements of titanium,

34:38.620 --> 34:45.060
vanadium, chromium, magnesay and iron or nickel, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, gallium

34:45.060 --> 34:49.380
or germanium in those higher octaves.

34:49.380 --> 34:53.260
We can do that between silicone and phosphorus or silicone and aluminum.

34:53.260 --> 35:00.180
So the transparent aluminum now becomes possible because we can now control the pressure and

35:00.180 --> 35:05.540
change the pressure and motion conditions where we couldn't do that before because they

35:05.540 --> 35:12.100
were going by Cartesian space at 90 degrees and 45 degrees straight lines, the Euclidean

35:12.100 --> 35:17.580
space that they've made up, this orthogonal or church like space that they've generated

35:17.580 --> 35:20.500
because they wanted to promote that cross.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.700
He doesn't even know the names of the elements.

35:22.700 --> 35:25.980
He's saying mangasane instead of manganese.

35:25.980 --> 35:30.500
He says silicone instead of silicon because he doesn't know that silicone is a different

35:30.500 --> 35:31.500
material.

35:31.500 --> 35:33.300
He can't pronounce orthogonal.

35:33.300 --> 35:38.660
He's never even heard these words spoken before and he is doing nothing whatsoever to actually

35:38.660 --> 35:42.220
explain anything about what he just showed to Joe.

35:42.220 --> 35:49.860
He's practically speaking in tongues and Joe is lapping it up.

35:49.860 --> 35:54.940
And as the cherry on top, he pretends that this brilliance was hidden because the Catholic

35:54.940 --> 35:58.740
church loves the straight lines from the cross.

35:58.740 --> 36:04.260
Does he not know how much power this symbol still has over normal people even today who

36:04.260 --> 36:06.860
would never fall for any of this bullshit?

36:06.860 --> 36:11.540
He just knows that churching up the story gives it a Da Vinci code vibe that ensnares

36:11.540 --> 36:12.540
gullible people.

36:12.540 --> 36:18.100
Can you tell me how a planet is formed under this theory?

36:18.100 --> 36:22.340
So you have a sun and how does the sun give birth to these planets?

36:22.340 --> 36:52.140
90 minutes in, Joe finally asks him to actually explain something and Terry's

36:52.860 --> 36:55.180
response is astounding.

36:55.180 --> 36:59.540
Stars crap out planets the way we take a dump on the toilet.

36:59.540 --> 37:01.540
Case closed everyone.

37:01.540 --> 37:03.260
Planets are fecal matter.

37:03.260 --> 37:06.080
And the red spot on Jupiter will be a planet leader.

37:06.080 --> 37:10.260
Of course this is meaningless since it's a storm, it's a cyclone.

37:10.260 --> 37:13.500
How does a bunch of wind form a planet exactly?

37:13.500 --> 37:17.140
And he's just so objectively wrong about every trivial detail.

37:17.140 --> 37:21.500
The red spot is not at the equator, it's 22 degrees below the equator.

37:21.860 --> 37:27.300
And the human anus is not located on the waist.

37:27.300 --> 37:32.820
This is such a stunning example of the difference between real science and insane ramblings.

37:32.820 --> 37:35.380
Ask this question of an astrophysicist.

37:35.380 --> 37:40.580
You'll get mountains of data, explanations, equations, predictions, confirmations of those

37:40.580 --> 37:42.820
predictions through observation.

37:42.820 --> 37:44.980
Ask Terry at what do you get?

37:44.980 --> 37:47.060
The sun takes a crap.

37:47.060 --> 37:48.180
The end.

37:48.180 --> 37:50.220
Who falls for this stuff?

37:50.220 --> 37:54.740
Everything is just one great being, we're all God.

37:54.740 --> 38:01.740
That's what Jesus was talking about, that's what Buddha was talking about, it's recognizing

38:01.740 --> 38:03.700
the divinity in you.

38:03.700 --> 38:08.500
Actually neither of those people said anything like that, Buddha didn't proclaim to be divine

38:08.500 --> 38:13.900
and in Christian mythology Jesus didn't say I'm God and so are all of you.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.140
He just said that he was God.

38:16.140 --> 38:19.140
That's kind of why the Romans killed him.

38:19.140 --> 38:24.620
Terry is just looking for excuses to call himself God and he's as dumb with theology

38:24.620 --> 38:26.260
as he is with science.

38:26.260 --> 38:32.180
Here I've invented, here I'm an Oscar nominated actor that is known all around the world,

38:32.180 --> 38:36.140
face recognition, vocal recognition all around the world.

38:36.140 --> 38:40.820
I've invented a new form of flight, tangential flight, the ability to fly around your own

38:40.820 --> 38:47.460
center of mass, something they've never been able to do and you don't hear anything about

38:47.460 --> 38:48.460
it.

38:48.460 --> 38:54.100
Harsicism is oozing out of every pore of his body and congealing into little origami cranes

38:54.100 --> 38:55.740
in front of our eyes.

38:55.740 --> 39:01.340
He's world famous kind of so his imaginary invention must be brilliant.

39:01.340 --> 39:03.660
Tangential flight, tangent to what?

39:03.660 --> 39:08.580
He doesn't know what a tangent is and of course his little toddler toy doesn't actually fly

39:08.580 --> 39:11.980
or do anything, he just has cute animations.

39:11.980 --> 39:16.260
Instead of all the props having to turn themselves around to stop and turn in opposite directions

39:16.260 --> 39:22.860
they just switch the direction, they just, so it's a collective pitch and it changes

39:22.860 --> 39:27.260
and so now instead of going up you're going down but now five of them will come together.

39:27.260 --> 39:31.620
So I was trying to reach out to Elon Musk, I was trying to reach out to Jeff Bezos, I

39:31.620 --> 39:36.500
was trying because my main goal was I was building these to clean up the upper atmosphere,

39:36.500 --> 39:44.820
all of that debris that's up there and ultimately to mine the asteroid belt.

39:44.820 --> 39:48.900
You can immediately see that someone is clicking on a screen to trigger an animation so it's

39:48.900 --> 39:53.340
anyone's guess as to why Elon Musk should care about this crappy video game.

39:53.340 --> 39:58.340
Terry is not only smarter than every physicist in history but he's better at building space

39:58.340 --> 40:02.460
crafts than everyone alive despite never having built anything.

40:02.460 --> 40:04.780
The hubris is off the charts.

40:04.780 --> 40:09.380
It's not worth listening to this entire rant but he genuinely believes that he has invented

40:09.380 --> 40:14.500
revolutionary technology and that he's being ignored for literally no reason.

40:14.500 --> 40:22.380
And so it's just going to react and immediately it converts into a plasma and so we can project

40:22.380 --> 40:25.020
anything into space.

40:25.020 --> 40:29.460
All of that has been accomplished and it's ignored.

40:29.460 --> 40:34.580
Delusional narcissists always have this precise brand of persecution complex.

40:34.580 --> 40:39.020
James Tore, Ben Davidson, they all do the same thing.

40:39.020 --> 40:44.780
All the experts are morons because they ignore my super brilliant revolutionary insights.

40:44.780 --> 40:49.100
The whole establishment is against me because they're afraid of my truth.

40:49.100 --> 40:50.980
Honestly, I think we've had enough.

40:50.980 --> 40:56.300
I got 2 hours into the 3 hour podcast and there's just no point in continuing.

40:56.300 --> 41:02.100
It's the epitome of manic hogwash with virtually nothing to even sink your teeth into and there's

41:02.100 --> 41:06.020
only so many times I can point out that what he's saying is meaningless.

41:06.020 --> 41:08.780
In the end, there's only one point that needs to be made.

41:08.780 --> 41:14.060
Pretentious tools like Terry can hope to fool as many people as they can by speaking confidently

41:14.060 --> 41:17.460
and using jargon they hope the listener doesn't understand.

41:17.460 --> 41:20.020
But what can they do with it?

41:20.020 --> 41:22.740
What can they physically achieve with it?

41:22.740 --> 41:26.860
Terry thinks he's reinvented physics but that's because he never learned any physics

41:26.860 --> 41:28.180
in the first place.

41:28.180 --> 41:30.420
Take this free body problem for example.

41:30.420 --> 41:33.060
This is something he was supposed to learn in high school.

41:33.060 --> 41:37.300
You use Newton's Laws, plug in some numbers and you get an answer that correlates with

41:37.300 --> 41:38.300
reality.

41:38.300 --> 41:42.320
You can predict what will happen when you let go of the block.

41:42.320 --> 41:43.500
And guess what?

41:43.500 --> 41:47.340
When you let go of the block, that thing does happen.

41:47.340 --> 41:50.100
Terry's gibberish doesn't have that power.

41:50.100 --> 41:56.060
His ramblings have no utility, no predictive power, no technological application.

41:56.060 --> 41:57.380
It's a parlor trick.

41:57.380 --> 41:59.220
It's basically hypnotism.

41:59.220 --> 42:02.320
But as I mentioned before, it's not harmless.

42:02.320 --> 42:07.280
His way of thinking is dangerous and these types of people are often dangerous.

42:07.280 --> 42:08.880
Do you want some evidence?

42:08.880 --> 42:09.880
Because I was angry.

42:09.880 --> 42:12.040
I was really angry.

42:12.040 --> 42:19.760
And I was going to use all of the knowledge that I had and I was going to destroy mankind.

42:19.760 --> 42:25.160
Oh my God, right out of Marvel.

42:25.160 --> 42:27.760
I was like, yeah, I was about to, but then...

42:27.760 --> 42:29.320
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

42:29.320 --> 42:31.280
Things like these are very revealing.

42:31.280 --> 42:32.400
It's not a joke.

42:32.400 --> 42:39.040
He genuinely believes he has this kind of power and he has contemplated exercising it in a

42:39.040 --> 42:41.380
violent, destructive way.

42:41.380 --> 42:45.400
Do you know who else has had such thoughts and acted on them?

42:45.400 --> 42:48.000
Go and read the Manifesto of the Unabomber.

42:48.000 --> 42:54.040
It's the exact same self-aggrandizing tone, the same superiority complex, the same incessant

42:54.040 --> 42:55.400
rambling.

42:55.400 --> 42:59.720
This is the psyche of cult leaders and domestic terrorists.

42:59.720 --> 43:04.680
I'm not saying that Terrence Howard necessarily would or will blow something up in murder

43:04.680 --> 43:10.220
people, but those who blow things up in murder people tend to think this way.

43:10.220 --> 43:15.560
They have this strain of delusional narcissism in them that enables them to first think they're

43:15.560 --> 43:21.600
better than everyone else and also that they deserve the right to exercise power over others.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.600
Terry is mentally ill.

43:23.600 --> 43:28.800
He should be checked into a mental institution to get treatment for his personality disorder.

43:28.800 --> 43:34.120
Cue the onslaught of people saying I have no right to diagnose anyone based on a podcast

43:34.120 --> 43:35.120
appearance.

43:35.120 --> 43:36.960
Yeah, technically, you're right.

43:36.960 --> 43:41.800
But also, he is a delusional narcissist with a personality disorder that should be committed

43:41.800 --> 43:43.480
to a mental institution.

43:43.480 --> 43:44.480
Sorry.

43:44.480 --> 43:49.160
And if the people in his life really cared about him, they'd have done that a while ago.

43:49.160 --> 43:50.720
Now let's pivot to Joe.

43:50.720 --> 43:54.280
In my video on Tucker Carlson, I gave Joe a bit of a pass.

43:54.280 --> 43:59.080
But here, Joe just fails miserably and his failure is twofold.

43:59.080 --> 44:03.840
First, Joe desperately needs a better bullshit detector.

44:03.840 --> 44:09.480
Anybody who can't tell that Terrence is completely full of shit within a few sentences has terrible

44:09.480 --> 44:11.600
judgment end of story.

44:11.600 --> 44:15.400
You don't even need to be able to articulate with clarity how he is wrong.

44:15.760 --> 44:21.400
It's just blatantly apparent in his manner of presenting ideas, the way he vomits esoteric

44:21.400 --> 44:27.040
terminology rapid fire, the way he overperforms to give the impression of profundity.

44:27.040 --> 44:30.920
It's immediately apparent to any rational person.

44:30.920 --> 44:35.520
But the other problem is a more pernicious type of mental defect, which I've mentioned

44:35.520 --> 44:39.400
many times, and that is the anti-establishment bias.

44:39.400 --> 44:41.120
Joe has that in spades.

44:41.120 --> 44:46.000
This is not something like your explanation of these things and your description of the

44:46.000 --> 44:51.960
very nature of reality itself is not something that should be taken lightly.

44:51.960 --> 44:52.960
No.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.280
It's something that, like...

44:54.280 --> 44:55.280
Thank you for saying that.

44:55.280 --> 45:01.760
It needs to be laid out and it needs to be slowly examined because you've obviously spent

45:01.760 --> 45:03.720
a lot of time working on this.

45:03.720 --> 45:10.240
People with this bias can hear any ridiculous story from any unqualified, clueless weirdo

45:10.360 --> 45:15.320
and they will immediately give it far more credence than it deserves simply because it

45:15.320 --> 45:20.480
feeds their desire to see established knowledge arbitrarily overturned.

45:20.480 --> 45:26.280
Joe is psychologically incapable of seeing how stupid this all is because he desperately

45:26.280 --> 45:28.200
wants this story to be true.

45:28.200 --> 45:30.200
Wow.

45:30.200 --> 45:35.000
I wish I could really truly understand exactly what you're saying because I'm kind of getting

45:35.000 --> 45:37.560
it and you're doing a great job explaining it.

45:37.560 --> 45:44.800
But if you're right, that really changes everything and it accounts for why physics

45:44.800 --> 45:47.880
kind of hits a stalling point.

45:47.880 --> 45:51.320
It doesn't matter that Joe has no clue what he's saying.

45:51.320 --> 45:56.880
Instead of entertaining the idea that he isn't really saying anything, he just blindly asserts

45:56.880 --> 46:02.360
that the emperor has all his clothes on and that the imaginary garments must be so much

46:02.360 --> 46:07.560
better than the drab and outdated clothing that establishment science provides.

46:07.560 --> 46:12.880
A field which obviously must be stalling just because he refuses to lift a finger to learn

46:12.880 --> 46:15.480
how vibrant the field really is.

46:15.480 --> 46:22.320
It's contrarianism on steroids to the point where even the most trivial self-evident facts

46:22.320 --> 46:26.960
can be called into question just because of their addiction to perceiving themselves

46:26.960 --> 46:29.240
as superior to the masses.

46:29.240 --> 46:34.280
Even something as trivial as 1 times 1 equals 1.

46:34.280 --> 46:41.400
This insistence that the dissenting voice should instantly be taken more seriously than substantiated

46:41.400 --> 46:47.900
knowledge is an infantile attitude that is destroying our culture and I'm tired of everyone

46:47.900 --> 46:52.440
looking the other way for fear of making waves or insulting people.

46:52.440 --> 46:56.400
Terrence should be mocked to his face on a daily basis.

46:56.400 --> 47:01.440
He may not be evil or deserve severe punishment, but these are the checks and balances that

47:01.440 --> 47:03.840
maintain civic responsibility.

47:03.840 --> 47:08.520
If you act like social poison, there should be an antidote.

47:08.520 --> 47:14.240
Everyone in his vicinity should be constantly showing him how delusional he is until something

47:14.240 --> 47:18.740
registers and he takes it upon himself to change.

47:18.740 --> 47:23.040
Because as insane as he is, his ramblings have an impact.

47:23.040 --> 47:24.400
Certain people listen.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.880
Their minds warp.

47:25.880 --> 47:31.040
They choose to further disregard the body of human knowledge or any concept of expertise

47:31.040 --> 47:36.580
and we all suffer the consequences of the poor choices they make as a result.

47:36.580 --> 47:39.640
But what's the one thing we can say for certain about Terry?

47:39.640 --> 47:45.640
This is what you'll be remembered for and your acting will be just a footnote.

47:45.640 --> 47:46.920
That about sums it up.

47:46.920 --> 47:51.900
He will be remembered as a pointless lunatic no matter how badly the contrarians want to

47:51.900 --> 47:54.280
delude themselves.

47:54.280 --> 47:58.520
So that's it for Terrence Howard, it is genuinely astounding to me that anyone would listen

47:58.520 --> 48:03.680
to this guy for more than 30 seconds and subjecting myself to several hours of his ramblings has

48:03.680 --> 48:06.400
probably taken a few months off of my life.

48:06.400 --> 48:08.040
So I hope you got something out of it.

48:08.040 --> 48:08.920
I'll see you next time.
