00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome to a most interesting talk, I'm sure, about e-max org mode.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's difficult to say what exactly e-max org mode will do for you

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
for visa to list all the things it doesn't do, because that's a considerably smaller list.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So let's welcome Professor Dominik.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello, my name is Karsten Dominik.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm a professor at the University of Amsterdam and also at the University of Meimingen.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And I was invited here today to talk about a little software project.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I would like to start by saying that I'm not a software person.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm not a programmer. I'm not an IT person.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm really a scientist and I do this kind of programming as a hobby.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Most of the coding for this project has taken place on a train, on the commuter train.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I do it in a train every day for one hour and it takes time to write some programs.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So that's what I'm doing.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And I want to talk to you about e-max org mode, which is a system to track projects,

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
to write down notes, to draft papers and all of that using plain text files.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So really as simple as possible, at first I think it sounds really archaic

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
where people wonder why should we actually leave all these fancy sexy programs

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
which we have on our computers and for which we have paid big money.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And just show them away and use a much simpler system.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But I would like to try today to show you and maybe convince you

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
that this is actually a viable approach which can be useful for many different things.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I told you that I'm a teacher at the University and I'm used to getting questions all the time.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's what my students do, so please feel free to ask me any questions at any moment during the talk.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If I go too fast or too slow or something like this.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
First of all I have to show this slide I was told just for real reasons.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This talk is being recorded and that means whatever you say can and will be used against you.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So be warned.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's already starts by the name.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's a really strange name for our program I guess.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I often get this question why is it such a silly name?

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What is the reason for this?

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well the org is just because it has to do with organizing.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What this program tries to do is help organize many things for normal life and also for life as a scientist.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And mode, it's called alt mode because it's not really a standalone program.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's a mode, an editing mode of the e-max editor.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not sure if everybody knows what I'm talking about here.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So let me just back up a little bit.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay, okay, okay.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
One step back.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What is e-max?

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Does everybody know what e-max is?

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Really?

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Nobody says no?

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, okay, somebody says no.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
E-max is one of the oldest editors in the computer world.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I think it has existed for decades.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It was written by Richard Starman, which is the founder of the Free Software Foundation.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And so it's really started at the beginning of everything that is open source and free software that we are using now very often.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And also our institute, for example, we are using lots of open source and free programs these days.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So e-max is an editor.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What is it?

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's an editor for text files.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And while it does have a nice window environment that you can use the mouse to execute commands, it's really at its best with keyboard commands.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's a very efficient and fast program to work with.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Once you have learned all those keys, which initially is always a big hurdle, but this time you find out that this is actually the best way and actually also better for your hands in order to avoid illnesses like RSE or something like this.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Very important is that e-max is self-documenting.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So any programs which run in e-max are written in a way that every function, every variable, everything in the program is done is documented internally and you can access this documentation at any point.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So that's automatic.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
There are basically no undocumented programs in e-max.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's automatically built in.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's highly customizable.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We can really change whatever you want.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And this is really why I started working with this program because I like things to work the way I want them.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I know exactly what I want and I like programming environments where I can change everything in the way how I want to have it.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And it's highly expandable.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So that means you can, well, not easily, but if you know how to write this code, which is a programming language which is being used for the extensions in e-max, you can write that and you can extend it.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And e-max has nodes and this is where the name alt-mode comes from.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It has minor nodes and major nodes and these are just sort of little packages which change the behavior of the editor in a certain way.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:26,000
For example, if you are programming in some language, for example in R, there is a special mode in e-max which can highlight the R commands and the syntax will colorize them or give you special editing commands for this.

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There are also big packages which you can implement in this way and alt-mode is one of those packages which works like this.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So alt-mode is a major mode for e-max, not a minor mode.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
A minor mode changes some detail.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
For example, we automatically want lines to be wrapped around while our type are not.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is a minor mode.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
A major mode is really something big.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, and then the next question is why would one want to use an editor as a base for an organization program?

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's, I think, a very good question and one which has to be answered.

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:18,000
One reason is that where I work, certainly half of the people use e-max because many of us write programs, many of us write papers in latex for example and e-max is really powerful to do this kind of stuff so many of my colleagues do know how to use e-max.

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But what is even more important is that this editor is actually an ultra-portable platform for running code.

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's almost like a Java virtual machine because e-max has been ported to pretty much every system.

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It runs on some mobile phones.

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It runs on Windows computer, on Windows, on Macintosh, on the VMS so you can just pick your system and there is an e-max implementation for this.

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And that means that anything which you program for e-max will work on all these systems.

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So if your IT department now decides that you all have to throw away your Windows computer and use Macintosh, e-max will still work on that system and you can continue to use these programs.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Another important thing is that there are many other useful systems which run inside e-max for example e-mail clients, news group leaders, there's even a web browser inside there.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And that makes a very good environment for integrating an organization program with these other tools.

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So you don't have to rely on a company like Apple which gives you sort of a Catholic experience on a computer where they determine everything for you, how you should be using it.

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But you can just do it with a system like this.

91
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay?

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So I hope that makes clear why Alt-Mode has this stupid name Alt-Mode.

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The next thing is that this system is using text files, really plain text files.

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So this is not rich text in the way that you have bold text and italic text.

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This not electricity, it's really like text files like e-mails and the most basic kind of text.

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And this is really so 1970s.

97
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So why should one use this?

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Why is that useful?

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, I think it's extremely useful because it helps you to focus on content.

100
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It stops you from playing with tools and it helps you to focus on content.

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Of course, text files are really the only truly portable document format which exists because you were able to read text files a hundred years ago,

102
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
or maybe on the first computer scale more on that say 40 years ago or so.

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And I'm sure you will be able to read text files a hundred years from now.

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So this is really the basic format which will all exist.

105
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And that also means that if you collect your organizational data, you are planning for a project and things like this,

106
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
you will never be locked into a particular proprietary software.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I mean, if you buy one of those programs, they all have their internal format and it's sometimes very hard to get your data back out.

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You have spent two years entering things into this program and then you decide to use a different one and it's very difficult to actually switch over.

109
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It would never happen if you had to use text files because you can always use them or get somebody to write a little part of a new which will turn one thing into another.

110
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So this will, I think, is a very strong point.

111
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And it can be easily processed with other tools.

112
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:25,000
There's many tools which can read text files, change them, make small edits, automatically create items in your project list and things like this.

113
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So I do have another point here, yes.

114
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Another interesting thing is that you can use version control to get a nice history of these files.

115
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's much more difficult, for example, with a Word file, to get a nice history to be able to look back when did I make this change in the past.

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
With simple text files, this is much easier and much more straightforward.

117
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So this is why I like text files and why I really work with them as much as possible.

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Okay, so let's try to start answering what Altmode does and what it is.

119
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
At its core, Altmode is just an outliner.

120
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So I'm sure we all have worked with outliners.

121
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You can use Microsoft Word as an outliner or there's an omni outliner, for example, and a good program, and things like this, which create outlines.

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The meaning for this is that pretty much everything that has to be structured can be represented as an outline.

123
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Altmode has some main nodes and then it has leaves and further children and things like this.

124
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's very useful for organizing your thoughts, for doing brainstorming and for putting everything into a nice structure which helps you to think about it in a structured way.

125
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So that's what it is at its base, a simple outline represented in plain text.

126
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And Altmode as an editing mode, it runs in an editor, so of course it can use and enhance all the features of this text editor.

127
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And therefore it makes it very comfortable to work with this.

128
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I will show you a little bit later, I will give you some examples how it makes it really easy writing things, in particular reorganizing it.

129
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Very often if you sit in a meeting and you have to type nodes, it's just a brainstorming session everybody throws in a few ideas.

130
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And then in the end you have to sit down and organize things, and the Altmode is really good for this.

131
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Another point is that outlines of course are also the basic structure of the scientific output, which we have to produce as a scientist.

132
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Because we have to write papers or books or presentations, and all of these things can be thought of as an outline.

133
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Where you have headlines, major sections, and then you filter it down into the small details.

134
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Okay, so the outline keys, what you use in order to work with the outline.

135
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Most important ones in Altmode are the keys which let you change the visibility of the outline, because you can fold away leaves in the outline in order to get a better overview.

136
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And then we have two commands really, one is to cycle the visibility of the subtree, and the other one is to cycle the global visibility.

137
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That doesn't really mean much, so I'm going to show you what I mean by this.

138
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So this is a view on a window in E-max, I hope you can see from the back, because it's implemented here, I think it's a little bit less sharp.

139
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But what you see here is two headlines in an outline, and they are marked just by a single star here in front.

140
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
If it would be a sub-note and it would have several stars in front, that's what it looks like.

141
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And the point which I'll show you behind that shows you that this is just a folded down.

142
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm sure you have seen something like this also in other programs.

143
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And so we are now just going to use a top key and a shift top key in order to change.

144
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So I'm pressing top once, we'll actually show the list of sub-pading here, and then we can just move down to one of the sub-pading, press top again,

145
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and you will actually just zoom in there and open this.

146
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Then you can go back and just fold it all back.

147
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And if you press now top twice in a row, then you will not only get to see the direct children, but actually everything which is below here.

148
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And then you can fold it back up.

149
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And that was all done with one key, it's just a single key, you don't have to remember many commands.

150
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And the other command is shift top, and if you press that, then you get first something which looks like a table of contents with all the headings.

151
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And if you press it again, then you actually get any text which is in this outline, and pressing it one more time, folds everything back up.

152
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So that means you only have two keys, and that is enough to look at this outline and to fold it and unfold it.

153
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That makes it quite convenient, I think.

154
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The next important part is that you have to be able to restructure it out.

155
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And I really cannot emphasize this enough.

156
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I think this is one of the main functionalities which Ordnus does rather, which most outlines don't do well.

157
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Because normally to restructure something like this, it means you have to cut something away, to move to a different location, to paste it in, to change the level on which it is.

158
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It is a tedious work in Ordnud.

159
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It works more like that.

160
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You can imagine to just hold onto one leaf in the outline tree and then just slide it around in the entire outline.

161
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It is like with a hot knife through butter.

162
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That is what it does.

163
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So we hold down the meta key, which is the command key or something like this, depending on your computer system.

164
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And then we just use the curve keys in order to move things around.

165
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So there is another little thing here.

166
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So this is just a different structure.

167
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Over here we have five main headlines.

168
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And now the first thing which we are going to do is just take this first...

169
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Actually, I am folding it open.

170
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I am opening the outline that you can see all the sub-headings.

171
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Now we take the first heading and we just slide it down.

172
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We move it through the entire outline to the end.

173
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And then we move it back up.

174
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You can move it down here.

175
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You can see the keys which are being pressed.

176
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
We move it back up.

177
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So the next thing which we are going to do is to take the second headline and just move the entire subtree, which is below us, a little bit down.

178
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It should help.

179
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah, it has happened now.

180
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That is right.

181
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Even further now.

182
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And now we go down.

183
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And now we demode the setting.

184
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So this is actually a child of this one.

185
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yes.

186
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And the next thing is that we make this entire subtree also one level down.

187
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And then we decide that this subtree heading here should actually be a sub-heading up because we just promote it and slide it up.

188
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And it looks a little bit tedious, but if you try this out, this works really fast and gets thought, which initially were quite random, gets them into an order.

189
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I use this all the time.

190
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So sitting in a meeting makes these notes.

191
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Afterwards, I take 10 minutes to reorganize things and I have a nice structure thing which I can send to others, even as notes.

192
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I want to go to the next slide.

193
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes.

194
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Is it already the next slide?

195
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes.

196
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah.

198
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Okay.

199
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's all text files.

200
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's what I said.

201
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Let's you do more with an outline.

202
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Not only take notes, but you can actually make notes in the outline, make them as action items.

203
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's also important.

204
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You sit in a meeting, you write down notes, and you find out that there's something that we have to work with.

205
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And that's why it has some kinds of metadata, which is just what this slide represents.

206
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So you can just put in special text in special locations, which can mean special things.

207
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's not really special text.

208
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's actually also just plain text, but by some commands and all that, it will be interpreted as something more complicated.

209
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So for example, this first thing here, which is something that we call the to-do keyword.

210
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So by default, this is just either the word to-do or the word done.

211
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
This means like a checkbox on off.

212
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Either we still have to do this or it is already done.

213
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Next thing is a priority.

214
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You can assign priorities if you want.

215
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Then you can assign tags.

216
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So just like, for example, this is something that has to do something with work.

217
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And it's something which I want to buy.

218
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And the other thing is that we can put planning information.

219
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
For example, we can say this has a deadline.

220
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It has to be done at a certain time so that you get the keyword and then the date after it in order to say when this has to be finished.

221
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And then down here, this is what we call a property draw.

222
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This is just a lot of key value pairs where you can put arbitrary information.

223
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You're actually completely free in what you want to put here and how you want to write it down here.

224
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
By default, this doesn't really have any meaning.

225
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But there are commands and which assign meanings to this and do something with this special data.

226
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Okay.

227
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Then, let's allow you to make links.

228
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So if you just write something which looks like a link into the text, it will actually be interpreted one.

229
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So if you click on it or if you call a special command, that means it will open something.

230
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
For example, you can put in a URL or a link to a certain file and also specify how you want to open it.

231
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Or you can put an email address.

232
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If you click on this, you can send an email to this.

233
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And so there's many different types of links.

234
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
This is not even a complete list which you can put in there.

235
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And also be very useful, I think.

236
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Okay, I said that you can embed tasks.

237
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And this is what is also shown here in a sort of a bigger way.

238
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So we actually have a piece of an outline here.

239
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Here's a motor headline, a level two, level three headlines down here.

240
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And here's even level four headlines.

241
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And as you can now see here, I have defined a few more keywords here.

242
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So here's one which has to do.

243
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So this is something which has to be done.

244
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Here's one which says this is done.

245
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That means this task is very finished.

246
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And why is it finished?

247
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Well, because below this task, there's a couple of other ones.

248
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
One we have actually canceled.

249
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So that means we decided actually not to do this,

250
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
even though initially it was a to-do item.

251
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And then there's another one which is already done.

252
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And that means this task is done.

253
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And you can actually get here a little calculation of what fraction of the task is finished.

254
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So in this case, it's one of two.

255
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And then on this level, the first one is not finished.

256
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The second is, so that's why there's one of two is finished up here.

257
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And this is something which I also use very often.

258
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
For example, I write an outline for a paper.

259
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I write all those headlines, the sub-headlines which I want to make.

260
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And then I can just mark things like, I have to look into this.

261
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I have to do that.

262
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You can mark it there.

263
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's hidden in this paper.

264
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But as I will show you in a moment,

265
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
you can actually then pull out this information into an easy list

266
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
where you can then see what is still to be done.

267
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You also have checkboxes.

268
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So you can now have, this is all just plain text.

269
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
This is just a bracket, an X and a bracket highlighted in a special font.

270
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's why it looks like a real box.

271
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
But it's really all plain text.

272
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Just a checkbox.

273
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
This is what I imagine, what kind of experiments you do here in this institute.

274
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So that you need electricity and brains of rats to study

275
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
and brains of humans to study.

276
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So I don't know.

277
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah.

278
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Okay.

279
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Checkboxes.

280
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
This is something very useful that lists and ticks things off.

281
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Then another thing is that you can write tables in plain text,

282
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
which is really crazy.

283
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And some people have laughed at me for this,

284
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
but I implemented it anyway because I think it's a great font.

285
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So here's just a little demonstration that you can write tables in plain text.

286
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
In a very simple way,

287
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
you just write the names of the fields and you separate them by vertical bars as your columns.

288
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Those will be examined without from a couple of students.

289
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And so it automatically expands.

290
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You can see as I write here the field which adapts automatically.

291
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's still, everything is plain text.

292
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You can just print this on a paper and read it in a different program

293
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and it will still look exactly like this.

294
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So this is a couple of students where I'm just writing down the notes here.

295
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Names I get longer and longer to show you that the fields automatically adapt.

296
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And then another thing which I've built into this is that you can actually do some calculations.

297
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So for example, you can just calculate the sum of all these notes,

298
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
just a little formula, the sum of the fields which you put in there.

299
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And you will calculate that in plain text.

300
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Everything plain text, everything.

301
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And then you can also calculate the average if you want,

302
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
which is also what we are going to do here.

303
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The average of these results.

304
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So it's just this value divided by 3.

305
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Wow, there's too many digits.

306
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So let's just go back up, get back into this formula

307
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and just append a format specifier to this.

308
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So if you are a programmer, you will recognize this as a printf format specifier.

309
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And so you just can format these numbers nicely.

310
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And then you can reorganize the tables.

311
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So we are sorted now by the highest cipher.

312
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And that's just like the structure editing.

313
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Just basically holding the meta key and pulling these fields and rows around.

314
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't know any table program which actually makes it easier to reorganize that table than this program.

315
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So okay, it's a bit crazy, I admit.

316
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But I think it's still very useful if you make notes

317
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
and you can make little tables and add a few numbers.

318
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
For example, the other day I was sitting with a student,

319
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
we were writing a portfolio and we needed to add up the times which we needed for certain observations.

320
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
If you can just do it in your notes, you add quickly up these numbers

321
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and send an email to realize what this is.

322
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Okay, so now for a bigger view, how does this now look like?

323
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm just going to show you a few example screens.

324
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
This is a real life, my example file.

325
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
This is a file where I collect meeting notes.

326
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's just one giant file.

327
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's a very long file where I have a major note for all the different meetings where I'm going to.

328
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm listening here to other people, so there's always a major note for this.

329
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Sometimes I put a date when this really was.

330
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And then below these notes, I have further outlines of when people talk,

331
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
what they talked about and just organizing these things.

332
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And as you can see here, in there I mark a little task where I say,

333
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
this is something I have to act on.

334
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Sometimes I put a date telling me this is as a deadline here, you have to be aware of this.

335
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's actually in the notes, Father.

336
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's not that you have to go to a calendar and put an alarm there and say,

337
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
well, I have to be aware of this and then you have this information in two different places,

338
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,000
which is always bad because when you change it, you will usually change only one side of it and not both sides of it.

339
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
So it's here in this information.

340
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And this is a huge file.

341
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You don't see only a very small fraction of this because I've been using this program for a couple of years

342
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
and all my meeting notes are in this file.

343
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
There's a command in August which tells me, well, show me everything which I still have to do.

344
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So that goes to this meeting note file, but also to other files which have to do with different projects,

345
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
files which have to do with my teaching,

346
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and just pull out all those lines which say there's something to do.

347
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So I can just go through this list and check, well, there's something,

348
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
what do I like to do now? How much time do I have?

349
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I can just pick the task and then jump from there into my notes file.

350
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Welcome this stuff.

351
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Take it off in the notes file and then it will disappear from this list.

352
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I find that extremely useful.

353
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Another view which you can get on the radar is so because I'm going to close this door.

354
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Another useful view is the agenda.

355
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And that is just a calendar.

356
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So as you can see here, this list one week starts with Sunday, 7th of February, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

357
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And for every day, it pulls out tasks where I have somewhere set in my file where this is something to do.

358
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And there's a couple of them.

359
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
For example, here's one which says it has been scheduled already 14 times.

360
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
That means I wanted to work on this 14 days ago so the bigger this number gets, the more scared I should get.

361
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And then there's here's one which has been scheduled for today.

362
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
These are just pre warnings which has in 8 days there's a deadline coming up which is related to the task which is here.

363
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So I have to write some proposals and things like this for this deadline.

364
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's coming up here.

365
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And then also for the next days, just give me a preview of things which are coming towards me where I have to pay attention.

366
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And as I said, all the data is just in one place.

367
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So there's another duplication.

368
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So if I sit here with my curve on this line, I can say this is now done.

369
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It asked me for a little note.

370
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So what have you done with this?

371
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It will put the note into the outline leaf where this was from.

372
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It will change the to-do key or to-done.

373
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And I will never see this task again.

374
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Only if I go back to my notes and read actually what did I do with this project, then I will still find this task.

375
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It was done and there will be a reason why it was done and when.

376
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So this is how this works.

377
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Okay.

378
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Scientists.

379
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm a scientist and I wrote this program initially in order to organize my projects.

380
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So you can actually organize also when you have to buy a present for your kids that they can later.

381
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
But that was the original idea.

382
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And so what I was hoping was awkward is that you can put as much as possible relating to the planning of a program,

383
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,000
so the scheduling to the notes can put it into a single file that was what I was hoping.

384
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So notes, notes, notes.

385
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I cannot emphasize it.

386
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I think this is the daily bread and butter of a scientist.

387
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'm getting into an age where I forget everything and so I have to write down notes and I do this really constantly.

388
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You can put it into that same file.

389
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You can put your project schedule and the due dates.

390
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Wherever it belongs, you mark things and say that has to be done and when and by when.

391
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Okay.

392
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That's what you can put in.

393
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You can put a detailed look of actions and problems.

394
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You can just write for every day.

395
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You can write a little note and say, well, what did I do there?

396
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And it will be all in that same project file.

397
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It will not be in a different place.

398
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It will be in the right place.

399
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You can put the complete specification of the steps which you have taken in the analysis.

400
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Which is really, really useful.

401
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:53,000
If you do this here in a nice way and I will show you later that you can very easily then turn the outline where you have specified this into a draft for a paper.

402
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So if you write this in your notes, you almost have it already, well, it's half done for a paper.

403
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You have to write an article for publications.

404
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm sure that you are also as pressed as we are for constant publishing, publish or perish.

405
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
This is also important for us.

406
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:19,000
So an article for publication or a digital slideshow and all these things can be at least drafted in this file.

407
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Sometimes you can actually completely prepare them in an open file, but you can at least draft them in there.

408
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
There's even a facility to track data acquisition in a graphical way.

409
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm going to say a little bit about this.

410
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
This is a bit more complicated, so it's not so easy to say this in the short time which I have.

411
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Okay, so let's start with publishing.

412
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Now we have all this data in a text file.

413
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Of course, we all know that when we have to publish something, when we have to write a publication or a presentation, that is different file formats.

414
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I don't know if you have to write a word file in the end.

415
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I have to write a latech file.

416
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
This is an accepted document format, which we have.

417
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Another way to publish things is of course to put them on the web.

418
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Or you can put something into a doc book, which is an HTML-like format.

419
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Latech, as I said, is a text formatting thing, which is very good for science.

420
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
If you have to put them in the equations, which is what we have to do, that is very important.

421
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
In the end, you get a PDF file out of this.

422
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You can make a Beamer presentation.

423
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
That is also via latech a presentation, which you can show on the screen.

424
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
There's an export to ASCII, which makes it even more readable way of reading the same file, even the root out-mode file itself.

425
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's already very readable, of course.

426
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And you can also link a couple of documents, and actually, for example, publish an entire web page from these files.

427
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Let's look at an example.

428
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So here, I'm just making a tall project.

429
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Figure out how planets form.

430
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Of course, this is not really my project.

431
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Of course, I would like to figure out how planets form.

432
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But in reality, I guess the same is true for you, is that projects are already much smaller.

433
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But it's easy to understand, I've taken a big project here.

434
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So, for example, I have a task here that I should study some literature.

435
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
After a while, I'm done with this.

436
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I've read this literature.

437
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm going to discuss with my co-worker on a certain date.

438
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And we have a couple of ideas of how this could be done.

439
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So, these are to do.

440
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So, I want us to look them into them.

441
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
This year, we started.

442
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So, that means that we have started thinking about this.

443
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
But then we have decided that this first idea is garbage.

444
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So, we cancel it.

445
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And then there's more ideas.

446
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
So, we just work on them.

447
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
We have a little table where we make an estimate.

448
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
We estimate a couple of numbers, which we need for this project.

449
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Okay.

450
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And so, now we have this kind of a project.

451
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And now, let's see what we can do with this.

452
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So, let's try to export this in the different ways.

453
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
For example, here's off that page.

454
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm just going back one more time.

455
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm sorry.

456
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So, this is the text file.

457
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And this is off that same file, the HTML export.

458
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So, it's just one press of a button.

459
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And that thing turns into an HTML page,

460
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
which contains all the information.

461
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Here's a nicely formatted table.

462
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Here's a table of contents, which is clickable.

463
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You can just click on these sort of things.

464
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Go there.

465
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So, without any extra work, you have put this thing up on the web.

466
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Here's the latex version of this.

467
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And then you can discuss if you actually like the way this looks.

468
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Of course, because this file was very list-oriented.

469
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So, there's many headlines and there are two little texts in between.

470
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But even if you decide to work on the latex file itself,

471
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
you can still get your first version, your draft version in this.

472
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You can sit in the text editor, write in the text file,

473
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
focus totally on the content, get the structure right,

474
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
then turn it into that pretty file and fix it a little bit

475
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
and send it to the publisher.

476
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I've really liked the experience in the last few years

477
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
that this is a very efficient way of doing things.

478
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Well, you can turn that same file.

479
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It's really not that I haven't done anything.

480
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
The same file turned it into a presentation.

481
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
This is done with the Beamer package, which also goes through latex,

482
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
which is the third mode in my file.

483
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
There's one slide.

484
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
This is the discussion with my colleague.

485
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
There's different ideas are here on the table.

486
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's in the presentation.

487
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So, you can also get your draft presentation with no extra work.

488
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's all coming from the same source.

489
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Okay.

490
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
There's further things which you can do as a scientist

491
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
with this kind of stuff.

492
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And I'm only going to briefly touch on them

493
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
because they are a bit more complex.

494
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You can embed latex commands for all of us into an automobile.

495
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
If you need a more complex equation in there,

496
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
you can just put it directly in there.

497
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I don't know if any people here use latex

498
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and how much they do use it,

499
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
but for us, this is extremely useful.

500
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You can embed source code snippets.

501
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
If you are working, for example, with R, to do your analysis

502
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
or with a C code,

503
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
you can put little pieces of source code in there,

504
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
which can be very useful as I will show in a minute.

505
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You can actually run those source code snippets

506
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
and you can capture the results into a table.

507
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So, it's a little bit like Mathematica in a way.

508
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You can do some calculations and work in that type of document.

509
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And if you take this together,

510
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
this actually puts you into a place

511
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
where you can start doing reproducible research

512
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
and literal programming with this kind of a system.

513
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I'm not sure if you know these buzzwords.

514
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm going to say a little bit more about it.

515
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So, here's just an example of embedded latex.

516
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Again, this is one of those text files.

517
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And I've just written here the big-legged letters alpha, meter,

518
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and gamma are used to denote angles.

519
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And alpha is the way to write angles

520
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
to write big-legged letters in latex.

521
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So, this is how you write it.

522
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And finally, Mathematica would actually have to put $2 sounds

523
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
on both sides in order to mark them as mass.

524
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
This is not necessary in Alt-Mode.

525
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
You can just write them plainly in there

526
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and it will actually find them and convert them in the right way.

527
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Then there's another thing.

528
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm actually pushing the two slashes around a little bit of text.

529
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And that is in Alt-Mode the short form to say

530
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
that you actually want to have this in italics.

531
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
This is sort of the same specification as we use in e in e-mail.

532
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
If you just write these slashes, that means some emphasis.

533
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Down here is an equation and that is literally

534
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
how you would also write this in latex.

535
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And you can just put it there if it's a bit more complex.

536
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And then if you turn this into latex with a similar button

537
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
then you see this down here.

538
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So, this is just section heading and then the sentence which I've written.

539
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And here down here is a beautifully formatted equation

540
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
as latex does is for you.

541
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Another thing is are these embedded code examples?

542
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
For example, I'm writing together this micro-legal little piece of code

543
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
in order to study this problem in planning formation.

544
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And so this is a little snippet from the code which we are moving there.

545
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And initially actually I put in this possibility to say

546
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
well, here is some Fortran 90 in this case code.

547
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And that was only for documentation purposes

548
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
because I ended up to be able to say well, this is a piece of code

549
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
so please format this nicely for me on an HTML page.

550
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And so this was what this was made for.

551
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
We now have an HTML page from exactly this

552
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
where when this source code gets nicely formatted and colored

553
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
and so that you can easily look at this.

554
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's very nice if you have to write software and have to document it in a way.

555
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
What then happened was actually totally unexpected.

556
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
There's a couple of people on the main list where we discuss about ordnance.

557
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Eric Schulte, Eric Schulte, there should be a T.

558
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And then they actually said, well, this is interesting.

559
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So there are little snippets of code in there.

560
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Why don't we just build a facility to run these pieces of code

561
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and to capture the output.

562
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So what they have done with here is for example,

563
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I don't know if any of you recognize this is a piece of R code

564
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
and it's been used to take a file and to split it into words

565
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and to look at the words which are most frequently used in the text.

566
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Take the first six of them and turn them into a table.

567
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And the table, the output table is right in here.

568
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So you can run this stuff in the file and get the result.

569
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
This might seem a little bit academic

570
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
and I think that for many of you it might well be

571
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
that this is not really what you are going to do,

572
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
but if you are more interested in computer science

573
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
and in documenting things and into writing the documentation

574
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
of a program together with the program itself,

575
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
this may be something you would find interesting.

576
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
That has to do with literal programming.

577
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It's an important thing.

578
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I think computer scientists maybe started in a way by Donald Knuth

579
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
who has defined what this is.

580
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So let's try to find a way to write computer programs

581
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
where the main aim is not explaining to the computer what it should do

582
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
but explaining to other human beings what we want the computer to do.

583
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So that means that you actually write something which is human-readable together with the code

584
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
and Orkwood also allows you to do this.

585
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
If you have a program like this and there's two operations,

586
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
one is called ROOF and that makes a printable document.

587
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
That's just the export Orkwood does anyway.

588
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And then there's a tangle operation which throws away all the text

589
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
which is meant for the humans and only takes the code for the computer.

590
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And you can also do that with the program which was written by Eric Schulte and Dan Davidson.

591
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yeah, reproducible research is the other side of this.

592
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
That means that reproducible research will try to combine the scientific results

593
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
with all the tools that they use to produce them

594
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
because if you make a figure which you show in the paper,

595
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
people should in principle be able to verify that figure

596
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
to check if you have really done your homework well.

597
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And this is what's called reproducible research

598
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
and what I've explained about this Ork-Babel stuff

599
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
lets you do some of this also with Orkwood.

600
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Okay, enough of that.

601
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I think that leads us a little bit too far.

602
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm going to just finish with a couple of slides with a few links.

603
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So if you want to know more about Ork-Mood, there's a website here,

604
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Ork-Mood.org, which of course was made in Ork-Mood.

605
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So we actually use plain text styles to make this website and then just publish it.

606
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I've given another talk like this, not quite like this,

607
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
but a bit similar at Google of one and a half years ago.

608
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I think you can look at that if you want.

609
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
We have a long list of tutorials which you can look at.

610
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And there's a main list where we discuss about Ork-Mood.

611
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And there's another site which is called Work, which is a user-made site

612
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:13,000
where we collect documentation and more information about this project.

613
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
If you are an iPhone user, there's actually an iPhone application,

614
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
which means that you can take all these modes files with you.

615
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
That's actually nice.

616
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I mean, all the modes which I've made over the last years,

617
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I have on my little iPhone Touch and can look things up if I want.

618
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And you can actually tick tasks off from here.

619
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And then when you sort it back, it will actually be changed in your files.

620
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It's very nice.

621
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Richard Norland wrote this application.

622
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It's a lot of fun.

623
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
The users of Ork-Mood are really wildly different.

624
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
If you look at this list, you will see that it's really not only made for scientists

625
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
or not only made for a particular kind of people.

626
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
There's a collection from the website, which is one web page

627
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
where people actually introduce themselves.

628
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Stefan also has an entry on that site.

629
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
For example, we have an archaeologist in Hawaii who runs his archaeology company using Ork.

630
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And he writes his research.

631
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
He gets his results and publishes them mainly through Ork-Mood.

632
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I think that's a lot of fun.

633
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Another guy is a farmer who organizes stuff on his farm.

634
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And he's also a mountaineer.

635
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
There's scientists and computer scientists.

636
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
There's several one-person companies who run the entire company on this system.

637
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
But there's also bigger things.

638
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
One of the people there is the director of a computer science company

639
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
and of a university research group.

640
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
We have a historian.

641
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
There's a blind person who runs his entire life through EMEG.

642
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And he really loves Ork-Mood because it's a program

643
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
which he can use inside EMEGs where he runs his way.

644
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And the head of the ITU-UPLT McFung Institute also uses Ork-Mood, obviously.

645
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
As we all know, I guess.

646
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Well, this is a word of Twitter these days.

647
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Today we have all to say everything you have to say in 140 characters.

648
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So I've collected a couple of things which I found on the Twitter feed

649
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
that people have said.

650
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
So not everybody is entirely positive.

651
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So for example, this one, I like this one.

652
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
The sheer elaborated insanity of the Ork-Mood spreadsheet

653
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
is a destilled microcosm of all that is wonderful and brain damaged about EMEGs.

654
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And I think that's really a very true and very nice statement.

655
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
That EMEGs is, if you see it like this, brain damaged, but it's really wonderful.

656
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And I love it. I don't want to be anywhere else.

657
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
There's more people who think like this.

658
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
For example, this guy says, if I hated everything about EMEGs,

659
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I would still use it for Ork-Mood.

660
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Or Eric Frahler, also one of the people on the mailing list.

661
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Eric is actually the one who drove the BIMA presentation export here.

662
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So very important for this.

663
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
He says, it used to be that I hated leaving EMEGs to do anything.

664
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Now it's getting to the point that I hate leaving Ork-Mood.

665
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,000
The people really use this as the main environment in which they do everything.

666
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Well, not everybody would get as extreme as Circus League, I guess.

667
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Okay, I'm almost done, I think.

668
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Yes, there's a list of acknowledgments which I still want to say

669
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
because many people are contributing to this program

670
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and also in particular to the stuff which I have shown you today.

671
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
There's a mailing list.

672
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I cannot really believe that we have now 800 people on this mailing list

673
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
which read that mailing list all the time.

674
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
There's at least 20 messages a day.

675
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Some days there are 30 or 40 or 50 messages on this list.

676
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And all really good messages.

677
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
There's no garbage here, it's amazing.

678
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Well, Eric Schulte and I have spread them correctly.

679
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Thank God.

680
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And then David and David Ork-Babble, which is really a major extension.

681
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Thomas S. Dahl has written some examples which I've used here.

682
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Sebastian Rose, Bastian Guerrero, Balki Sun, if that is pronounced correctly.

683
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And Eric Frager all have been really important for some of the exporters which we have.

684
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Richard Moreland is the guy who wrote Mobile Ork, the iPhone application

685
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
and gives it away for free so you don't have to pay for it.

686
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
You have a donation button on his web page if you still want.

687
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Feel free to.

688
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And I would like to thank Stefan for inviting me here today.

689
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And I'm still around for the rest of the day,

690
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
so I hope I will see some of the science which is being done at this institute

691
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
because I'm actually really interested in brain research.

692
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And for the rest, if you have any questions now or later during the day,

693
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
please just get in touch with me.

694
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Thank you.

695
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Any questions?

696
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Yes.

697
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
We have access to the fund in the Expression Center.

698
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Yes.

699
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Can just, you can put all the org files under version control.

700
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I definitely do this because it means that you can freely

701
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
and without any fear, edit and change things like crazy.

702
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And then just use the standard version control system to keep the version of all these files.

703
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Yes.

704
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Always.

705
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
What kind of action like staff wait to do cancels are also available?

706
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Or is it good to create my own actions?

707
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Standard, if you download and install it, it only has two, which is to do and done.

708
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But you can very easily, I mean, just in the top of the file,

709
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
you just write a hash mark plus.

710
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
This is always a sign that you want to declare something and then to do.

711
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And after that, you just put a list of all the words which you want to be action words and then they are.

712
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Are there tutorials to tell me which are good actions or better to add to actions or many different actions?

713
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Well, that really depends on taste.

714
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And for me, it actually even depends on file.

715
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So for example, if I'm organizing something with many other people together,

716
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
then I like to make names of everybody who is involved to do keywords.

717
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So I can just assign every task which is listed there directly with the two key words to the person.

718
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
You can also use tags if you want, but you can also use the two key words.

719
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I myself have maybe eight or nine key words very little.

720
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I know that some people have 50.

721
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
No, but they just use it in a different way.

722
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:52,000
So I think that's really one of the strong points of all that it actually lets you define this freely and also make it different for every file.

723
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:59,000
So if you have a special task, a special thing that you have to do, you can just change it for that thing.

724
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Then what I'm going to do is use this to do and then start it.

725
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It means I've started with this.

726
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Waiting means, well, I'm just waiting for someone that means I have to check back if they have really finished it.

727
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And then it's done and cancelled and delegated.

728
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And then I just have something similar on a higher level for a project which I use to designate things which have many sub tasks in it really below them.

729
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
But that's basically all I use.

730
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
So I use a small one and I think that's actually much better for my users.

731
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Yeah.

732
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Yeah.

733
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
There's nothing built in right now.

734
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But yes, source code files are text files and auto files are text files.

735
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I think I can write you a one liner and Pearl, which will take your source code and put out an auto true, which contains all the to do tasks in that source code.

736
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I think that's very easy.

737
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Maybe not a one liner, maybe a three liner, but yes.

738
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And of course, if you know how to write the next list, then you can also write it in the next.

739
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But many people just know different scripting languages like Python or Pearl or something like this.

740
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And I would prefer to use that and that's perfectly possible.

741
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
That's why it's all text files because it's so easy in this way.

742
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:31,000
You can also just have a Python module, which will pass an awkward file and return a true structure which contains the other entry and then you can manipulate it and do something with it.

743
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Yeah.

744
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yes.

745
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
That's correct.

746
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Yes, that's right.

747
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:57,000
The number in which I had shown there was just for illustration in order to show you what the original structure was in order to see that actually something changes when I move them around.

748
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Normally you would not number it and all these things are an outline and you would not number the nodes, but you can get them numbered when you export.

749
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So if you say, I want to export this to HTML or to Radix, then you can get a numbered outline.

750
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
But yeah, no, you just wouldn't write them.

751
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I mean, I can just see if I can get this to work here.

752
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I'm not sure if you can read it.

753
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Really?

754
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It's really cool.

755
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Just a second for you next to come up.

756
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You can just recover from everything which is going on in this machine. Okay, so let's just.

757
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:50,000
So one thing is we do have a number of at least so I'm just writing just the garbage text here.

758
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And you can see that no, this is not right.

759
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Yeah, so this is a non-arrated list.

760
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And if you organize this, this works exactly the same.

761
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
So I hold down the meta key and then I use the cursor key to pull up and down.

762
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
You will actually see that it moves up and down. It does do the numbering.

763
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
But normally in outlines, so this would be.

764
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
So this is just text and you just would not number it.

765
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,000
But you can still change the level of course, like those move it in and out or swap it with the other one and lose the level of this.

766
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
But that doesn't show numbers normally.

767
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah, I just had it at the site only to illustrate that there is a structure and that these are meant as sub-levels.

768
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
But I'm not using them.

769
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So that was just text, not really numbers.

770
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Yeah, exactly. Just don't type numbers.

771
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
It's the laziest way of typing numbers is not to type them.

772
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Yeah, it's for lazy people.

773
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Yes.

774
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Well, yeah, that's certainly if you're looking towards the output formats.

775
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Yeah, it's actually a much easier way of making tables.

776
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
For example, when I have to make a table in latech, I never write this in latech anymore because I just hate it.

777
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
It's very difficult to read.

778
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And we actually have a special way, which I didn't explain here today, but I did explain this in my talk at Google.

779
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:49,000
That you can actually, for example, in your C source code or in your latech file, you can actually put a special section, which is actually a comment for latech where you have a normal table.

780
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And then this one key, it gets actually turned into a latech table and inserted at the right location in the table.

781
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So you can in place almost use this much nicer syntax and much easier way of looking at tables in order to edit and make that table and then still have it in the proper format for latech.

782
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
We use it very often.

783
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
In fact, I could try to demonstrate it, but I'm not sure if I'm fast enough to do this.

784
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Yeah.

785
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
When can I get the t-shirts like yours?

786
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
On our website, so right at the top.

787
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And I think the t-shirts are like 15 or 20 euro and two of those euros get to me.

788
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
So that's something like that.

789
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
So that I can stay a happy person and keep programming this.

790
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Yes, we have mugs and we have scarves and bags and full shop.

791
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
A friend of mine made it.

792
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah, more questions.

793
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Apparently not, Stefan.

794
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
What should I do now?

795
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Just close the session.

796
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I think we are done.

797
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And many thanks for coming out.

798
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I can call out if you can make this an excellent place to hang out.

799
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
For recreational reasons too.

800
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So many thanks for coming and giving us this panel talk.

801
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And if you have questions on how to run e-mugs at the institute, there will be something

802
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
