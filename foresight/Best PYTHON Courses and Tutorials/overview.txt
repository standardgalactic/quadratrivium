1. **Install Proxy Modules**: You need to install `proxy` and `proxy_set_header`, `proxy_http_version`, `proxy_redirect`, `capital_U_upgrade`, `capital_C_connection_upgrade`, and `proxy_read_timeout` Nginx modules. These can be installed with your package manager, for example, using `apt-get install libnginx-mod-*`.

2. **Configure Nginx**: Modify the Nginx configuration file (usually located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`) to properly forward proxy requests to JupyterHub. This involves setting the HTTP version, redirecting requests, and handling upgrade requests.

3. **Set Proper Timeout**: Configure a read timeout of 86400 seconds (1 day) in Nginx to prevent timeouts for long-running processes like Jupyter notebooks.

4. **Intercept Static Asset Requests**: To speed up the JupyterHub instance, you need to intercept requests for static assets and serve them from the local filesystem instead of loading them from the proxy. This is done by adding a new server block in Nginx that serves the static files from a directory where you have cloned the Jupyter notebook repository.

5. **Clone the Notebook Repository**: Clone the Jupyter notebook repository (`https://github.com/jupyter/notebook.git`) to a local directory on your machine to serve as the static files source for Nginx.

6. **Restart Nginx**: After making changes to the configuration, restart Nginx to apply those changes. You can do this by running `nginx -s stop` followed by `nginx`.

7. **Verify Setup**: Open your web browser and navigate to the JupyterHub instance (usually at `http://localhost:8080`). If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to access JupyterHub, run notebooks, and see static assets being served locally.

By following these steps, you should have a functional JupyterHub setup with Nginx as a reverse proxy, optimized for both dynamic content and static asset serving. Remember to replace `engine X` with the actual engine or service you are using (e.g., Cobalt, MyBinder, Binder, etc.).
