Checking The Conciliators Guild/Iain McGilchrist on Civilization and the Divided Mind.txt
 In this conversation, we delve into the concept of our minds being influenced by forces akin to parasites, which can commandeer the nervous system of higher animals for their own benefit, at the expense of the host's well-being. This idea is exemplified by the parasite Toxoplasma, which alters the behavior of rats so they are attracted to cats, its ultimate host.

The discussion then shifts to the concept of the "commanding self" in Sufi lore, which can dominate an individual's life if it grows too large, leading to actions that are not in one's own interest or well-being. This idea resonates with the notion of addictions and the struggle between different aspects of our psyche.

The conversation also touches upon myths from around the world that have a remarkable resemblance to the understanding of how the two hemispheres of the brain work together. Specifically, the Onondaga legend of the two brothers is highlighted as an example of profound insight into the dynamics between the rational and emotional aspects of our nature.

The underlying message is that for any meaningful change in society or our personal lives, a "change of heart and mind" is essential. This shift in consciousness is necessary to transcend our current limitations and rekindle our better nature. The discussion underscores that any external changes are futile without an internal transformation guided by this new understanding of our dual-natured minds.

The conversation concludes with a recognition of the importance of such paradigms in guiding us towards a more holistic and balanced approach to living, which can potentially lead to positive change in future generations.
