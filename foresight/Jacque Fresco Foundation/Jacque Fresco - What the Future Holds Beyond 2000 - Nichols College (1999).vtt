00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Are any of you people, members of the World Future Society?

00:10.640 --> 00:13.400
I'm sure most of you heard about the C. Clark.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.280
Will you raise your hands?

00:15.280 --> 00:16.780
Good.

00:16.780 --> 00:21.880
He said that if he wrote a book that everybody enjoyed

00:21.880 --> 00:27.120
and understood, he said he wouldn't be saying anything new.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.000
Think about that.

00:29.040 --> 00:32.380
What I'm going to talk about is going to change some of your

00:32.380 --> 00:35.880
lives, the way you look at yourself and the way you look

00:35.880 --> 00:37.680
at the world around you.

00:37.680 --> 00:42.580
The subject matter is not the kind of matter to get from

00:42.580 --> 00:45.160
ordinary sources or books.

00:45.160 --> 00:49.760
So I would like your participation in an experiment.

00:49.760 --> 00:54.560
And some of you might be able to tell what it is that I draw

00:54.560 --> 00:57.300
on the board before I finish.

00:57.340 --> 01:00.000
And if you know what it is, interrupt.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.340
Say, I got it.

01:01.340 --> 01:02.820
So I'm going to start.

01:02.820 --> 01:04.900
Can all of you see the board?

01:04.900 --> 01:06.740
I don't think I can make it with this.

01:12.100 --> 01:13.860
Can all of you see the board?

01:13.860 --> 01:15.860
Can you hear me all right?

01:15.860 --> 01:17.500
OK.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.900
The minute you know what it is, interrupt.

01:28.300 --> 01:31.260
The same thinking ship, the Titanic.

01:31.260 --> 01:31.860
What is it?

01:31.860 --> 01:32.500
Titanic.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.780
OK, great.

01:33.780 --> 01:37.260
Now, if he didn't call that, remember, there's no ship

01:37.260 --> 01:38.860
there at all.

01:38.860 --> 01:43.860
There was enough bits for his associative memory to put that

01:43.860 --> 01:44.700
together.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.820
Now, you know that's not a ship.

01:46.820 --> 01:47.980
Now, what is this?

01:47.980 --> 01:50.060
Some of you older people might guess this.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.060
An alarm clock.

01:55.060 --> 01:56.780
Who did that?

01:56.780 --> 02:00.140
You are amazing.

02:00.140 --> 02:01.500
Where's the alarm clock?

02:01.500 --> 02:06.860
Well, anyway, if she wasn't able to call that, I would have

02:06.860 --> 02:10.220
put the legs on it and the clock and Hamilton watch

02:10.220 --> 02:12.740
coming, until somebody called it.

02:12.740 --> 02:17.180
Now, there are still some that cannot see the ship.

02:17.180 --> 02:20.420
So I would have gone all along, put all the windows in,

02:20.420 --> 02:22.940
Titanic, everything, until somebody got up and said,

02:22.940 --> 02:24.740
yeah, Titanic.

02:24.740 --> 02:31.700
Well, this is an attempt to prove that all of us are

02:31.700 --> 02:36.860
capable of making decisions and arriving at a conclusion

02:36.860 --> 02:40.540
without all of the information prepared for us.

02:40.540 --> 02:43.860
That is a unique quality in human beings.

02:43.860 --> 02:48.100
We can put things together, and we do not require the

02:48.100 --> 02:50.980
accumulation of a great deal of information.

02:50.980 --> 02:53.220
In this system, if you understand this

02:53.220 --> 02:56.660
quite well, who would you say this is?

03:13.340 --> 03:16.060
Who said that?

03:16.060 --> 03:18.220
Who said that?

03:18.220 --> 03:20.540
Lincoln.

03:20.580 --> 03:22.260
I don't see Lincoln, but it's Lincoln.

03:22.260 --> 03:24.060
It would have been Abraham Lincoln.

03:24.060 --> 03:26.820
When I got filled with it, I would have gone on with a beard

03:26.820 --> 03:28.780
and all of the stuff.

03:28.780 --> 03:32.500
So this is just to prove that people can put something

03:32.500 --> 03:36.940
together, and I'm going to try to explain to you just what

03:36.940 --> 03:40.500
creative thinking really is.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.860
Now, I'm going to use old language, the language that I

03:43.860 --> 03:47.100
use with people who are not familiar with this way of

03:47.100 --> 03:48.020
thinking.

03:48.020 --> 03:53.460
The old language is that people can think and reason.

03:53.460 --> 03:56.060
I do not believe that is possible.

03:56.060 --> 03:57.900
I have many inventions.

03:57.900 --> 04:00.740
I've worked on many different things, but I don't believe

04:00.740 --> 04:04.260
that human beings can think or reason.

04:04.260 --> 04:05.740
This is what I do believe.

04:05.740 --> 04:08.140
By the way, you don't have to accept anything I say.

04:08.140 --> 04:11.380
During the question period, don't be polite.

04:11.380 --> 04:13.220
Come at it from all angles.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.820
Break it down if you can.

04:14.820 --> 04:17.580
This helps me, and it helps you.

04:17.620 --> 04:21.020
So when I talk about thinking and reasoning and putting

04:21.020 --> 04:25.100
things together, we're talking about the forces that shape

04:25.100 --> 04:26.900
human behavior.

04:26.900 --> 04:34.460
I believe that all human behavior is lawful, that the

04:34.460 --> 04:38.100
reactions and values that all people have are perfectly

04:38.100 --> 04:41.060
lawful to the environment that they come from.

04:41.060 --> 04:45.860
So every human being is perfectly well adjusted from

04:45.860 --> 04:48.860
where they are coming from, from their background and

04:48.860 --> 04:49.940
experience.

04:49.940 --> 04:54.060
If you as a baby were raised by the Seminole Indians, you

04:54.060 --> 04:56.500
would behave if you never saw anything else like a

04:56.500 --> 04:58.180
Seminole Indian.

04:58.180 --> 05:01.060
And if you were brought up in any other Indian group and you

05:01.060 --> 05:04.900
had feathers in your head, in your head gear, and you were

05:04.900 --> 05:07.780
dancing around the fire, and I walked over and said, that's

05:07.780 --> 05:08.300
ridiculous.

05:08.300 --> 05:11.060
What are you dancing around the fire with the feathers for?

05:11.060 --> 05:12.780
You don't take your hat, throw it on the ground, says

05:12.780 --> 05:13.060
you don't.

05:13.060 --> 05:14.860
I never thought of it that way.

05:14.860 --> 05:16.180
We can't do that.

05:16.180 --> 05:18.940
We're victims of culture.

05:18.940 --> 05:22.380
We look at the world with our background.

05:22.380 --> 05:24.620
We have no other way of doing it.

05:24.620 --> 05:28.820
Psychology is kind of a rudimentary form today, an

05:28.820 --> 05:32.900
attempt to grasp at the factors that shape human

05:32.900 --> 05:36.140
behavior, the factors that are responsible for the way we

05:36.140 --> 05:40.140
look at ourselves, other people, and the way we behave, or

05:40.140 --> 05:42.100
if you wish, misbehave.

05:42.140 --> 05:45.540
I don't believe that any human being misbehaves.

05:45.540 --> 05:49.460
They use whatever tools they know of, whatever tools

05:49.460 --> 05:51.100
they're familiar with.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.780
Language is a tool.

05:53.780 --> 05:57.860
It's someone to show you a picture of an airplane, what

05:57.860 --> 06:00.700
appeared to be an airplane, without wings.

06:00.700 --> 06:03.460
When people look at it and they stand by and they say, it

06:03.460 --> 06:04.700
will never fly.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.940
But they don't say, how do you propose to lift off the

06:06.940 --> 06:08.820
ground without wings?

06:08.820 --> 06:12.020
That's the key to communication.

06:12.060 --> 06:17.140
Now, a very famous scientist deceased now, trying to get

06:17.140 --> 06:20.820
the government and people to put up sufficient funds to

06:20.820 --> 06:25.900
monitor outer space, to try to make contact with extra

06:25.900 --> 06:28.220
terrestrial life.

06:28.220 --> 06:31.460
I want to try to save this to you and think about what I

06:31.460 --> 06:32.900
say, toss it around.

06:32.900 --> 06:35.740
I'm using the old language because you're not that

06:35.740 --> 06:39.540
familiar with these values.

06:39.540 --> 06:44.340
If people or beings or things can travel 100 million

06:44.340 --> 06:50.780
light years through time and space, they are not humanoid.

06:50.780 --> 06:55.700
The storage system for water would occupy miles.

06:55.700 --> 06:59.500
And all of the facilities required by humans would

06:59.500 --> 07:02.820
take up tremendous amounts of space and require

07:02.820 --> 07:05.660
tremendous amounts of energy.

07:05.660 --> 07:07.300
Now, there are people that talk of flying

07:07.300 --> 07:10.100
saucers at the land here on Earth.

07:10.100 --> 07:13.540
And they go to some farmer, and they take him into the

07:13.540 --> 07:17.140
saucer, and they do all kinds of experiments on them.

07:17.140 --> 07:21.500
Now, first of all, people do not travel hundreds of

07:21.500 --> 07:25.500
millions of light years to pick up some farmer and ask him

07:25.500 --> 07:26.940
what kind of suspenders he wears.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.340
Carl Sagan wanted to communicate with extra

07:33.340 --> 07:34.380
terrestrials.

07:34.380 --> 07:38.060
He hoped that they, in turn, would communicate with us.

07:38.060 --> 07:41.300
Now, you know that the Republicans can't communicate

07:41.300 --> 07:43.620
with the Democrats.

07:43.620 --> 07:46.820
You know that husbands and wives have difficulty in

07:46.820 --> 07:48.020
communicating.

07:48.020 --> 07:51.020
Children and parents have difficulty, because the

07:51.020 --> 07:55.460
language we use was designed a long time ago.

07:55.460 --> 08:01.460
And it is inherently difficult to get ideas across in the

08:01.460 --> 08:03.980
language that we use today.

08:03.980 --> 08:08.260
However, when engineers meet and talk, they speak a

08:08.260 --> 08:10.460
different language.

08:10.460 --> 08:13.220
One engineer might present a very thin cable, and says,

08:13.220 --> 08:17.980
this can support 5,000 tons.

08:17.980 --> 08:21.180
And the other engineer says, what's its tensile strength?

08:21.180 --> 08:22.860
And he's given that information.

08:22.860 --> 08:24.580
Then he puts it in a machine.

08:24.580 --> 08:25.860
I don't know whether he knew this.

08:25.860 --> 08:30.180
And he snaps it to make sure that it holds for that.

08:30.220 --> 08:42.620
When engineers design an airplane, they do all the

08:42.620 --> 08:43.940
calculations.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.700
This is a very rapid drawing of a

08:46.700 --> 08:48.740
front view of an airplane.

08:48.740 --> 08:51.660
They do all the rapid calculations, and they figure

08:51.660 --> 08:54.860
what that wing will be able to support.

08:54.860 --> 08:57.340
And after all their calculations, and after

08:57.340 --> 09:02.020
they're certain, they then pile sandbags on the wing.

09:02.020 --> 09:03.060
Did you know that?

09:03.060 --> 09:09.500
Until it breaks off to make damn sure that it does the job.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.900
Now, that does not exist in everyday language.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.900
In everyday language, you don't have that ability.

09:15.900 --> 09:18.580
When an engineer meets another engineer, he says, I can

09:18.580 --> 09:23.620
illuminate an area with this tiny point of light that has

09:23.620 --> 09:26.140
50,000 square feet.

09:26.180 --> 09:27.940
The engineer says, well, that's not possible.

09:27.940 --> 09:29.820
He doesn't talk like that.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.940
He says, how do you power that unit?

09:32.940 --> 09:35.460
What kind of voltage does it take?

09:35.460 --> 09:37.780
How do you illuminate that spot?

09:37.780 --> 09:39.220
They ask questions.

09:39.220 --> 09:42.900
The average person, yeah, nah, not in a thousand years.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.940
That's been around for a long time.

09:44.940 --> 09:50.060
That is a language of war, of hatred, of bigotry, of

09:50.060 --> 09:54.500
prejudice, the inability to ask questions.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.540
And we've got to be very careful about that.

09:57.540 --> 10:00.940
And at one lecture I remember at Princeton, I was trying to

10:00.940 --> 10:05.300
say that human beings cannot think or reason, because of

10:05.300 --> 10:08.540
psychology, department, and sociology.

10:08.540 --> 10:11.540
Well, one of the individuals stood up, one of the staff,

10:11.540 --> 10:14.780
and he said, all right, where did the camera come from?

10:14.780 --> 10:16.780
There were no cameras at one time.

10:16.780 --> 10:19.540
Someone had to think about a camera.

10:19.540 --> 10:21.900
He just doesn't come out of the thin air.

10:21.900 --> 10:26.860
And after doing a lot of work, many years ago, in ancient

10:26.860 --> 10:30.060
Egypt, or if you live out in the country, or have lived

10:30.060 --> 10:33.980
out in the country, if there was a hole in the barn wall,

10:33.980 --> 10:38.900
that is, a knot was knocked out, the cows on the outside

10:38.900 --> 10:42.820
appeared on the wall of the barn, upside down.

10:42.820 --> 10:47.380
And in Egypt, you went in this dome to see the upside down

10:47.380 --> 10:48.420
world.

10:48.420 --> 10:51.780
There was a little hole here, and the daylight came in, and

10:51.780 --> 10:54.740
you saw people walking upside down on the wall.

10:54.740 --> 10:57.260
How many of you have experienced that kind of

10:57.260 --> 10:59.300
phenomenon?

10:59.300 --> 11:02.260
That is essentially the box-hole camera.

11:02.260 --> 11:05.380
A camera, the simple camera without a lens, there's just

11:05.380 --> 11:07.540
a little hole in the box.

11:07.540 --> 11:12.220
And somebody said, well, how can I see that image?

11:12.220 --> 11:15.340
And they used a transparent membrane back here, and they

11:15.340 --> 11:20.500
could see the upside down head, or a person, or a cow.

11:20.540 --> 11:24.420
And they asked this question, if only I can retain that

11:24.420 --> 11:25.340
image?

11:25.340 --> 11:26.780
Well, that isn't the answer.

11:26.780 --> 11:28.100
That's just a question.

11:28.100 --> 11:31.380
I wonder how I could retain that image.

11:31.380 --> 11:35.980
So years before that, the American Indians and other

11:35.980 --> 11:41.460
primitives have taken tappercloth, or they'd weave

11:41.460 --> 11:44.700
natural materials into a kind of a fabric.

11:44.700 --> 11:47.220
And then they would take berry juices and

11:47.220 --> 11:48.980
dye it different colors.

11:48.980 --> 11:53.620
Sometimes a leaf would fall upon that surface, and after

11:53.620 --> 11:57.580
the sun dried it, they had an image of the leaf.

11:57.580 --> 12:03.500
So they began to use dyes from this background, that all

12:03.500 --> 12:08.620
human beings, to understand the better, the first human

12:08.620 --> 12:12.580
being that jumped off a precipice with wings, he

12:12.580 --> 12:13.700
died.

12:13.740 --> 12:17.300
And his brother-in-law wrote, next time, make the wings

12:17.300 --> 12:19.660
larger.

12:19.660 --> 12:23.940
No one starts out right away and solves a problem, unless

12:23.940 --> 12:26.740
you have a tremendous background in many different

12:26.740 --> 12:27.820
areas.

12:27.820 --> 12:30.580
Well, the next guy that jumped off, he jumped off of the

12:30.580 --> 12:31.820
larger wings.

12:31.820 --> 12:34.700
And he flew a little, and then they went, and the old

12:34.700 --> 12:38.020
fisherman said, you've got to brace them wings, like a

12:38.020 --> 12:40.020
boat, like a man.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.780
They're not going to hold, so they braced it.

12:42.780 --> 12:45.740
And then they jumped off the precipice, this individual,

12:45.740 --> 12:49.060
and he flew, and he hit a tree.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.740
And he hurt his leg real badly.

12:51.740 --> 12:54.220
And his wife said, you know, John, a fish has a

12:54.220 --> 12:57.820
rudder, good point.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.660
And they stuck the rudder on the airplane.

13:00.660 --> 13:04.780
No one ever sat down and invented a television set, an

13:04.780 --> 13:08.940
airplane, the electric light, wireless, none of that came

13:08.940 --> 13:12.740
about by men walking in deep concentration.

13:12.740 --> 13:16.900
And then, through some ethereal substance, bingo, the

13:16.900 --> 13:18.300
idea is formulated.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.140
It doesn't work that way.

13:20.140 --> 13:22.540
It's hard work.

13:22.540 --> 13:25.820
And I make more mistakes than anybody I know, because I

13:25.820 --> 13:27.020
try more things.

13:29.740 --> 13:32.980
There's nothing wrong with building something, and

13:32.980 --> 13:34.940
finding out that it doesn't work.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.100
This is where you get your experience.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.500
There's nothing wrong with criticism.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.980
I remember the first model airplanes that I built went

13:41.980 --> 13:45.460
nosing into the ground, and I was ashamed of them.

13:45.460 --> 13:49.700
And a young engineer told me that my center of gravity had

13:49.700 --> 13:50.300
to be corrected.

13:50.300 --> 13:53.140
That is, move the wing forward.

13:53.140 --> 13:59.020
And so all of us stand on the shoulders of one another, and

13:59.020 --> 14:00.780
we shape the future.

14:00.780 --> 14:03.620
Another question that was asked, well, somebody had to

14:03.620 --> 14:04.940
invent the bow and arrow.

14:04.940 --> 14:06.420
Somebody had to think of it.

14:06.420 --> 14:08.500
It just didn't come out of nowhere.

14:08.500 --> 14:12.420
Well, I talked to many Indians, and after talking to many

14:12.420 --> 14:17.620
Indians, this is when I found out that Indians used to skin

14:17.620 --> 14:21.060
animals, and this is a lousy drawing of the skin of an

14:21.060 --> 14:25.340
animal stretched out in the sun.

14:25.340 --> 14:29.380
When the Indians got back, the skin was half the size.

14:29.380 --> 14:31.340
It shrunk and became thicker.

14:31.340 --> 14:33.100
And they didn't like that at all.

14:33.100 --> 14:37.660
So they cut leather into strips, thin strips.

14:37.660 --> 14:41.980
And they took an existing frame, and they tied that skin

14:41.980 --> 14:42.780
to the frame.

14:42.780 --> 14:45.860
Something you may have seen this, was lace of leather,

14:45.860 --> 14:48.500
all in one, to prevent it from shrinking.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.500
But when they cut the strips of leather and put them out in

14:51.500 --> 14:54.740
the sun, they shrunk and became fat and short.

14:54.740 --> 14:57.220
And they were just pleased with that.

14:57.220 --> 15:01.540
After many, many years, one Indian tied that strand of

15:01.540 --> 15:06.900
leather to a piece of wood, a stick.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.900
He split the top, tied it up, and tied the leather to the

15:09.900 --> 15:10.500
stick.

15:10.500 --> 15:14.860
When he came back, hoping that it would dry and not shrink,

15:14.860 --> 15:16.900
the stick took this form.

15:16.900 --> 15:20.180
It was bent.

15:20.180 --> 15:23.780
He plucked that in and went, bong, now.

15:23.780 --> 15:26.940
And after many years, somebody took another piece of wood,

15:26.940 --> 15:30.380
put it in and pulled the string, and off it went.

15:30.460 --> 15:33.460
Well, if man can't think or reason, where did the movie

15:33.460 --> 15:35.460
camera come from?

15:35.460 --> 15:36.500
Somebody had to think of that.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.100
It doesn't exist out there.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.220
Well, here's where it came from.

15:40.220 --> 15:44.620
Many, many years ago, thousands of years ago in China,

15:44.620 --> 15:50.380
they used to take a candle, and they'd take some bamboo

15:50.380 --> 15:53.460
paper at the time, and put it in front of the candle.

15:53.460 --> 15:55.820
And then they'd cut out a little figurine of a human

15:55.820 --> 15:58.220
being, and put the candle behind it.

15:58.220 --> 16:02.060
And as the candle undulated, the little person would dance,

16:02.060 --> 16:03.380
and they'd play music.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.020
That was the beginning.

16:05.020 --> 16:06.300
How did that happen?

16:06.300 --> 16:09.540
Some guy had a candle in the piece of paper, and he was

16:09.540 --> 16:12.700
just happened to be behind it, and his finger appeared to

16:12.700 --> 16:14.260
move on the screen.

16:14.260 --> 16:18.460
And so he extracted or built upon that phenomena.

16:18.460 --> 16:21.460
Then later, there's something interesting occurring.

16:21.460 --> 16:25.980
The Chinese used to take these tremendous scrolls and

16:25.980 --> 16:26.860
open them up.

16:26.860 --> 16:31.100
Well, they then later taped, or they wired, or they used

16:31.100 --> 16:35.300
gut and tied many pages together and built a kind of a

16:35.300 --> 16:36.260
pad.

16:36.260 --> 16:41.340
But in order to get to a particular page, the oriental

16:41.340 --> 16:45.300
would mark the corner of the page so that they can find

16:45.300 --> 16:46.580
with a symbol.

16:46.580 --> 16:49.980
And as you flip through the pages fast, that little dot

16:49.980 --> 16:52.220
would jump all over the place.

16:52.220 --> 16:57.220
Well, years later, an individual drew various

16:57.220 --> 17:01.540
successive pictures of a bird in flight, and put them down

17:01.540 --> 17:03.940
in the corner of the paper and flipped it.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.740
And the little bird wings began to move up and down.

17:06.740 --> 17:11.980
Well, a Frenchman saw that, and he took little pieces of

17:11.980 --> 17:17.220
cardboard, and he put them in a circular pattern.

17:17.220 --> 17:20.700
I'm going to try to get it down as quickly as I can.

17:20.700 --> 17:24.740
And he put a crank up here that you turn, and the little

17:24.740 --> 17:27.180
pictures would go around in a circle.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.020
And the Chinese had something like this also, and they had

17:30.020 --> 17:33.220
a bamboo interrupter that would just hold the picture for

17:33.220 --> 17:36.420
a few seconds, a second, less than a second, as you turned

17:36.420 --> 17:39.460
it, a man appeared to move across the screen.

17:39.460 --> 17:42.860
Well, the Frenchman machined that out of brass, did a

17:42.860 --> 17:45.900
beautiful job, and when you turned the crank, the person

17:45.900 --> 17:49.700
walked with smoother motions rather than these abrupt

17:49.700 --> 17:51.100
motions.

17:51.100 --> 17:55.820
Edison saw that unit that the Frenchman designed, and he

17:55.820 --> 17:59.860
turned it into this position.

17:59.860 --> 18:02.180
I guess I can't work with that microphone.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.220
Can you hear me back there?

18:07.540 --> 18:08.500
Is there an OK?

18:08.500 --> 18:08.980
OK.

18:12.740 --> 18:22.660
And what happened is he turned it into a vertical position, and

18:22.660 --> 18:29.700
all the pictures were set in a circular fashion, and you turned

18:29.700 --> 18:31.180
the crank here.

18:31.180 --> 18:32.060
Excuse me.

18:32.060 --> 18:33.660
They won't get the audio on the camera.

18:33.660 --> 18:34.260
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:34.260 --> 18:37.180
Why don't you just put it in your pocket or something?

18:37.620 --> 18:39.980
Oh, it's fine.

18:39.980 --> 18:42.980
Or hook it to your wrist.

18:42.980 --> 18:44.100
Thanks.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.900
Roxanne is my associate.

18:45.900 --> 18:49.140
She works on all the buildings and all the things that we've

18:49.140 --> 18:51.940
developed in the Venus Project, which I'll talk to you

18:51.940 --> 18:53.300
about later.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.580
And Edison purchased this, put a magnifying glass in front of

18:56.580 --> 18:59.940
it, and you put a nickel in, and you turned the crank, and

18:59.940 --> 19:01.380
you saw people moving.

19:01.380 --> 19:03.860
A bunch of still photographs.

19:03.860 --> 19:06.580
It was a long, slow process.

19:06.580 --> 19:10.260
Nobody, no individual, invented the camera.

19:10.260 --> 19:13.020
A little bit here, a little there, added to that, and

19:13.020 --> 19:17.460
eventually the Wright brothers read about experimental

19:17.460 --> 19:21.380
aircraft, where thousands of people died trying to develop

19:21.380 --> 19:23.300
a flying machine.

19:23.300 --> 19:26.460
And after picking up bits of this information, including

19:26.460 --> 19:31.260
man-carrying kites from China thousands of years ago, and

19:31.260 --> 19:33.620
they built the first flying machine.

19:33.660 --> 19:35.420
They were called the father of flight.

19:35.420 --> 19:39.420
Again, there's no father of anything.

19:39.420 --> 19:42.060
You may take an idea so far, you add to it, and

19:42.060 --> 19:43.380
gradually it's built up.

19:43.380 --> 19:47.540
A genius, a genius is a person that has been exposed to

19:47.540 --> 19:51.300
many different systems, and therefore they can come up

19:51.300 --> 19:54.180
with a wide range of solutions.

19:54.180 --> 19:58.020
A man like Leonardo da Vinci, you think that he just

19:58.020 --> 19:59.500
evolved out of nothing?

19:59.500 --> 20:02.060
He spoke to people that were interested in mechanics in

20:02.060 --> 20:02.900
his time.

20:02.900 --> 20:06.540
They gathered and they shared ideas, but you only hear of

20:06.540 --> 20:08.460
da Vinci.

20:08.460 --> 20:14.980
Unfortunately, guys like Nikolai Tesla, Edison, all the

20:14.980 --> 20:18.140
great innovators of the past have been influenced by

20:18.140 --> 20:19.940
other people.

20:19.940 --> 20:23.620
And the mythical structures that we build around inventors

20:23.620 --> 20:25.780
that they inherit special abilities.

20:25.780 --> 20:28.420
They are geniuses, or they're in tune with the infinite

20:28.420 --> 20:33.020
mind, and the ideas somehow filter in.

20:33.020 --> 20:35.060
Well, this is a kind of nonsense.

20:35.060 --> 20:39.220
It's the same story about, is there intelligent life out

20:39.220 --> 20:40.500
there?

20:40.500 --> 20:46.580
The real question is, is there intelligent life here?

20:46.580 --> 20:49.780
We don't think so, not yet.

20:49.780 --> 20:52.020
I'm serious, I'm not kidding.

20:52.020 --> 20:54.420
What is intelligence?

20:54.420 --> 21:00.020
Well, the ability to reason things out, you can't have

21:00.020 --> 21:03.580
that ability unless you've had experience in particular

21:03.580 --> 21:04.540
areas.

21:04.540 --> 21:10.140
An eskimo never dreams, I repeat this, of walking on a

21:10.140 --> 21:12.340
palm-fringed beach.

21:12.340 --> 21:13.380
Can you understand that?

21:13.380 --> 21:17.300
It is not possible, unless he has seen motion pictures or

21:17.300 --> 21:20.460
something about the beach.

21:20.460 --> 21:24.140
It is not possible for any human being to build a frame of

21:24.140 --> 21:28.020
reference of any kind without experience.

21:28.020 --> 21:32.500
I know where every invention I ever made came from.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.500
I know the influence, the books I've read, the people I've

21:35.500 --> 21:38.700
known, everything that shaped those values.

21:38.700 --> 21:41.500
And sometimes people say, well, when did you think of that?

21:41.500 --> 21:42.940
Wonderful idea.

21:42.940 --> 21:44.420
It was in February the first.

21:44.420 --> 21:48.100
Now, it's cumulative bits of information that we put

21:48.100 --> 21:51.220
together with experience.

21:51.220 --> 21:53.460
So all of the artificial structures and

21:53.460 --> 21:57.700
artificiality of all societies, they are all primitive

21:57.700 --> 21:58.500
today.

21:58.500 --> 22:01.980
They are all backward, the very fact that we use

22:01.980 --> 22:05.700
political systems, the very fact that there are Democrats

22:05.700 --> 22:09.660
and Republicans and notions about how the

22:09.660 --> 22:11.380
world ought to be governed.

22:11.380 --> 22:13.980
Now, scientists could not do a thing with that.

22:13.980 --> 22:17.500
If you want to put a man on the moon, you have to know what

22:17.500 --> 22:19.620
the distance is precisely.

22:19.620 --> 22:22.460
You have to know how much material you're lifting up

22:22.460 --> 22:24.260
toward the moon.

22:24.260 --> 22:28.140
You have to know how much force a human body can stand.

22:28.140 --> 22:31.260
Well, to start with, they don't have that information.

22:31.260 --> 22:35.740
So they build special devices, a big centrifuge.

22:35.740 --> 22:38.580
They put a human being in it, and they whirl it around.

22:38.580 --> 22:40.020
They say, how are you doing?

22:40.020 --> 22:41.580
And the guy conks out.

22:41.580 --> 22:45.980
And they say, well, this is how fast you can rotate

22:45.980 --> 22:47.660
certain groups of people.

22:47.660 --> 22:50.620
And they build data.

22:50.620 --> 22:55.020
And from that data, they plan the moon voyage.

22:55.020 --> 23:00.780
The question then is, what kind of world do we want?

23:00.780 --> 23:04.300
How is it that we want our social system to operate?

23:04.300 --> 23:07.260
What makes criminal behavior?

23:07.260 --> 23:10.580
What are the factors that make a Jeffrey Dahmer?

23:10.580 --> 23:12.100
I'm sure you know who that was.

23:12.100 --> 23:15.340
Before Jeffrey, there was Albert Fish.

23:15.340 --> 23:19.100
I don't know if any of you remember Albert Fish.

23:19.100 --> 23:22.140
Albert Fish was a fine-looking gentleman.

23:22.140 --> 23:24.900
He ate 45 children.

23:24.900 --> 23:29.100
Well, you wonder, how can anyone do that kind of thing?

23:29.100 --> 23:32.100
I'm going to try to give you some idea of the background

23:32.100 --> 23:34.260
of Albert Fish.

23:34.260 --> 23:37.500
When he was a youngster, about 10 years old,

23:37.500 --> 23:39.900
he was touching his private parts.

23:39.900 --> 23:42.740
His mother was an old-time Baptist.

23:42.780 --> 23:46.060
And she says, you are going straight to hell.

23:46.060 --> 23:47.980
You will burn eternally.

23:47.980 --> 23:53.100
And that kid, Albert Fish, stuck needles into his genitals

23:53.100 --> 23:55.340
because he didn't want to burn in hell.

23:55.340 --> 23:57.660
And he took other children into empty lots

23:57.660 --> 24:00.740
and cut off their private parts because he

24:00.740 --> 24:02.420
wanted to save them.

24:02.420 --> 24:05.540
If you're brought up in a distorted environment, which

24:05.540 --> 24:09.660
we all live in today, any judge that wraps the gavel

24:09.660 --> 24:12.620
and says, 30 years is an ignoramus

24:12.620 --> 24:15.460
because he has no idea of the factors that

24:15.460 --> 24:17.380
shape human behavior.

24:17.380 --> 24:22.060
When you become aware, if you bring up a healthy boy

24:22.060 --> 24:24.980
with about six women, and one of the girls says,

24:24.980 --> 24:26.980
oh, did I see a gorgeous hat?

24:26.980 --> 24:29.740
That boy will pick up the same mannerisms,

24:29.740 --> 24:34.260
same facial expressions, and say, oh, I just love that hat.

24:34.260 --> 24:36.060
Because if that's the environment

24:36.060 --> 24:38.740
that you brought up in Italy, you say, hey, what's the matter?

24:38.740 --> 24:40.140
You like or you don't like?

24:40.140 --> 24:42.740
In other words, it depends on the way you brought up.

24:42.740 --> 24:44.780
Did you know that Lincoln was Irish?

24:44.780 --> 24:49.980
It depends on your group and the values that you exchange.

24:49.980 --> 24:54.020
And if you want a world without war, without hatred,

24:54.020 --> 24:57.380
without crime, without stupidity,

24:57.380 --> 25:02.700
it can be arranged if you follow this bit.

25:02.700 --> 25:06.340
If we consider at some time, which society will,

25:06.380 --> 25:10.020
at a later time, I hope it would be sooner,

25:10.020 --> 25:13.540
that all of the earth become the common heritage

25:13.540 --> 25:17.700
of all nations, all of the resource of the earth,

25:17.700 --> 25:20.580
the common heritage of all nations.

25:20.580 --> 25:22.460
And if you believe in God, if you

25:22.460 --> 25:26.300
understand the teachings of all religions,

25:26.300 --> 25:30.940
there are no property lines in heaven, no banks,

25:30.940 --> 25:34.780
no personal positions in which one person is elevated

25:34.780 --> 25:36.660
above another.

25:36.660 --> 25:40.020
That if the earth were the common heritage of all nations

25:40.020 --> 25:42.100
and all of the artificial boundaries

25:42.100 --> 25:44.780
removed that separate people, there'd

25:44.780 --> 25:49.700
be no basis for war, no basis for armament.

25:49.700 --> 25:51.420
The world you live in is an old world.

25:51.420 --> 25:52.100
It's language.

25:52.100 --> 25:52.820
It's old.

25:52.820 --> 25:54.460
Its values are old.

25:54.460 --> 25:56.900
And our institutions of education

25:56.900 --> 25:59.820
fail to touch the social system.

25:59.820 --> 26:00.580
You want to be careful.

26:00.580 --> 26:01.540
Don't touch that.

26:01.540 --> 26:05.260
This is an area that you don't want to get involved in.

26:05.260 --> 26:09.020
Well, in order for you to grow, in order

26:09.020 --> 26:11.020
for you to make the world a better place,

26:11.020 --> 26:13.900
you have to face this situation.

26:13.900 --> 26:17.060
I don't say that people are going to sit back and do that.

26:17.060 --> 26:19.900
According to all historical records,

26:19.900 --> 26:23.300
no civilization, anyway, to my knowledge,

26:23.300 --> 26:25.940
has ever sit back to plan the future.

26:25.940 --> 26:28.340
Exactly what we're going to do, how we're going to live,

26:28.340 --> 26:30.100
how we're going to work out transportation.

26:30.100 --> 26:33.060
Now, we just build highways all over the place.

26:33.060 --> 26:36.780
Although you go to school and you learn something,

26:36.780 --> 26:39.860
you learn that a straight line is the shortest distance

26:39.860 --> 26:42.540
between two given points.

26:42.540 --> 26:46.660
Well, look at a roadmap of the United States.

26:46.660 --> 26:51.420
And I think you'll find spaghetti all over the place.

26:51.420 --> 26:53.500
Rarely do you see that.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.500
Look at your cities, every building

26:55.500 --> 26:57.340
of different size and shape.

26:57.340 --> 27:00.940
This does not express individuality.

27:00.940 --> 27:02.740
It's a chaos.

27:02.740 --> 27:05.540
At four o'clock, all the cars come out of this building,

27:05.540 --> 27:07.860
and they can't get across that bridge.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.700
So you've got to build another bridge.

27:09.700 --> 27:12.500
So you elect people to political office

27:12.500 --> 27:14.300
that are totally incompetent.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.780
They are neutrally bankrupt.

27:15.780 --> 27:18.340
I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican.

27:18.340 --> 27:20.140
They don't have the value system

27:20.140 --> 27:23.980
to solve these problems that exist.

27:23.980 --> 27:26.300
They are not educated in that way.

27:26.300 --> 27:29.980
They are brought up with a uniform set of values.

27:29.980 --> 27:31.860
And they go out into the world.

27:31.860 --> 27:36.260
And this was a sad story of coming events.

27:36.260 --> 27:37.980
There are computers today.

27:37.980 --> 27:40.140
There are machines in existence today

27:40.140 --> 27:48.740
that can handle 500 trillion bits of information per second.

27:48.740 --> 27:51.500
No human comes anywhere near that.

27:51.500 --> 27:54.580
And you think that in the next 15 or 20 years,

27:54.580 --> 27:56.740
there's going to be people in government?

27:56.740 --> 27:58.540
No way.

27:58.540 --> 28:00.860
For example, if you took a group of computers

28:00.860 --> 28:03.420
and arranged them in a special fashion

28:03.420 --> 28:06.180
and ran the electrical tentacles out

28:06.180 --> 28:12.380
to the agricultural belt with probes into the soil,

28:12.380 --> 28:14.020
when the water table dropped, that

28:14.020 --> 28:17.100
would turn on the pumps and bring the water into the area.

28:17.100 --> 28:20.180
If the nutrients changed, it would pump nutrients

28:20.180 --> 28:21.300
into the area.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.220
What kind of world do you want?

28:23.220 --> 28:25.460
I don't think any of you here, maybe a few of you,

28:25.460 --> 28:29.620
might remember when human beings used to operate elevators.

28:29.620 --> 28:30.900
They'd turn to crank.

28:30.900 --> 28:33.780
They'd never quite got to the floor, up and down.

28:33.780 --> 28:36.060
Finally, they became automated.

28:36.060 --> 28:36.980
Step back.

28:36.980 --> 28:38.380
It's a lovely day today.

28:38.380 --> 28:39.860
How are you, Mr. Jones?

28:39.860 --> 28:41.460
If they scan your face.

28:41.460 --> 28:43.860
And they'll take you exactly to that floor.

28:43.860 --> 28:45.980
After that comes the transveyor.

28:45.980 --> 28:49.340
An elevator moves up and down sideways, all directions.

28:49.340 --> 28:51.300
You get on it and verbalize, I want

28:51.300 --> 28:53.540
to go to the art center, music center,

28:53.540 --> 28:56.100
and it'll take you there.

28:56.100 --> 28:59.540
The kind of world you live in and the automobiles that

28:59.540 --> 29:03.180
exist as transportation units are dangerous,

29:03.180 --> 29:08.700
because they have a bumper in front and one in the back.

29:08.700 --> 29:11.140
And I'm sure that if an extraterrestrial visited

29:11.140 --> 29:14.020
the earth, they'd say, what are those shiny things in front

29:14.020 --> 29:15.700
and back of the vehicle?

29:15.700 --> 29:16.700
Well, they're bumpers.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.420
They don't prevent damage.

29:18.420 --> 29:21.580
Well, don't you have the head on the side?

29:21.580 --> 29:24.020
Why aren't the bumper all around the car?

29:24.020 --> 29:25.900
And then they came with the airbag.

29:25.900 --> 29:27.820
And they put an airbag in front of you.

29:27.820 --> 29:29.100
If you get hit on the side, your head

29:29.100 --> 29:31.140
goes right through the glass.

29:31.140 --> 29:33.900
They had a long time to appeal to companies,

29:33.900 --> 29:36.260
a long time to solve those problems.

29:36.260 --> 29:39.100
And then you see motorcycle policemen pull over.

29:39.100 --> 29:41.060
What do you think you're doing?

29:41.060 --> 29:43.700
All you have to do in a car, if you wanted to,

29:43.700 --> 29:45.220
I wouldn't do it.

29:45.220 --> 29:46.940
I wouldn't even put this in a car.

29:46.940 --> 29:51.980
Just put a sort of a chimograph or a cylindrical recorder.

29:51.980 --> 29:55.140
When you go through a 30-mile-an-hour zone to 50-mile-an-hour,

29:55.140 --> 29:56.660
it's recorded on there.

29:56.660 --> 29:59.260
And every month, you have to tear that strip out of your car

29:59.260 --> 30:02.740
and mail it into the police department.

30:02.740 --> 30:05.460
Well, the police wouldn't like that.

30:05.460 --> 30:08.180
But how many violations do you think you'd have?

30:08.180 --> 30:10.460
There are better ways than that.

30:10.460 --> 30:13.340
You just make a car intelligent.

30:13.340 --> 30:15.260
Well, here's what that means.

30:15.260 --> 30:18.540
How intelligent can machine be?

30:18.540 --> 30:21.700
Well, if you took a little gadget called a pressure

30:21.700 --> 30:25.980
transducer, if you squeeze it, it generates electricity.

30:25.980 --> 30:28.020
So let's put one in each tire.

30:28.020 --> 30:30.980
And let's say that you kick the front-right tire.

30:30.980 --> 30:35.460
It goes to a recording says, ouch, my front-right tire.

30:35.460 --> 30:39.340
Now, of course, if you kick any tire, it'll verbalize.

30:39.340 --> 30:43.740
But if you kick it hard, it'll say ouch, my front-right tire.

30:43.780 --> 30:46.380
And if you kick it again, it'll say, who do you think you are?

30:46.380 --> 30:48.620
Do you want to give a machine feelings?

30:48.620 --> 30:53.140
Do you want to give a machine compassion, love, warmth?

30:53.140 --> 30:55.420
I'll tell you why they leave it out of machines,

30:55.420 --> 30:58.220
because it doesn't work.

30:58.220 --> 31:01.020
Human emotions that you learn are the most significant

31:01.020 --> 31:05.780
and most important differences between men and machines.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.220
Human emotions are very touchy subject.

31:08.220 --> 31:11.500
It's like racing your engine at a stop light.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.300
It doesn't take you anywhere.

31:13.340 --> 31:15.260
It doesn't serve any purpose.

31:15.260 --> 31:16.860
If you get a lump in your throat when

31:16.860 --> 31:19.700
you see hungry people, that's emotional.

31:19.700 --> 31:23.420
But when you increase the agricultural yield per acre,

31:23.420 --> 31:24.820
that's caring.

31:24.820 --> 31:26.060
That's love.

31:26.060 --> 31:31.700
Love is transforming all of the verbal and paper

31:31.700 --> 31:35.580
proclamations to a way of life.

31:35.580 --> 31:38.060
The shameful thing about our century

31:38.060 --> 31:42.340
is that there was only one Edison, one Louis Pasteur,

31:42.340 --> 31:46.220
one Nikolai Tesla, one Madame Curie.

31:46.220 --> 31:49.900
We should have had thousands of them, and we will.

31:49.900 --> 31:53.940
Once we get rid of the artificial boundaries

31:53.940 --> 31:57.700
that separate people, once we get rid of nationalism,

31:57.700 --> 32:02.300
patriotism, again, I do not mean to offend anybody.

32:02.300 --> 32:05.460
All that I ask you to do is think about this,

32:05.460 --> 32:07.500
toss it around.

32:07.500 --> 32:10.380
This is what the Venus Project advocates.

32:10.380 --> 32:15.100
The Venus Project is a design for culture

32:15.100 --> 32:18.220
in which we bridge the difference between all nations.

32:18.220 --> 32:22.660
How is that done by a universal language, the blueprint?

32:22.660 --> 32:25.140
If you open a blueprint in Japan,

32:25.140 --> 32:27.500
they know what you're talking about.

32:27.500 --> 32:31.260
If you write a prescription for England, Japan, France,

32:31.260 --> 32:33.220
the pharmacologist understands that.

32:33.220 --> 32:34.900
There's no discrepancies.

32:34.900 --> 32:36.420
There's no ambivalence.

32:36.420 --> 32:38.220
I wonder what he meant by that.

32:38.220 --> 32:42.660
It's clear the language we use daily is not.

32:42.660 --> 32:48.020
The language of warmth and love are verbal excuses

32:48.020 --> 32:50.760
and verbal outlets for some people,

32:50.760 --> 32:53.620
for avoiding their responsibility

32:53.620 --> 32:57.220
to make the world a better place for everyone.

32:57.220 --> 33:00.300
The smarter your kids are, the richer my life.

33:00.300 --> 33:04.220
Every kid on corner shooting up drugs, going nowhere,

33:04.220 --> 33:07.420
you're going to have to pay for in the future.

33:07.460 --> 33:12.460
Therefore, it is efficient and functionally selfish

33:12.660 --> 33:15.420
to build a better world for everyone.

33:15.420 --> 33:17.420
If you try to do it, people come to me all the time

33:17.420 --> 33:21.500
and they say, can you design a city with a wall high enough

33:21.500 --> 33:24.100
so when the U2K problem comes

33:24.100 --> 33:27.580
or the system breaks down or the banks fail,

33:27.580 --> 33:29.340
we will be protected.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.940
I say, sure I can design that,

33:30.940 --> 33:33.380
but there are people that'll drive by

33:33.380 --> 33:36.740
with launching mechanisms right over your little wall.

33:36.740 --> 33:39.060
There's no place you can hide.

33:39.060 --> 33:42.620
We have 25 acres, people call it Eden too.

33:42.620 --> 33:44.060
Beautiful.

33:44.060 --> 33:47.300
But if the bottom falls out of this culture,

33:47.300 --> 33:49.660
there will be people at my front gate with children.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.540
How about some food just for the kids?

33:51.540 --> 33:53.060
The next day, 50 people.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.660
Everything looks solid to you.

33:55.660 --> 33:57.980
Everything looks solid and stable

33:57.980 --> 33:59.740
and the future looks promising.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.460
But here's the truth.

34:01.460 --> 34:03.580
I have seen an XY plotter,

34:03.580 --> 34:06.540
that is a machine that moves in three dimensions.

34:06.540 --> 34:09.860
They put a scalpel in that machine

34:09.860 --> 34:12.340
and an x-ray of a brain tumor.

34:12.340 --> 34:15.900
And this machine removed the brain tumor on a cadaver

34:15.900 --> 34:17.940
in about one-tenth the time.

34:17.940 --> 34:20.740
And doctors think, oh, just the industrial work

34:20.740 --> 34:23.220
on the production line, he's on the way out,

34:23.220 --> 34:25.420
but not me, I can think.

34:25.420 --> 34:27.220
Let me say this again.

34:27.220 --> 34:29.260
The typewriters that work the speech,

34:29.260 --> 34:32.260
today you talk, you compute it and you get a type

34:32.260 --> 34:35.900
and also correct your English, restructures your sentences,

34:35.900 --> 34:37.300
makes recommendations.

34:38.300 --> 34:41.980
How much longer do you think people are going to be

34:41.980 --> 34:45.700
in positions in industry and government

34:45.700 --> 34:49.820
making their own decisions?

34:49.820 --> 34:53.540
We don't believe that anyone ought to make decisions.

34:53.540 --> 34:56.580
We believe that people ought to arrive at decisions.

34:56.580 --> 34:58.340
And here's what that means.

34:58.340 --> 35:01.300
You go across the country and pick up samples of the soil

35:01.300 --> 35:02.540
all over the nation.

35:02.540 --> 35:04.580
You bring it to central agriculture,

35:04.620 --> 35:08.020
analyze that soil, and then turn to your health department

35:08.020 --> 35:10.660
and ask them what people need, manganese,

35:10.660 --> 35:13.980
whatever they need, and what is this soil good for?

35:13.980 --> 35:16.140
What should we grow, tomatoes,

35:16.140 --> 35:18.660
and then rotate the crop, move to something else?

35:18.660 --> 35:21.700
That's what I mean by surveying the conditions.

35:21.700 --> 35:24.180
Not what's your opinion, what's your opinion?

35:24.180 --> 35:28.100
Democracy is a crude and voter system

35:28.100 --> 35:32.100
and should have been phased out centuries ago.

35:32.140 --> 35:35.060
But we don't have enough outside points of view

35:35.060 --> 35:36.460
on radio and television.

35:37.420 --> 35:39.660
When I talked this way on the Larry King show,

35:39.660 --> 35:41.540
he said to me, just a minute,

35:41.540 --> 35:44.260
I depend on those people that you're attacking.

35:44.260 --> 35:46.460
I wasn't attacking the automobile companies.

35:46.460 --> 35:50.020
I just said that if you did that, it would be safer.

35:50.020 --> 35:52.940
If you put proximity units on automobiles,

35:52.940 --> 35:54.780
most of you have them in your home now,

35:54.780 --> 35:56.980
when you walk over the building, the light goes on.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.580
That's a proximity unit.

35:58.580 --> 36:00.820
Put that in your car, and if you're backing up

36:00.820 --> 36:03.900
and a child is crawling behind you, it stops,

36:03.900 --> 36:06.540
no matter how much you step on the gas.

36:06.540 --> 36:09.860
I don't want any signs slippery when wet.

36:09.860 --> 36:12.060
I want an abrasive put in the highway

36:12.060 --> 36:15.540
and take that sign down, so it's not slippery when wet.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.420
I don't want to say to kids, stay away from drugs.

36:19.420 --> 36:21.900
I want to make life so interesting for people

36:21.900 --> 36:23.340
that they don't want drugs.

36:23.340 --> 36:25.380
They don't want to dull their senses.

36:25.380 --> 36:27.180
They want to become keen,

36:27.180 --> 36:29.540
and they want to become fully aware,

36:29.580 --> 36:34.300
I'm using older language and conscious of their surroundings.

36:34.300 --> 36:37.580
It is painful to deaden your awareness

36:37.580 --> 36:39.460
when life is beautiful,

36:39.460 --> 36:41.580
when what you do goes out to people

36:41.580 --> 36:43.560
and makes their lives better.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.460
In one session at Princeton,

36:45.460 --> 36:47.780
I changed the values of many people.

36:47.780 --> 36:51.260
They walked out discussing this for years thereafter,

36:51.260 --> 36:53.500
and I still get letters today.

36:53.500 --> 36:56.980
I went into an area of New York called Hell's Kitchen.

36:56.980 --> 37:01.420
The kids there were considered very bad, bad.

37:01.420 --> 37:04.260
And the social worker used to wear a necktie and eyeglasses.

37:05.260 --> 37:08.740
And anyone that wore eyeglasses when I was a kid was a sissy.

37:08.740 --> 37:11.220
And when you wear a necktie and a suit,

37:11.220 --> 37:14.640
and you're talking to these kids that rags in the slums,

37:15.620 --> 37:18.900
they look at you as an outsider, you're unacceptable to them.

37:18.900 --> 37:22.260
So I put a wire recorder out in the front office.

37:22.260 --> 37:24.980
And after the social worker talked to the young boy,

37:24.980 --> 37:28.060
by the way, they made guns out of water pipe in New York.

37:28.060 --> 37:29.140
How many of you knew that?

37:29.140 --> 37:32.100
They didn't go and buy guns, they made them.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.660
And the social worker picked the gun out,

37:33.660 --> 37:35.460
he said, you're gonna take someone's eye hour,

37:35.460 --> 37:37.100
wind up in a state penitentiary,

37:37.100 --> 37:39.340
hurt your brother and father, you wanna do that?

37:39.340 --> 37:41.420
Well, the kid says nothing at all.

37:41.420 --> 37:42.420
Now, when the kid walks out,

37:42.420 --> 37:45.180
I make a wire recording of the way he talks to his friend.

37:45.180 --> 37:49.340
And he said, joy, the guy up front, the social worker.

37:49.340 --> 37:50.500
Then I walk over to the store,

37:50.500 --> 37:52.100
how'd you make out with Johnny?

37:52.100 --> 37:53.620
I had a good talk with the boy.

37:53.620 --> 37:55.420
I believe we established rapport.

37:55.420 --> 37:58.340
How do you know that?

37:58.340 --> 38:00.220
He says, I felt it intuitively.

38:01.260 --> 38:02.580
Then I play the tape.

38:02.580 --> 38:04.340
By the way, it was a wire recorder.

38:04.340 --> 38:07.140
I play the tape of the kid's answers.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.300
And he says, I'm grateful so-and-so.

38:10.300 --> 38:13.580
I said, no, no, just say, I don't know how to get to Johnny.

38:13.580 --> 38:14.900
I know how to get to Billy.

38:14.900 --> 38:18.300
I tried eight different methods, none of them worked.

38:18.300 --> 38:21.260
So I said, what's when I do next week?

38:21.300 --> 38:23.660
I walked in the office, picked up the gun,

38:23.660 --> 38:25.660
and I said, I understand you made this gun.

38:25.660 --> 38:27.860
He said, I told the guy I made it last week.

38:27.860 --> 38:29.100
This is in New York City.

38:29.100 --> 38:31.220
I used to make recordings of this.

38:31.220 --> 38:33.980
I wanted to use it in a film later.

38:33.980 --> 38:36.340
And I picked up the gun, I'm looking at it,

38:36.340 --> 38:37.980
and I'm shaking my head.

38:37.980 --> 38:39.540
He said, what's the matter with it?

38:39.540 --> 38:41.060
Let's come in.

38:41.060 --> 38:44.220
The damn pin is an eighth of an inch off center.

38:45.580 --> 38:46.740
He says, yeah.

38:47.900 --> 38:49.900
And I said, if you put a couple of washers on the side,

38:49.900 --> 38:52.180
you can move the pin right on center.

38:52.180 --> 38:54.180
He said, hey, do you like here?

38:54.180 --> 38:55.660
I said, what, with those jerks?

38:55.660 --> 38:56.500
Nah!

38:58.700 --> 39:01.140
Can I bring my friends over to meet you?

39:01.140 --> 39:05.220
That's people like him with similar values.

39:05.220 --> 39:09.660
Then you go to work in their terms, not your terms.

39:09.660 --> 39:13.860
Real psychology has to be related to the real world,

39:13.860 --> 39:17.660
not theory, not lab experiments in schools

39:17.660 --> 39:19.580
where you're not in touch with people,

39:19.580 --> 39:21.580
where you don't get the feel of people,

39:21.580 --> 39:26.380
where you don't get the sense of their identification

39:26.380 --> 39:27.980
with the world around them.

39:27.980 --> 39:30.140
I have changed many of those kids.

39:30.140 --> 39:33.100
And I brought a gun in for them to look at,

39:33.100 --> 39:34.740
and I said, I made this gun.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.260
Wow, they said.

39:36.260 --> 39:38.700
I sure would like to be able to make a gun like that.

39:38.700 --> 39:40.340
That's why I can help you do it.

39:40.340 --> 39:42.900
You can, or what do I have to do?

39:42.900 --> 39:45.980
I have to learn how to draw a front view of a gun,

39:46.900 --> 39:48.540
a side view of a gun.

39:51.420 --> 39:53.860
I know I'm going fast and there are a lot of drawings.

39:53.860 --> 39:57.660
You have to make three views to the gun so it can be made.

39:57.660 --> 40:00.180
He said, you know, I'm gonna learn to do that.

40:00.180 --> 40:02.260
So I set them up on a drafting table

40:02.260 --> 40:06.380
and I took them from guns to water skis to other things.

40:06.380 --> 40:09.340
Today a lot of them are engineering draftsmen.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.180
Because they told me that the kids,

40:11.180 --> 40:15.340
they only had an IQ of 24, so you can't get to them.

40:16.140 --> 40:19.180
Well, I said to one of these kids with an IQ of 24,

40:19.180 --> 40:22.460
suppose you wanted to rob that jewelry store across the way.

40:22.460 --> 40:23.380
How would you go about it?

40:23.380 --> 40:25.260
Any way at all.

40:25.260 --> 40:28.260
Well, I said I'd throw a bag of fecal matter in there

40:28.260 --> 40:29.940
and the guy gets mad at my friend,

40:29.940 --> 40:32.540
he runs there and I clean off the counter.

40:33.820 --> 40:35.180
That's where they live.

40:35.180 --> 40:38.180
I suppose you wanted to rob the third story,

40:38.180 --> 40:42.260
no ladders, no ropes, no weights.

40:42.260 --> 40:44.300
How would you get up to the third story?

40:45.300 --> 40:47.180
Well, after several days,

40:47.180 --> 40:49.900
one of the youngsters came up with a piece of wood.

40:49.900 --> 40:52.780
He didn't even know what a wedge was.

40:52.780 --> 40:54.860
You see that hunk of wood?

40:54.860 --> 40:57.220
I can stick in the bricks and it gets tight,

40:57.220 --> 41:00.740
no matter how far the bricks are, one another.

41:00.740 --> 41:03.420
And I can climb up to God, he didn't use that language.

41:03.420 --> 41:06.060
He was much, much stronger language.

41:06.060 --> 41:08.980
I climb up the building and take whatever I want to take.

41:08.980 --> 41:10.420
That's how I do it.

41:10.420 --> 41:12.380
Well, how do you give people an IQ test

41:12.380 --> 41:14.060
to come from a different environment?

41:14.060 --> 41:16.060
How do you know what they sense?

41:16.060 --> 41:17.620
Do you think that the formalist

41:17.620 --> 41:20.580
who tries to structure the nature of intelligence,

41:20.580 --> 41:22.780
the nature of creativity,

41:22.780 --> 41:24.780
without being creative, can do it?

41:26.060 --> 41:29.740
Well, in order to teach children how to become creative,

41:29.740 --> 41:34.780
I make a Martian out of rubber with eyes on tentacles

41:34.780 --> 41:36.380
and a pointed rear end.

41:37.860 --> 41:40.340
And they look at it and they think eh,

41:40.340 --> 41:42.660
and I say to them what good are three eyes

41:42.660 --> 41:44.260
or four eyes on tentacles?

41:44.260 --> 41:46.460
Eventually, we need to look at the back, the front,

41:46.460 --> 41:48.620
the side, the top at the same time.

41:48.620 --> 41:50.740
And one of the guys had six arms.

41:50.740 --> 41:53.340
Well, he can shave, read a book, eat a donut,

41:53.340 --> 41:58.060
and drink coffee instead of eh, as we're brought up.

41:58.060 --> 42:00.900
If you met a Martian, they had an opening out there.

42:00.900 --> 42:02.660
So what's that?

42:02.660 --> 42:04.100
Notice the attitude?

42:04.100 --> 42:05.300
What is that?

42:05.300 --> 42:07.700
Well, if we eat anything that's bad for us,

42:07.700 --> 42:10.860
it's ejected right away, not in your system.

42:10.900 --> 42:12.780
It goes through your whole system.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.340
So you're taught in medical school

42:14.340 --> 42:16.900
how wonderful the human body is,

42:16.900 --> 42:18.300
how wonderful it is.

42:18.300 --> 42:20.740
This isn't true at all.

42:20.740 --> 42:24.820
That you're indoctrinated to a set of values that are unreal.

42:26.020 --> 42:29.660
And in order for me to get these ideas out there,

42:29.660 --> 42:32.980
it's extremely difficult because we need films,

42:32.980 --> 42:36.620
we need equipment in order to do that.

42:36.620 --> 42:40.700
What the Venus Project has to offer is a way of life

42:40.700 --> 42:43.020
without ambiguity, a language

42:43.020 --> 42:47.620
that has a much more precise form of communication,

42:47.620 --> 42:50.420
to change the relationship between people

42:50.420 --> 42:54.260
where the male and female are not given separate roles,

42:54.260 --> 42:55.100
where the females say,

42:55.100 --> 42:57.340
I want to be a biochemist or a physicist,

42:57.340 --> 42:58.700
and she goes that way.

42:58.700 --> 43:02.460
When you hand a girl a doll, you're placing a set,

43:02.460 --> 43:04.460
you're beginning to manipulate the people.

43:04.460 --> 43:07.340
Everybody's afraid of controlling human behavior.

43:07.340 --> 43:09.660
You're always controlling behavior.

43:09.700 --> 43:11.340
When you pick up your little girl

43:11.340 --> 43:13.340
and say, don't play with that little Lutheran boy

43:13.340 --> 43:15.780
across the way, and you put him down again,

43:15.780 --> 43:17.740
or don't talk to that little Catholic girl

43:17.740 --> 43:18.580
across the way.

43:18.580 --> 43:20.740
Well, you're always indoctrinating children.

43:20.740 --> 43:23.340
Who loves you more than anything in the world?

43:23.340 --> 43:24.780
The candy store man.

43:24.780 --> 43:27.020
No, your mommy and your daddy.

43:27.020 --> 43:30.900
Say, indoctrination continuously.

43:30.900 --> 43:32.420
And then all of us together sing,

43:32.420 --> 43:35.380
we are free, let's go, we are free.

43:35.380 --> 43:38.820
So beware whenever you hear of freedom

43:38.860 --> 43:40.980
and all that sort of thing, watch out.

43:42.340 --> 43:44.420
Because a real free society,

43:44.420 --> 43:47.500
the closest I've ever come to it was in Polynesia.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.780
I lived in the South Pacific Islands for a while,

43:49.780 --> 43:52.700
and the natives gave me bananas and coconuts.

43:52.700 --> 43:56.260
They were very generous, and they had no words for work.

43:56.260 --> 43:57.940
Would you believe that?

43:57.940 --> 44:01.660
They went fishing all day, they played, they had Lew house.

44:01.660 --> 44:05.260
And they said, junk, you know, what you want?

44:05.260 --> 44:08.420
And I said, well, I would like an outrigger canoe,

44:08.420 --> 44:09.740
and they built one for me.

44:11.300 --> 44:14.940
A few days after they brought it to my hut,

44:14.940 --> 44:16.900
I heard some rustling outside,

44:16.900 --> 44:19.380
and they were all carrying the canoe away.

44:19.380 --> 44:20.620
I said, what's going on?

44:20.620 --> 44:21.740
You know use.

44:22.740 --> 44:24.820
It was a different value system.

44:24.820 --> 44:27.620
Now, the men and women walked around nude on the island

44:27.620 --> 44:29.380
when I got it a long time ago.

44:30.740 --> 44:33.860
And I never saw a native, poke another native,

44:33.860 --> 44:38.300
hey, get a load of that chick, none of that, none of that.

44:38.300 --> 44:41.140
They looked at the eyes of women when they talked to them.

44:41.140 --> 44:44.460
Never, hey, look at that, never at the legs.

44:44.460 --> 44:46.780
The motion picture cameras and all the movie theaters

44:46.780 --> 44:49.980
are dolling up and down the hind quarters and all.

44:49.980 --> 44:51.520
And you wonder why men are like that?

44:51.520 --> 44:52.900
They are not like that.

44:52.900 --> 44:55.120
They are made like that by culture.

44:56.180 --> 44:57.700
Then the missionaries arrived,

44:58.700 --> 45:01.260
and the little girls used to come to church, you know,

45:01.260 --> 45:04.860
innocent listening, and they put the t-shirts on them.

45:06.380 --> 45:07.980
And the girls had no idea

45:07.980 --> 45:09.700
why they were putting the t-shirts on them.

45:09.700 --> 45:10.780
What's this for?

45:10.780 --> 45:12.220
It's like me covering your nose.

45:12.220 --> 45:15.020
You can't go into room B unless your nose is covered.

45:15.020 --> 45:18.020
Well, the girls cut two holes in the t-shirts

45:18.020 --> 45:19.060
and came to church.

45:19.980 --> 45:23.300
So we're dealing with many different cultures,

45:23.300 --> 45:25.980
subcultures, and values.

45:25.980 --> 45:28.020
Our culture, if we are to grow

45:28.020 --> 45:32.100
and build a civilization worthy of humankind,

45:32.100 --> 45:34.460
we have to have a quantum jump

45:34.460 --> 45:38.480
in the way we look at our world, people, and ourselves.

45:39.500 --> 45:44.340
The Venus Project is the redesign of a culture

45:44.340 --> 45:47.740
in which the elements that comprise the culture

45:47.740 --> 45:48.580
are different.

45:48.580 --> 45:51.060
For example, our cities are round,

45:51.060 --> 45:53.420
not because I like round cities.

45:53.420 --> 45:54.720
The city is round.

45:54.720 --> 45:59.000
The center of the city has a socially integrated computer.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.980
This may be a medical center.

46:00.980 --> 46:02.940
This might be an engineering center.

46:03.060 --> 46:04.740
And if you work in the medical center,

46:04.740 --> 46:06.620
you can live in beautiful gardens

46:06.620 --> 46:08.860
with running streams and waterfalls.

46:08.860 --> 46:12.860
And every district is the same distance from the center.

46:12.860 --> 46:14.220
There are no cars in the city.

46:14.220 --> 46:17.500
You get on a conveyor and dial where you want to go to.

46:17.500 --> 46:19.820
There's no crime in the city.

46:19.820 --> 46:23.860
Just before the public library in the United States,

46:23.860 --> 46:25.860
people said, well, you can't really do that.

46:25.860 --> 46:27.740
The people never bring back the books.

46:27.740 --> 46:28.580
They'll keep them.

46:28.580 --> 46:29.580
They won't return them.

46:29.580 --> 46:31.620
Of course, all that was incorrect.

46:31.620 --> 46:34.700
I want to build a library where any child can walk in,

46:34.700 --> 46:38.660
check out a camera, check out art materials,

46:38.660 --> 46:41.980
check out water skis, make things available.

46:41.980 --> 46:43.380
People don't steal.

46:43.380 --> 46:45.460
No one's going to hit you on the head

46:45.460 --> 46:48.340
to take your watch off if it's available.

46:48.340 --> 46:52.260
Well, how are you going to pay for this central library

46:52.260 --> 46:56.780
that gives children these things for nothing?

46:56.780 --> 47:01.500
Well, it cost about $50,000 to keep a kid in jail,

47:01.500 --> 47:06.900
one year, an adult $75,000 a year.

47:06.900 --> 47:10.620
Food, clothing, shelter, dental care.

47:10.620 --> 47:14.220
Isn't it easier to do it in a different way?

47:14.220 --> 47:17.820
I would love to go to Mexico and say, what's your problem?

47:17.820 --> 47:20.860
They say, well, senor, we don't have the modern machinery

47:20.860 --> 47:22.140
you have.

47:22.140 --> 47:24.500
Give them modern machinery.

47:24.500 --> 47:26.340
Build schools for them.

47:26.340 --> 47:28.180
And they won't be coming over the border.

47:28.180 --> 47:30.460
What makes them come over the border?

47:30.460 --> 47:32.940
Hunger, lack of employment.

47:32.940 --> 47:36.180
They say, oh, damn Mexicans, you know what I like.

47:36.180 --> 47:38.220
There's nothing like that.

47:38.220 --> 47:40.980
Everything is shoved by something else.

47:40.980 --> 47:44.780
You are told that a tree falls over.

47:44.780 --> 47:47.380
You are told that a sailboat sails.

47:47.380 --> 47:52.300
A sailboat cannot sail unless acted upon by a resident force

47:52.300 --> 47:53.620
called the wind.

47:53.620 --> 47:55.180
A tree does not fall.

47:55.180 --> 47:59.300
If it rains and it's asymmetric and the soil becomes loose,

47:59.340 --> 48:00.780
gravity does the rest.

48:00.780 --> 48:02.340
The tree doesn't fall.

48:02.340 --> 48:04.700
Plants do not grow.

48:04.700 --> 48:08.500
They require radiant energy, nutrients, water,

48:08.500 --> 48:11.900
stop any of those things, and the plant stops.

48:11.900 --> 48:17.140
Human beings are not self-operating entities.

48:17.140 --> 48:20.140
We are operated by many resident forces.

48:20.140 --> 48:22.140
Of course, many of us are not aware of that.

48:22.140 --> 48:25.860
It looks like we're perfectly free making our own decisions.

48:25.860 --> 48:27.660
I know I think for myself.

48:27.660 --> 48:28.580
I'm sure you do.

48:28.580 --> 48:30.900
That's an illusion, because if you've

48:30.900 --> 48:33.860
brought up to believe in the Kennedy rocker,

48:33.860 --> 48:35.540
you want one for your home.

48:35.540 --> 48:39.100
It'll injure your back, distort your anatomy,

48:39.100 --> 48:42.540
but Kennedy had one like that, and I want one like that.

48:42.540 --> 48:46.700
When you break the patterns that have been established

48:46.700 --> 48:50.380
by existing society, you begin to move people

48:50.380 --> 48:52.740
in a new direction.

48:52.740 --> 48:56.020
I admit I could get up here and give a very pleasant lecture

48:56.020 --> 48:59.980
of how wonderful everything will be in the future.

48:59.980 --> 49:04.020
A helicopter in every garage, a house in suburbia,

49:04.020 --> 49:07.100
another on the beach, maybe one in Hawaii.

49:07.100 --> 49:08.100
This is the future.

49:08.100 --> 49:10.380
That is not the future.

49:10.380 --> 49:12.660
Those are the illusion generators,

49:12.660 --> 49:15.100
and there are lots of them.

49:15.100 --> 49:19.780
Gregory once told me that being black and living

49:19.780 --> 49:22.900
in the South, Dick Gregory, he said,

49:22.900 --> 49:24.940
whenever I was late for work, I couldn't

49:24.940 --> 49:27.900
run to the bus, because they would

49:27.900 --> 49:29.820
wonder what that blackie was up to.

49:33.500 --> 49:36.740
We project our value system into others.

49:36.740 --> 49:41.100
We project characteristics into others.

49:41.100 --> 49:45.020
We have to find out what we are really like.

49:45.020 --> 49:48.180
Now, many people tell me they want to find themselves.

49:48.180 --> 49:50.060
This is another ridiculous thing.

49:50.060 --> 49:51.460
Who are you going to find?

49:51.500 --> 49:55.660
Some jerk at 18, and a different value system at 23,

49:55.660 --> 49:57.220
you can never find yourself.

49:57.220 --> 50:00.540
If you read, keep up with new ideas, what's self?

50:00.540 --> 50:03.500
The self of 20?

50:03.500 --> 50:05.900
When I was 15, I was a jerk.

50:05.900 --> 50:08.500
And as time went on, I learned more

50:08.500 --> 50:10.660
about many different things, and knew

50:10.660 --> 50:14.220
how much I had to learn in order to move forward.

50:14.220 --> 50:16.380
There is no finding yourself.

50:16.380 --> 50:18.100
People come over to me and say, I

50:18.100 --> 50:21.140
want to know how I relate to the cosmos.

50:21.140 --> 50:24.540
We don't even know how a single self splits.

50:24.540 --> 50:27.420
And they want to know how they relate to the cosmos.

50:27.420 --> 50:30.340
What a bunch of verbal crap.

50:30.340 --> 50:31.860
Really, it's meaningless.

50:31.860 --> 50:35.940
And so I'm sorry that I only have one hour

50:35.940 --> 50:40.300
to try to give you ideas along different lines.

50:40.300 --> 50:42.140
Generally, it takes seminars.

50:42.140 --> 50:46.260
It takes a lot of demonstration and films.

50:46.260 --> 50:49.380
I did not mean to offend any of you.

50:49.380 --> 50:52.220
I hope that I didn't.

50:52.220 --> 50:53.900
Thank you for your time.

50:53.900 --> 51:06.820
I'm sure the audience has some questions, so fire away.

51:06.820 --> 51:08.740
Yes?

51:08.740 --> 51:10.580
I teach middle school kids.

51:10.580 --> 51:11.740
What do you see?

51:11.740 --> 51:12.980
I'm a little hard of hearing.

51:12.980 --> 51:14.500
I'm sorry about that.

51:14.500 --> 51:16.100
I teach middle school kids, and I

51:16.100 --> 51:19.420
wondered some of your philosophies of education.

51:19.420 --> 51:22.060
OK, got the point.

51:22.060 --> 51:25.060
For example, in our city design, we have big lakes.

51:25.060 --> 51:26.460
We've made all these lakes.

51:26.460 --> 51:27.060
They exist.

51:27.060 --> 51:27.940
It's real.

51:27.940 --> 51:30.700
We have modern structures there, all different.

51:30.700 --> 51:33.300
Roxanne said to me, my associate, she said,

51:33.300 --> 51:36.420
I just don't want to draw pretty pictures of buildings.

51:36.420 --> 51:37.460
I want to build them.

51:37.460 --> 51:38.700
I want to make them.

51:38.700 --> 51:40.620
And she did all the cement work.

51:40.620 --> 51:42.300
And one day she came over and she said,

51:42.300 --> 51:43.740
how about a swimming pool?

51:43.740 --> 51:45.140
And she was with a girlfriend.

51:45.180 --> 51:47.060
I said, when do you girls want to start?

51:47.060 --> 51:48.420
Well, we never built a pool.

51:48.420 --> 51:50.900
They built it in two weeks, a beautiful pool.

51:50.900 --> 51:52.700
We'll show you pictures of it.

51:52.700 --> 51:55.780
And so we built a big lake in the city.

51:55.780 --> 51:57.620
And there's a hill in the middle of the lake,

51:57.620 --> 52:00.300
about 80 feet up out of the water.

52:00.300 --> 52:02.100
And on top of the hill is a craft shop

52:02.100 --> 52:04.780
where children can build anything they want to build.

52:04.780 --> 52:06.220
But in order to get there, you've

52:06.220 --> 52:08.060
got to get in a boat and row it.

52:08.060 --> 52:10.380
Instead of lining them up and say, come on, everybody

52:10.380 --> 52:12.740
together, forward, backward now.

52:12.740 --> 52:15.060
Arrange the environment so you have

52:15.100 --> 52:16.700
to row to get to the hill.

52:16.700 --> 52:19.220
You have to climb the hill to get to the craft shop.

52:19.220 --> 52:22.460
And an automobile or anything you build will not go together

52:22.460 --> 52:24.420
unless four children pick up the car

52:24.420 --> 52:25.700
and the others put the wheels on.

52:25.700 --> 52:27.700
Instead of saying, I want you people to work together

52:27.700 --> 52:29.580
and cooperate and stop fighting.

52:29.580 --> 52:32.500
Arrange things so that it works that way.

52:32.500 --> 52:34.500
That's what nature does.

52:34.500 --> 52:38.460
When a fox, a baby fox, sees a porcupine,

52:38.460 --> 52:40.140
it says, we know what have we here.

52:40.140 --> 52:41.300
I don't know.

52:41.300 --> 52:42.700
And he gets close to the porcupine.

52:42.700 --> 52:44.500
Finally, he gets a quill.

52:44.500 --> 52:46.580
And he stays away from the porcupine.

52:46.580 --> 52:48.860
But if you raise your children and try

52:48.860 --> 52:53.340
to avoid experiences that had hurt you

52:53.340 --> 52:56.220
and you buy them every toy that they want,

52:56.220 --> 52:59.940
you produce a blob of jello.

52:59.940 --> 53:04.860
Some degree of challenge, some degree of stress is necessary.

53:04.860 --> 53:09.340
And so we build an environment, try to answer your question,

53:09.340 --> 53:11.540
where the elements so arranged has

53:11.540 --> 53:14.980
to produce what you call creativity.

53:14.980 --> 53:17.740
Can I give you one more bit on that?

53:17.740 --> 53:18.740
All right.

53:18.740 --> 53:22.700
Is there anyone else interested in creativity in children?

53:22.700 --> 53:24.020
You raise your hands?

53:24.020 --> 53:24.940
OK.

53:24.940 --> 53:30.380
What we do is we, I ask a child to make a drawing.

53:30.380 --> 53:31.340
Anything they want to draw.

53:31.340 --> 53:33.100
And this is what they usually do.

53:33.100 --> 53:34.780
Can everybody see the blackboard?

53:34.780 --> 53:36.180
Well, I'll draw it up here.

53:36.180 --> 53:39.180
They draw something like this.

53:39.220 --> 53:41.660
I'm talking about four and five-year-olds.

53:46.140 --> 53:48.300
Then they draw something like this.

53:51.700 --> 53:55.140
And then most of them do something like this.

53:58.340 --> 54:00.540
I'm sure you've all seen those drawings.

54:00.540 --> 54:04.500
In fact, I'm sure many of you draw that way today.

54:04.500 --> 54:06.980
And so the teacher gives them some crayon,

54:06.980 --> 54:09.100
and they color it, and she hangs it up.

54:09.140 --> 54:10.980
This is a little Billy's drawing.

54:10.980 --> 54:15.980
But when she tells Billy that this is the way we spell cat,

54:15.980 --> 54:17.860
and Billy says, I see.

54:17.860 --> 54:20.220
And he comes back with something like this.

54:23.740 --> 54:24.940
Can you see that?

54:24.940 --> 54:26.660
The teacher says, that's wrong.

54:26.660 --> 54:27.860
That isn't wrong.

54:27.860 --> 54:30.100
Most of it is appropriate.

54:30.100 --> 54:32.220
It's just this that we change.

54:32.220 --> 54:34.340
So I say very close.

54:34.340 --> 54:38.980
We just substitute this with something like this.

54:38.980 --> 54:44.500
Then the child comes back again with something like this.

54:44.500 --> 54:47.660
I say much closer, much better.

54:47.660 --> 54:51.660
Only we turn this around so you can put the A inside of it.

54:51.660 --> 54:55.740
Say whatever you have to say to get the idea across.

54:55.740 --> 54:58.900
Instead of saying, well, that isn't what I told you.

54:58.900 --> 55:00.660
Well, all you're just using that child

55:00.660 --> 55:04.340
as an outlet for insufficiency.

55:04.340 --> 55:06.580
Then I do this with the children.

55:06.580 --> 55:10.100
I have them draw the letter T. And I say,

55:10.100 --> 55:12.060
which one of these looked like a peach pit?

55:14.700 --> 55:16.780
The child generally picks this.

55:16.780 --> 55:18.940
I see you, those of you back there,

55:18.940 --> 55:20.660
I'm sure you can't see that.

55:20.660 --> 55:23.220
And the blackboard is fully cluttered.

55:23.220 --> 55:25.060
And I don't have here.

55:25.060 --> 55:27.180
I'll try to clear your head.

55:27.180 --> 55:34.180
Where most of you can see, the child draws a letter T.

55:34.180 --> 55:36.500
And he draws a peach pit in the middle.

55:36.500 --> 55:39.660
Then he draws one peach pit here and one there.

55:39.660 --> 55:42.580
And he takes out the middle peach pit.

55:42.580 --> 55:45.260
Then I say, what is this?

55:45.260 --> 55:47.460
They say, that's a bunch of birdies flying.

55:47.460 --> 55:49.220
It's good.

55:49.220 --> 55:52.420
You move down a peach pit and a half

55:52.420 --> 55:57.140
and draw the letter V upside down.

55:57.140 --> 56:00.340
And the child draws a letter V upside down.

56:00.340 --> 56:05.020
Then he draws a birdie under the V.

56:05.020 --> 56:08.940
One peach pit down like this.

56:08.940 --> 56:12.060
And then he joins another birdie to that and a half

56:12.060 --> 56:15.020
round beneath that and one peach pit above.

56:15.020 --> 56:15.940
He does this.

56:15.940 --> 56:18.540
And then I say to the child, what is this?

56:18.540 --> 56:19.900
That's a hide.

56:19.900 --> 56:21.100
That's good.

56:21.100 --> 56:23.580
Half a hide from the top of the eyebrow

56:23.580 --> 56:25.540
to the bottom of the nose.

56:25.540 --> 56:30.660
And they move from that offensive drawing made by the child

56:30.660 --> 56:35.700
to this in less than a half hour.

56:35.700 --> 56:38.340
And I'm talking about five and six year olds

56:38.340 --> 56:41.500
moving into this realm, drawing sports cars,

56:41.500 --> 56:43.540
turning them around.

56:43.540 --> 56:46.580
And we give them crayon and chalk

56:46.580 --> 56:49.980
because we want them to bring out their artistic ability.

56:49.980 --> 56:53.460
You can't bring out anything if there's no basis

56:53.460 --> 56:55.500
or structure for it.

56:55.500 --> 56:59.220
If you sit in the woods and meditate on your navel

56:59.220 --> 57:02.860
for three years, you'll have a tremendously clear picture

57:02.860 --> 57:06.260
of the navel and nothing more.

57:06.260 --> 57:08.900
So you have to work to get information.

57:08.900 --> 57:12.340
You have to arrange things so that it generates

57:12.340 --> 57:15.660
what you call creativity.

57:15.660 --> 57:18.940
Now a psychologist in one session

57:18.940 --> 57:21.340
said that, well, I know two children that

57:21.340 --> 57:23.180
came from the same environment.

57:23.180 --> 57:24.900
And if environment is everything,

57:24.900 --> 57:27.820
one turned out to be a gangster, the other a minister.

57:27.860 --> 57:31.500
If environment is everything, how do you get those differences?

57:31.500 --> 57:35.380
The minute you pick up one child and start playing with it

57:35.380 --> 57:37.460
and the other stands there with that little,

57:37.460 --> 57:40.020
you're making jealousy and envy.

57:40.020 --> 57:42.180
There's no such thing as the same environment.

57:42.180 --> 57:43.620
So when I pick up my little girl,

57:43.620 --> 57:46.740
I pick up my older little boy.

57:46.740 --> 57:49.140
You never work with one child.

57:49.140 --> 57:51.300
Why can't you keep your area clean?

57:51.300 --> 57:53.100
Your brother does all the time.

57:53.100 --> 57:54.700
You leave all your things around.

57:54.700 --> 57:56.820
Well, when he trips and falls down the stairs,

57:56.860 --> 57:58.620
his brother smiles.

57:58.620 --> 58:00.580
An inhibited smile of course.

58:00.580 --> 58:01.820
But he does smile.

58:01.820 --> 58:05.860
So we build these artificialities

58:05.860 --> 58:07.940
in the world we live in today.

58:07.940 --> 58:10.620
We've got to interfere and change things.

58:10.620 --> 58:12.180
Those of you that would like to know more

58:12.180 --> 58:13.820
about the Venus Project,

58:13.820 --> 58:16.420
we have a video, a tape, and a book

58:16.420 --> 58:21.340
introducing the basic conceptual layout

58:21.340 --> 58:23.220
of what it's about.

58:23.220 --> 58:24.580
Any other questions?

58:24.580 --> 58:26.740
I can't go in in more detail.

58:26.740 --> 58:27.980
Yes?

58:27.980 --> 58:30.500
I find you're curious about the future interest there,

58:30.500 --> 58:33.020
but how do you account for human nature?

58:33.020 --> 58:34.220
How do I account for what?

58:34.220 --> 58:35.220
Human nature.

58:35.220 --> 58:36.820
Human nature.

58:36.820 --> 58:41.820
Human nature is the way people have found

58:42.180 --> 58:46.760
other people to behave over many long years.

58:46.760 --> 58:51.300
They appear to manifest greed, jealousy,

58:51.300 --> 58:53.660
envy, even animals.

58:53.700 --> 58:56.900
If you take a cat and put it on your lap

58:56.900 --> 59:01.020
in the presence of the dog, the dog may growl.

59:02.140 --> 59:04.580
And it's like, oh, that's what I mean

59:04.580 --> 59:07.420
by the nature of the beast.

59:07.420 --> 59:10.580
So I said, come on down to my lab in about a week.

59:10.580 --> 59:12.780
So I picked up my cat, put it on my lap

59:12.780 --> 59:14.780
and the dog says, oh, it's wagging.

59:15.700 --> 59:17.740
Because you reinforce the dog

59:17.740 --> 59:20.180
before you pick up the cat and put it.

59:20.180 --> 59:23.620
The cat is a threat to the dog's security.

59:23.620 --> 59:27.180
The dog wants you to pet it, not the cat.

59:27.180 --> 59:30.860
So you give the dog these ambivalent feelings,

59:30.860 --> 59:32.900
but you can have 15 kids in the room

59:32.900 --> 59:35.300
without jealousy, without envy.

59:35.300 --> 59:37.180
It is not human nature.

59:37.180 --> 59:41.780
It's human behavior that's shaped by culture.

59:41.780 --> 59:45.340
Like I said, if you were brought up in China years ago,

59:45.340 --> 59:47.140
you'd walk with your hands in your sleeves

59:47.140 --> 59:50.140
and shuffle and wear a long pigtail.

59:50.140 --> 59:51.660
And so, well, that's human nature.

59:51.660 --> 59:52.500
That's not.

59:52.500 --> 59:55.700
That's the influence of environment on your behavior.

59:55.700 --> 59:58.620
Dancing is the same thing.

59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.380
Dancers change over time.

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.260
Music changes over time.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.380
So there is really no human nature.

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.300
Think about it, toss it around.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:12.980
There is varying degrees of human behavior.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.900
If we wish to understand the factors

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.340
that generate our value system,

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.980
that generate the way we look at the world,

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:23.780
we have to go back in time and study these things.

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:24.620
I'm sorry again.

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:27.260
I can't go into much more detail,

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:31.340
just a general overview of the Venus Project.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.340
Yes?

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:34.020
You mentioned a universal language.

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:36.100
Are you speaking about something like Esperanto?

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.700
No, that wouldn't do.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.100
Or interlingua?

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.580
No, that wouldn't do.

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:44.060
The language has to have a physical reference.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.900
In other words, that means that,

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:54.180
suppose we took some tungsten and hid it with high-pitched sound,

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.260
and bouncing off that tungsten,

01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:01.820
a pattern occurred on a screen that looked like that.

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.980
Now, this was the nickel, and this is the iron,

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.300
and we learned how to chart that pattern.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:12.300
When you wrote tungsten, you do this in the future.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:17.100
So it's always like chemistry, like a pharmacologist

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:21.060
reads a prescription, assuming the doctor's handwriting is good.

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.860
Look at that prescription, and it turns out the same product.

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:27.220
We don't want individuality in that area.

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.700
We want uniformity.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.260
Is there a place for individuality?

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:36.780
You know, in the next few years, the word individuality

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:42.060
will go the way all the other crude and vulgar terms went.

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:46.100
When you buy a Mercedes, if you can afford it,

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:49.140
and you turn the key, you want it to start, not sometimes,

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.220
all the time.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.220
And when you turn, you want it to turn.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:55.100
And when you put the brakes on, you want it to stop.

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:59.260
So it's called quality control.

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:03.740
Variations in human behavior, which we call individuality

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:07.700
today, is poor quality control.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.900
In the future, the question of people,

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:13.660
then wouldn't everybody be uniform then?

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:15.340
Well, the question of uniformity is such

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.540
and just that they will uniformly,

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:23.140
like anyone they meet, uniformly share ideas and resources,

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:26.260
uniformly share knowledge with everyone else,

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.020
and uniformly courteous with everyone else.

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:31.060
That's the only kind of uniformity.

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:35.460
As far as the accumulation of wealth, property, and power,

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:39.500
this would be considered part of the age of the Bulgarians.

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.060
To us, this is all normal.

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:46.060
This is a thing to do, to become successful.

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:49.740
Well, in my early days, I wanted to be successful,

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.940
and a company came to me and said,

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:54.500
we have a bunch of Mexican women and Indian women

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.700
that sit at a conveyor belt, and they pick the black beans,

01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:00.220
and they pick the white beans, throw them in another box,

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:03.180
and they said, can you improve that?

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.940
I said, how far do you want to go?

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:08.220
How many beans can you deliver?

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.860
So what I did in the early days

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:13.300
is I built a big bicycle wheel with hollow spokes

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:15.100
that turned like an airplane propeller

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:20.580
into a vat of beans, sucking up one bean to each vacuum tube.

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.580
And then there was a photoelectric cell here.

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:25.180
If the bean was black, it tripped it with a wire.

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:27.060
And as you sit and watch, those beans

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:28.820
went up like this in the big vat.

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.900
And in eight hours, we did the work

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.820
that 50 women took three months to do.

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.260
Now, I would like my machines to come in,

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:40.660
but I would like them to get a shorter workday,

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.340
an increase in purchasing power.

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:45.620
If machines do not improve the lives of people

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:47.500
that work in automobile factories,

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.780
if they're automated out of existence,

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:52.980
so will you be automated out of existence.

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.740
All of us can be automated out.

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:59.180
Roxanne recently had some area,

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:02.260
she does architectural rendering, site plans.

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:06.780
There are machines that do that some years ago, CAD.

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.300
There are machines today that make models.

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:13.140
If you take a vase and put it on the table and it's scanned,

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:16.980
they have a laser beam that penetrates the fluid

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:21.300
and solidifies that fluid in the exact shape of that vase.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:24.980
You can do it to England, China, anywhere in the world.

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.780
And I want to repeat this.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:30.420
Machines today, that is three months ago,

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:34.900
could handle 500 trillion bits of information per second.

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:37.380
I don't care how many humans you get together,

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:41.340
there's no place for human behavior in the next 20 years.

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:45.420
There's no place for human participation in the next 20 years,

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:47.340
or maybe less.

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:50.380
No one can predict the future precisely.

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:54.180
I am not gentle, I don't pull my punches, I can't afford it.

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.660
I respect you, I like you too much.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.140
I would rather tell you things as they are,

01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:01.700
not generate additional illusions.
