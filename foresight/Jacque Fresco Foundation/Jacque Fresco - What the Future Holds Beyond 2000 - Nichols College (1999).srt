1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Are any of you people, members of the World Future Society?

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,400
I'm sure most of you heard about the C. Clark.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,280
Will you raise your hands?

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,780
Good.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,880
He said that if he wrote a book that everybody enjoyed

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,120
and understood, he said he wouldn't be saying anything new.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,000
Think about that.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,380
What I'm going to talk about is going to change some of your

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,880
lives, the way you look at yourself and the way you look

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,680
at the world around you.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,580
The subject matter is not the kind of matter to get from

12
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,160
ordinary sources or books.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,760
So I would like your participation in an experiment.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,560
And some of you might be able to tell what it is that I draw

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,300
on the board before I finish.

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,000
And if you know what it is, interrupt.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,340
Say, I got it.

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,820
So I'm going to start.

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,900
Can all of you see the board?

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,740
I don't think I can make it with this.

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,860
Can all of you see the board?

22
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,860
Can you hear me all right?

23
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,500
OK.

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,900
The minute you know what it is, interrupt.

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,260
The same thinking ship, the Titanic.

26
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:31,860
What is it?

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,500
Titanic.

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,780
OK, great.

29
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,260
Now, if he didn't call that, remember, there's no ship

30
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,860
there at all.

31
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,860
There was enough bits for his associative memory to put that

32
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,700
together.

33
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,820
Now, you know that's not a ship.

34
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,980
Now, what is this?

35
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,060
Some of you older people might guess this.

36
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,060
An alarm clock.

37
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,780
Who did that?

38
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,140
You are amazing.

39
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,500
Where's the alarm clock?

40
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,860
Well, anyway, if she wasn't able to call that, I would have

41
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,220
put the legs on it and the clock and Hamilton watch

42
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,740
coming, until somebody called it.

43
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,180
Now, there are still some that cannot see the ship.

44
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,420
So I would have gone all along, put all the windows in,

45
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,940
Titanic, everything, until somebody got up and said,

46
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,740
yeah, Titanic.

47
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:31,700
Well, this is an attempt to prove that all of us are

48
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,860
capable of making decisions and arriving at a conclusion

49
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,540
without all of the information prepared for us.

50
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,860
That is a unique quality in human beings.

51
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,100
We can put things together, and we do not require the

52
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,980
accumulation of a great deal of information.

53
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,220
In this system, if you understand this

54
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,660
quite well, who would you say this is?

55
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,060
Who said that?

56
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,220
Who said that?

57
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,540
Lincoln.

58
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,260
I don't see Lincoln, but it's Lincoln.

59
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,060
It would have been Abraham Lincoln.

60
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,820
When I got filled with it, I would have gone on with a beard

61
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,780
and all of the stuff.

62
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,500
So this is just to prove that people can put something

63
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,940
together, and I'm going to try to explain to you just what

64
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,500
creative thinking really is.

65
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,860
Now, I'm going to use old language, the language that I

66
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,100
use with people who are not familiar with this way of

67
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,020
thinking.

68
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,460
The old language is that people can think and reason.

69
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,060
I do not believe that is possible.

70
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,900
I have many inventions.

71
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,740
I've worked on many different things, but I don't believe

72
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,260
that human beings can think or reason.

73
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,740
This is what I do believe.

74
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,140
By the way, you don't have to accept anything I say.

75
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,380
During the question period, don't be polite.

76
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,220
Come at it from all angles.

77
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,820
Break it down if you can.

78
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,580
This helps me, and it helps you.

79
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,020
So when I talk about thinking and reasoning and putting

80
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,100
things together, we're talking about the forces that shape

81
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,900
human behavior.

82
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:34,460
I believe that all human behavior is lawful, that the

83
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,100
reactions and values that all people have are perfectly

84
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,060
lawful to the environment that they come from.

85
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,860
So every human being is perfectly well adjusted from

86
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,860
where they are coming from, from their background and

87
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,940
experience.

88
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,060
If you as a baby were raised by the Seminole Indians, you

89
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,500
would behave if you never saw anything else like a

90
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,180
Seminole Indian.

91
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,060
And if you were brought up in any other Indian group and you

92
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,900
had feathers in your head, in your head gear, and you were

93
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,780
dancing around the fire, and I walked over and said, that's

94
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,300
ridiculous.

95
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,060
What are you dancing around the fire with the feathers for?

96
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,780
You don't take your hat, throw it on the ground, says

97
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,060
you don't.

98
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,860
I never thought of it that way.

99
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,180
We can't do that.

100
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,940
We're victims of culture.

101
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,380
We look at the world with our background.

102
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,620
We have no other way of doing it.

103
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,820
Psychology is kind of a rudimentary form today, an

104
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,900
attempt to grasp at the factors that shape human

105
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,140
behavior, the factors that are responsible for the way we

106
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,140
look at ourselves, other people, and the way we behave, or

107
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,100
if you wish, misbehave.

108
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,540
I don't believe that any human being misbehaves.

109
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,460
They use whatever tools they know of, whatever tools

110
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,100
they're familiar with.

111
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,780
Language is a tool.

112
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,860
It's someone to show you a picture of an airplane, what

113
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,700
appeared to be an airplane, without wings.

114
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,460
When people look at it and they stand by and they say, it

115
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,700
will never fly.

116
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,940
But they don't say, how do you propose to lift off the

117
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,820
ground without wings?

118
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,020
That's the key to communication.

119
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,140
Now, a very famous scientist deceased now, trying to get

120
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,820
the government and people to put up sufficient funds to

121
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,900
monitor outer space, to try to make contact with extra

122
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,220
terrestrial life.

123
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,460
I want to try to save this to you and think about what I

124
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,900
say, toss it around.

125
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,740
I'm using the old language because you're not that

126
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,540
familiar with these values.

127
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,340
If people or beings or things can travel 100 million

128
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,780
light years through time and space, they are not humanoid.

129
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,700
The storage system for water would occupy miles.

130
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,500
And all of the facilities required by humans would

131
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,820
take up tremendous amounts of space and require

132
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,660
tremendous amounts of energy.

133
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,300
Now, there are people that talk of flying

134
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,100
saucers at the land here on Earth.

135
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,540
And they go to some farmer, and they take him into the

136
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,140
saucer, and they do all kinds of experiments on them.

137
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,500
Now, first of all, people do not travel hundreds of

138
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,500
millions of light years to pick up some farmer and ask him

139
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,940
what kind of suspenders he wears.

140
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,340
Carl Sagan wanted to communicate with extra

141
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,380
terrestrials.

142
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,060
He hoped that they, in turn, would communicate with us.

143
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,300
Now, you know that the Republicans can't communicate

144
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,620
with the Democrats.

145
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,820
You know that husbands and wives have difficulty in

146
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,020
communicating.

147
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,020
Children and parents have difficulty, because the

148
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,460
language we use was designed a long time ago.

149
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,460
And it is inherently difficult to get ideas across in the

150
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,980
language that we use today.

151
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,260
However, when engineers meet and talk, they speak a

152
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,460
different language.

153
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,220
One engineer might present a very thin cable, and says,

154
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,980
this can support 5,000 tons.

155
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,180
And the other engineer says, what's its tensile strength?

156
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,860
And he's given that information.

157
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,580
Then he puts it in a machine.

158
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,860
I don't know whether he knew this.

159
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,180
And he snaps it to make sure that it holds for that.

160
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:42,620
When engineers design an airplane, they do all the

161
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,940
calculations.

162
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,700
This is a very rapid drawing of a

163
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,740
front view of an airplane.

164
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,660
They do all the rapid calculations, and they figure

165
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,860
what that wing will be able to support.

166
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,340
And after all their calculations, and after

167
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,020
they're certain, they then pile sandbags on the wing.

168
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,060
Did you know that?

169
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:09,500
Until it breaks off to make damn sure that it does the job.

170
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,900
Now, that does not exist in everyday language.

171
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,900
In everyday language, you don't have that ability.

172
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,580
When an engineer meets another engineer, he says, I can

173
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,620
illuminate an area with this tiny point of light that has

174
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,140
50,000 square feet.

175
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,940
The engineer says, well, that's not possible.

176
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,820
He doesn't talk like that.

177
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,940
He says, how do you power that unit?

178
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,460
What kind of voltage does it take?

179
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,780
How do you illuminate that spot?

180
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,220
They ask questions.

181
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,900
The average person, yeah, nah, not in a thousand years.

182
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,940
That's been around for a long time.

183
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,060
That is a language of war, of hatred, of bigotry, of

184
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,500
prejudice, the inability to ask questions.

185
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,540
And we've got to be very careful about that.

186
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,940
And at one lecture I remember at Princeton, I was trying to

187
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,300
say that human beings cannot think or reason, because of

188
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,540
psychology, department, and sociology.

189
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,540
Well, one of the individuals stood up, one of the staff,

190
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,780
and he said, all right, where did the camera come from?

191
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,780
There were no cameras at one time.

192
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,540
Someone had to think about a camera.

193
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,900
He just doesn't come out of the thin air.

194
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,860
And after doing a lot of work, many years ago, in ancient

195
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,060
Egypt, or if you live out in the country, or have lived

196
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,980
out in the country, if there was a hole in the barn wall,

197
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,900
that is, a knot was knocked out, the cows on the outside

198
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,820
appeared on the wall of the barn, upside down.

199
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,380
And in Egypt, you went in this dome to see the upside down

200
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,420
world.

201
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,780
There was a little hole here, and the daylight came in, and

202
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,740
you saw people walking upside down on the wall.

203
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,260
How many of you have experienced that kind of

204
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,300
phenomenon?

205
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,260
That is essentially the box-hole camera.

206
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,380
A camera, the simple camera without a lens, there's just

207
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,540
a little hole in the box.

208
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,220
And somebody said, well, how can I see that image?

209
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,340
And they used a transparent membrane back here, and they

210
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,500
could see the upside down head, or a person, or a cow.

211
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,420
And they asked this question, if only I can retain that

212
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,340
image?

213
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,780
Well, that isn't the answer.

214
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,100
That's just a question.

215
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,380
I wonder how I could retain that image.

216
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,980
So years before that, the American Indians and other

217
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:41,460
primitives have taken tappercloth, or they'd weave

218
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,700
natural materials into a kind of a fabric.

219
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,220
And then they would take berry juices and

220
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,980
dye it different colors.

221
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,620
Sometimes a leaf would fall upon that surface, and after

222
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,580
the sun dried it, they had an image of the leaf.

223
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:03,500
So they began to use dyes from this background, that all

224
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,620
human beings, to understand the better, the first human

225
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,580
being that jumped off a precipice with wings, he

226
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,700
died.

227
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,300
And his brother-in-law wrote, next time, make the wings

228
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,660
larger.

229
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,940
No one starts out right away and solves a problem, unless

230
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,740
you have a tremendous background in many different

231
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,820
areas.

232
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,580
Well, the next guy that jumped off, he jumped off of the

233
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,820
larger wings.

234
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,700
And he flew a little, and then they went, and the old

235
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,020
fisherman said, you've got to brace them wings, like a

236
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,020
boat, like a man.

237
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,780
They're not going to hold, so they braced it.

238
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,740
And then they jumped off the precipice, this individual,

239
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,060
and he flew, and he hit a tree.

240
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,740
And he hurt his leg real badly.

241
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,220
And his wife said, you know, John, a fish has a

242
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,820
rudder, good point.

243
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,660
And they stuck the rudder on the airplane.

244
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,780
No one ever sat down and invented a television set, an

245
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,940
airplane, the electric light, wireless, none of that came

246
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,740
about by men walking in deep concentration.

247
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,900
And then, through some ethereal substance, bingo, the

248
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,300
idea is formulated.

249
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,140
It doesn't work that way.

250
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,540
It's hard work.

251
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,820
And I make more mistakes than anybody I know, because I

252
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,020
try more things.

253
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,980
There's nothing wrong with building something, and

254
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,940
finding out that it doesn't work.

255
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,100
This is where you get your experience.

256
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,500
There's nothing wrong with criticism.

257
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,980
I remember the first model airplanes that I built went

258
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,460
nosing into the ground, and I was ashamed of them.

259
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,700
And a young engineer told me that my center of gravity had

260
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,300
to be corrected.

261
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,140
That is, move the wing forward.

262
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:59,020
And so all of us stand on the shoulders of one another, and

263
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,780
we shape the future.

264
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,620
Another question that was asked, well, somebody had to

265
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,940
invent the bow and arrow.

266
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,420
Somebody had to think of it.

267
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,500
It just didn't come out of nowhere.

268
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,420
Well, I talked to many Indians, and after talking to many

269
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:17,620
Indians, this is when I found out that Indians used to skin

270
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,060
animals, and this is a lousy drawing of the skin of an

271
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,340
animal stretched out in the sun.

272
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,380
When the Indians got back, the skin was half the size.

273
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,340
It shrunk and became thicker.

274
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,100
And they didn't like that at all.

275
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,660
So they cut leather into strips, thin strips.

276
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,980
And they took an existing frame, and they tied that skin

277
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,780
to the frame.

278
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,860
Something you may have seen this, was lace of leather,

279
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,500
all in one, to prevent it from shrinking.

280
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
But when they cut the strips of leather and put them out in

281
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,740
the sun, they shrunk and became fat and short.

282
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,220
And they were just pleased with that.

283
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,540
After many, many years, one Indian tied that strand of

284
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,900
leather to a piece of wood, a stick.

285
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,900
He split the top, tied it up, and tied the leather to the

286
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,500
stick.

287
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,860
When he came back, hoping that it would dry and not shrink,

288
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,900
the stick took this form.

289
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,180
It was bent.

290
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,780
He plucked that in and went, bong, now.

291
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,940
And after many years, somebody took another piece of wood,

292
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,380
put it in and pulled the string, and off it went.

293
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,460
Well, if man can't think or reason, where did the movie

294
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,460
camera come from?

295
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,500
Somebody had to think of that.

296
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,100
It doesn't exist out there.

297
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,220
Well, here's where it came from.

298
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,620
Many, many years ago, thousands of years ago in China,

299
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,380
they used to take a candle, and they'd take some bamboo

300
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,460
paper at the time, and put it in front of the candle.

301
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,820
And then they'd cut out a little figurine of a human

302
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,220
being, and put the candle behind it.

303
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,060
And as the candle undulated, the little person would dance,

304
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,380
and they'd play music.

305
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,020
That was the beginning.

306
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,300
How did that happen?

307
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,540
Some guy had a candle in the piece of paper, and he was

308
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,700
just happened to be behind it, and his finger appeared to

309
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,260
move on the screen.

310
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,460
And so he extracted or built upon that phenomena.

311
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,460
Then later, there's something interesting occurring.

312
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,980
The Chinese used to take these tremendous scrolls and

313
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,860
open them up.

314
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,100
Well, they then later taped, or they wired, or they used

315
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,300
gut and tied many pages together and built a kind of a

316
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,260
pad.

317
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,340
But in order to get to a particular page, the oriental

318
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:45,300
would mark the corner of the page so that they can find

319
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,580
with a symbol.

320
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,980
And as you flip through the pages fast, that little dot

321
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,220
would jump all over the place.

322
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,220
Well, years later, an individual drew various

323
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,540
successive pictures of a bird in flight, and put them down

324
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,940
in the corner of the paper and flipped it.

325
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,740
And the little bird wings began to move up and down.

326
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,980
Well, a Frenchman saw that, and he took little pieces of

327
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,220
cardboard, and he put them in a circular pattern.

328
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,700
I'm going to try to get it down as quickly as I can.

329
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,740
And he put a crank up here that you turn, and the little

330
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,180
pictures would go around in a circle.

331
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,020
And the Chinese had something like this also, and they had

332
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,220
a bamboo interrupter that would just hold the picture for

333
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,420
a few seconds, a second, less than a second, as you turned

334
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,460
it, a man appeared to move across the screen.

335
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,860
Well, the Frenchman machined that out of brass, did a

336
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,900
beautiful job, and when you turned the crank, the person

337
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,700
walked with smoother motions rather than these abrupt

338
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,100
motions.

339
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,820
Edison saw that unit that the Frenchman designed, and he

340
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,860
turned it into this position.

341
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,180
I guess I can't work with that microphone.

342
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,220
Can you hear me back there?

343
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,500
Is there an OK?

344
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:08,980
OK.

345
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:22,660
And what happened is he turned it into a vertical position, and

346
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:29,700
all the pictures were set in a circular fashion, and you turned

347
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,180
the crank here.

348
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,060
Excuse me.

349
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,660
They won't get the audio on the camera.

350
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

351
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,180
Why don't you just put it in your pocket or something?

352
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,980
Oh, it's fine.

353
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,980
Or hook it to your wrist.

354
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,100
Thanks.

355
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,900
Roxanne is my associate.

356
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,140
She works on all the buildings and all the things that we've

357
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,940
developed in the Venus Project, which I'll talk to you

358
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,300
about later.

359
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,580
And Edison purchased this, put a magnifying glass in front of

360
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,940
it, and you put a nickel in, and you turned the crank, and

361
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,380
you saw people moving.

362
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,860
A bunch of still photographs.

363
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,580
It was a long, slow process.

364
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,260
Nobody, no individual, invented the camera.

365
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,020
A little bit here, a little there, added to that, and

366
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,460
eventually the Wright brothers read about experimental

367
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,380
aircraft, where thousands of people died trying to develop

368
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,300
a flying machine.

369
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,460
And after picking up bits of this information, including

370
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,260
man-carrying kites from China thousands of years ago, and

371
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,620
they built the first flying machine.

372
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,420
They were called the father of flight.

373
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,420
Again, there's no father of anything.

374
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,060
You may take an idea so far, you add to it, and

375
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,380
gradually it's built up.

376
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,540
A genius, a genius is a person that has been exposed to

377
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,300
many different systems, and therefore they can come up

378
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,180
with a wide range of solutions.

379
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,020
A man like Leonardo da Vinci, you think that he just

380
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,500
evolved out of nothing?

381
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,060
He spoke to people that were interested in mechanics in

382
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,900
his time.

383
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,540
They gathered and they shared ideas, but you only hear of

384
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,460
da Vinci.

385
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:14,980
Unfortunately, guys like Nikolai Tesla, Edison, all the

386
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,140
great innovators of the past have been influenced by

387
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,940
other people.

388
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,620
And the mythical structures that we build around inventors

389
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,780
that they inherit special abilities.

390
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,420
They are geniuses, or they're in tune with the infinite

391
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:33,020
mind, and the ideas somehow filter in.

392
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,060
Well, this is a kind of nonsense.

393
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,220
It's the same story about, is there intelligent life out

394
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,500
there?

395
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,580
The real question is, is there intelligent life here?

396
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,780
We don't think so, not yet.

397
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,020
I'm serious, I'm not kidding.

398
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,420
What is intelligence?

399
00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:00,020
Well, the ability to reason things out, you can't have

400
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,580
that ability unless you've had experience in particular

401
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,540
areas.

402
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:10,140
An eskimo never dreams, I repeat this, of walking on a

403
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,340
palm-fringed beach.

404
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,380
Can you understand that?

405
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,300
It is not possible, unless he has seen motion pictures or

406
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,460
something about the beach.

407
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,140
It is not possible for any human being to build a frame of

408
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,020
reference of any kind without experience.

409
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,500
I know where every invention I ever made came from.

410
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,500
I know the influence, the books I've read, the people I've

411
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,700
known, everything that shaped those values.

412
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,500
And sometimes people say, well, when did you think of that?

413
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,940
Wonderful idea.

414
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,420
It was in February the first.

415
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,100
Now, it's cumulative bits of information that we put

416
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,220
together with experience.

417
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,460
So all of the artificial structures and

418
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,700
artificiality of all societies, they are all primitive

419
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,500
today.

420
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,980
They are all backward, the very fact that we use

421
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,700
political systems, the very fact that there are Democrats

422
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,660
and Republicans and notions about how the

423
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,380
world ought to be governed.

424
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,980
Now, scientists could not do a thing with that.

425
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,500
If you want to put a man on the moon, you have to know what

426
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,620
the distance is precisely.

427
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,460
You have to know how much material you're lifting up

428
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,260
toward the moon.

429
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,140
You have to know how much force a human body can stand.

430
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,260
Well, to start with, they don't have that information.

431
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,740
So they build special devices, a big centrifuge.

432
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,580
They put a human being in it, and they whirl it around.

433
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,020
They say, how are you doing?

434
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,580
And the guy conks out.

435
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,980
And they say, well, this is how fast you can rotate

436
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,660
certain groups of people.

437
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,620
And they build data.

438
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:55,020
And from that data, they plan the moon voyage.

439
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:00,780
The question then is, what kind of world do we want?

440
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,300
How is it that we want our social system to operate?

441
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,260
What makes criminal behavior?

442
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,580
What are the factors that make a Jeffrey Dahmer?

443
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,100
I'm sure you know who that was.

444
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,340
Before Jeffrey, there was Albert Fish.

445
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,100
I don't know if any of you remember Albert Fish.

446
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,140
Albert Fish was a fine-looking gentleman.

447
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,900
He ate 45 children.

448
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,100
Well, you wonder, how can anyone do that kind of thing?

449
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,100
I'm going to try to give you some idea of the background

450
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,260
of Albert Fish.

451
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,500
When he was a youngster, about 10 years old,

452
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,900
he was touching his private parts.

453
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,740
His mother was an old-time Baptist.

454
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,060
And she says, you are going straight to hell.

455
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,980
You will burn eternally.

456
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,100
And that kid, Albert Fish, stuck needles into his genitals

457
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,340
because he didn't want to burn in hell.

458
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,660
And he took other children into empty lots

459
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,740
and cut off their private parts because he

460
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,420
wanted to save them.

461
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,540
If you're brought up in a distorted environment, which

462
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,660
we all live in today, any judge that wraps the gavel

463
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,620
and says, 30 years is an ignoramus

464
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,460
because he has no idea of the factors that

465
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,380
shape human behavior.

466
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,060
When you become aware, if you bring up a healthy boy

467
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,980
with about six women, and one of the girls says,

468
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,980
oh, did I see a gorgeous hat?

469
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,740
That boy will pick up the same mannerisms,

470
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,260
same facial expressions, and say, oh, I just love that hat.

471
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,060
Because if that's the environment

472
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,740
that you brought up in Italy, you say, hey, what's the matter?

473
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,140
You like or you don't like?

474
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,740
In other words, it depends on the way you brought up.

475
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,780
Did you know that Lincoln was Irish?

476
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,980
It depends on your group and the values that you exchange.

477
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,020
And if you want a world without war, without hatred,

478
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,380
without crime, without stupidity,

479
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,700
it can be arranged if you follow this bit.

480
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,340
If we consider at some time, which society will,

481
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,020
at a later time, I hope it would be sooner,

482
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,540
that all of the earth become the common heritage

483
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,700
of all nations, all of the resource of the earth,

484
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,580
the common heritage of all nations.

485
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,460
And if you believe in God, if you

486
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,300
understand the teachings of all religions,

487
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,940
there are no property lines in heaven, no banks,

488
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,780
no personal positions in which one person is elevated

489
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,660
above another.

490
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,020
That if the earth were the common heritage of all nations

491
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,100
and all of the artificial boundaries

492
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,780
removed that separate people, there'd

493
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:49,700
be no basis for war, no basis for armament.

494
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,420
The world you live in is an old world.

495
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,100
It's language.

496
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,820
It's old.

497
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,460
Its values are old.

498
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,900
And our institutions of education

499
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,820
fail to touch the social system.

500
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,580
You want to be careful.

501
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,540
Don't touch that.

502
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:05,260
This is an area that you don't want to get involved in.

503
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:09,020
Well, in order for you to grow, in order

504
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,020
for you to make the world a better place,

505
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,900
you have to face this situation.

506
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,060
I don't say that people are going to sit back and do that.

507
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,900
According to all historical records,

508
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,300
no civilization, anyway, to my knowledge,

509
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,940
has ever sit back to plan the future.

510
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,340
Exactly what we're going to do, how we're going to live,

511
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,100
how we're going to work out transportation.

512
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,060
Now, we just build highways all over the place.

513
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,780
Although you go to school and you learn something,

514
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,860
you learn that a straight line is the shortest distance

515
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,540
between two given points.

516
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,660
Well, look at a roadmap of the United States.

517
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:51,420
And I think you'll find spaghetti all over the place.

518
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,500
Rarely do you see that.

519
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Look at your cities, every building

520
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,340
of different size and shape.

521
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,940
This does not express individuality.

522
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,740
It's a chaos.

523
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,540
At four o'clock, all the cars come out of this building,

524
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,860
and they can't get across that bridge.

525
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,700
So you've got to build another bridge.

526
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,500
So you elect people to political office

527
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,300
that are totally incompetent.

528
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,780
They are neutrally bankrupt.

529
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,340
I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican.

530
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,140
They don't have the value system

531
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,980
to solve these problems that exist.

532
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,300
They are not educated in that way.

533
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,980
They are brought up with a uniform set of values.

534
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,860
And they go out into the world.

535
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,260
And this was a sad story of coming events.

536
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,980
There are computers today.

537
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,140
There are machines in existence today

538
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:48,740
that can handle 500 trillion bits of information per second.

539
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,500
No human comes anywhere near that.

540
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,580
And you think that in the next 15 or 20 years,

541
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,740
there's going to be people in government?

542
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,540
No way.

543
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,860
For example, if you took a group of computers

544
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,420
and arranged them in a special fashion

545
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,180
and ran the electrical tentacles out

546
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:12,380
to the agricultural belt with probes into the soil,

547
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,020
when the water table dropped, that

548
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,100
would turn on the pumps and bring the water into the area.

549
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,180
If the nutrients changed, it would pump nutrients

550
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,300
into the area.

551
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,220
What kind of world do you want?

552
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,460
I don't think any of you here, maybe a few of you,

553
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,620
might remember when human beings used to operate elevators.

554
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,900
They'd turn to crank.

555
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,780
They'd never quite got to the floor, up and down.

556
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,060
Finally, they became automated.

557
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:36,980
Step back.

558
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,380
It's a lovely day today.

559
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,860
How are you, Mr. Jones?

560
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,460
If they scan your face.

561
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,860
And they'll take you exactly to that floor.

562
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,980
After that comes the transveyor.

563
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,340
An elevator moves up and down sideways, all directions.

564
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,300
You get on it and verbalize, I want

565
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,540
to go to the art center, music center,

566
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,100
and it'll take you there.

567
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,540
The kind of world you live in and the automobiles that

568
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,180
exist as transportation units are dangerous,

569
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:08,700
because they have a bumper in front and one in the back.

570
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,140
And I'm sure that if an extraterrestrial visited

571
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,020
the earth, they'd say, what are those shiny things in front

572
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,700
and back of the vehicle?

573
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,700
Well, they're bumpers.

574
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,420
They don't prevent damage.

575
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,580
Well, don't you have the head on the side?

576
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,020
Why aren't the bumper all around the car?

577
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,900
And then they came with the airbag.

578
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,820
And they put an airbag in front of you.

579
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,100
If you get hit on the side, your head

580
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,140
goes right through the glass.

581
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,900
They had a long time to appeal to companies,

582
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,260
a long time to solve those problems.

583
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,100
And then you see motorcycle policemen pull over.

584
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,060
What do you think you're doing?

585
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,700
All you have to do in a car, if you wanted to,

586
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,220
I wouldn't do it.

587
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,940
I wouldn't even put this in a car.

588
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:51,980
Just put a sort of a chimograph or a cylindrical recorder.

589
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,140
When you go through a 30-mile-an-hour zone to 50-mile-an-hour,

590
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,660
it's recorded on there.

591
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,260
And every month, you have to tear that strip out of your car

592
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,740
and mail it into the police department.

593
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,460
Well, the police wouldn't like that.

594
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,180
But how many violations do you think you'd have?

595
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,460
There are better ways than that.

596
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,340
You just make a car intelligent.

597
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,260
Well, here's what that means.

598
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,540
How intelligent can machine be?

599
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,700
Well, if you took a little gadget called a pressure

600
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,980
transducer, if you squeeze it, it generates electricity.

601
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,020
So let's put one in each tire.

602
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,980
And let's say that you kick the front-right tire.

603
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,460
It goes to a recording says, ouch, my front-right tire.

604
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,340
Now, of course, if you kick any tire, it'll verbalize.

605
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,740
But if you kick it hard, it'll say ouch, my front-right tire.

606
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,380
And if you kick it again, it'll say, who do you think you are?

607
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,620
Do you want to give a machine feelings?

608
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:53,140
Do you want to give a machine compassion, love, warmth?

609
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,420
I'll tell you why they leave it out of machines,

610
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,220
because it doesn't work.

611
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,020
Human emotions that you learn are the most significant

612
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:05,780
and most important differences between men and machines.

613
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,220
Human emotions are very touchy subject.

614
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,500
It's like racing your engine at a stop light.

615
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,300
It doesn't take you anywhere.

616
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,260
It doesn't serve any purpose.

617
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,860
If you get a lump in your throat when

618
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,700
you see hungry people, that's emotional.

619
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,420
But when you increase the agricultural yield per acre,

620
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,820
that's caring.

621
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,060
That's love.

622
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:31,700
Love is transforming all of the verbal and paper

623
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,580
proclamations to a way of life.

624
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,060
The shameful thing about our century

625
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:42,340
is that there was only one Edison, one Louis Pasteur,

626
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,220
one Nikolai Tesla, one Madame Curie.

627
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,900
We should have had thousands of them, and we will.

628
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,940
Once we get rid of the artificial boundaries

629
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,700
that separate people, once we get rid of nationalism,

630
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:02,300
patriotism, again, I do not mean to offend anybody.

631
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,460
All that I ask you to do is think about this,

632
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,500
toss it around.

633
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,380
This is what the Venus Project advocates.

634
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:15,100
The Venus Project is a design for culture

635
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,220
in which we bridge the difference between all nations.

636
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,660
How is that done by a universal language, the blueprint?

637
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,140
If you open a blueprint in Japan,

638
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,500
they know what you're talking about.

639
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,260
If you write a prescription for England, Japan, France,

640
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,220
the pharmacologist understands that.

641
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,900
There's no discrepancies.

642
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,420
There's no ambivalence.

643
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,220
I wonder what he meant by that.

644
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,660
It's clear the language we use daily is not.

645
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:48,020
The language of warmth and love are verbal excuses

646
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,760
and verbal outlets for some people,

647
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,620
for avoiding their responsibility

648
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,220
to make the world a better place for everyone.

649
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,300
The smarter your kids are, the richer my life.

650
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,220
Every kid on corner shooting up drugs, going nowhere,

651
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,420
you're going to have to pay for in the future.

652
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:12,460
Therefore, it is efficient and functionally selfish

653
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,420
to build a better world for everyone.

654
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,420
If you try to do it, people come to me all the time

655
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,500
and they say, can you design a city with a wall high enough

656
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,100
so when the U2K problem comes

657
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,580
or the system breaks down or the banks fail,

658
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,340
we will be protected.

659
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,940
I say, sure I can design that,

660
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,380
but there are people that'll drive by

661
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,740
with launching mechanisms right over your little wall.

662
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,060
There's no place you can hide.

663
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,620
We have 25 acres, people call it Eden too.

664
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,060
Beautiful.

665
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,300
But if the bottom falls out of this culture,

666
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,660
there will be people at my front gate with children.

667
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,540
How about some food just for the kids?

668
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,060
The next day, 50 people.

669
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,660
Everything looks solid to you.

670
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,980
Everything looks solid and stable

671
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,740
and the future looks promising.

672
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,460
But here's the truth.

673
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,580
I have seen an XY plotter,

674
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,540
that is a machine that moves in three dimensions.

675
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,860
They put a scalpel in that machine

676
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,340
and an x-ray of a brain tumor.

677
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,900
And this machine removed the brain tumor on a cadaver

678
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,940
in about one-tenth the time.

679
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,740
And doctors think, oh, just the industrial work

680
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,220
on the production line, he's on the way out,

681
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,420
but not me, I can think.

682
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,220
Let me say this again.

683
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,260
The typewriters that work the speech,

684
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,260
today you talk, you compute it and you get a type

685
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:35,900
and also correct your English, restructures your sentences,

686
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,300
makes recommendations.

687
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,980
How much longer do you think people are going to be

688
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,700
in positions in industry and government

689
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,820
making their own decisions?

690
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,540
We don't believe that anyone ought to make decisions.

691
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,580
We believe that people ought to arrive at decisions.

692
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,340
And here's what that means.

693
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,300
You go across the country and pick up samples of the soil

694
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,540
all over the nation.

695
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,580
You bring it to central agriculture,

696
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,020
analyze that soil, and then turn to your health department

697
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,660
and ask them what people need, manganese,

698
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,980
whatever they need, and what is this soil good for?

699
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,140
What should we grow, tomatoes,

700
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,660
and then rotate the crop, move to something else?

701
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,700
That's what I mean by surveying the conditions.

702
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,180
Not what's your opinion, what's your opinion?

703
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:28,100
Democracy is a crude and voter system

704
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,100
and should have been phased out centuries ago.

705
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,060
But we don't have enough outside points of view

706
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,460
on radio and television.

707
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,660
When I talked this way on the Larry King show,

708
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,540
he said to me, just a minute,

709
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,260
I depend on those people that you're attacking.

710
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,460
I wasn't attacking the automobile companies.

711
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,020
I just said that if you did that, it would be safer.

712
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,940
If you put proximity units on automobiles,

713
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,780
most of you have them in your home now,

714
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,980
when you walk over the building, the light goes on.

715
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,580
That's a proximity unit.

716
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,820
Put that in your car, and if you're backing up

717
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,900
and a child is crawling behind you, it stops,

718
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,540
no matter how much you step on the gas.

719
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,860
I don't want any signs slippery when wet.

720
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,060
I want an abrasive put in the highway

721
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:15,540
and take that sign down, so it's not slippery when wet.

722
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,420
I don't want to say to kids, stay away from drugs.

723
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,900
I want to make life so interesting for people

724
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,340
that they don't want drugs.

725
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,380
They don't want to dull their senses.

726
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,180
They want to become keen,

727
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,540
and they want to become fully aware,

728
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:34,300
I'm using older language and conscious of their surroundings.

729
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,580
It is painful to deaden your awareness

730
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,460
when life is beautiful,

731
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,580
when what you do goes out to people

732
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,560
and makes their lives better.

733
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,460
In one session at Princeton,

734
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,780
I changed the values of many people.

735
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,260
They walked out discussing this for years thereafter,

736
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,500
and I still get letters today.

737
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,980
I went into an area of New York called Hell's Kitchen.

738
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,420
The kids there were considered very bad, bad.

739
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,260
And the social worker used to wear a necktie and eyeglasses.

740
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,740
And anyone that wore eyeglasses when I was a kid was a sissy.

741
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,220
And when you wear a necktie and a suit,

742
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,640
and you're talking to these kids that rags in the slums,

743
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,900
they look at you as an outsider, you're unacceptable to them.

744
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,260
So I put a wire recorder out in the front office.

745
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,980
And after the social worker talked to the young boy,

746
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,060
by the way, they made guns out of water pipe in New York.

747
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,140
How many of you knew that?

748
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,100
They didn't go and buy guns, they made them.

749
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,660
And the social worker picked the gun out,

750
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,460
he said, you're gonna take someone's eye hour,

751
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,100
wind up in a state penitentiary,

752
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,340
hurt your brother and father, you wanna do that?

753
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,420
Well, the kid says nothing at all.

754
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,420
Now, when the kid walks out,

755
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,180
I make a wire recording of the way he talks to his friend.

756
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,340
And he said, joy, the guy up front, the social worker.

757
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,500
Then I walk over to the store,

758
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,100
how'd you make out with Johnny?

759
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,620
I had a good talk with the boy.

760
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,420
I believe we established rapport.

761
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,340
How do you know that?

762
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,220
He says, I felt it intuitively.

763
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,580
Then I play the tape.

764
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,340
By the way, it was a wire recorder.

765
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,140
I play the tape of the kid's answers.

766
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,300
And he says, I'm grateful so-and-so.

767
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,580
I said, no, no, just say, I don't know how to get to Johnny.

768
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,900
I know how to get to Billy.

769
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,300
I tried eight different methods, none of them worked.

770
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,260
So I said, what's when I do next week?

771
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,660
I walked in the office, picked up the gun,

772
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,660
and I said, I understand you made this gun.

773
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,860
He said, I told the guy I made it last week.

774
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,100
This is in New York City.

775
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,220
I used to make recordings of this.

776
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,980
I wanted to use it in a film later.

777
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,340
And I picked up the gun, I'm looking at it,

778
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,980
and I'm shaking my head.

779
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,540
He said, what's the matter with it?

780
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,060
Let's come in.

781
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,220
The damn pin is an eighth of an inch off center.

782
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,740
He says, yeah.

783
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,900
And I said, if you put a couple of washers on the side,

784
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,180
you can move the pin right on center.

785
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,180
He said, hey, do you like here?

786
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,660
I said, what, with those jerks?

787
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,500
Nah!

788
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,140
Can I bring my friends over to meet you?

789
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:05,220
That's people like him with similar values.

790
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,660
Then you go to work in their terms, not your terms.

791
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,860
Real psychology has to be related to the real world,

792
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,660
not theory, not lab experiments in schools

793
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,580
where you're not in touch with people,

794
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,580
where you don't get the feel of people,

795
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:26,380
where you don't get the sense of their identification

796
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,980
with the world around them.

797
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,140
I have changed many of those kids.

798
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,100
And I brought a gun in for them to look at,

799
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,740
and I said, I made this gun.

800
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,260
Wow, they said.

801
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,700
I sure would like to be able to make a gun like that.

802
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,340
That's why I can help you do it.

803
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,900
You can, or what do I have to do?

804
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,980
I have to learn how to draw a front view of a gun,

805
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,540
a side view of a gun.

806
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,860
I know I'm going fast and there are a lot of drawings.

807
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,660
You have to make three views to the gun so it can be made.

808
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,180
He said, you know, I'm gonna learn to do that.

809
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,260
So I set them up on a drafting table

810
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,380
and I took them from guns to water skis to other things.

811
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,340
Today a lot of them are engineering draftsmen.

812
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,180
Because they told me that the kids,

813
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,340
they only had an IQ of 24, so you can't get to them.

814
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,180
Well, I said to one of these kids with an IQ of 24,

815
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,460
suppose you wanted to rob that jewelry store across the way.

816
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,380
How would you go about it?

817
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,260
Any way at all.

818
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,260
Well, I said I'd throw a bag of fecal matter in there

819
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,940
and the guy gets mad at my friend,

820
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,540
he runs there and I clean off the counter.

821
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,180
That's where they live.

822
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,180
I suppose you wanted to rob the third story,

823
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,260
no ladders, no ropes, no weights.

824
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,300
How would you get up to the third story?

825
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,180
Well, after several days,

826
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,900
one of the youngsters came up with a piece of wood.

827
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,780
He didn't even know what a wedge was.

828
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,860
You see that hunk of wood?

829
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,220
I can stick in the bricks and it gets tight,

830
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,740
no matter how far the bricks are, one another.

831
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,420
And I can climb up to God, he didn't use that language.

832
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,060
He was much, much stronger language.

833
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,980
I climb up the building and take whatever I want to take.

834
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,420
That's how I do it.

835
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,380
Well, how do you give people an IQ test

836
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,060
to come from a different environment?

837
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,060
How do you know what they sense?

838
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,620
Do you think that the formalist

839
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,580
who tries to structure the nature of intelligence,

840
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,780
the nature of creativity,

841
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,780
without being creative, can do it?

842
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,740
Well, in order to teach children how to become creative,

843
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:34,780
I make a Martian out of rubber with eyes on tentacles

844
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,380
and a pointed rear end.

845
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,340
And they look at it and they think eh,

846
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,660
and I say to them what good are three eyes

847
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,260
or four eyes on tentacles?

848
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,460
Eventually, we need to look at the back, the front,

849
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,620
the side, the top at the same time.

850
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,740
And one of the guys had six arms.

851
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,340
Well, he can shave, read a book, eat a donut,

852
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:58,060
and drink coffee instead of eh, as we're brought up.

853
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,900
If you met a Martian, they had an opening out there.

854
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,660
So what's that?

855
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,100
Notice the attitude?

856
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,300
What is that?

857
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,700
Well, if we eat anything that's bad for us,

858
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,860
it's ejected right away, not in your system.

859
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,780
It goes through your whole system.

860
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,340
So you're taught in medical school

861
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,900
how wonderful the human body is,

862
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,300
how wonderful it is.

863
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,740
This isn't true at all.

864
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,820
That you're indoctrinated to a set of values that are unreal.

865
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,660
And in order for me to get these ideas out there,

866
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,980
it's extremely difficult because we need films,

867
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,620
we need equipment in order to do that.

868
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,700
What the Venus Project has to offer is a way of life

869
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,020
without ambiguity, a language

870
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,620
that has a much more precise form of communication,

871
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,420
to change the relationship between people

872
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:54,260
where the male and female are not given separate roles,

873
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,100
where the females say,

874
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,340
I want to be a biochemist or a physicist,

875
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,700
and she goes that way.

876
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,460
When you hand a girl a doll, you're placing a set,

877
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,460
you're beginning to manipulate the people.

878
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,340
Everybody's afraid of controlling human behavior.

879
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,660
You're always controlling behavior.

880
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,340
When you pick up your little girl

881
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,340
and say, don't play with that little Lutheran boy

882
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,780
across the way, and you put him down again,

883
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,740
or don't talk to that little Catholic girl

884
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,580
across the way.

885
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,740
Well, you're always indoctrinating children.

886
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,340
Who loves you more than anything in the world?

887
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,780
The candy store man.

888
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,020
No, your mommy and your daddy.

889
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,900
Say, indoctrination continuously.

890
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,420
And then all of us together sing,

891
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,380
we are free, let's go, we are free.

892
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,820
So beware whenever you hear of freedom

893
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,980
and all that sort of thing, watch out.

894
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,420
Because a real free society,

895
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,500
the closest I've ever come to it was in Polynesia.

896
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,780
I lived in the South Pacific Islands for a while,

897
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,700
and the natives gave me bananas and coconuts.

898
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,260
They were very generous, and they had no words for work.

899
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,940
Would you believe that?

900
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,660
They went fishing all day, they played, they had Lew house.

901
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,260
And they said, junk, you know, what you want?

902
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:08,420
And I said, well, I would like an outrigger canoe,

903
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,740
and they built one for me.

904
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,940
A few days after they brought it to my hut,

905
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,900
I heard some rustling outside,

906
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,380
and they were all carrying the canoe away.

907
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,620
I said, what's going on?

908
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,740
You know use.

909
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,820
It was a different value system.

910
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,620
Now, the men and women walked around nude on the island

911
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,380
when I got it a long time ago.

912
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:33,860
And I never saw a native, poke another native,

913
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:38,300
hey, get a load of that chick, none of that, none of that.

914
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,140
They looked at the eyes of women when they talked to them.

915
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,460
Never, hey, look at that, never at the legs.

916
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,780
The motion picture cameras and all the movie theaters

917
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,980
are dolling up and down the hind quarters and all.

918
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,520
And you wonder why men are like that?

919
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,900
They are not like that.

920
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,120
They are made like that by culture.

921
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,700
Then the missionaries arrived,

922
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,260
and the little girls used to come to church, you know,

923
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,860
innocent listening, and they put the t-shirts on them.

924
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,980
And the girls had no idea

925
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,700
why they were putting the t-shirts on them.

926
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,780
What's this for?

927
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,220
It's like me covering your nose.

928
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,020
You can't go into room B unless your nose is covered.

929
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,020
Well, the girls cut two holes in the t-shirts

930
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,060
and came to church.

931
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,300
So we're dealing with many different cultures,

932
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,980
subcultures, and values.

933
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,020
Our culture, if we are to grow

934
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:32,100
and build a civilization worthy of humankind,

935
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,460
we have to have a quantum jump

936
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,480
in the way we look at our world, people, and ourselves.

937
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:44,340
The Venus Project is the redesign of a culture

938
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,740
in which the elements that comprise the culture

939
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,580
are different.

940
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,060
For example, our cities are round,

941
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,420
not because I like round cities.

942
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,720
The city is round.

943
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,000
The center of the city has a socially integrated computer.

944
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,980
This may be a medical center.

945
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,940
This might be an engineering center.

946
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,740
And if you work in the medical center,

947
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,620
you can live in beautiful gardens

948
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,860
with running streams and waterfalls.

949
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:12,860
And every district is the same distance from the center.

950
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,220
There are no cars in the city.

951
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,500
You get on a conveyor and dial where you want to go to.

952
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,820
There's no crime in the city.

953
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:23,860
Just before the public library in the United States,

954
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,860
people said, well, you can't really do that.

955
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,740
The people never bring back the books.

956
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,580
They'll keep them.

957
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,580
They won't return them.

958
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,620
Of course, all that was incorrect.

959
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,700
I want to build a library where any child can walk in,

960
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,660
check out a camera, check out art materials,

961
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,980
check out water skis, make things available.

962
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,380
People don't steal.

963
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,460
No one's going to hit you on the head

964
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,340
to take your watch off if it's available.

965
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:52,260
Well, how are you going to pay for this central library

966
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,780
that gives children these things for nothing?

967
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:01,500
Well, it cost about $50,000 to keep a kid in jail,

968
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,900
one year, an adult $75,000 a year.

969
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,620
Food, clothing, shelter, dental care.

970
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:14,220
Isn't it easier to do it in a different way?

971
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,820
I would love to go to Mexico and say, what's your problem?

972
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,860
They say, well, senor, we don't have the modern machinery

973
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,140
you have.

974
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,500
Give them modern machinery.

975
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,340
Build schools for them.

976
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,180
And they won't be coming over the border.

977
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,460
What makes them come over the border?

978
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,940
Hunger, lack of employment.

979
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,180
They say, oh, damn Mexicans, you know what I like.

980
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,220
There's nothing like that.

981
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,980
Everything is shoved by something else.

982
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,780
You are told that a tree falls over.

983
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,380
You are told that a sailboat sails.

984
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:52,300
A sailboat cannot sail unless acted upon by a resident force

985
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,620
called the wind.

986
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,180
A tree does not fall.

987
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:59,300
If it rains and it's asymmetric and the soil becomes loose,

988
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,780
gravity does the rest.

989
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,340
The tree doesn't fall.

990
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,700
Plants do not grow.

991
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,500
They require radiant energy, nutrients, water,

992
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,900
stop any of those things, and the plant stops.

993
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:17,140
Human beings are not self-operating entities.

994
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,140
We are operated by many resident forces.

995
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,140
Of course, many of us are not aware of that.

996
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:25,860
It looks like we're perfectly free making our own decisions.

997
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,660
I know I think for myself.

998
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,580
I'm sure you do.

999
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,900
That's an illusion, because if you've

1000
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,860
brought up to believe in the Kennedy rocker,

1001
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,540
you want one for your home.

1002
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,100
It'll injure your back, distort your anatomy,

1003
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,540
but Kennedy had one like that, and I want one like that.

1004
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,700
When you break the patterns that have been established

1005
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,380
by existing society, you begin to move people

1006
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,740
in a new direction.

1007
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,020
I admit I could get up here and give a very pleasant lecture

1008
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:59,980
of how wonderful everything will be in the future.

1009
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:04,020
A helicopter in every garage, a house in suburbia,

1010
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,100
another on the beach, maybe one in Hawaii.

1011
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,100
This is the future.

1012
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,380
That is not the future.

1013
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,660
Those are the illusion generators,

1014
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,100
and there are lots of them.

1015
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:19,780
Gregory once told me that being black and living

1016
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,900
in the South, Dick Gregory, he said,

1017
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,940
whenever I was late for work, I couldn't

1018
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:27,900
run to the bus, because they would

1019
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,820
wonder what that blackie was up to.

1020
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,740
We project our value system into others.

1021
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:41,100
We project characteristics into others.

1022
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,020
We have to find out what we are really like.

1023
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:48,180
Now, many people tell me they want to find themselves.

1024
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,060
This is another ridiculous thing.

1025
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,460
Who are you going to find?

1026
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,660
Some jerk at 18, and a different value system at 23,

1027
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,220
you can never find yourself.

1028
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,540
If you read, keep up with new ideas, what's self?

1029
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,500
The self of 20?

1030
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,900
When I was 15, I was a jerk.

1031
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,500
And as time went on, I learned more

1032
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,660
about many different things, and knew

1033
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,220
how much I had to learn in order to move forward.

1034
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,380
There is no finding yourself.

1035
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,100
People come over to me and say, I

1036
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,140
want to know how I relate to the cosmos.

1037
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,540
We don't even know how a single self splits.

1038
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,420
And they want to know how they relate to the cosmos.

1039
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:30,340
What a bunch of verbal crap.

1040
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,860
Really, it's meaningless.

1041
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,940
And so I'm sorry that I only have one hour

1042
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:40,300
to try to give you ideas along different lines.

1043
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,140
Generally, it takes seminars.

1044
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:46,260
It takes a lot of demonstration and films.

1045
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,380
I did not mean to offend any of you.

1046
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,220
I hope that I didn't.

1047
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,900
Thank you for your time.

1048
00:50:53,900 --> 00:51:06,820
I'm sure the audience has some questions, so fire away.

1049
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,740
Yes?

1050
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,580
I teach middle school kids.

1051
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,740
What do you see?

1052
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,980
I'm a little hard of hearing.

1053
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,500
I'm sorry about that.

1054
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,100
I teach middle school kids, and I

1055
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,420
wondered some of your philosophies of education.

1056
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,060
OK, got the point.

1057
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:25,060
For example, in our city design, we have big lakes.

1058
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,460
We've made all these lakes.

1059
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,060
They exist.

1060
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:27,940
It's real.

1061
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,700
We have modern structures there, all different.

1062
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,300
Roxanne said to me, my associate, she said,

1063
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,420
I just don't want to draw pretty pictures of buildings.

1064
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,460
I want to build them.

1065
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,700
I want to make them.

1066
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,620
And she did all the cement work.

1067
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,300
And one day she came over and she said,

1068
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,740
how about a swimming pool?

1069
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,140
And she was with a girlfriend.

1070
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,060
I said, when do you girls want to start?

1071
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,420
Well, we never built a pool.

1072
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,900
They built it in two weeks, a beautiful pool.

1073
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,700
We'll show you pictures of it.

1074
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,780
And so we built a big lake in the city.

1075
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,620
And there's a hill in the middle of the lake,

1076
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,300
about 80 feet up out of the water.

1077
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,100
And on top of the hill is a craft shop

1078
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,780
where children can build anything they want to build.

1079
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,220
But in order to get there, you've

1080
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,060
got to get in a boat and row it.

1081
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,380
Instead of lining them up and say, come on, everybody

1082
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,740
together, forward, backward now.

1083
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,060
Arrange the environment so you have

1084
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,700
to row to get to the hill.

1085
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,220
You have to climb the hill to get to the craft shop.

1086
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:22,460
And an automobile or anything you build will not go together

1087
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,420
unless four children pick up the car

1088
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,700
and the others put the wheels on.

1089
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,700
Instead of saying, I want you people to work together

1090
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,580
and cooperate and stop fighting.

1091
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,500
Arrange things so that it works that way.

1092
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
That's what nature does.

1093
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,460
When a fox, a baby fox, sees a porcupine,

1094
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,140
it says, we know what have we here.

1095
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,300
I don't know.

1096
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,700
And he gets close to the porcupine.

1097
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,500
Finally, he gets a quill.

1098
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,580
And he stays away from the porcupine.

1099
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,860
But if you raise your children and try

1100
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:53,340
to avoid experiences that had hurt you

1101
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:56,220
and you buy them every toy that they want,

1102
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:59,940
you produce a blob of jello.

1103
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:04,860
Some degree of challenge, some degree of stress is necessary.

1104
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:09,340
And so we build an environment, try to answer your question,

1105
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,540
where the elements so arranged has

1106
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,980
to produce what you call creativity.

1107
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:17,740
Can I give you one more bit on that?

1108
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,740
All right.

1109
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:22,700
Is there anyone else interested in creativity in children?

1110
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,020
You raise your hands?

1111
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:24,940
OK.

1112
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:30,380
What we do is we, I ask a child to make a drawing.

1113
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,340
Anything they want to draw.

1114
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,100
And this is what they usually do.

1115
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,780
Can everybody see the blackboard?

1116
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,180
Well, I'll draw it up here.

1117
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,180
They draw something like this.

1118
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,660
I'm talking about four and five-year-olds.

1119
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,300
Then they draw something like this.

1120
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:55,140
And then most of them do something like this.

1121
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,540
I'm sure you've all seen those drawings.

1122
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:04,500
In fact, I'm sure many of you draw that way today.

1123
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,980
And so the teacher gives them some crayon,

1124
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:09,100
and they color it, and she hangs it up.

1125
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,980
This is a little Billy's drawing.

1126
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,980
But when she tells Billy that this is the way we spell cat,

1127
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,860
and Billy says, I see.

1128
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,220
And he comes back with something like this.

1129
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,940
Can you see that?

1130
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,660
The teacher says, that's wrong.

1131
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,860
That isn't wrong.

1132
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,100
Most of it is appropriate.

1133
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,220
It's just this that we change.

1134
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,340
So I say very close.

1135
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:38,980
We just substitute this with something like this.

1136
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:44,500
Then the child comes back again with something like this.

1137
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,660
I say much closer, much better.

1138
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:51,660
Only we turn this around so you can put the A inside of it.

1139
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,740
Say whatever you have to say to get the idea across.

1140
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,900
Instead of saying, well, that isn't what I told you.

1141
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,660
Well, all you're just using that child

1142
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:04,340
as an outlet for insufficiency.

1143
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,580
Then I do this with the children.

1144
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:10,100
I have them draw the letter T. And I say,

1145
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,060
which one of these looked like a peach pit?

1146
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,780
The child generally picks this.

1147
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,940
I see you, those of you back there,

1148
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,660
I'm sure you can't see that.

1149
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,220
And the blackboard is fully cluttered.

1150
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,060
And I don't have here.

1151
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,180
I'll try to clear your head.

1152
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:34,180
Where most of you can see, the child draws a letter T.

1153
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,500
And he draws a peach pit in the middle.

1154
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,660
Then he draws one peach pit here and one there.

1155
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,580
And he takes out the middle peach pit.

1156
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:45,260
Then I say, what is this?

1157
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,460
They say, that's a bunch of birdies flying.

1158
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,220
It's good.

1159
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,420
You move down a peach pit and a half

1160
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:57,140
and draw the letter V upside down.

1161
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:00,340
And the child draws a letter V upside down.

1162
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:05,020
Then he draws a birdie under the V.

1163
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:08,940
One peach pit down like this.

1164
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,060
And then he joins another birdie to that and a half

1165
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,020
round beneath that and one peach pit above.

1166
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:15,940
He does this.

1167
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,540
And then I say to the child, what is this?

1168
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,900
That's a hide.

1169
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,100
That's good.

1170
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,580
Half a hide from the top of the eyebrow

1171
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,540
to the bottom of the nose.

1172
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:30,660
And they move from that offensive drawing made by the child

1173
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:35,700
to this in less than a half hour.

1174
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,340
And I'm talking about five and six year olds

1175
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:41,500
moving into this realm, drawing sports cars,

1176
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,540
turning them around.

1177
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,580
And we give them crayon and chalk

1178
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,980
because we want them to bring out their artistic ability.

1179
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,460
You can't bring out anything if there's no basis

1180
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,500
or structure for it.

1181
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,220
If you sit in the woods and meditate on your navel

1182
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,860
for three years, you'll have a tremendously clear picture

1183
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,260
of the navel and nothing more.

1184
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,900
So you have to work to get information.

1185
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,340
You have to arrange things so that it generates

1186
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,660
what you call creativity.

1187
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,940
Now a psychologist in one session

1188
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,340
said that, well, I know two children that

1189
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,180
came from the same environment.

1190
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,900
And if environment is everything,

1191
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,820
one turned out to be a gangster, the other a minister.

1192
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:31,500
If environment is everything, how do you get those differences?

1193
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,380
The minute you pick up one child and start playing with it

1194
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,460
and the other stands there with that little,

1195
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,020
you're making jealousy and envy.

1196
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,180
There's no such thing as the same environment.

1197
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,620
So when I pick up my little girl,

1198
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:46,740
I pick up my older little boy.

1199
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:49,140
You never work with one child.

1200
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,300
Why can't you keep your area clean?

1201
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,100
Your brother does all the time.

1202
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,700
You leave all your things around.

1203
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,820
Well, when he trips and falls down the stairs,

1204
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:58,620
his brother smiles.

1205
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,580
An inhibited smile of course.

1206
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,820
But he does smile.

1207
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:05,860
So we build these artificialities

1208
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,940
in the world we live in today.

1209
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,620
We've got to interfere and change things.

1210
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,180
Those of you that would like to know more

1211
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,820
about the Venus Project,

1212
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,420
we have a video, a tape, and a book

1213
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:21,340
introducing the basic conceptual layout

1214
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,220
of what it's about.

1215
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,580
Any other questions?

1216
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,740
I can't go in in more detail.

1217
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,980
Yes?

1218
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:30,500
I find you're curious about the future interest there,

1219
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,020
but how do you account for human nature?

1220
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,220
How do I account for what?

1221
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,220
Human nature.

1222
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,820
Human nature.

1223
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:41,820
Human nature is the way people have found

1224
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:46,760
other people to behave over many long years.

1225
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,300
They appear to manifest greed, jealousy,

1226
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,660
envy, even animals.

1227
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,900
If you take a cat and put it on your lap

1228
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:01,020
in the presence of the dog, the dog may growl.

1229
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,580
And it's like, oh, that's what I mean

1230
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:07,420
by the nature of the beast.

1231
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,580
So I said, come on down to my lab in about a week.

1232
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,780
So I picked up my cat, put it on my lap

1233
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,780
and the dog says, oh, it's wagging.

1234
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,740
Because you reinforce the dog

1235
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:20,180
before you pick up the cat and put it.

1236
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:23,620
The cat is a threat to the dog's security.

1237
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:27,180
The dog wants you to pet it, not the cat.

1238
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,860
So you give the dog these ambivalent feelings,

1239
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,900
but you can have 15 kids in the room

1240
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,300
without jealousy, without envy.

1241
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,180
It is not human nature.

1242
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:41,780
It's human behavior that's shaped by culture.

1243
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:45,340
Like I said, if you were brought up in China years ago,

1244
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,140
you'd walk with your hands in your sleeves

1245
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:50,140
and shuffle and wear a long pigtail.

1246
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,660
And so, well, that's human nature.

1247
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:52,500
That's not.

1248
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,700
That's the influence of environment on your behavior.

1249
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,620
Dancing is the same thing.

1250
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,380
Dancers change over time.

1251
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,260
Music changes over time.

1252
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:07,380
So there is really no human nature.

1253
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,300
Think about it, toss it around.

1254
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,980
There is varying degrees of human behavior.

1255
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,900
If we wish to understand the factors

1256
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,340
that generate our value system,

1257
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:20,980
that generate the way we look at the world,

1258
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,780
we have to go back in time and study these things.

1259
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:24,620
I'm sorry again.

1260
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,260
I can't go into much more detail,

1261
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:31,340
just a general overview of the Venus Project.

1262
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,340
Yes?

1263
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,020
You mentioned a universal language.

1264
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,100
Are you speaking about something like Esperanto?

1265
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,700
No, that wouldn't do.

1266
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,100
Or interlingua?

1267
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,580
No, that wouldn't do.

1268
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:44,060
The language has to have a physical reference.

1269
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,900
In other words, that means that,

1270
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:54,180
suppose we took some tungsten and hid it with high-pitched sound,

1271
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,260
and bouncing off that tungsten,

1272
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:01,820
a pattern occurred on a screen that looked like that.

1273
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,980
Now, this was the nickel, and this is the iron,

1274
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:08,300
and we learned how to chart that pattern.

1275
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:12,300
When you wrote tungsten, you do this in the future.

1276
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:17,100
So it's always like chemistry, like a pharmacologist

1277
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:21,060
reads a prescription, assuming the doctor's handwriting is good.

1278
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:23,860
Look at that prescription, and it turns out the same product.

1279
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:27,220
We don't want individuality in that area.

1280
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,700
We want uniformity.

1281
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,260
Is there a place for individuality?

1282
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:36,780
You know, in the next few years, the word individuality

1283
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:42,060
will go the way all the other crude and vulgar terms went.

1284
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:46,100
When you buy a Mercedes, if you can afford it,

1285
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,140
and you turn the key, you want it to start, not sometimes,

1286
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,220
all the time.

1287
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:52,220
And when you turn, you want it to turn.

1288
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:55,100
And when you put the brakes on, you want it to stop.

1289
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:59,260
So it's called quality control.

1290
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:03,740
Variations in human behavior, which we call individuality

1291
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:07,700
today, is poor quality control.

1292
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,900
In the future, the question of people,

1293
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:13,660
then wouldn't everybody be uniform then?

1294
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:15,340
Well, the question of uniformity is such

1295
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,540
and just that they will uniformly,

1296
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:23,140
like anyone they meet, uniformly share ideas and resources,

1297
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:26,260
uniformly share knowledge with everyone else,

1298
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:29,020
and uniformly courteous with everyone else.

1299
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,060
That's the only kind of uniformity.

1300
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:35,460
As far as the accumulation of wealth, property, and power,

1301
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,500
this would be considered part of the age of the Bulgarians.

1302
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,060
To us, this is all normal.

1303
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:46,060
This is a thing to do, to become successful.

1304
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:49,740
Well, in my early days, I wanted to be successful,

1305
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,940
and a company came to me and said,

1306
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:54,500
we have a bunch of Mexican women and Indian women

1307
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,700
that sit at a conveyor belt, and they pick the black beans,

1308
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,220
and they pick the white beans, throw them in another box,

1309
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:03,180
and they said, can you improve that?

1310
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,940
I said, how far do you want to go?

1311
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,220
How many beans can you deliver?

1312
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,860
So what I did in the early days

1313
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:13,300
is I built a big bicycle wheel with hollow spokes

1314
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,100
that turned like an airplane propeller

1315
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:20,580
into a vat of beans, sucking up one bean to each vacuum tube.

1316
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,580
And then there was a photoelectric cell here.

1317
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:25,180
If the bean was black, it tripped it with a wire.

1318
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:27,060
And as you sit and watch, those beans

1319
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,820
went up like this in the big vat.

1320
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,900
And in eight hours, we did the work

1321
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,820
that 50 women took three months to do.

1322
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:38,260
Now, I would like my machines to come in,

1323
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:40,660
but I would like them to get a shorter workday,

1324
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,340
an increase in purchasing power.

1325
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:45,620
If machines do not improve the lives of people

1326
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,500
that work in automobile factories,

1327
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,780
if they're automated out of existence,

1328
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:52,980
so will you be automated out of existence.

1329
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:55,740
All of us can be automated out.

1330
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:59,180
Roxanne recently had some area,

1331
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:02,260
she does architectural rendering, site plans.

1332
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:06,780
There are machines that do that some years ago, CAD.

1333
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:09,300
There are machines today that make models.

1334
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,140
If you take a vase and put it on the table and it's scanned,

1335
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,980
they have a laser beam that penetrates the fluid

1336
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:21,300
and solidifies that fluid in the exact shape of that vase.

1337
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:24,980
You can do it to England, China, anywhere in the world.

1338
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,780
And I want to repeat this.

1339
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:30,420
Machines today, that is three months ago,

1340
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,900
could handle 500 trillion bits of information per second.

1341
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,380
I don't care how many humans you get together,

1342
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:41,340
there's no place for human behavior in the next 20 years.

1343
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:45,420
There's no place for human participation in the next 20 years,

1344
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,340
or maybe less.

1345
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:50,380
No one can predict the future precisely.

1346
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:54,180
I am not gentle, I don't pull my punches, I can't afford it.

1347
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:56,660
I respect you, I like you too much.

1348
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,140
I would rather tell you things as they are,

1349
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:01,700
not generate additional illusions.
