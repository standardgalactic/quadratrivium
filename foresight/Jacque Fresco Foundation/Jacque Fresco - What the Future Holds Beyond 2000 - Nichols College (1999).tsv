0	5000	Are any of you people, members of the World Future Society?
10640	13400	I'm sure most of you heard about the C. Clark.
13400	15280	Will you raise your hands?
15280	16780	Good.
16780	21880	He said that if he wrote a book that everybody enjoyed
21880	27120	and understood, he said he wouldn't be saying anything new.
27120	29000	Think about that.
29040	32380	What I'm going to talk about is going to change some of your
32380	35880	lives, the way you look at yourself and the way you look
35880	37680	at the world around you.
37680	42580	The subject matter is not the kind of matter to get from
42580	45160	ordinary sources or books.
45160	49760	So I would like your participation in an experiment.
49760	54560	And some of you might be able to tell what it is that I draw
54560	57300	on the board before I finish.
57340	60000	And if you know what it is, interrupt.
60000	61340	Say, I got it.
61340	62820	So I'm going to start.
62820	64900	Can all of you see the board?
64900	66740	I don't think I can make it with this.
72100	73860	Can all of you see the board?
73860	75860	Can you hear me all right?
75860	77500	OK.
77500	79900	The minute you know what it is, interrupt.
88300	91260	The same thinking ship, the Titanic.
91260	91860	What is it?
91860	92500	Titanic.
92500	93780	OK, great.
93780	97260	Now, if he didn't call that, remember, there's no ship
97260	98860	there at all.
98860	103860	There was enough bits for his associative memory to put that
103860	104700	together.
104700	106820	Now, you know that's not a ship.
106820	107980	Now, what is this?
107980	110060	Some of you older people might guess this.
113500	115060	An alarm clock.
115060	116780	Who did that?
116780	120140	You are amazing.
120140	121500	Where's the alarm clock?
121500	126860	Well, anyway, if she wasn't able to call that, I would have
126860	130220	put the legs on it and the clock and Hamilton watch
130220	132740	coming, until somebody called it.
132740	137180	Now, there are still some that cannot see the ship.
137180	140420	So I would have gone all along, put all the windows in,
140420	142940	Titanic, everything, until somebody got up and said,
142940	144740	yeah, Titanic.
144740	151700	Well, this is an attempt to prove that all of us are
151700	156860	capable of making decisions and arriving at a conclusion
156860	160540	without all of the information prepared for us.
160540	163860	That is a unique quality in human beings.
163860	168100	We can put things together, and we do not require the
168100	170980	accumulation of a great deal of information.
170980	173220	In this system, if you understand this
173220	176660	quite well, who would you say this is?
193340	196060	Who said that?
196060	198220	Who said that?
198220	200540	Lincoln.
200580	202260	I don't see Lincoln, but it's Lincoln.
202260	204060	It would have been Abraham Lincoln.
204060	206820	When I got filled with it, I would have gone on with a beard
206820	208780	and all of the stuff.
208780	212500	So this is just to prove that people can put something
212500	216940	together, and I'm going to try to explain to you just what
216940	220500	creative thinking really is.
220500	223860	Now, I'm going to use old language, the language that I
223860	227100	use with people who are not familiar with this way of
227100	228020	thinking.
228020	233460	The old language is that people can think and reason.
233460	236060	I do not believe that is possible.
236060	237900	I have many inventions.
237900	240740	I've worked on many different things, but I don't believe
240740	244260	that human beings can think or reason.
244260	245740	This is what I do believe.
245740	248140	By the way, you don't have to accept anything I say.
248140	251380	During the question period, don't be polite.
251380	253220	Come at it from all angles.
253220	254820	Break it down if you can.
254820	257580	This helps me, and it helps you.
257620	261020	So when I talk about thinking and reasoning and putting
261020	265100	things together, we're talking about the forces that shape
265100	266900	human behavior.
266900	274460	I believe that all human behavior is lawful, that the
274460	278100	reactions and values that all people have are perfectly
278100	281060	lawful to the environment that they come from.
281060	285860	So every human being is perfectly well adjusted from
285860	288860	where they are coming from, from their background and
288860	289940	experience.
289940	294060	If you as a baby were raised by the Seminole Indians, you
294060	296500	would behave if you never saw anything else like a
296500	298180	Seminole Indian.
298180	301060	And if you were brought up in any other Indian group and you
301060	304900	had feathers in your head, in your head gear, and you were
304900	307780	dancing around the fire, and I walked over and said, that's
307780	308300	ridiculous.
308300	311060	What are you dancing around the fire with the feathers for?
311060	312780	You don't take your hat, throw it on the ground, says
312780	313060	you don't.
313060	314860	I never thought of it that way.
314860	316180	We can't do that.
316180	318940	We're victims of culture.
318940	322380	We look at the world with our background.
322380	324620	We have no other way of doing it.
324620	328820	Psychology is kind of a rudimentary form today, an
328820	332900	attempt to grasp at the factors that shape human
332900	336140	behavior, the factors that are responsible for the way we
336140	340140	look at ourselves, other people, and the way we behave, or
340140	342100	if you wish, misbehave.
342140	345540	I don't believe that any human being misbehaves.
345540	349460	They use whatever tools they know of, whatever tools
349460	351100	they're familiar with.
351100	353780	Language is a tool.
353780	357860	It's someone to show you a picture of an airplane, what
357860	360700	appeared to be an airplane, without wings.
360700	363460	When people look at it and they stand by and they say, it
363460	364700	will never fly.
364700	366940	But they don't say, how do you propose to lift off the
366940	368820	ground without wings?
368820	372020	That's the key to communication.
372060	377140	Now, a very famous scientist deceased now, trying to get
377140	380820	the government and people to put up sufficient funds to
380820	385900	monitor outer space, to try to make contact with extra
385900	388220	terrestrial life.
388220	391460	I want to try to save this to you and think about what I
391460	392900	say, toss it around.
392900	395740	I'm using the old language because you're not that
395740	399540	familiar with these values.
399540	404340	If people or beings or things can travel 100 million
404340	410780	light years through time and space, they are not humanoid.
410780	415700	The storage system for water would occupy miles.
415700	419500	And all of the facilities required by humans would
419500	422820	take up tremendous amounts of space and require
422820	425660	tremendous amounts of energy.
425660	427300	Now, there are people that talk of flying
427300	430100	saucers at the land here on Earth.
430100	433540	And they go to some farmer, and they take him into the
433540	437140	saucer, and they do all kinds of experiments on them.
437140	441500	Now, first of all, people do not travel hundreds of
441500	445500	millions of light years to pick up some farmer and ask him
445500	446940	what kind of suspenders he wears.
450500	453340	Carl Sagan wanted to communicate with extra
453340	454380	terrestrials.
454380	458060	He hoped that they, in turn, would communicate with us.
458060	461300	Now, you know that the Republicans can't communicate
461300	463620	with the Democrats.
463620	466820	You know that husbands and wives have difficulty in
466820	468020	communicating.
468020	471020	Children and parents have difficulty, because the
471020	475460	language we use was designed a long time ago.
475460	481460	And it is inherently difficult to get ideas across in the
481460	483980	language that we use today.
483980	488260	However, when engineers meet and talk, they speak a
488260	490460	different language.
490460	493220	One engineer might present a very thin cable, and says,
493220	497980	this can support 5,000 tons.
497980	501180	And the other engineer says, what's its tensile strength?
501180	502860	And he's given that information.
502860	504580	Then he puts it in a machine.
504580	505860	I don't know whether he knew this.
505860	510180	And he snaps it to make sure that it holds for that.
510220	522620	When engineers design an airplane, they do all the
522620	523940	calculations.
523940	526700	This is a very rapid drawing of a
526700	528740	front view of an airplane.
528740	531660	They do all the rapid calculations, and they figure
531660	534860	what that wing will be able to support.
534860	537340	And after all their calculations, and after
537340	542020	they're certain, they then pile sandbags on the wing.
542020	543060	Did you know that?
543060	549500	Until it breaks off to make damn sure that it does the job.
549500	552900	Now, that does not exist in everyday language.
552900	555900	In everyday language, you don't have that ability.
555900	558580	When an engineer meets another engineer, he says, I can
558580	563620	illuminate an area with this tiny point of light that has
563620	566140	50,000 square feet.
566180	567940	The engineer says, well, that's not possible.
567940	569820	He doesn't talk like that.
569820	572940	He says, how do you power that unit?
572940	575460	What kind of voltage does it take?
575460	577780	How do you illuminate that spot?
577780	579220	They ask questions.
579220	582900	The average person, yeah, nah, not in a thousand years.
582900	584940	That's been around for a long time.
584940	590060	That is a language of war, of hatred, of bigotry, of
590060	594500	prejudice, the inability to ask questions.
594500	597540	And we've got to be very careful about that.
597540	600940	And at one lecture I remember at Princeton, I was trying to
600940	605300	say that human beings cannot think or reason, because of
605300	608540	psychology, department, and sociology.
608540	611540	Well, one of the individuals stood up, one of the staff,
611540	614780	and he said, all right, where did the camera come from?
614780	616780	There were no cameras at one time.
616780	619540	Someone had to think about a camera.
619540	621900	He just doesn't come out of the thin air.
621900	626860	And after doing a lot of work, many years ago, in ancient
626860	630060	Egypt, or if you live out in the country, or have lived
630060	633980	out in the country, if there was a hole in the barn wall,
633980	638900	that is, a knot was knocked out, the cows on the outside
638900	642820	appeared on the wall of the barn, upside down.
642820	647380	And in Egypt, you went in this dome to see the upside down
647380	648420	world.
648420	651780	There was a little hole here, and the daylight came in, and
651780	654740	you saw people walking upside down on the wall.
654740	657260	How many of you have experienced that kind of
657260	659300	phenomenon?
659300	662260	That is essentially the box-hole camera.
662260	665380	A camera, the simple camera without a lens, there's just
665380	667540	a little hole in the box.
667540	672220	And somebody said, well, how can I see that image?
672220	675340	And they used a transparent membrane back here, and they
675340	680500	could see the upside down head, or a person, or a cow.
680540	684420	And they asked this question, if only I can retain that
684420	685340	image?
685340	686780	Well, that isn't the answer.
686780	688100	That's just a question.
688100	691380	I wonder how I could retain that image.
691380	695980	So years before that, the American Indians and other
695980	701460	primitives have taken tappercloth, or they'd weave
701460	704700	natural materials into a kind of a fabric.
704700	707220	And then they would take berry juices and
707220	708980	dye it different colors.
708980	713620	Sometimes a leaf would fall upon that surface, and after
713620	717580	the sun dried it, they had an image of the leaf.
717580	723500	So they began to use dyes from this background, that all
723500	728620	human beings, to understand the better, the first human
728620	732580	being that jumped off a precipice with wings, he
732580	733700	died.
733740	737300	And his brother-in-law wrote, next time, make the wings
737300	739660	larger.
739660	743940	No one starts out right away and solves a problem, unless
743940	746740	you have a tremendous background in many different
746740	747820	areas.
747820	750580	Well, the next guy that jumped off, he jumped off of the
750580	751820	larger wings.
751820	754700	And he flew a little, and then they went, and the old
754700	758020	fisherman said, you've got to brace them wings, like a
758020	760020	boat, like a man.
760020	762780	They're not going to hold, so they braced it.
762780	765740	And then they jumped off the precipice, this individual,
765740	769060	and he flew, and he hit a tree.
769060	771740	And he hurt his leg real badly.
771740	774220	And his wife said, you know, John, a fish has a
774220	777820	rudder, good point.
777820	780660	And they stuck the rudder on the airplane.
780660	784780	No one ever sat down and invented a television set, an
784780	788940	airplane, the electric light, wireless, none of that came
788940	792740	about by men walking in deep concentration.
792740	796900	And then, through some ethereal substance, bingo, the
796900	798300	idea is formulated.
798300	800140	It doesn't work that way.
800140	802540	It's hard work.
802540	805820	And I make more mistakes than anybody I know, because I
805820	807020	try more things.
809740	812980	There's nothing wrong with building something, and
812980	814940	finding out that it doesn't work.
814940	817100	This is where you get your experience.
817100	819500	There's nothing wrong with criticism.
819500	821980	I remember the first model airplanes that I built went
821980	825460	nosing into the ground, and I was ashamed of them.
825460	829700	And a young engineer told me that my center of gravity had
829700	830300	to be corrected.
830300	833140	That is, move the wing forward.
833140	839020	And so all of us stand on the shoulders of one another, and
839020	840780	we shape the future.
840780	843620	Another question that was asked, well, somebody had to
843620	844940	invent the bow and arrow.
844940	846420	Somebody had to think of it.
846420	848500	It just didn't come out of nowhere.
848500	852420	Well, I talked to many Indians, and after talking to many
852420	857620	Indians, this is when I found out that Indians used to skin
857620	861060	animals, and this is a lousy drawing of the skin of an
861060	865340	animal stretched out in the sun.
865340	869380	When the Indians got back, the skin was half the size.
869380	871340	It shrunk and became thicker.
871340	873100	And they didn't like that at all.
873100	877660	So they cut leather into strips, thin strips.
877660	881980	And they took an existing frame, and they tied that skin
881980	882780	to the frame.
882780	885860	Something you may have seen this, was lace of leather,
885860	888500	all in one, to prevent it from shrinking.
888500	891500	But when they cut the strips of leather and put them out in
891500	894740	the sun, they shrunk and became fat and short.
894740	897220	And they were just pleased with that.
897220	901540	After many, many years, one Indian tied that strand of
901540	906900	leather to a piece of wood, a stick.
906900	909900	He split the top, tied it up, and tied the leather to the
909900	910500	stick.
910500	914860	When he came back, hoping that it would dry and not shrink,
914860	916900	the stick took this form.
916900	920180	It was bent.
920180	923780	He plucked that in and went, bong, now.
923780	926940	And after many years, somebody took another piece of wood,
926940	930380	put it in and pulled the string, and off it went.
930460	933460	Well, if man can't think or reason, where did the movie
933460	935460	camera come from?
935460	936500	Somebody had to think of that.
936500	938100	It doesn't exist out there.
938100	940220	Well, here's where it came from.
940220	944620	Many, many years ago, thousands of years ago in China,
944620	950380	they used to take a candle, and they'd take some bamboo
950380	953460	paper at the time, and put it in front of the candle.
953460	955820	And then they'd cut out a little figurine of a human
955820	958220	being, and put the candle behind it.
958220	962060	And as the candle undulated, the little person would dance,
962060	963380	and they'd play music.
963380	965020	That was the beginning.
965020	966300	How did that happen?
966300	969540	Some guy had a candle in the piece of paper, and he was
969540	972700	just happened to be behind it, and his finger appeared to
972700	974260	move on the screen.
974260	978460	And so he extracted or built upon that phenomena.
978460	981460	Then later, there's something interesting occurring.
981460	985980	The Chinese used to take these tremendous scrolls and
985980	986860	open them up.
986860	991100	Well, they then later taped, or they wired, or they used
991100	995300	gut and tied many pages together and built a kind of a
995300	996260	pad.
996260	1001340	But in order to get to a particular page, the oriental
1001340	1005300	would mark the corner of the page so that they can find
1005300	1006580	with a symbol.
1006580	1009980	And as you flip through the pages fast, that little dot
1009980	1012220	would jump all over the place.
1012220	1017220	Well, years later, an individual drew various
1017220	1021540	successive pictures of a bird in flight, and put them down
1021540	1023940	in the corner of the paper and flipped it.
1023940	1026740	And the little bird wings began to move up and down.
1026740	1031980	Well, a Frenchman saw that, and he took little pieces of
1031980	1037220	cardboard, and he put them in a circular pattern.
1037220	1040700	I'm going to try to get it down as quickly as I can.
1040700	1044740	And he put a crank up here that you turn, and the little
1044740	1047180	pictures would go around in a circle.
1047180	1050020	And the Chinese had something like this also, and they had
1050020	1053220	a bamboo interrupter that would just hold the picture for
1053220	1056420	a few seconds, a second, less than a second, as you turned
1056420	1059460	it, a man appeared to move across the screen.
1059460	1062860	Well, the Frenchman machined that out of brass, did a
1062860	1065900	beautiful job, and when you turned the crank, the person
1065900	1069700	walked with smoother motions rather than these abrupt
1069700	1071100	motions.
1071100	1075820	Edison saw that unit that the Frenchman designed, and he
1075820	1079860	turned it into this position.
1079860	1082180	I guess I can't work with that microphone.
1085780	1087220	Can you hear me back there?
1087540	1088500	Is there an OK?
1088500	1088980	OK.
1092740	1102660	And what happened is he turned it into a vertical position, and
1102660	1109700	all the pictures were set in a circular fashion, and you turned
1109700	1111180	the crank here.
1111180	1112060	Excuse me.
1112060	1113660	They won't get the audio on the camera.
1113660	1114260	Oh, I'm sorry.
1114260	1117180	Why don't you just put it in your pocket or something?
1117620	1119980	Oh, it's fine.
1119980	1122980	Or hook it to your wrist.
1122980	1124100	Thanks.
1124100	1125900	Roxanne is my associate.
1125900	1129140	She works on all the buildings and all the things that we've
1129140	1131940	developed in the Venus Project, which I'll talk to you
1131940	1133300	about later.
1133300	1136580	And Edison purchased this, put a magnifying glass in front of
1136580	1139940	it, and you put a nickel in, and you turned the crank, and
1139940	1141380	you saw people moving.
1141380	1143860	A bunch of still photographs.
1143860	1146580	It was a long, slow process.
1146580	1150260	Nobody, no individual, invented the camera.
1150260	1153020	A little bit here, a little there, added to that, and
1153020	1157460	eventually the Wright brothers read about experimental
1157460	1161380	aircraft, where thousands of people died trying to develop
1161380	1163300	a flying machine.
1163300	1166460	And after picking up bits of this information, including
1166460	1171260	man-carrying kites from China thousands of years ago, and
1171260	1173620	they built the first flying machine.
1173660	1175420	They were called the father of flight.
1175420	1179420	Again, there's no father of anything.
1179420	1182060	You may take an idea so far, you add to it, and
1182060	1183380	gradually it's built up.
1183380	1187540	A genius, a genius is a person that has been exposed to
1187540	1191300	many different systems, and therefore they can come up
1191300	1194180	with a wide range of solutions.
1194180	1198020	A man like Leonardo da Vinci, you think that he just
1198020	1199500	evolved out of nothing?
1199500	1202060	He spoke to people that were interested in mechanics in
1202060	1202900	his time.
1202900	1206540	They gathered and they shared ideas, but you only hear of
1206540	1208460	da Vinci.
1208460	1214980	Unfortunately, guys like Nikolai Tesla, Edison, all the
1214980	1218140	great innovators of the past have been influenced by
1218140	1219940	other people.
1219940	1223620	And the mythical structures that we build around inventors
1223620	1225780	that they inherit special abilities.
1225780	1228420	They are geniuses, or they're in tune with the infinite
1228420	1233020	mind, and the ideas somehow filter in.
1233020	1235060	Well, this is a kind of nonsense.
1235060	1239220	It's the same story about, is there intelligent life out
1239220	1240500	there?
1240500	1246580	The real question is, is there intelligent life here?
1246580	1249780	We don't think so, not yet.
1249780	1252020	I'm serious, I'm not kidding.
1252020	1254420	What is intelligence?
1254420	1260020	Well, the ability to reason things out, you can't have
1260020	1263580	that ability unless you've had experience in particular
1263580	1264540	areas.
1264540	1270140	An eskimo never dreams, I repeat this, of walking on a
1270140	1272340	palm-fringed beach.
1272340	1273380	Can you understand that?
1273380	1277300	It is not possible, unless he has seen motion pictures or
1277300	1280460	something about the beach.
1280460	1284140	It is not possible for any human being to build a frame of
1284140	1288020	reference of any kind without experience.
1288020	1292500	I know where every invention I ever made came from.
1292500	1295500	I know the influence, the books I've read, the people I've
1295500	1298700	known, everything that shaped those values.
1298700	1301500	And sometimes people say, well, when did you think of that?
1301500	1302940	Wonderful idea.
1302940	1304420	It was in February the first.
1304420	1308100	Now, it's cumulative bits of information that we put
1308100	1311220	together with experience.
1311220	1313460	So all of the artificial structures and
1313460	1317700	artificiality of all societies, they are all primitive
1317700	1318500	today.
1318500	1321980	They are all backward, the very fact that we use
1321980	1325700	political systems, the very fact that there are Democrats
1325700	1329660	and Republicans and notions about how the
1329660	1331380	world ought to be governed.
1331380	1333980	Now, scientists could not do a thing with that.
1333980	1337500	If you want to put a man on the moon, you have to know what
1337500	1339620	the distance is precisely.
1339620	1342460	You have to know how much material you're lifting up
1342460	1344260	toward the moon.
1344260	1348140	You have to know how much force a human body can stand.
1348140	1351260	Well, to start with, they don't have that information.
1351260	1355740	So they build special devices, a big centrifuge.
1355740	1358580	They put a human being in it, and they whirl it around.
1358580	1360020	They say, how are you doing?
1360020	1361580	And the guy conks out.
1361580	1365980	And they say, well, this is how fast you can rotate
1365980	1367660	certain groups of people.
1367660	1370620	And they build data.
1370620	1375020	And from that data, they plan the moon voyage.
1375020	1380780	The question then is, what kind of world do we want?
1380780	1384300	How is it that we want our social system to operate?
1384300	1387260	What makes criminal behavior?
1387260	1390580	What are the factors that make a Jeffrey Dahmer?
1390580	1392100	I'm sure you know who that was.
1392100	1395340	Before Jeffrey, there was Albert Fish.
1395340	1399100	I don't know if any of you remember Albert Fish.
1399100	1402140	Albert Fish was a fine-looking gentleman.
1402140	1404900	He ate 45 children.
1404900	1409100	Well, you wonder, how can anyone do that kind of thing?
1409100	1412100	I'm going to try to give you some idea of the background
1412100	1414260	of Albert Fish.
1414260	1417500	When he was a youngster, about 10 years old,
1417500	1419900	he was touching his private parts.
1419900	1422740	His mother was an old-time Baptist.
1422780	1426060	And she says, you are going straight to hell.
1426060	1427980	You will burn eternally.
1427980	1433100	And that kid, Albert Fish, stuck needles into his genitals
1433100	1435340	because he didn't want to burn in hell.
1435340	1437660	And he took other children into empty lots
1437660	1440740	and cut off their private parts because he
1440740	1442420	wanted to save them.
1442420	1445540	If you're brought up in a distorted environment, which
1445540	1449660	we all live in today, any judge that wraps the gavel
1449660	1452620	and says, 30 years is an ignoramus
1452620	1455460	because he has no idea of the factors that
1455460	1457380	shape human behavior.
1457380	1462060	When you become aware, if you bring up a healthy boy
1462060	1464980	with about six women, and one of the girls says,
1464980	1466980	oh, did I see a gorgeous hat?
1466980	1469740	That boy will pick up the same mannerisms,
1469740	1474260	same facial expressions, and say, oh, I just love that hat.
1474260	1476060	Because if that's the environment
1476060	1478740	that you brought up in Italy, you say, hey, what's the matter?
1478740	1480140	You like or you don't like?
1480140	1482740	In other words, it depends on the way you brought up.
1482740	1484780	Did you know that Lincoln was Irish?
1484780	1489980	It depends on your group and the values that you exchange.
1489980	1494020	And if you want a world without war, without hatred,
1494020	1497380	without crime, without stupidity,
1497380	1502700	it can be arranged if you follow this bit.
1502700	1506340	If we consider at some time, which society will,
1506380	1510020	at a later time, I hope it would be sooner,
1510020	1513540	that all of the earth become the common heritage
1513540	1517700	of all nations, all of the resource of the earth,
1517700	1520580	the common heritage of all nations.
1520580	1522460	And if you believe in God, if you
1522460	1526300	understand the teachings of all religions,
1526300	1530940	there are no property lines in heaven, no banks,
1530940	1534780	no personal positions in which one person is elevated
1534780	1536660	above another.
1536660	1540020	That if the earth were the common heritage of all nations
1540020	1542100	and all of the artificial boundaries
1542100	1544780	removed that separate people, there'd
1544780	1549700	be no basis for war, no basis for armament.
1549700	1551420	The world you live in is an old world.
1551420	1552100	It's language.
1552100	1552820	It's old.
1552820	1554460	Its values are old.
1554460	1556900	And our institutions of education
1556900	1559820	fail to touch the social system.
1559820	1560580	You want to be careful.
1560580	1561540	Don't touch that.
1561540	1565260	This is an area that you don't want to get involved in.
1565260	1569020	Well, in order for you to grow, in order
1569020	1571020	for you to make the world a better place,
1571020	1573900	you have to face this situation.
1573900	1577060	I don't say that people are going to sit back and do that.
1577060	1579900	According to all historical records,
1579900	1583300	no civilization, anyway, to my knowledge,
1583300	1585940	has ever sit back to plan the future.
1585940	1588340	Exactly what we're going to do, how we're going to live,
1588340	1590100	how we're going to work out transportation.
1590100	1593060	Now, we just build highways all over the place.
1593060	1596780	Although you go to school and you learn something,
1596780	1599860	you learn that a straight line is the shortest distance
1599860	1602540	between two given points.
1602540	1606660	Well, look at a roadmap of the United States.
1606660	1611420	And I think you'll find spaghetti all over the place.
1611420	1613500	Rarely do you see that.
1613500	1615500	Look at your cities, every building
1615500	1617340	of different size and shape.
1617340	1620940	This does not express individuality.
1620940	1622740	It's a chaos.
1622740	1625540	At four o'clock, all the cars come out of this building,
1625540	1627860	and they can't get across that bridge.
1627860	1629700	So you've got to build another bridge.
1629700	1632500	So you elect people to political office
1632500	1634300	that are totally incompetent.
1634300	1635780	They are neutrally bankrupt.
1635780	1638340	I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican.
1638340	1640140	They don't have the value system
1640140	1643980	to solve these problems that exist.
1643980	1646300	They are not educated in that way.
1646300	1649980	They are brought up with a uniform set of values.
1649980	1651860	And they go out into the world.
1651860	1656260	And this was a sad story of coming events.
1656260	1657980	There are computers today.
1657980	1660140	There are machines in existence today
1660140	1668740	that can handle 500 trillion bits of information per second.
1668740	1671500	No human comes anywhere near that.
1671500	1674580	And you think that in the next 15 or 20 years,
1674580	1676740	there's going to be people in government?
1676740	1678540	No way.
1678540	1680860	For example, if you took a group of computers
1680860	1683420	and arranged them in a special fashion
1683420	1686180	and ran the electrical tentacles out
1686180	1692380	to the agricultural belt with probes into the soil,
1692380	1694020	when the water table dropped, that
1694020	1697100	would turn on the pumps and bring the water into the area.
1697100	1700180	If the nutrients changed, it would pump nutrients
1700180	1701300	into the area.
1701300	1703220	What kind of world do you want?
1703220	1705460	I don't think any of you here, maybe a few of you,
1705460	1709620	might remember when human beings used to operate elevators.
1709620	1710900	They'd turn to crank.
1710900	1713780	They'd never quite got to the floor, up and down.
1713780	1716060	Finally, they became automated.
1716060	1716980	Step back.
1716980	1718380	It's a lovely day today.
1718380	1719860	How are you, Mr. Jones?
1719860	1721460	If they scan your face.
1721460	1723860	And they'll take you exactly to that floor.
1723860	1725980	After that comes the transveyor.
1725980	1729340	An elevator moves up and down sideways, all directions.
1729340	1731300	You get on it and verbalize, I want
1731300	1733540	to go to the art center, music center,
1733540	1736100	and it'll take you there.
1736100	1739540	The kind of world you live in and the automobiles that
1739540	1743180	exist as transportation units are dangerous,
1743180	1748700	because they have a bumper in front and one in the back.
1748700	1751140	And I'm sure that if an extraterrestrial visited
1751140	1754020	the earth, they'd say, what are those shiny things in front
1754020	1755700	and back of the vehicle?
1755700	1756700	Well, they're bumpers.
1756700	1758420	They don't prevent damage.
1758420	1761580	Well, don't you have the head on the side?
1761580	1764020	Why aren't the bumper all around the car?
1764020	1765900	And then they came with the airbag.
1765900	1767820	And they put an airbag in front of you.
1767820	1769100	If you get hit on the side, your head
1769100	1771140	goes right through the glass.
1771140	1773900	They had a long time to appeal to companies,
1773900	1776260	a long time to solve those problems.
1776260	1779100	And then you see motorcycle policemen pull over.
1779100	1781060	What do you think you're doing?
1781060	1783700	All you have to do in a car, if you wanted to,
1783700	1785220	I wouldn't do it.
1785220	1786940	I wouldn't even put this in a car.
1786940	1791980	Just put a sort of a chimograph or a cylindrical recorder.
1791980	1795140	When you go through a 30-mile-an-hour zone to 50-mile-an-hour,
1795140	1796660	it's recorded on there.
1796660	1799260	And every month, you have to tear that strip out of your car
1799260	1802740	and mail it into the police department.
1802740	1805460	Well, the police wouldn't like that.
1805460	1808180	But how many violations do you think you'd have?
1808180	1810460	There are better ways than that.
1810460	1813340	You just make a car intelligent.
1813340	1815260	Well, here's what that means.
1815260	1818540	How intelligent can machine be?
1818540	1821700	Well, if you took a little gadget called a pressure
1821700	1825980	transducer, if you squeeze it, it generates electricity.
1825980	1828020	So let's put one in each tire.
1828020	1830980	And let's say that you kick the front-right tire.
1830980	1835460	It goes to a recording says, ouch, my front-right tire.
1835460	1839340	Now, of course, if you kick any tire, it'll verbalize.
1839340	1843740	But if you kick it hard, it'll say ouch, my front-right tire.
1843780	1846380	And if you kick it again, it'll say, who do you think you are?
1846380	1848620	Do you want to give a machine feelings?
1848620	1853140	Do you want to give a machine compassion, love, warmth?
1853140	1855420	I'll tell you why they leave it out of machines,
1855420	1858220	because it doesn't work.
1858220	1861020	Human emotions that you learn are the most significant
1861020	1865780	and most important differences between men and machines.
1865780	1868220	Human emotions are very touchy subject.
1868220	1871500	It's like racing your engine at a stop light.
1871500	1873300	It doesn't take you anywhere.
1873340	1875260	It doesn't serve any purpose.
1875260	1876860	If you get a lump in your throat when
1876860	1879700	you see hungry people, that's emotional.
1879700	1883420	But when you increase the agricultural yield per acre,
1883420	1884820	that's caring.
1884820	1886060	That's love.
1886060	1891700	Love is transforming all of the verbal and paper
1891700	1895580	proclamations to a way of life.
1895580	1898060	The shameful thing about our century
1898060	1902340	is that there was only one Edison, one Louis Pasteur,
1902340	1906220	one Nikolai Tesla, one Madame Curie.
1906220	1909900	We should have had thousands of them, and we will.
1909900	1913940	Once we get rid of the artificial boundaries
1913940	1917700	that separate people, once we get rid of nationalism,
1917700	1922300	patriotism, again, I do not mean to offend anybody.
1922300	1925460	All that I ask you to do is think about this,
1925460	1927500	toss it around.
1927500	1930380	This is what the Venus Project advocates.
1930380	1935100	The Venus Project is a design for culture
1935100	1938220	in which we bridge the difference between all nations.
1938220	1942660	How is that done by a universal language, the blueprint?
1942660	1945140	If you open a blueprint in Japan,
1945140	1947500	they know what you're talking about.
1947500	1951260	If you write a prescription for England, Japan, France,
1951260	1953220	the pharmacologist understands that.
1953220	1954900	There's no discrepancies.
1954900	1956420	There's no ambivalence.
1956420	1958220	I wonder what he meant by that.
1958220	1962660	It's clear the language we use daily is not.
1962660	1968020	The language of warmth and love are verbal excuses
1968020	1970760	and verbal outlets for some people,
1970760	1973620	for avoiding their responsibility
1973620	1977220	to make the world a better place for everyone.
1977220	1980300	The smarter your kids are, the richer my life.
1980300	1984220	Every kid on corner shooting up drugs, going nowhere,
1984220	1987420	you're going to have to pay for in the future.
1987460	1992460	Therefore, it is efficient and functionally selfish
1992660	1995420	to build a better world for everyone.
1995420	1997420	If you try to do it, people come to me all the time
1997420	2001500	and they say, can you design a city with a wall high enough
2001500	2004100	so when the U2K problem comes
2004100	2007580	or the system breaks down or the banks fail,
2007580	2009340	we will be protected.
2009340	2010940	I say, sure I can design that,
2010940	2013380	but there are people that'll drive by
2013380	2016740	with launching mechanisms right over your little wall.
2016740	2019060	There's no place you can hide.
2019060	2022620	We have 25 acres, people call it Eden too.
2022620	2024060	Beautiful.
2024060	2027300	But if the bottom falls out of this culture,
2027300	2029660	there will be people at my front gate with children.
2029660	2031540	How about some food just for the kids?
2031540	2033060	The next day, 50 people.
2034100	2035660	Everything looks solid to you.
2035660	2037980	Everything looks solid and stable
2037980	2039740	and the future looks promising.
2039740	2041460	But here's the truth.
2041460	2043580	I have seen an XY plotter,
2043580	2046540	that is a machine that moves in three dimensions.
2046540	2049860	They put a scalpel in that machine
2049860	2052340	and an x-ray of a brain tumor.
2052340	2055900	And this machine removed the brain tumor on a cadaver
2055900	2057940	in about one-tenth the time.
2057940	2060740	And doctors think, oh, just the industrial work
2060740	2063220	on the production line, he's on the way out,
2063220	2065420	but not me, I can think.
2065420	2067220	Let me say this again.
2067220	2069260	The typewriters that work the speech,
2069260	2072260	today you talk, you compute it and you get a type
2072260	2075900	and also correct your English, restructures your sentences,
2075900	2077300	makes recommendations.
2078300	2081980	How much longer do you think people are going to be
2081980	2085700	in positions in industry and government
2085700	2089820	making their own decisions?
2089820	2093540	We don't believe that anyone ought to make decisions.
2093540	2096580	We believe that people ought to arrive at decisions.
2096580	2098340	And here's what that means.
2098340	2101300	You go across the country and pick up samples of the soil
2101300	2102540	all over the nation.
2102540	2104580	You bring it to central agriculture,
2104620	2108020	analyze that soil, and then turn to your health department
2108020	2110660	and ask them what people need, manganese,
2110660	2113980	whatever they need, and what is this soil good for?
2113980	2116140	What should we grow, tomatoes,
2116140	2118660	and then rotate the crop, move to something else?
2118660	2121700	That's what I mean by surveying the conditions.
2121700	2124180	Not what's your opinion, what's your opinion?
2124180	2128100	Democracy is a crude and voter system
2128100	2132100	and should have been phased out centuries ago.
2132140	2135060	But we don't have enough outside points of view
2135060	2136460	on radio and television.
2137420	2139660	When I talked this way on the Larry King show,
2139660	2141540	he said to me, just a minute,
2141540	2144260	I depend on those people that you're attacking.
2144260	2146460	I wasn't attacking the automobile companies.
2146460	2150020	I just said that if you did that, it would be safer.
2150020	2152940	If you put proximity units on automobiles,
2152940	2154780	most of you have them in your home now,
2154780	2156980	when you walk over the building, the light goes on.
2156980	2158580	That's a proximity unit.
2158580	2160820	Put that in your car, and if you're backing up
2160820	2163900	and a child is crawling behind you, it stops,
2163900	2166540	no matter how much you step on the gas.
2166540	2169860	I don't want any signs slippery when wet.
2169860	2172060	I want an abrasive put in the highway
2172060	2175540	and take that sign down, so it's not slippery when wet.
2176500	2179420	I don't want to say to kids, stay away from drugs.
2179420	2181900	I want to make life so interesting for people
2181900	2183340	that they don't want drugs.
2183340	2185380	They don't want to dull their senses.
2185380	2187180	They want to become keen,
2187180	2189540	and they want to become fully aware,
2189580	2194300	I'm using older language and conscious of their surroundings.
2194300	2197580	It is painful to deaden your awareness
2197580	2199460	when life is beautiful,
2199460	2201580	when what you do goes out to people
2201580	2203560	and makes their lives better.
2203560	2205460	In one session at Princeton,
2205460	2207780	I changed the values of many people.
2207780	2211260	They walked out discussing this for years thereafter,
2211260	2213500	and I still get letters today.
2213500	2216980	I went into an area of New York called Hell's Kitchen.
2216980	2221420	The kids there were considered very bad, bad.
2221420	2224260	And the social worker used to wear a necktie and eyeglasses.
2225260	2228740	And anyone that wore eyeglasses when I was a kid was a sissy.
2228740	2231220	And when you wear a necktie and a suit,
2231220	2234640	and you're talking to these kids that rags in the slums,
2235620	2238900	they look at you as an outsider, you're unacceptable to them.
2238900	2242260	So I put a wire recorder out in the front office.
2242260	2244980	And after the social worker talked to the young boy,
2244980	2248060	by the way, they made guns out of water pipe in New York.
2248060	2249140	How many of you knew that?
2249140	2252100	They didn't go and buy guns, they made them.
2252100	2253660	And the social worker picked the gun out,
2253660	2255460	he said, you're gonna take someone's eye hour,
2255460	2257100	wind up in a state penitentiary,
2257100	2259340	hurt your brother and father, you wanna do that?
2259340	2261420	Well, the kid says nothing at all.
2261420	2262420	Now, when the kid walks out,
2262420	2265180	I make a wire recording of the way he talks to his friend.
2265180	2269340	And he said, joy, the guy up front, the social worker.
2269340	2270500	Then I walk over to the store,
2270500	2272100	how'd you make out with Johnny?
2272100	2273620	I had a good talk with the boy.
2273620	2275420	I believe we established rapport.
2275420	2278340	How do you know that?
2278340	2280220	He says, I felt it intuitively.
2281260	2282580	Then I play the tape.
2282580	2284340	By the way, it was a wire recorder.
2284340	2287140	I play the tape of the kid's answers.
2288020	2290300	And he says, I'm grateful so-and-so.
2290300	2293580	I said, no, no, just say, I don't know how to get to Johnny.
2293580	2294900	I know how to get to Billy.
2294900	2298300	I tried eight different methods, none of them worked.
2298300	2301260	So I said, what's when I do next week?
2301300	2303660	I walked in the office, picked up the gun,
2303660	2305660	and I said, I understand you made this gun.
2305660	2307860	He said, I told the guy I made it last week.
2307860	2309100	This is in New York City.
2309100	2311220	I used to make recordings of this.
2311220	2313980	I wanted to use it in a film later.
2313980	2316340	And I picked up the gun, I'm looking at it,
2316340	2317980	and I'm shaking my head.
2317980	2319540	He said, what's the matter with it?
2319540	2321060	Let's come in.
2321060	2324220	The damn pin is an eighth of an inch off center.
2325580	2326740	He says, yeah.
2327900	2329900	And I said, if you put a couple of washers on the side,
2329900	2332180	you can move the pin right on center.
2332180	2334180	He said, hey, do you like here?
2334180	2335660	I said, what, with those jerks?
2335660	2336500	Nah!
2338700	2341140	Can I bring my friends over to meet you?
2341140	2345220	That's people like him with similar values.
2345220	2349660	Then you go to work in their terms, not your terms.
2349660	2353860	Real psychology has to be related to the real world,
2353860	2357660	not theory, not lab experiments in schools
2357660	2359580	where you're not in touch with people,
2359580	2361580	where you don't get the feel of people,
2361580	2366380	where you don't get the sense of their identification
2366380	2367980	with the world around them.
2367980	2370140	I have changed many of those kids.
2370140	2373100	And I brought a gun in for them to look at,
2373100	2374740	and I said, I made this gun.
2374740	2376260	Wow, they said.
2376260	2378700	I sure would like to be able to make a gun like that.
2378700	2380340	That's why I can help you do it.
2380340	2382900	You can, or what do I have to do?
2382900	2385980	I have to learn how to draw a front view of a gun,
2386900	2388540	a side view of a gun.
2391420	2393860	I know I'm going fast and there are a lot of drawings.
2393860	2397660	You have to make three views to the gun so it can be made.
2397660	2400180	He said, you know, I'm gonna learn to do that.
2400180	2402260	So I set them up on a drafting table
2402260	2406380	and I took them from guns to water skis to other things.
2406380	2409340	Today a lot of them are engineering draftsmen.
2409340	2411180	Because they told me that the kids,
2411180	2415340	they only had an IQ of 24, so you can't get to them.
2416140	2419180	Well, I said to one of these kids with an IQ of 24,
2419180	2422460	suppose you wanted to rob that jewelry store across the way.
2422460	2423380	How would you go about it?
2423380	2425260	Any way at all.
2425260	2428260	Well, I said I'd throw a bag of fecal matter in there
2428260	2429940	and the guy gets mad at my friend,
2429940	2432540	he runs there and I clean off the counter.
2433820	2435180	That's where they live.
2435180	2438180	I suppose you wanted to rob the third story,
2438180	2442260	no ladders, no ropes, no weights.
2442260	2444300	How would you get up to the third story?
2445300	2447180	Well, after several days,
2447180	2449900	one of the youngsters came up with a piece of wood.
2449900	2452780	He didn't even know what a wedge was.
2452780	2454860	You see that hunk of wood?
2454860	2457220	I can stick in the bricks and it gets tight,
2457220	2460740	no matter how far the bricks are, one another.
2460740	2463420	And I can climb up to God, he didn't use that language.
2463420	2466060	He was much, much stronger language.
2466060	2468980	I climb up the building and take whatever I want to take.
2468980	2470420	That's how I do it.
2470420	2472380	Well, how do you give people an IQ test
2472380	2474060	to come from a different environment?
2474060	2476060	How do you know what they sense?
2476060	2477620	Do you think that the formalist
2477620	2480580	who tries to structure the nature of intelligence,
2480580	2482780	the nature of creativity,
2482780	2484780	without being creative, can do it?
2486060	2489740	Well, in order to teach children how to become creative,
2489740	2494780	I make a Martian out of rubber with eyes on tentacles
2494780	2496380	and a pointed rear end.
2497860	2500340	And they look at it and they think eh,
2500340	2502660	and I say to them what good are three eyes
2502660	2504260	or four eyes on tentacles?
2504260	2506460	Eventually, we need to look at the back, the front,
2506460	2508620	the side, the top at the same time.
2508620	2510740	And one of the guys had six arms.
2510740	2513340	Well, he can shave, read a book, eat a donut,
2513340	2518060	and drink coffee instead of eh, as we're brought up.
2518060	2520900	If you met a Martian, they had an opening out there.
2520900	2522660	So what's that?
2522660	2524100	Notice the attitude?
2524100	2525300	What is that?
2525300	2527700	Well, if we eat anything that's bad for us,
2527700	2530860	it's ejected right away, not in your system.
2530900	2532780	It goes through your whole system.
2532780	2534340	So you're taught in medical school
2534340	2536900	how wonderful the human body is,
2536900	2538300	how wonderful it is.
2538300	2540740	This isn't true at all.
2540740	2544820	That you're indoctrinated to a set of values that are unreal.
2546020	2549660	And in order for me to get these ideas out there,
2549660	2552980	it's extremely difficult because we need films,
2552980	2556620	we need equipment in order to do that.
2556620	2560700	What the Venus Project has to offer is a way of life
2560700	2563020	without ambiguity, a language
2563020	2567620	that has a much more precise form of communication,
2567620	2570420	to change the relationship between people
2570420	2574260	where the male and female are not given separate roles,
2574260	2575100	where the females say,
2575100	2577340	I want to be a biochemist or a physicist,
2577340	2578700	and she goes that way.
2578700	2582460	When you hand a girl a doll, you're placing a set,
2582460	2584460	you're beginning to manipulate the people.
2584460	2587340	Everybody's afraid of controlling human behavior.
2587340	2589660	You're always controlling behavior.
2589700	2591340	When you pick up your little girl
2591340	2593340	and say, don't play with that little Lutheran boy
2593340	2595780	across the way, and you put him down again,
2595780	2597740	or don't talk to that little Catholic girl
2597740	2598580	across the way.
2598580	2600740	Well, you're always indoctrinating children.
2600740	2603340	Who loves you more than anything in the world?
2603340	2604780	The candy store man.
2604780	2607020	No, your mommy and your daddy.
2607020	2610900	Say, indoctrination continuously.
2610900	2612420	And then all of us together sing,
2612420	2615380	we are free, let's go, we are free.
2615380	2618820	So beware whenever you hear of freedom
2618860	2620980	and all that sort of thing, watch out.
2622340	2624420	Because a real free society,
2624420	2627500	the closest I've ever come to it was in Polynesia.
2627500	2629780	I lived in the South Pacific Islands for a while,
2629780	2632700	and the natives gave me bananas and coconuts.
2632700	2636260	They were very generous, and they had no words for work.
2636260	2637940	Would you believe that?
2637940	2641660	They went fishing all day, they played, they had Lew house.
2641660	2645260	And they said, junk, you know, what you want?
2645260	2648420	And I said, well, I would like an outrigger canoe,
2648420	2649740	and they built one for me.
2651300	2654940	A few days after they brought it to my hut,
2654940	2656900	I heard some rustling outside,
2656900	2659380	and they were all carrying the canoe away.
2659380	2660620	I said, what's going on?
2660620	2661740	You know use.
2662740	2664820	It was a different value system.
2664820	2667620	Now, the men and women walked around nude on the island
2667620	2669380	when I got it a long time ago.
2670740	2673860	And I never saw a native, poke another native,
2673860	2678300	hey, get a load of that chick, none of that, none of that.
2678300	2681140	They looked at the eyes of women when they talked to them.
2681140	2684460	Never, hey, look at that, never at the legs.
2684460	2686780	The motion picture cameras and all the movie theaters
2686780	2689980	are dolling up and down the hind quarters and all.
2689980	2691520	And you wonder why men are like that?
2691520	2692900	They are not like that.
2692900	2695120	They are made like that by culture.
2696180	2697700	Then the missionaries arrived,
2698700	2701260	and the little girls used to come to church, you know,
2701260	2704860	innocent listening, and they put the t-shirts on them.
2706380	2707980	And the girls had no idea
2707980	2709700	why they were putting the t-shirts on them.
2709700	2710780	What's this for?
2710780	2712220	It's like me covering your nose.
2712220	2715020	You can't go into room B unless your nose is covered.
2715020	2718020	Well, the girls cut two holes in the t-shirts
2718020	2719060	and came to church.
2719980	2723300	So we're dealing with many different cultures,
2723300	2725980	subcultures, and values.
2725980	2728020	Our culture, if we are to grow
2728020	2732100	and build a civilization worthy of humankind,
2732100	2734460	we have to have a quantum jump
2734460	2738480	in the way we look at our world, people, and ourselves.
2739500	2744340	The Venus Project is the redesign of a culture
2744340	2747740	in which the elements that comprise the culture
2747740	2748580	are different.
2748580	2751060	For example, our cities are round,
2751060	2753420	not because I like round cities.
2753420	2754720	The city is round.
2754720	2759000	The center of the city has a socially integrated computer.
2759000	2760980	This may be a medical center.
2760980	2762940	This might be an engineering center.
2763060	2764740	And if you work in the medical center,
2764740	2766620	you can live in beautiful gardens
2766620	2768860	with running streams and waterfalls.
2768860	2772860	And every district is the same distance from the center.
2772860	2774220	There are no cars in the city.
2774220	2777500	You get on a conveyor and dial where you want to go to.
2777500	2779820	There's no crime in the city.
2779820	2783860	Just before the public library in the United States,
2783860	2785860	people said, well, you can't really do that.
2785860	2787740	The people never bring back the books.
2787740	2788580	They'll keep them.
2788580	2789580	They won't return them.
2789580	2791620	Of course, all that was incorrect.
2791620	2794700	I want to build a library where any child can walk in,
2794700	2798660	check out a camera, check out art materials,
2798660	2801980	check out water skis, make things available.
2801980	2803380	People don't steal.
2803380	2805460	No one's going to hit you on the head
2805460	2808340	to take your watch off if it's available.
2808340	2812260	Well, how are you going to pay for this central library
2812260	2816780	that gives children these things for nothing?
2816780	2821500	Well, it cost about $50,000 to keep a kid in jail,
2821500	2826900	one year, an adult $75,000 a year.
2826900	2830620	Food, clothing, shelter, dental care.
2830620	2834220	Isn't it easier to do it in a different way?
2834220	2837820	I would love to go to Mexico and say, what's your problem?
2837820	2840860	They say, well, senor, we don't have the modern machinery
2840860	2842140	you have.
2842140	2844500	Give them modern machinery.
2844500	2846340	Build schools for them.
2846340	2848180	And they won't be coming over the border.
2848180	2850460	What makes them come over the border?
2850460	2852940	Hunger, lack of employment.
2852940	2856180	They say, oh, damn Mexicans, you know what I like.
2856180	2858220	There's nothing like that.
2858220	2860980	Everything is shoved by something else.
2860980	2864780	You are told that a tree falls over.
2864780	2867380	You are told that a sailboat sails.
2867380	2872300	A sailboat cannot sail unless acted upon by a resident force
2872300	2873620	called the wind.
2873620	2875180	A tree does not fall.
2875180	2879300	If it rains and it's asymmetric and the soil becomes loose,
2879340	2880780	gravity does the rest.
2880780	2882340	The tree doesn't fall.
2882340	2884700	Plants do not grow.
2884700	2888500	They require radiant energy, nutrients, water,
2888500	2891900	stop any of those things, and the plant stops.
2891900	2897140	Human beings are not self-operating entities.
2897140	2900140	We are operated by many resident forces.
2900140	2902140	Of course, many of us are not aware of that.
2902140	2905860	It looks like we're perfectly free making our own decisions.
2905860	2907660	I know I think for myself.
2907660	2908580	I'm sure you do.
2908580	2910900	That's an illusion, because if you've
2910900	2913860	brought up to believe in the Kennedy rocker,
2913860	2915540	you want one for your home.
2915540	2919100	It'll injure your back, distort your anatomy,
2919100	2922540	but Kennedy had one like that, and I want one like that.
2922540	2926700	When you break the patterns that have been established
2926700	2930380	by existing society, you begin to move people
2930380	2932740	in a new direction.
2932740	2936020	I admit I could get up here and give a very pleasant lecture
2936020	2939980	of how wonderful everything will be in the future.
2939980	2944020	A helicopter in every garage, a house in suburbia,
2944020	2947100	another on the beach, maybe one in Hawaii.
2947100	2948100	This is the future.
2948100	2950380	That is not the future.
2950380	2952660	Those are the illusion generators,
2952660	2955100	and there are lots of them.
2955100	2959780	Gregory once told me that being black and living
2959780	2962900	in the South, Dick Gregory, he said,
2962900	2964940	whenever I was late for work, I couldn't
2964940	2967900	run to the bus, because they would
2967900	2969820	wonder what that blackie was up to.
2973500	2976740	We project our value system into others.
2976740	2981100	We project characteristics into others.
2981100	2985020	We have to find out what we are really like.
2985020	2988180	Now, many people tell me they want to find themselves.
2988180	2990060	This is another ridiculous thing.
2990060	2991460	Who are you going to find?
2991500	2995660	Some jerk at 18, and a different value system at 23,
2995660	2997220	you can never find yourself.
2997220	3000540	If you read, keep up with new ideas, what's self?
3000540	3003500	The self of 20?
3003500	3005900	When I was 15, I was a jerk.
3005900	3008500	And as time went on, I learned more
3008500	3010660	about many different things, and knew
3010660	3014220	how much I had to learn in order to move forward.
3014220	3016380	There is no finding yourself.
3016380	3018100	People come over to me and say, I
3018100	3021140	want to know how I relate to the cosmos.
3021140	3024540	We don't even know how a single self splits.
3024540	3027420	And they want to know how they relate to the cosmos.
3027420	3030340	What a bunch of verbal crap.
3030340	3031860	Really, it's meaningless.
3031860	3035940	And so I'm sorry that I only have one hour
3035940	3040300	to try to give you ideas along different lines.
3040300	3042140	Generally, it takes seminars.
3042140	3046260	It takes a lot of demonstration and films.
3046260	3049380	I did not mean to offend any of you.
3049380	3052220	I hope that I didn't.
3052220	3053900	Thank you for your time.
3053900	3066820	I'm sure the audience has some questions, so fire away.
3066820	3068740	Yes?
3068740	3070580	I teach middle school kids.
3070580	3071740	What do you see?
3071740	3072980	I'm a little hard of hearing.
3072980	3074500	I'm sorry about that.
3074500	3076100	I teach middle school kids, and I
3076100	3079420	wondered some of your philosophies of education.
3079420	3082060	OK, got the point.
3082060	3085060	For example, in our city design, we have big lakes.
3085060	3086460	We've made all these lakes.
3086460	3087060	They exist.
3087060	3087940	It's real.
3087940	3090700	We have modern structures there, all different.
3090700	3093300	Roxanne said to me, my associate, she said,
3093300	3096420	I just don't want to draw pretty pictures of buildings.
3096420	3097460	I want to build them.
3097460	3098700	I want to make them.
3098700	3100620	And she did all the cement work.
3100620	3102300	And one day she came over and she said,
3102300	3103740	how about a swimming pool?
3103740	3105140	And she was with a girlfriend.
3105180	3107060	I said, when do you girls want to start?
3107060	3108420	Well, we never built a pool.
3108420	3110900	They built it in two weeks, a beautiful pool.
3110900	3112700	We'll show you pictures of it.
3112700	3115780	And so we built a big lake in the city.
3115780	3117620	And there's a hill in the middle of the lake,
3117620	3120300	about 80 feet up out of the water.
3120300	3122100	And on top of the hill is a craft shop
3122100	3124780	where children can build anything they want to build.
3124780	3126220	But in order to get there, you've
3126220	3128060	got to get in a boat and row it.
3128060	3130380	Instead of lining them up and say, come on, everybody
3130380	3132740	together, forward, backward now.
3132740	3135060	Arrange the environment so you have
3135100	3136700	to row to get to the hill.
3136700	3139220	You have to climb the hill to get to the craft shop.
3139220	3142460	And an automobile or anything you build will not go together
3142460	3144420	unless four children pick up the car
3144420	3145700	and the others put the wheels on.
3145700	3147700	Instead of saying, I want you people to work together
3147700	3149580	and cooperate and stop fighting.
3149580	3152500	Arrange things so that it works that way.
3152500	3154500	That's what nature does.
3154500	3158460	When a fox, a baby fox, sees a porcupine,
3158460	3160140	it says, we know what have we here.
3160140	3161300	I don't know.
3161300	3162700	And he gets close to the porcupine.
3162700	3164500	Finally, he gets a quill.
3164500	3166580	And he stays away from the porcupine.
3166580	3168860	But if you raise your children and try
3168860	3173340	to avoid experiences that had hurt you
3173340	3176220	and you buy them every toy that they want,
3176220	3179940	you produce a blob of jello.
3179940	3184860	Some degree of challenge, some degree of stress is necessary.
3184860	3189340	And so we build an environment, try to answer your question,
3189340	3191540	where the elements so arranged has
3191540	3194980	to produce what you call creativity.
3194980	3197740	Can I give you one more bit on that?
3197740	3198740	All right.
3198740	3202700	Is there anyone else interested in creativity in children?
3202700	3204020	You raise your hands?
3204020	3204940	OK.
3204940	3210380	What we do is we, I ask a child to make a drawing.
3210380	3211340	Anything they want to draw.
3211340	3213100	And this is what they usually do.
3213100	3214780	Can everybody see the blackboard?
3214780	3216180	Well, I'll draw it up here.
3216180	3219180	They draw something like this.
3219220	3221660	I'm talking about four and five-year-olds.
3226140	3228300	Then they draw something like this.
3231700	3235140	And then most of them do something like this.
3238340	3240540	I'm sure you've all seen those drawings.
3240540	3244500	In fact, I'm sure many of you draw that way today.
3244500	3246980	And so the teacher gives them some crayon,
3246980	3249100	and they color it, and she hangs it up.
3249140	3250980	This is a little Billy's drawing.
3250980	3255980	But when she tells Billy that this is the way we spell cat,
3255980	3257860	and Billy says, I see.
3257860	3260220	And he comes back with something like this.
3263740	3264940	Can you see that?
3264940	3266660	The teacher says, that's wrong.
3266660	3267860	That isn't wrong.
3267860	3270100	Most of it is appropriate.
3270100	3272220	It's just this that we change.
3272220	3274340	So I say very close.
3274340	3278980	We just substitute this with something like this.
3278980	3284500	Then the child comes back again with something like this.
3284500	3287660	I say much closer, much better.
3287660	3291660	Only we turn this around so you can put the A inside of it.
3291660	3295740	Say whatever you have to say to get the idea across.
3295740	3298900	Instead of saying, well, that isn't what I told you.
3298900	3300660	Well, all you're just using that child
3300660	3304340	as an outlet for insufficiency.
3304340	3306580	Then I do this with the children.
3306580	3310100	I have them draw the letter T. And I say,
3310100	3312060	which one of these looked like a peach pit?
3314700	3316780	The child generally picks this.
3316780	3318940	I see you, those of you back there,
3318940	3320660	I'm sure you can't see that.
3320660	3323220	And the blackboard is fully cluttered.
3323220	3325060	And I don't have here.
3325060	3327180	I'll try to clear your head.
3327180	3334180	Where most of you can see, the child draws a letter T.
3334180	3336500	And he draws a peach pit in the middle.
3336500	3339660	Then he draws one peach pit here and one there.
3339660	3342580	And he takes out the middle peach pit.
3342580	3345260	Then I say, what is this?
3345260	3347460	They say, that's a bunch of birdies flying.
3347460	3349220	It's good.
3349220	3352420	You move down a peach pit and a half
3352420	3357140	and draw the letter V upside down.
3357140	3360340	And the child draws a letter V upside down.
3360340	3365020	Then he draws a birdie under the V.
3365020	3368940	One peach pit down like this.
3368940	3372060	And then he joins another birdie to that and a half
3372060	3375020	round beneath that and one peach pit above.
3375020	3375940	He does this.
3375940	3378540	And then I say to the child, what is this?
3378540	3379900	That's a hide.
3379900	3381100	That's good.
3381100	3383580	Half a hide from the top of the eyebrow
3383580	3385540	to the bottom of the nose.
3385540	3390660	And they move from that offensive drawing made by the child
3390660	3395700	to this in less than a half hour.
3395700	3398340	And I'm talking about five and six year olds
3398340	3401500	moving into this realm, drawing sports cars,
3401500	3403540	turning them around.
3403540	3406580	And we give them crayon and chalk
3406580	3409980	because we want them to bring out their artistic ability.
3409980	3413460	You can't bring out anything if there's no basis
3413460	3415500	or structure for it.
3415500	3419220	If you sit in the woods and meditate on your navel
3419220	3422860	for three years, you'll have a tremendously clear picture
3422860	3426260	of the navel and nothing more.
3426260	3428900	So you have to work to get information.
3428900	3432340	You have to arrange things so that it generates
3432340	3435660	what you call creativity.
3435660	3438940	Now a psychologist in one session
3438940	3441340	said that, well, I know two children that
3441340	3443180	came from the same environment.
3443180	3444900	And if environment is everything,
3444900	3447820	one turned out to be a gangster, the other a minister.
3447860	3451500	If environment is everything, how do you get those differences?
3451500	3455380	The minute you pick up one child and start playing with it
3455380	3457460	and the other stands there with that little,
3457460	3460020	you're making jealousy and envy.
3460020	3462180	There's no such thing as the same environment.
3462180	3463620	So when I pick up my little girl,
3463620	3466740	I pick up my older little boy.
3466740	3469140	You never work with one child.
3469140	3471300	Why can't you keep your area clean?
3471300	3473100	Your brother does all the time.
3473100	3474700	You leave all your things around.
3474700	3476820	Well, when he trips and falls down the stairs,
3476860	3478620	his brother smiles.
3478620	3480580	An inhibited smile of course.
3480580	3481820	But he does smile.
3481820	3485860	So we build these artificialities
3485860	3487940	in the world we live in today.
3487940	3490620	We've got to interfere and change things.
3490620	3492180	Those of you that would like to know more
3492180	3493820	about the Venus Project,
3493820	3496420	we have a video, a tape, and a book
3496420	3501340	introducing the basic conceptual layout
3501340	3503220	of what it's about.
3503220	3504580	Any other questions?
3504580	3506740	I can't go in in more detail.
3506740	3507980	Yes?
3507980	3510500	I find you're curious about the future interest there,
3510500	3513020	but how do you account for human nature?
3513020	3514220	How do I account for what?
3514220	3515220	Human nature.
3515220	3516820	Human nature.
3516820	3521820	Human nature is the way people have found
3522180	3526760	other people to behave over many long years.
3526760	3531300	They appear to manifest greed, jealousy,
3531300	3533660	envy, even animals.
3533700	3536900	If you take a cat and put it on your lap
3536900	3541020	in the presence of the dog, the dog may growl.
3542140	3544580	And it's like, oh, that's what I mean
3544580	3547420	by the nature of the beast.
3547420	3550580	So I said, come on down to my lab in about a week.
3550580	3552780	So I picked up my cat, put it on my lap
3552780	3554780	and the dog says, oh, it's wagging.
3555700	3557740	Because you reinforce the dog
3557740	3560180	before you pick up the cat and put it.
3560180	3563620	The cat is a threat to the dog's security.
3563620	3567180	The dog wants you to pet it, not the cat.
3567180	3570860	So you give the dog these ambivalent feelings,
3570860	3572900	but you can have 15 kids in the room
3572900	3575300	without jealousy, without envy.
3575300	3577180	It is not human nature.
3577180	3581780	It's human behavior that's shaped by culture.
3581780	3585340	Like I said, if you were brought up in China years ago,
3585340	3587140	you'd walk with your hands in your sleeves
3587140	3590140	and shuffle and wear a long pigtail.
3590140	3591660	And so, well, that's human nature.
3591660	3592500	That's not.
3592500	3595700	That's the influence of environment on your behavior.
3595700	3598620	Dancing is the same thing.
3598620	3600380	Dancers change over time.
3600380	3603260	Music changes over time.
3603260	3607380	So there is really no human nature.
3607380	3609300	Think about it, toss it around.
3609300	3612980	There is varying degrees of human behavior.
3612980	3615900	If we wish to understand the factors
3615900	3618340	that generate our value system,
3618340	3620980	that generate the way we look at the world,
3620980	3623780	we have to go back in time and study these things.
3623780	3624620	I'm sorry again.
3624620	3627260	I can't go into much more detail,
3627260	3631340	just a general overview of the Venus Project.
3631340	3632340	Yes?
3632340	3634020	You mentioned a universal language.
3634020	3636100	Are you speaking about something like Esperanto?
3636100	3637700	No, that wouldn't do.
3637700	3639100	Or interlingua?
3639100	3640580	No, that wouldn't do.
3640580	3644060	The language has to have a physical reference.
3644060	3645900	In other words, that means that,
3646900	3654180	suppose we took some tungsten and hid it with high-pitched sound,
3654180	3656260	and bouncing off that tungsten,
3656260	3661820	a pattern occurred on a screen that looked like that.
3661820	3664980	Now, this was the nickel, and this is the iron,
3664980	3668300	and we learned how to chart that pattern.
3668300	3672300	When you wrote tungsten, you do this in the future.
3672300	3677100	So it's always like chemistry, like a pharmacologist
3677100	3681060	reads a prescription, assuming the doctor's handwriting is good.
3681060	3683860	Look at that prescription, and it turns out the same product.
3683860	3687220	We don't want individuality in that area.
3687220	3689700	We want uniformity.
3689700	3692260	Is there a place for individuality?
3692260	3696780	You know, in the next few years, the word individuality
3696780	3702060	will go the way all the other crude and vulgar terms went.
3703020	3706100	When you buy a Mercedes, if you can afford it,
3706100	3709140	and you turn the key, you want it to start, not sometimes,
3709140	3710220	all the time.
3710220	3712220	And when you turn, you want it to turn.
3712220	3715100	And when you put the brakes on, you want it to stop.
3715100	3719260	So it's called quality control.
3719260	3723740	Variations in human behavior, which we call individuality
3723740	3727700	today, is poor quality control.
3727700	3729900	In the future, the question of people,
3729980	3733660	then wouldn't everybody be uniform then?
3733660	3735340	Well, the question of uniformity is such
3735340	3737540	and just that they will uniformly,
3737540	3743140	like anyone they meet, uniformly share ideas and resources,
3743140	3746260	uniformly share knowledge with everyone else,
3746260	3749020	and uniformly courteous with everyone else.
3749020	3751060	That's the only kind of uniformity.
3751060	3755460	As far as the accumulation of wealth, property, and power,
3755460	3759500	this would be considered part of the age of the Bulgarians.
3759820	3762060	To us, this is all normal.
3762060	3766060	This is a thing to do, to become successful.
3766060	3769740	Well, in my early days, I wanted to be successful,
3769740	3771940	and a company came to me and said,
3771940	3774500	we have a bunch of Mexican women and Indian women
3774500	3777700	that sit at a conveyor belt, and they pick the black beans,
3777700	3780220	and they pick the white beans, throw them in another box,
3780220	3783180	and they said, can you improve that?
3783180	3784940	I said, how far do you want to go?
3786620	3788220	How many beans can you deliver?
3788220	3789860	So what I did in the early days
3789860	3793300	is I built a big bicycle wheel with hollow spokes
3793300	3795100	that turned like an airplane propeller
3795100	3800580	into a vat of beans, sucking up one bean to each vacuum tube.
3800580	3802580	And then there was a photoelectric cell here.
3802580	3805180	If the bean was black, it tripped it with a wire.
3805180	3807060	And as you sit and watch, those beans
3807060	3808820	went up like this in the big vat.
3808820	3810900	And in eight hours, we did the work
3810900	3813820	that 50 women took three months to do.
3814820	3818260	Now, I would like my machines to come in,
3818260	3820660	but I would like them to get a shorter workday,
3820660	3822340	an increase in purchasing power.
3822340	3825620	If machines do not improve the lives of people
3825620	3827500	that work in automobile factories,
3827500	3829780	if they're automated out of existence,
3829780	3832980	so will you be automated out of existence.
3833820	3835740	All of us can be automated out.
3835740	3839180	Roxanne recently had some area,
3839180	3842260	she does architectural rendering, site plans.
3842660	3846780	There are machines that do that some years ago, CAD.
3846780	3849300	There are machines today that make models.
3849300	3853140	If you take a vase and put it on the table and it's scanned,
3853140	3856980	they have a laser beam that penetrates the fluid
3856980	3861300	and solidifies that fluid in the exact shape of that vase.
3861300	3864980	You can do it to England, China, anywhere in the world.
3864980	3866780	And I want to repeat this.
3866780	3870420	Machines today, that is three months ago,
3870420	3874900	could handle 500 trillion bits of information per second.
3874900	3877380	I don't care how many humans you get together,
3877380	3881340	there's no place for human behavior in the next 20 years.
3881340	3885420	There's no place for human participation in the next 20 years,
3885420	3887340	or maybe less.
3887340	3890380	No one can predict the future precisely.
3890380	3894180	I am not gentle, I don't pull my punches, I can't afford it.
3894180	3896660	I respect you, I like you too much.
3896660	3899140	I would rather tell you things as they are,
3899140	3901700	not generate additional illusions.
