0	7640	By the end of this video, you'll understand this. A Hopf vibration. You may have heard
7640	13760	mathematician Eric Weinstein comment on Joe Rogan. Hopf. And this is going to be H-O-P-F.
13760	20480	H-O-P-F. You are looking at the most important object in the universe. What?
20480	27360	Discovered by Heinz Hopf in 1931, Hopf fiber bundles hop up in at least eight different
27360	34280	physics situations. So what you are seeing is, as legendary physicist Roger Penrose put it,
34280	40840	an element of the architecture of our world. We'll build to an understanding of the Hopf
40840	46200	vibration and the fewest steps necessary. If you're not yet familiar with higher dimensional
46200	53080	shapes, you might want to first watch my video explaining a 4D hypercube known as the Tesseract,
53080	60200	linked above and below. In my opinion, hypercubes are easier to understand than hyperspheres,
60200	65440	and that video more gradually builds from the 0th to the 4th dimension.
65440	74640	So what's the simplest definition of a Hopf vibration? It's just a map from a hypersphere
74640	84240	in 4D onto a sphere in 3D. How is it mapped? A sphere is fully covered by points. Each
84240	91080	point is mapped to a circle from the hypersphere. The circles are the fibers that compose the
91080	103240	hypersphere. We'll unpack this in a bit, but first we need
103240	109120	to briefly cover the concept of stereographic projection, which is the process of mapping
109120	116560	a sphere onto a plane. First, imagine a light source at the north pole of this circle in
116560	122000	2D. As this light beam passes through the circumference, you can see there is projection
122000	129040	of a purple point on the x-axis in 1D. Now here we have the light source at the north
129040	134720	pole of the sphere in 3D. As the light passes through the boundary, you can see a circle
134720	141400	is projected onto the 2D plane. Note how the circle is larger closer to the north pole.
141400	149240	Next, we inflate a polyhedron with four colored faces. We project in all directions from a
149240	154800	fixed point on the north pole. You can see how the faces on the sphere are projected
154800	162360	onto the two-dimensional plane below. We are demonstrating how a circle or sphere
162360	168440	appears in lower dimensions, so we can build intuition of how a hypersphere projects into
168440	176760	one lower dimension, the third dimension. The top row is the view of a circle or sphere
176760	183160	in what you might call their traditional space, 2D for the circle and 3D for the sphere. The
183160	189280	bottom row is how that is projected onto a lower-dimensional plane. Before we explain
189280	195440	the hop-fibration, it's important to note I'm skimming over imaginary numbers, quaternions,
195440	200680	and the complex plane to keep this as straightforward as possible. But if you wish to dive into
200680	208040	the nitty-gritty math, there are links in the description.
208040	213920	In our first example, we are stereographically projecting from the north pole of a sphere.
213920	224040	As we rotate around the circle, you can see how this one point corresponds to one circle.
224040	238160	If we view this continuously, all of the circles fill up the hypersphere.
238160	244120	Let's track just one point as it moves from north to south. We'll start at the equator.
244120	249200	The red point on the sphere relates to the red circle within the hypersphere. The white
249200	258600	torus or doughnut corresponds to connected points around an axis.
258600	263120	As the point spins southward, you can see the circle getting smaller and tighter around
263120	268720	the center, until it's a non-skewed circle through the south pole. As the point moves
268720	275080	north, the corresponding circle gets much larger until, when it goes to true north,
275080	280600	it appears as a straight line. It's hard to imagine, but this is actually a circle
280600	287240	through infinity. This is how the circles would appear around a single axis, say the
287240	293760	equator. It's easy to see this interaction if we look at just two complex points and
293760	300600	their complementary circles.
300600	307640	As you view them move around an axis, you can see how they are linked like a chain.
307640	318220	A third linked circle joins the dance. And we can keep on adding circles to fit the
318220	326240	entire hypersphere. Algebraic topology professor Niles Johnson at Ohio State University created
326240	331800	this excellent visualization of the hopf vibration with its corresponding points on
331800	341040	a sphere. Some hopf vibration facts. None of the circles intersect. Each circle links
341040	348960	to every other circle exactly once. True south, in 3D, is a circle at the core of the hopf
348960	355880	vibration. Visualize this as the tightest circle in the center of the torus or doughnut.
355880	362240	True north, in 3D, is that circle through infinity. Remember, this is the stereographic
362240	370120	projection of the hypersphere in our familiar three dimensions.
370120	375200	While this is running, two plugs. First, if you're enjoying this video, please subscribe
375200	382520	to my channel. And second, I highly recommend a similar visualizer and interactive tool
382520	388880	created by Nico Belmonte. It allows you to draw your own circles within the hopf vibration
388880	395640	and rotate the structure as well. This awesome learning tool is linked below in the description.
395640	401200	And now we stereographically project these villarso circles on a few latitudes on the
401200	409680	sphere. As this runs, I need to recommend the excellent resource dimensions-math.org and
409680	415840	the corresponding Joe Slay's YouTube channel. Joe's and a team of brilliant minds created
415840	421240	an amazing nine-part series on dimensions, which you should check out. Many of the visuals
421240	426240	in this video come from that series, which they so graciously distributed under a Creative
426240	433280	Commons license. Everything is linked below in the description. We then rotate around
433280	435400	for the space.
463920	469800	I also want to share some still images of the hopf vibration from another angle, which
469800	476840	I think better illustrates the fiber-bundledness of the structure. While we're here, why not
476840	483280	take a ride inside a hopf vibration? You can see all the circles which look like lines
483280	491120	are made up of zero-dimensional points, which kind of look like spheres. As we mentioned
491120	499680	earlier, the hopf vibration is a fundamental element across a range of physics applications.
499680	505120	Even if you'll never understand these advanced physics concepts, I hope you gained an intuitive
505120	509880	understanding of an essential feature of our universe, the hopf vibration.
551120	572400	Thank you for watching, and please like and subscribe.
