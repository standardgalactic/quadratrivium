00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
The holographic principle is basically,

00:02.000 --> 00:05.240
and a hologram at any point is the information

00:05.240 --> 00:07.920
for the whole object, the whole scene,

00:07.920 --> 00:10.520
the whole cup, the whole ball, the whole plate.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.920
Berkson was far more famous than Einstein

00:12.920 --> 00:14.840
in the first two decades of the 20th century,

00:14.840 --> 00:17.480
which is kind of mind-boggling just to think of now.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.360
Berkson and Einstein had a history in 1922, I believe.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.800
The story is the myth perhaps is that that debate

00:23.800 --> 00:26.640
prevented Einstein from winning the Nobel Prize that year.

00:26.640 --> 00:27.480
Is that true?

00:27.480 --> 00:28.520
Yes, right.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.800
There was only one problem, and that was that

00:30.800 --> 00:34.120
there was a war going on, and I had been drafted

00:34.120 --> 00:35.960
as soon as I got out of the seminary

00:35.960 --> 00:39.720
because my draft status was no longer 4D, which was exempt.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.240
So I ended up going into the Marine Corps,

00:42.240 --> 00:46.160
and I was actually in a long-range reconnaissance group

00:46.160 --> 00:47.760
plowing through the jungle triumph,

00:47.760 --> 00:52.280
with six guys in the middle of nowhere in the jungle

00:52.280 --> 00:54.520
being dropped up in helicopters, et cetera, et cetera.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.560
One of Gibson's big ideas was affordance theory, right?

00:57.560 --> 00:59.200
He was that we see...

00:59.200 --> 01:01.200
Affordance is a big thing, yes.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.920
We see what is the usefulness of the objects,

01:04.920 --> 01:06.400
and we see that kind of space.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.680
It reminds me quite a bit of Donald Hoffman's theories

01:09.680 --> 01:12.160
around we see the world in terms of

01:12.160 --> 01:14.200
one of the most fit for us as organisms

01:14.200 --> 01:16.520
rather than what's actually there.

01:16.520 --> 01:18.880
But I know you've done a video on Hoffman.

01:18.880 --> 01:19.720
Right.

01:19.720 --> 01:22.240
We're gonna blow Hoffman away here, but let me go back.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.320
Just for one...

01:24.320 --> 01:26.000
Could you tell us about that mystical experience,

01:26.000 --> 01:27.600
what that was like?

01:27.600 --> 01:30.400
Shall we say all of a sudden just kind of

01:30.400 --> 01:33.920
laying on the deck, kind of like, wow, what's going on?

01:33.920 --> 01:37.320
And what one felt was that suddenly

01:37.320 --> 01:40.880
that there was this other being that you actually were.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.120
And this being was infinite.

01:43.120 --> 01:48.120
You and this being had been the same being forever.

01:49.440 --> 01:53.800
I guess I'm reminded of a statement by Thomas Merton,

01:53.840 --> 01:56.440
the great contemplative monk that a Catholic contemplative

01:56.440 --> 02:00.680
monk in a statement was in true contemplative state,

02:00.680 --> 02:03.320
or actually he meant a mystical state.

02:03.320 --> 02:08.320
All concept of sin dissolves because this being

02:08.960 --> 02:13.280
that you are is obviously a divine being and cannot sin.

02:13.280 --> 02:16.680
And so when you brought up in the Catholic framework,

02:16.680 --> 02:20.080
sin is very much a doctrine and a dogma,

02:20.080 --> 02:22.000
and you're worried about mortal sins and venial sins

02:22.000 --> 02:23.600
and confessing sins and so on and so forth.

02:23.600 --> 02:27.240
The whole thing just dissolved because it's felt to be ridiculous.

02:27.240 --> 02:31.920
It's felt to be no longer applicable.

02:31.920 --> 02:36.120
And the whole world was just one gigantic sea of love, you know?

02:36.120 --> 02:39.080
I mean, the ecstasy was so intense,

02:39.080 --> 02:41.640
I almost had to have it turned off.

02:41.640 --> 02:44.360
And there was another interesting concept

02:44.360 --> 02:46.800
that must have come from deep in my being

02:46.800 --> 02:50.400
because I got this, all is just.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.720
There was another was justice, everything.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.840
I must have been worried about injustice.

02:54.840 --> 02:58.320
I still am, but at that time it was like,

02:58.320 --> 02:59.800
well, everything is just.

02:59.800 --> 03:03.080
So it was very intense ecstatic experience.

03:03.080 --> 03:07.440
Rather, each instant penetrates,

03:07.440 --> 03:09.600
permeates the next, like the notes of a melody,

03:09.600 --> 03:12.840
each note penetrates, permeates the next.

03:12.840 --> 03:16.120
Some melodic transformation, organic continuity.

03:16.120 --> 03:19.040
How is these bits, how are they suddenly becoming

03:19.040 --> 03:22.000
concrete coffee cups with liquid in them?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.440
Stirring, rotating, right?

03:23.440 --> 03:27.480
Come on, when you look at the conception, it's ludicrous.

03:27.480 --> 03:31.040
It is not Berkson's conception of holographic feel.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.680
It's a 2D bit hologram.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.920
Sorry, but not the same thing.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.080
Not even worth looking.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.080
See, you got me mad.

03:41.080 --> 03:42.520
No, that's okay.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.280
I mean, you're passionate about it, I get it.

03:44.280 --> 03:48.280
How is this theory, Berkson in general,

03:48.280 --> 03:50.160
how does this influence your day-to-day life

03:50.200 --> 03:52.280
for your moment's moment existence, if it does at all?

03:52.280 --> 03:57.280
I, for one, think that science, physics, psychology,

03:58.800 --> 04:02.840
cognitive science, given Berkson's framework,

04:02.840 --> 04:07.840
absolutely backs the spiritual vision of man,

04:08.720 --> 04:11.720
the Zen vision, if nothing more,

04:11.720 --> 04:14.800
but probably also the Hindu vision

04:14.800 --> 04:18.040
of what our actual capabilities are.

04:18.080 --> 04:20.360
I think that there's no conflict between science

04:20.360 --> 04:25.040
and this whole notion that's permeating people's minds

04:25.040 --> 04:30.040
right now that neuroscience says we're just human robot forms

04:32.280 --> 04:34.840
with no spiritual component whatsoever

04:34.840 --> 04:37.480
is utterly destroyed by Berkson

04:37.480 --> 04:42.320
and gives us a very solid grounding in science

04:43.440 --> 04:47.360
and our own mystical experience that supports it.

04:47.400 --> 04:51.800
So I guess bottom line from that perspective,

04:51.800 --> 04:53.920
Berkson is a great comfort.

04:54.720 --> 04:59.720
And if people wanna shed the transhumanist vision

04:59.880 --> 05:03.600
of the idea where we're gonna all get a nice bunch of chips

05:03.600 --> 05:05.600
because it's just all we really are anyhow

05:05.600 --> 05:07.720
and just become enhanced robots.

05:07.720 --> 05:11.800
And also there is no God, there's no karmic laws

05:11.800 --> 05:14.120
and et cetera, et cetera that they'll get into Berkson

05:14.200 --> 05:19.200
and you'll see quickly how just shallow and superficial

05:20.240 --> 05:22.040
and understanding they actually are.

05:22.040 --> 05:24.640
I don't include people like Sam Harris or Daniel Dennett,

05:24.640 --> 05:26.440
et cetera, these people are in my mind

05:26.440 --> 05:28.480
are extremely badly misled

05:28.480 --> 05:31.880
because they extremely do not understand

05:31.880 --> 05:34.880
the problem of consciousness and time.

05:34.880 --> 05:39.000
So that's one thing, after that, it's been a giant pain

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
because I never thought that after 50,

05:46.760 --> 05:50.920
what are we, 50 years that this particular conception

05:50.920 --> 05:53.080
would be so buried yet.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.200
It's buried in cognitive science

05:55.200 --> 05:57.520
that no one wants to look at.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.800
It's buried in memory theory,

05:59.800 --> 06:01.080
it's buried in perception theory.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.680
It's buried by the Getzonians for great sake.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.040
They won't even look at it.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.720
It's buried by the Berksonians for that matter.

06:07.720 --> 06:11.240
Even Berksonian philosophers can't deal with it.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.200
I can just feel it, they don't want to deal with it.

06:13.200 --> 06:16.280
Oh, it's too much, can't deal with that.

06:16.280 --> 06:19.960
So it's become a frustrating pain

06:19.960 --> 06:23.280
and I feel like my life's mission has been a bust.

06:23.280 --> 06:26.240
So I feel right now, let me tell you the truth,

06:26.240 --> 06:27.800
it's been a good, it was a good try.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.480
Maybe someone later will come along

06:29.480 --> 06:33.000
and take it up because right now, to me,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.280
it's completely being ignored.

06:35.280 --> 06:38.440
Steve Robbins has a PhD in educational psych and psychology

06:38.440 --> 06:39.760
from the University of Minnesota

06:39.760 --> 06:41.600
with a focus on cognitive science.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.520
His thesis covered turn of the 20th century

06:43.520 --> 06:45.480
French philosopher Henri Berkson

06:45.480 --> 06:47.080
and his alternative model of mind.

06:47.080 --> 06:47.920
In the decades since,

06:47.920 --> 06:49.880
he's published academic journal articles

06:49.880 --> 06:52.320
and three books on Berkson slash consciousness.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.320
Before his doctoral work,

06:53.320 --> 06:55.800
he served as a Marine Infantry Officer in Vietnam.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.600
After 33 years in the software industry,

06:57.600 --> 07:00.080
he's now retired on a mini farm in Wisconsin

07:00.080 --> 07:02.280
and runs a YouTube channel with over 80 videos

07:02.280 --> 07:04.880
dedicated to Berkson and his holographic theory.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.160
Steve, thanks for coming on.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.440
Oh, thank you.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.720
It's a pleasure.

07:08.720 --> 07:13.480
Yeah, it's so great to see you and get to chat with you.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.120
I've discovered your channel many weeks ago

07:16.120 --> 07:21.000
and have been digesting each video, they're dense,

07:21.000 --> 07:22.800
but I highly recommend people check them out.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.640
After this conversation, I'll link all of your,

07:25.640 --> 07:27.080
link to your YouTube channel and your website

07:27.080 --> 07:28.240
in the description of my video.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.440
Right, right.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.640
It's a tiny point, either in space,

07:31.640 --> 07:33.600
somewhere in the channel.

07:35.480 --> 07:36.320
Yes, yes.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.640
Which takes a voyage to discover it currently.

07:39.640 --> 07:40.800
Yeah, absolutely.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.440
A lot of competition, you have to,

07:43.440 --> 07:45.160
it's a tough market.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.720
I know, I'm a similar size channel, so I get it.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.080
So Steve, it'd be great if we could kick us off.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.960
I know you have some prepared slides.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.000
If you want, you can pull those up.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.120
I'd love to, I know you have some at the beginning

07:59.120 --> 08:01.120
that goes through your background a little bit

08:01.120 --> 08:03.240
in even more detail, because I love to learn.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.160
I know our audience will have some context on you

08:06.160 --> 08:10.760
to get your story and to figure out what's intrigued you

08:10.760 --> 08:12.440
so much about Berkson.

08:12.440 --> 08:15.320
I consider you one of the world's experts on Berkson.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.000
So if you wouldn't mind, yeah, pulling that up,

08:18.000 --> 08:21.680
we can get into individuals of your story are great too.

08:21.680 --> 08:25.240
I think seeing the trajectory of your career.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.840
We're gonna have to go visual as you noted,

08:27.840 --> 08:30.120
because there's a lot here to comprehend

08:30.120 --> 08:34.400
that two talking heads make it very slow to get across.

08:34.400 --> 08:37.760
So some pictures work well.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.320
Yes, for the viewers, if you like visuals,

08:40.320 --> 08:45.320
Steve provides a lot of visuals on his YouTube channel

08:45.440 --> 08:47.800
and extensive quotes that help elucidate

08:47.800 --> 08:49.720
the concepts you're trying to get across.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.040
We were thinking about beginning where,

08:52.040 --> 08:56.000
how it began with, well, where I come from, I guess is the...

08:56.000 --> 08:57.160
Yeah, let's get your background.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.400
Where'd you grow up?

09:01.400 --> 09:03.400
So I'm basically a Minnesota native.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.760
I'm sitting in Wisconsin right now,

09:05.760 --> 09:07.560
a little bit north of Milwaukee.

09:08.720 --> 09:13.520
I spent a good chunk of my life, like seven years

09:13.520 --> 09:16.400
as a Franciscan seminarian,

09:16.400 --> 09:18.680
down in Chicago and ultimately in Illinois.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.800
In fact, there was a good picture of,

09:21.800 --> 09:23.760
there's my seminary in Illinois and West by Illinois.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.280
And that's not me, but that's some Franciscan.

09:27.120 --> 09:30.560
Just to give a context of what I'm talking about.

09:30.560 --> 09:35.560
Because I spent the last year in 1966 in the vichit

09:35.560 --> 09:37.360
where you're actually dressed up in a habit

09:37.360 --> 09:39.600
and walking around with your cord and your rosary

09:39.600 --> 09:41.200
and et cetera, et cetera.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.760
But I decided to...

09:43.760 --> 09:46.680
Can you tell us what you're up against?

09:46.680 --> 09:49.360
Do you mind giving us some context as to why you

09:49.360 --> 09:52.680
were temporarily, you joined the Franciscan order?

09:53.520 --> 09:55.160
Yeah, I would say this.

09:55.160 --> 10:00.160
My folks were very Catholic, very dedicated, very devout.

10:00.280 --> 10:05.280
And I had some sort of, shall I say, affinity toward this.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.520
I remember reading The Life of St. Francis,

10:09.520 --> 10:12.520
Perfect Joy St. Francis when I was seven years old.

10:12.520 --> 10:16.320
And that already started me off right there.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.160
I was going to be a Franciscan.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.720
Wow, at seven.

10:19.720 --> 10:24.080
Yeah, that division experience was quite the deal.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.240
I was, you know, you got up at midnight

10:26.240 --> 10:29.320
and chanted office, the divine office for an hour

10:29.320 --> 10:31.200
and then meditated and then went back to bed

10:31.200 --> 10:35.680
and got back up at six and did more chanting

10:35.680 --> 10:39.400
of the divine office, you know, tourism logs

10:39.400 --> 10:42.920
or whatever in Latin and then go through the whole day.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.760
There was no talking, et cetera.

10:45.760 --> 10:49.400
But I left in the spring of 1966

10:49.400 --> 10:53.200
because I decided ultimately after seven years

10:53.200 --> 10:55.720
and lots of Latin and Greek and German

10:57.720 --> 11:00.840
the interesting education that was available at the time

11:00.840 --> 11:05.840
in that environment that it wasn't quite the fit for me.

11:06.520 --> 11:11.520
And so I ended up going to the University of Minnesota.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.640
I had to finish off my undergrad.

11:15.640 --> 11:19.600
I crammed two years into one year at Minnesota

11:19.600 --> 11:22.440
and I was in psychology and political science.

11:22.440 --> 11:25.240
I was actually political science was my thing.

11:25.240 --> 11:28.280
But I liked psychology in the mind.

11:28.280 --> 11:33.280
And, but that, that little place there was the absolute

11:33.280 --> 11:37.920
haunt of skin air and behaviorism and his rats.

11:37.920 --> 11:42.920
And the very last course I had in the spring of 66

11:44.800 --> 11:47.240
was by a professor from Michigan

11:48.120 --> 11:51.320
who was teaching Piaget and cognitive development

11:51.320 --> 11:53.800
and the whole theory that actually there's something

11:53.800 --> 11:57.160
in the brain that skinner denied.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.440
For skinner you weren't even supposed to,

11:59.440 --> 12:00.680
the brain was off limits.

12:00.680 --> 12:04.840
You didn't look in the brain, but here you have Piaget

12:04.840 --> 12:06.440
talking about cognitive development.

12:06.440 --> 12:11.440
And that somehow turned me back on to psychology

12:11.440 --> 12:16.440
and there was only one problem and that was this,

12:17.880 --> 12:20.840
that there was a war going on.

12:20.840 --> 12:25.840
And I had been drafted as soon as I got out of the seminary

12:25.840 --> 12:29.280
because my draft status was no longer 4D,

12:29.280 --> 12:30.800
which was exempt.

12:30.800 --> 12:34.240
And so I ended up going into the Marine Corps

12:34.240 --> 12:37.240
for reasons I won't go into.

12:37.520 --> 12:42.440
And I was actually in a long range reconnaissance group

12:42.440 --> 12:44.520
plowing through the jungle, trying,

12:44.520 --> 12:49.080
with six guys in the middle of nowhere in the jungle

12:49.080 --> 12:51.320
being dropped up in helicopters, et cetera, et cetera.

12:51.320 --> 12:55.720
So I spent 68, 69 doing that.

12:55.720 --> 12:56.800
And-

12:56.800 --> 12:57.640
Wow.

12:57.640 --> 12:58.480
Steve, thank you for your service.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.040
These are always interesting experiences.

13:01.040 --> 13:06.040
And I came back to the States and I guess that's a piece

13:06.880 --> 13:10.120
I didn't, it's hard to picture here, but I was very,

13:10.120 --> 13:13.040
I call it, involuted because I was,

13:13.040 --> 13:15.000
when you go through an experience like that,

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
you're wanting to find what's the meaning of life

13:19.000 --> 13:22.240
and what the heck is this all about?

13:22.240 --> 13:25.880
And so you sort of go into an intense inward state

13:25.880 --> 13:29.680
and in that state, toward the end,

13:29.680 --> 13:34.200
I was in North Carolina on the sea coast,

13:34.200 --> 13:35.640
in the inland waterway.

13:35.640 --> 13:39.440
I was living with three other ex-officers

13:39.440 --> 13:41.240
and they were still officers in the Marines,

13:41.240 --> 13:46.240
but on top of a yacht basin, yacht club,

13:47.440 --> 13:52.440
but I had what one would call a mystical experience

13:52.880 --> 13:56.800
and which again had an impact on me

13:56.800 --> 14:00.680
because I'm used from the seminary from a course

14:00.680 --> 14:03.240
I took an epistemology, which I didn't have a clue

14:03.240 --> 14:06.480
what was going on, but there's something problematic

14:06.480 --> 14:08.760
with the relationship of subject to an object.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.000
And we'll come back to that in this discussion,

14:11.000 --> 14:15.240
but that mystical experience sort of enhanced

14:15.240 --> 14:19.400
that whole perception that, oh, this is quite interesting.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.880
And you see Piaget, back to him,

14:22.880 --> 14:26.200
he was sort of describing how the child starts out

14:26.200 --> 14:27.800
and actually kind of a mystical state

14:27.800 --> 14:29.240
where he's one with the world

14:29.240 --> 14:32.400
and only gradually does he learn

14:32.400 --> 14:35.560
that he's a self among other selves,

14:35.560 --> 14:37.720
an object among other objects,

14:37.720 --> 14:40.240
a force among other forces

14:40.240 --> 14:42.840
and that he has an identity himself

14:42.840 --> 14:46.080
with respect to this other matrix of beings,

14:46.080 --> 14:47.880
forces and objects.

14:47.880 --> 14:51.040
And so in essence, it's the description

14:51.040 --> 14:54.640
of how one goes from a, should we say,

14:54.640 --> 14:58.120
infatmistic to, excuse me,

14:58.120 --> 15:02.480
needing to zen koan to break through

15:02.480 --> 15:03.920
back to this original state

15:03.920 --> 15:06.160
or where you are one with the universe, shall we say.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.960
So that all struck me.

15:08.960 --> 15:13.960
In fact, that kind of became my thought in that,

15:13.960 --> 15:16.600
well, this is what I really should maybe look at

15:16.600 --> 15:19.000
if I go back to the University of Minnesota,

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
which my next arrow says back to Minnesota in 1971.

15:25.280 --> 15:28.080
Steve, do you mind, Steve?

15:28.080 --> 15:29.560
Sorry, I hate to interrupt you

15:29.560 --> 15:31.360
because you're in a great flow here,

15:31.360 --> 15:32.840
but if you care to share,

15:32.840 --> 15:35.080
and I know it might be a very personal experience,

15:35.080 --> 15:38.280
so please, if you don't want it, if you don't care to you,

15:38.280 --> 15:40.720
but could you tell us about that mystical experience,

15:40.720 --> 15:41.640
what that was like?

15:46.600 --> 15:48.320
It's a little hard to describe,

15:48.320 --> 15:53.040
but it was, I kind of found myself,

15:54.040 --> 15:55.600
shall we say, all of a sudden,

15:55.600 --> 15:59.920
just kind of laying on the deck,

15:59.920 --> 16:02.600
kind of like, wow, what's going on?

16:02.600 --> 16:07.600
And this, what one felt was that suddenly

16:08.680 --> 16:12.240
that there was this other being that you actually were.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.640
And this being was infinite.

16:14.640 --> 16:19.640
You and this being had been the same being forever.

16:20.560 --> 16:25.560
And I guess I'm reminded of a statement by Thomas Merton,

16:28.800 --> 16:30.280
the great contemplative monk,

16:30.280 --> 16:32.160
the Catholic contemplative monk,

16:34.040 --> 16:39.040
in his statement was in a true contemplative state,

16:39.240 --> 16:41.920
or actually he meant a mystical state.

16:41.920 --> 16:46.200
All concept of sin dissolves

16:46.200 --> 16:50.840
because this being that you are is obviously a divine being

16:50.840 --> 16:52.720
and cannot sin.

16:52.720 --> 16:57.280
And so when you're brought up in the Catholic framework,

16:59.080 --> 17:02.480
sin is very much a doctrine and a dogma,

17:02.480 --> 17:04.440
and you're worried about mortal sins and venial sins

17:04.440 --> 17:05.760
and confessing sins, et cetera, et cetera.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.040
And this whole thing just dissolved

17:07.040 --> 17:10.400
because it's felt to be ridiculous.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.320
It's felt to be, no longer can be,

17:12.320 --> 17:14.960
it's no longer applicable.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
And the whole world was just one gigantic sea of love.

17:21.320 --> 17:24.280
I mean, the ecstasy was so intense,

17:24.280 --> 17:26.800
I almost had to have it turned off.

17:26.800 --> 17:30.400
And there was another interesting concept

17:30.400 --> 17:32.840
that must have come from deep in my being

17:32.840 --> 17:36.560
because I got this all as just.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.880
There was another was justice, everything.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.920
I must have been worried about injustice.

17:40.920 --> 17:44.480
In fact, I still am, but at that time it was like,

17:44.480 --> 17:45.760
well, everything is just.

17:45.760 --> 17:50.360
And so it was very intense ecstatic experience.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.760
And with the awareness that there really wasn't no death,

17:53.760 --> 17:58.200
you had been this being, this whole notion of sin fell away

17:58.200 --> 18:01.680
because, well, there's lots of implications in that.

18:01.680 --> 18:06.680
So, yeah, that's pretty much the content thereof.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.480
Okay, and it wasn't long thereafter.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.440
I mean, that, well, it's kind of funny

18:12.440 --> 18:16.360
because I lived with another one of the tenants

18:16.360 --> 18:19.280
that lived with us, his nickname was Duke.

18:19.280 --> 18:23.240
He had been over in Vietnam for, well, 18 months.

18:24.240 --> 18:27.120
The normal 12 month tour and then his troops,

18:27.120 --> 18:30.120
his platoon turned them on to marijuana

18:30.120 --> 18:31.440
because they thought he was a cool guy.

18:31.440 --> 18:35.800
And he re-extended for six months just to do the marijuana.

18:35.800 --> 18:36.640
Wow.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.960
And then he'd be walking around.

18:39.560 --> 18:44.440
He was in LSD and he could be on an LSD trip.

18:44.440 --> 18:46.520
You never knew it, you know?

18:46.520 --> 18:48.040
Wow, interesting guy.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.600
And because I had gotten out of the ring

18:52.600 --> 18:56.960
or about a week after that mystical experience,

18:58.400 --> 19:01.760
he took me on an LSD trip, which was quite interesting,

19:02.920 --> 19:07.920
which also helped in the ultimate breakthrough

19:08.200 --> 19:10.520
one needs to understand Berkson.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.240
Because Berkson, as we're going to point out,

19:13.240 --> 19:15.760
is very zen, very mystical.

19:15.760 --> 19:18.280
And people that are not zen and not mystical

19:18.280 --> 19:19.560
and don't have this intuition,

19:19.560 --> 19:23.000
I think have a very hard time understanding Berkson.

19:24.800 --> 19:28.280
So, yeah, so like I said,

19:28.280 --> 19:30.880
the arrow, I ended up back at the University of Minnesota

19:30.880 --> 19:35.880
end of fall of 1970, starting 71.

19:36.360 --> 19:39.640
I'm back in graduate school in educational psychology.

19:39.640 --> 19:42.160
It was really called the Cognitive Foundations of Education.

19:42.160 --> 19:45.640
It's really a cognitive psychology thing.

19:45.640 --> 19:49.320
Philosophy was, and ultimately,

19:49.320 --> 19:51.200
computer science is going to come along.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.040
Right, yeah.

19:52.040 --> 19:55.160
Because that was the, 72 was the big year

19:55.160 --> 19:57.160
that computer science swept into academics

19:57.160 --> 19:58.520
into cognitive psychology.

19:59.440 --> 20:03.080
And the interesting thing you and I talked about before

20:03.080 --> 20:05.280
was how I hit Berkson.

20:05.280 --> 20:09.360
And the reason was I found a course right away

20:09.360 --> 20:14.240
with a Dr. Bart, who was into Berkson, was into Piaget.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.880
And it was a discussion about,

20:16.880 --> 20:21.160
or devoted to Piaget's group theory,

20:21.160 --> 20:23.560
the use of mathematical groups,

20:23.560 --> 20:26.560
which I think he got from Ernst Kassier,

20:28.200 --> 20:31.800
and initially, the great French phenomenon,

20:31.800 --> 20:34.360
or German phenomenologist philosopher.

20:35.280 --> 20:39.160
And my thing was, I was going to write something

20:39.160 --> 20:42.440
about the epistemology of gene Piaget.

20:42.440 --> 20:45.480
This came from my one course in the seminary

20:45.480 --> 20:49.120
on epistemology and my association

20:49.120 --> 20:50.680
with discovery of Piaget at the end.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.200
And I had no idea what I was going to do,

20:53.200 --> 20:54.640
but I thought it was cool.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.840
And Dr. Bart says, well, why don't you write

20:56.840 --> 20:59.720
a comparison of Berkson to Piaget?

21:00.720 --> 21:03.080
And I thought, oh, okay.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.280
I'm thinking, who's Berkson?

21:04.280 --> 21:08.520
I have no clue who Berkson, but I can do that.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.560
Sure, I can do that.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.560
Oh my God, do that.

21:12.840 --> 21:15.720
So I discovered, you know, you go to the library

21:15.720 --> 21:17.960
and you find books on Berkson,

21:17.960 --> 21:19.320
because you're never going to,

21:19.320 --> 21:22.040
or you wouldn't want to read Berkson right off the bat.

21:22.040 --> 21:26.520
But you find it's going to distill it for you, hope.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.520
And by will and car, I found a book on Berkson.

21:29.520 --> 21:34.360
And this is what I ran across right off the bat

21:34.360 --> 21:36.360
in about three or four pages in the car.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.480
This statement by Berkson,

21:38.480 --> 21:40.600
questions related to subject to an object,

21:40.600 --> 21:42.120
do the distinction in the union,

21:42.120 --> 21:45.400
what's it put in terms of time rather than a space?

21:46.440 --> 21:49.920
And I thought, whoa, that's cool, subject to an object.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.280
I have no clue what that thing meant.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.640
I mean, what is that?

21:52.640 --> 21:54.240
That's why I have the Zen picture there.

21:54.240 --> 21:55.320
It's a column.

21:55.320 --> 21:56.360
Yeah.

21:56.360 --> 21:59.160
It's like, what is the sound of one hand flapping?

21:59.440 --> 22:01.280
Who is it that sees?

22:01.280 --> 22:02.120
Okay.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.800
It's a coin that you have to contemplate.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.120
Well, I didn't know what that meant,

22:06.120 --> 22:08.280
but that was enough to tell me

22:08.280 --> 22:10.200
that something cool is going on.

22:12.320 --> 22:13.560
Do you mind, Steve,

22:13.560 --> 22:16.800
if we quickly just give folks a context

22:16.800 --> 22:20.080
as to when Berkson lived, what is-

22:20.080 --> 22:21.080
Oh, yeah.

22:21.080 --> 22:24.200
I mean, I know, but you're the expert, so.

22:24.320 --> 22:29.320
Well, of course, I forgot when he was born right after that.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.400
Yeah.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.000
I mean, yeah, mid-1800s, late-1800s.

22:34.000 --> 22:34.840
Yeah.

22:34.840 --> 22:38.840
Well, he's writing his thesis in 1889, okay?

22:40.560 --> 22:45.360
His thesis was time and free will.

22:45.360 --> 22:48.160
That was the title of it, 1889.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.000
So he's probably about 20,

22:50.000 --> 22:51.920
we can probably go back to about 1879

22:52.000 --> 22:54.320
or something like that when he was roughly born.

22:55.680 --> 22:58.120
So all seems so much for my Berkson expertise

22:58.120 --> 22:59.960
right off the bat, down the drain.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
But he was obviously French.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.040
He was quite brilliant.

23:09.040 --> 23:13.200
I mean, he was extremely diplomatic.

23:13.200 --> 23:18.200
His classmates said he could destroy your theory

23:18.200 --> 23:20.200
in a matter of a few sentences,

23:20.200 --> 23:25.200
but he did it very diplomatic and nicely.

23:26.120 --> 23:31.120
He won at 18 a very prestigious French prize in mathematics.

23:34.200 --> 23:39.200
And he greatly then disappointed his mathematics professor

23:40.200 --> 23:43.200
because he decided he was gonna go into philosophy.

23:44.200 --> 23:49.200
And that professor said, well, you could have been a politician.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.200
I just can be a philosopher.

23:52.200 --> 23:56.200
And I'm pointing this out because there's a great mythology

23:56.200 --> 23:57.200
about Berkson ultimate

23:57.200 --> 23:59.200
because he ultimately gets in a big argument

23:59.200 --> 24:01.200
with Einstein over relativity.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.200
And I think he beat the heck out of Einstein

24:03.200 --> 24:07.200
in terms of proper interpretation of relativity.

24:07.200 --> 24:10.200
That's another story we may not even get into.

24:10.200 --> 24:14.200
But the myth is that he did really understand mathematics.

24:14.200 --> 24:16.200
And even Einstein ultimately admitted,

24:16.200 --> 24:19.200
well, yes, Berkson totally understands the theory of relativity,

24:19.200 --> 24:23.200
but believe me, when you look at Berkson's book on relativity,

24:23.200 --> 24:26.200
he just dismantles, disdisex,

24:26.200 --> 24:29.200
and reconstructs the whole theory mathematically.

24:29.200 --> 24:32.200
And obviously, effortlessly.

24:32.200 --> 24:35.200
Their famous debate, Berkson and Einstein

24:35.200 --> 24:38.200
had a famous debate in 1922, I believe.

24:38.200 --> 24:42.200
And as a true, I mean, the story is the myth, perhaps,

24:42.200 --> 24:44.200
is that that debate prevented Einstein

24:44.200 --> 24:46.200
from winning the Nobel Prize that year.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.200
Is that true?

24:47.200 --> 24:49.200
Yes, right.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.200
And there's a whole book on it,

24:50.200 --> 24:52.200
and I'm gonna join a canalist

24:52.200 --> 24:54.200
called The Philosopher and the Physicist,

24:54.200 --> 24:56.200
which is the great title,

24:56.200 --> 24:58.200
going through the debate.

24:58.200 --> 25:02.200
Unfortunately, she completely misses the actual essence

25:02.200 --> 25:05.200
of the debate, which is a problem.

25:05.200 --> 25:09.200
And Berkson, one of my pieces of research,

25:09.200 --> 25:11.200
this person claimed that Berkson

25:11.200 --> 25:13.200
was far more famous than Einstein

25:13.200 --> 25:15.200
in the first two decades of the 20th century,

25:15.200 --> 25:18.200
which is kind of mind-boggling to think of now.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.200
Right, because what happened is,

25:20.200 --> 25:23.200
he published his time in free will,

25:23.200 --> 25:27.200
which was taking the problem of free will

25:27.200 --> 25:29.200
in the context of the nature of time,

25:29.200 --> 25:32.200
which still is ignored today completely.

25:32.200 --> 25:35.200
You can read Dennett, and A, you don't see Berkson mentioned,

25:35.200 --> 25:37.200
B, you don't see time mentioned,

25:37.200 --> 25:39.200
you know, Dennett on free will, then Dennett.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.200
And in fact, almost all of the current discussions

25:42.200 --> 25:45.200
on free will, he follows it up.

25:45.200 --> 25:53.200
He spends five years studying memory difficulties,

25:53.200 --> 25:57.200
aphasias, amnesias, and lesions to the brain,

25:57.200 --> 25:59.200
and comes out with this book,

25:59.200 --> 26:02.200
I got a picture of their matter in memory of 1896,

26:02.200 --> 26:04.200
because his whole problem was,

26:04.200 --> 26:08.200
does the brain actually store experience?

26:08.200 --> 26:12.200
Does it store that coffee cup out there in front of my guy there

26:12.200 --> 26:15.200
with the stirring spoon, that experience of the coffee stir?

26:15.200 --> 26:17.200
Is that stored in the brain?

26:17.200 --> 26:22.200
And his point was, the whole theory of consciousness

26:22.200 --> 26:24.200
rests on this question,

26:24.200 --> 26:26.200
is experience stored in the brain?

26:26.200 --> 26:32.200
And again, you won't find that question ever mentioned anywhere,

26:32.200 --> 26:35.200
not by charmers, not by straws,

26:35.200 --> 26:41.200
and not by any of the people that are the supposed great theorists

26:41.200 --> 26:43.200
of consciousness nowadays,

26:43.200 --> 26:45.200
just simply not understood.

26:45.200 --> 26:51.200
The bottom line, his analysis of the subject of all the phenomena

26:51.200 --> 26:53.200
of memory research at the time,

26:53.200 --> 26:55.200
was that it couldn't be stored in the brain,

26:55.200 --> 27:00.200
that you did not have to have that hypothesis,

27:00.200 --> 27:03.200
which is now a dogma, that memory is stored in the brain.

27:03.200 --> 27:07.200
In fact, all that could be happening is that the brain,

27:07.200 --> 27:11.200
when it's damaged, simply doesn't,

27:11.200 --> 27:15.200
let's say, form the proper neural patterns

27:15.200 --> 27:19.200
or modulating wave patterns, I'll call it,

27:19.200 --> 27:23.200
that allow the memory to be re-instantiated,

27:23.200 --> 27:30.200
the original experience, but not from within the brain itself.

27:30.200 --> 27:33.200
So that's another whole question we ultimately,

27:33.200 --> 27:35.200
probably actually quite won't get into,

27:35.200 --> 27:37.200
but we'll see part of it.

27:37.200 --> 27:40.200
And then, in 1907,

27:40.200 --> 27:43.200
he followed up with a book called Creative Evolution,

27:43.200 --> 27:48.200
which was a tour de force on the problem of evolution,

27:48.200 --> 27:50.200
the problem of Darwinian evolution.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.200
He was not a fan of Darwinian evolution.

27:53.200 --> 27:58.200
And really, the whole nature of the evolution of the universe.

27:58.200 --> 28:01.200
I mean, Tegard Deschardin,

28:01.200 --> 28:03.200
who actually, I was reading at the time,

28:03.200 --> 28:05.200
my mystical experience, I should say,

28:05.200 --> 28:11.200
was the great Catholic Jesuit,

28:11.200 --> 28:14.200
kind of a mystic theorist,

28:14.200 --> 28:19.200
was inspired by Berks' work, Creative Evolution.

28:19.200 --> 28:25.200
And he was launched it by that point into quite a bit of fame,

28:25.200 --> 28:31.200
and famed them, to the point where the ladies of Paris

28:31.200 --> 28:35.200
wanted to attend his lectures,

28:35.200 --> 28:38.200
and there was discussions of whether you'd hold the lectures

28:38.200 --> 28:40.200
in the Paris Opera Hall,

28:40.200 --> 28:43.200
because the attendance was so great.

28:43.200 --> 28:46.200
Yeah, he was a local celebrity in Paris, right?

28:46.200 --> 28:52.200
This, of course, also generated its own self-resistance,

28:52.200 --> 28:58.200
because now you had other academics that were like Bruch and Russell

28:58.200 --> 29:01.200
that were extremely upset.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.200
Should we say, we won't use the word jealous,

29:04.200 --> 29:07.200
but they didn't like this, too much popularity.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.200
And Bruchton took a lot of shots.

29:10.200 --> 29:15.200
The bottom line to not make us too long is that his popularity,

29:15.200 --> 29:21.200
well, again, he really emerged back in 1922, like you noted,

29:21.200 --> 29:27.200
because he had, being a great theorist of time that he was,

29:27.200 --> 29:31.200
his ears pricked up when he discovered that Paul Langevan

29:31.200 --> 29:34.200
had announced what's called a twin paradox,

29:34.200 --> 29:37.200
do you remember where the twin leaves the earth and the rocket

29:37.200 --> 29:40.200
comes back and he's ageless in his brother?

29:40.200 --> 29:44.200
And Bruchton thought that was a complete misuse of relativity.

29:44.200 --> 29:47.200
It destroyed the logical consistency of relativity.

29:47.200 --> 29:51.200
Hence, he began his arguments and got, ultimately,

29:51.200 --> 29:56.200
Scott Einstein wrote the book Duration and Simultaneity.

29:56.200 --> 30:02.200
And that sort of began this period.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.200
He was actually working with Einstein,

30:04.200 --> 30:09.200
the League of Nations at the time, too.

30:09.200 --> 30:13.200
So he was somewhat prominent in politics at the time,

30:13.200 --> 30:19.200
but that was beginning of his gradual descent into obscurity

30:19.200 --> 30:23.200
and wading into wings, as I like to know,

30:23.200 --> 30:26.200
was behaviorism, skin area and behaviorism,

30:26.200 --> 30:28.200
the analytical philosophy,

30:28.200 --> 30:32.200
which is very antithetical to Bruchton's continental philosophy.

30:32.200 --> 30:37.200
And he ended up dying of pneumonia after standing in the line

30:37.200 --> 30:40.200
for a long time in Paris, 1941,

30:40.200 --> 30:43.200
occupied by the Germans, by the Nazis.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.200
He had caught pneumonia.

30:45.200 --> 30:52.200
He was going to declare himself a Jew publicly as the Nazis were demanding.

30:52.200 --> 30:58.200
So he died of pneumonia and that was the end of Mr. Bruchton.

30:59.200 --> 31:04.200
And as I said, he sort of then went into obscurity.

31:04.200 --> 31:08.200
And so that's him.

31:08.200 --> 31:13.200
So meanwhile, someone like me comes along and discovers this quote.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.200
We were sitting right here.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.200
Yeah, this quote, back to the quote.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.200
Yeah, thank you for the context.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.200
It's helpful.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.200
Okay.

31:19.200 --> 31:23.200
So that began my reading of that book Matter of Memory.

31:23.200 --> 31:27.200
I mean, I must have read it a dozen times.

31:28.200 --> 31:33.200
In backwards, forwards, from the middle, outwards, every direction,

31:33.200 --> 31:36.200
because when you hit Matter of Memory,

31:36.200 --> 31:38.200
you really don't know what's going on.

31:38.200 --> 31:42.200
And the book was considered, especially its first chapter,

31:42.200 --> 31:46.200
obscure even by his adherents,

31:46.200 --> 31:52.200
by Bruchton's adherents, and we'll see why.

31:52.200 --> 31:56.200
So I'm in Minnesota.

31:56.200 --> 32:00.200
And what's about to happen in Minnesota is the computer model of

32:00.200 --> 32:04.200
mine is going to sweep in in 1972.

32:04.200 --> 32:07.200
The whole whole notion of the brain is a computer.

32:07.200 --> 32:13.200
This, my advisor in the education psychology side was very enamored

32:13.200 --> 32:17.200
of a book by Newell and Simon called General Problem Solving,

32:17.200 --> 32:21.200
Human Problem Solving, which went through their book with their model

32:21.200 --> 32:24.200
of a computer model, the general problem solver,

32:24.200 --> 32:28.200
which tried to simulate solving problems the way humans do,

32:28.200 --> 32:32.200
like cryptorhythmic problems, like Donald plus Gerald equal Robert,

32:32.200 --> 32:35.200
you know, which we have to sign numbers to each letter,

32:35.200 --> 32:40.200
like Donald and Gerald, Robert, or chess.

32:40.200 --> 32:44.200
There's another one of the things in their books.

32:44.200 --> 32:47.200
And so that swept in.

32:47.200 --> 32:53.200
And the other side of the story I was in related to was

32:53.200 --> 32:58.200
on a pure psychology side was

32:58.200 --> 33:03.200
what eventually became my thesis advisor, Dr. Bob Shaw.

33:03.200 --> 33:07.200
And let me, I think that's where we're having subject to an object here.

33:07.200 --> 33:11.200
I forgot to put that.

33:11.200 --> 33:15.200
Oh, I have to remember my source of my thing.

33:15.200 --> 33:22.200
So let's, let's, before I go to Shaw, let's go to this point in Berkson.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.200
Here's another of the colons.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.200
This is in chapter one of that book.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.200
So, but isn't that up?

33:28.200 --> 33:32.200
Berkson is talking about how do we see the coffee cup out there?

33:32.200 --> 33:40.200
And in space extended out there on the table.

33:40.200 --> 33:42.200
How do we see that coffee cup?

33:42.200 --> 33:45.200
Is there a photograph of the coffee cup in the brain?

33:45.200 --> 33:50.200
And he says, well, obviously, is it obvious the photograph?

33:50.200 --> 33:54.200
He said, I got to keep my things in order here.

33:54.200 --> 34:00.200
But neuroscience at the time was developed enough to know that there was no coffee image in the brain.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.200
You couldn't, you weren't going to find an image of the coffee cup in the brain,

34:03.200 --> 34:08.200
which is why I have the little red circle there with the line through it.

34:08.200 --> 34:12.200
So he says, excuse me, but isn't that obvious?

34:12.200 --> 34:18.200
The photograph, if the photograph there be is already taken already developed in the very heart of things.

34:18.200 --> 34:20.200
And at all points in space.

34:20.200 --> 34:23.200
No metaphysics, no physics can escape this conclusion.

34:23.200 --> 34:25.200
Build up the universe with atoms.

34:25.200 --> 34:29.200
Each is subject to the action, variable and quantity and quality according to the distance.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.200
Exerted and done by all material atoms.

34:31.200 --> 34:33.200
Exerted on it by all material atoms.

34:33.200 --> 34:35.200
Bring in Faraday, centers of force.

34:35.200 --> 34:38.200
The lines of force submitted in every direction from every center.

34:38.200 --> 34:42.200
Bring to bear upon each the influence of the whole material world.

34:42.200 --> 34:44.200
Call up the Laditsian monads.

34:44.200 --> 34:46.200
Each is the mirror of the universe.

34:47.200 --> 34:52.200
So that is key to his answer to how we see the coffee cup.

34:52.200 --> 34:54.200
But you can see it's yet another koan.

34:54.200 --> 34:59.200
It's koan number two along with subject to an object in terms of time.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.200
So I have no idea what that meant when I read it.

35:05.200 --> 35:11.200
He went on, he was actually before this, he was talking about the nature of the universe.

35:11.200 --> 35:14.200
Take any object, for example, like the coffee cup there.

35:14.200 --> 35:18.200
Any object is obliged to transmit the whole of what it receives,

35:18.200 --> 35:22.200
to oppose every action with an equal and contrary reaction.

35:22.200 --> 35:26.200
To be in short, really the road by which pass in every direction and modifications

35:26.200 --> 35:29.200
or what can be termed real actions.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.200
It's visualized waves,

35:32.200 --> 35:35.200
propagated throughout the immensity of the entire universe.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.200
Okay.

35:37.200 --> 35:42.200
So he says, so only if we consider any other place in the universe,

35:42.200 --> 35:47.200
we can regard the action of all matter is passing through it without resistance and without loss.

35:47.200 --> 35:51.200
And the photograph of the whole is translucent.

35:51.200 --> 35:57.200
Here is wanting behind the plate the black screen on which the image could be shown.

35:57.200 --> 36:01.200
Our zones of indetermination, there is talk about organisms,

36:01.200 --> 36:04.200
centers of free action that can act upon the world,

36:04.200 --> 36:06.200
play in some sort the part of that screen.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.200
They add nothing to what is there, the effect merely this.

36:09.200 --> 36:14.200
The real action, those waves passing through the coffee cup that

36:14.200 --> 36:20.200
the coffee cup is reflecting and sending back to all the other points in the universe.

36:20.200 --> 36:24.200
They affect merely this, the real action passes through those waves,

36:24.200 --> 36:27.200
and the virtual action remains.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.200
Okay.

36:29.200 --> 36:35.200
So if anyone here listening knows what this means already, let me know.

36:35.200 --> 36:41.200
Unless you've picked up what I've said, but you can see that this is pretty much co-on like,

36:41.200 --> 36:43.200
very difficult to understand what's going on.

36:43.200 --> 36:48.200
And he's talking about the problem of receiving the coffee cup,

36:48.200 --> 36:50.200
seeing that coffee cup out there on the kitchen table,

36:50.200 --> 36:53.200
which is really the hard problem.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.200
And we'll go back to that.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.200
That's the hard problem.

36:57.200 --> 37:02.200
Always see the coffee cup out there with this qualia.

37:02.200 --> 37:04.200
Okay.

37:04.200 --> 37:07.200
Well, this is where I was going.

37:07.200 --> 37:12.200
My other advisor, who eventually my thesis advisor was Bob Shaw, the bottom there,

37:12.200 --> 37:15.200
Robert E. Shaw.

37:15.200 --> 37:21.200
Now, he was a student of Gibson at Cornell for a couple of years.

37:21.200 --> 37:25.200
Gibson topped the picture, J.J. Gibson.

37:25.200 --> 37:29.200
There we have his dates, 1940, 1974, 1979.

37:29.200 --> 37:35.200
To me, he was the greatest theorist of perception that walked the planet.

37:35.200 --> 37:40.200
Maybe next to Bergson, but actually pure theorist of perception on philosopher.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.200
But he was very philosophical too.

37:42.200 --> 37:50.200
He founded the subject of, what we call the subject of ecological psychology,

37:50.200 --> 37:55.200
which is, there's now a journal today, the Journal of Ecological Psychology.

37:55.200 --> 38:00.200
It's a whole field or subfield in the study of perception.

38:00.200 --> 38:09.200
And Shaw, my advisor there, was the founder of that journal, the Journal of Ecological Psychology.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.200
He obviously knew Gibson.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.200
He studied with Gibson at Cornell for a couple of years.

38:13.200 --> 38:19.200
Why he was studying abstract automata theory at Cornell.

38:19.200 --> 38:27.200
Abstract automata theory is, shall we say, another level of abstraction above computer science.

38:27.200 --> 38:32.200
It's the abstract logical description of finite state machines.

38:32.200 --> 38:38.200
And Bob was a brilliant guy, as we'll see.

38:38.200 --> 38:40.200
I think it'll become through really evident.

38:40.200 --> 38:47.200
Gibson, if I may, had just such quick, one of Gibson's big ideas was Affordance theory, right?

38:47.200 --> 38:50.200
Affordance is a big thing, yes.

38:50.200 --> 38:54.200
We see what is the usefulness of the objects.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.200
We see that kind of space.

38:56.200 --> 39:00.200
It reminds me quite a bit of, seems analogous to, although I'm sure there's differences,

39:00.200 --> 39:07.200
between Donald Hoffman's theories around sort of our fitness.

39:07.200 --> 39:14.200
We see the world in terms of one of the most fit for us as organisms, rather than what's actually there.

39:14.200 --> 39:17.200
But I know you've done a video on Hoffman.

39:17.200 --> 39:25.200
We're going to blow Hoffman away here, but let me go back just for one thick thing here.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.200
Sure, sure.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.200
But we won't do it here.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.200
No, I just thought it looked quick to answer.

39:30.200 --> 39:35.200
Just say, let's go back to, look at the very bottom line, okay?

39:35.200 --> 39:38.200
Virtual action.

39:38.200 --> 39:42.200
That's affordances, as we'll see.

39:42.200 --> 39:45.200
Just a little preview.

39:45.200 --> 39:50.200
Yeah, I was going to ask you, I know virtual action, there's a few terms that you use that,

39:50.200 --> 39:56.200
when we get to them, I am going to stop and say, let's really define this and get this down.

39:56.200 --> 39:59.200
So virtual action is essentially affordances.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.200
Okay.

40:00.200 --> 40:04.200
Well, yes, but it's worse than that, so we're going to see.

40:04.200 --> 40:08.200
We have to take it in a holographic context, so back to where I was.

40:08.200 --> 40:12.200
Okay, so, let's see what my next slide is.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.200
Okay, so we're going to get there.

40:14.200 --> 40:24.200
So, in 1972, like I said, this computer model swept in.

40:24.200 --> 40:33.200
I attended a seminar with Shaw, and he went through Feigenbaum's book on computers and thought.

40:33.200 --> 40:48.200
And Shaw simply destroyed the whole notion that the computer model of mine had anything to do with reality back then, already in 1972.

40:48.200 --> 40:56.200
Around that time, also, Prebum, Carl Prebum, I don't have a picture of here,

40:56.200 --> 41:03.200
published his book called Languages in the Brain, where he argued that the brain was a hologram.

41:03.200 --> 41:08.200
And that accounted for how the brain stored memory.

41:08.200 --> 41:24.200
I was trying to buttress the findings of Carl Lashley, where Lashley had tried to destroy memories in the brain and couldn't do it, and decided that, which basically,

41:24.200 --> 41:32.200
what Lashley was doing, he was also destroying anything that would be considered neural nets today, but that's another question.

41:32.200 --> 41:40.200
And Lashley decided that memories won't be somehow very distributed, and holography, as we'll see, is the essence of distribution.

41:40.200 --> 41:50.200
And Carl was trying to argue that, and he had a very minor theory of perception at the time, in Languages in the Brain, how we see that coffee cup out there,

41:50.200 --> 41:57.200
that maybe the whole holography had something to do with that, but it was a real coherent theory.

41:57.200 --> 42:12.200
But Shaw had invited Prebum to come to a conference, and talk at a conference at the University of Minnesota, and pretty obviously the two had discussions.

42:12.200 --> 42:26.200
And that, shall we say the next day that Prebum was there, Shaw was giving his seminar, and he started talking about holography.

42:26.200 --> 42:34.200
And so we're going to quickly talk about holography, the construction of a hologram.

42:34.200 --> 42:45.200
And so in the construction of a hologram, we've got the hologram plate there, and we've got a form of laser light to the left.

42:45.200 --> 42:48.200
That would be a laser, a coherent frequency laser.

42:48.200 --> 43:02.200
And so the waves from that laser are hitting the hologram plate, and then, I don't have a picture there, but normally some of those waves are bounced off of half-mirror to the object or the scene,

43:02.200 --> 43:04.200
the pyramid or the ball there.

43:04.200 --> 43:12.200
So you would have some waves bouncing off the ball in the pyramid and bouncing back toward the plate.

43:12.200 --> 43:16.200
So that's called the object wave, as I've got labeled there.

43:16.200 --> 43:25.200
So the hologram is the interference pattern of these two waves, the reference wave and the object wave.

43:25.200 --> 43:39.200
And I was going to put a nice picture of an interference pattern there, and I forgot, but it looks, it's just a jumble of lines that look nothing like the pyramid and the ball.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.200
But that's our hologram.

43:41.200 --> 43:49.200
It's a jumble of lines, the interference, the recording of the interference pattern of those two waves.

43:49.200 --> 43:55.200
And now, the reconstruction process is interesting.

43:55.200 --> 44:10.200
If I beam a wave of light, a coherent wave of the same frequency as the original wave, of the original reference wave, that's now called the reconstructive wave, the reconstructing waves that are just labeled at frequency one.

44:10.200 --> 44:14.200
We're beaming that back through the hologram plate.

44:14.200 --> 44:27.200
And what is specified is the source of this original object wave front, namely the pyramid and the ball.

44:27.200 --> 44:36.200
So notice, that's called the virtual image, virtual action, but now virtual image.

44:37.200 --> 44:41.200
That's the virtual image, and you can move your head around.

44:41.200 --> 44:43.200
Notice the viewer up there.

44:43.200 --> 44:57.200
He can sort of, he's seeing the behind the plate as it were out in space, the image of the pyramid and ball, and he can move his head around and sort of see the side of the pyramid and the side of the balls.

44:57.200 --> 45:01.200
It's a 3D image, so to speak.

45:01.200 --> 45:07.200
So that's the reconstruction process.

45:07.200 --> 45:09.200
Let me see what my next slide is.

45:09.200 --> 45:15.200
Now, one can store multiple wave fronts on a hologram.

45:15.200 --> 45:28.200
So on the left there, I've got the frequency one case, a reference wave of frequency one being used to store the pyramid and the ball interference pattern.

45:28.200 --> 45:38.200
And I can change my reference wave frequency, and therefore my reconstructive wave frequency, frequency two, store an image of the of a cop.

45:38.200 --> 45:45.200
And, and that that way from also interference wave interference patterns also on a plate.

45:45.200 --> 45:57.200
And so if I modulate the reconstructive way from frequency frequency one, where I'm specifying the pyramid ball to frequency two, I'm specifying now the cop.

45:57.200 --> 45:59.200
I can modulate it back to frequency one and see the ball again.

45:59.200 --> 46:02.200
So I can modulate the reconstructive wave.

46:02.200 --> 46:05.200
Okay, so far so good.

46:05.200 --> 46:09.200
I'm in the footsteps of Shaw here.

46:09.200 --> 46:26.200
So then what Shaw says is, well, rather than looking at the brain as being the hologram, what if we look at the universe as being the hologram, the universe is the holographic field.

46:26.200 --> 46:34.200
In other words, as he said, the hologram is not in the head, the head is in the hologram.

46:34.200 --> 46:50.200
And the brain is acting or is creating the reconstructive wave, passing through the holographic field and specifying a source within the field, the coffee cup stirring spoon the table.

46:50.200 --> 46:52.200
Okay.

46:52.200 --> 47:01.200
So he's flipping pre Brahms thesis around completely.

47:01.200 --> 47:08.200
And that's when I realized what Berkson's talking about.

47:08.200 --> 47:13.200
But isn't that obvious that the photograph, I got to move your picture.

47:13.200 --> 47:15.200
That's okay.

47:15.200 --> 47:23.200
This is that obvious that the photograph of the photograph there be is already taken already developed in the very heart of things.

47:23.200 --> 47:26.200
And at all points in space.

47:26.200 --> 47:39.200
What Berkson was describing in that obscure chapter one was that the universal field of matter field of matter is a holographic field.

47:39.200 --> 47:46.200
Each point and that that's a little slide I forgot to do.

47:46.200 --> 47:56.200
Because each point in that field is is the reflection of has the information for all other points in the field.

47:56.200 --> 48:08.200
If I go back to a slide here, for example, if you look at the cup.

48:08.200 --> 48:10.200
Okay.

48:10.200 --> 48:13.200
Visualize it as a set of points.

48:13.200 --> 48:14.200
Okay.

48:14.200 --> 48:19.200
Where each point is giving rise to a a spherical wave.

48:19.200 --> 48:20.200
Okay.

48:20.200 --> 48:21.200
This is in the.

48:21.200 --> 48:23.200
Let me go back one more.

48:23.200 --> 48:26.200
I mean, it's related to what you say.

48:26.200 --> 48:33.200
There's clearly a relation to quantum mechanics here where, you know, waves and particles, etc.

48:33.200 --> 48:35.200
I'm sure.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.200
I wouldn't.

48:36.200 --> 48:40.200
I wouldn't go into the quantum mechanics of black hole and that's it.

48:40.200 --> 48:41.200
Okay.

48:41.200 --> 48:42.200
Okay.

48:42.200 --> 48:44.200
But here.

48:44.200 --> 48:46.200
So the cup go back to the ball each.

48:46.200 --> 48:48.200
This is we're constructing a hologram.

48:48.200 --> 48:49.200
Okay.

48:49.200 --> 48:56.200
Each point on the ball can be considered as giving rise to a little spherical wave that goes out toward that plate.

48:56.200 --> 48:57.200
All right.

48:57.200 --> 49:00.200
And covers the entire plate.

49:00.200 --> 49:01.200
Okay.

49:01.200 --> 49:08.200
So, so the information for any one point in that ball covers the entire plate plate.

49:08.200 --> 49:24.200
But conversely, then at when you realize a whole set of points of that ball covering that plate, then that at any point in the plate is the information for the entire ball.

49:24.200 --> 49:25.200
Okay.

49:25.200 --> 49:31.200
So one one point, the spherical wave from one point covers the entire plate.

49:31.200 --> 49:42.200
But now when you see there's a whole set of spherical waves covering the entire plate realize that any point the plate is the information for the whole ball and the pyramid.

49:42.200 --> 49:54.200
So, so the whole of graphic principles basically that in a hologram at any point is the information for the whole object.

49:54.200 --> 49:59.200
The whole, the whole scene, the whole cup, the whole ball, the whole plate.

49:59.200 --> 50:05.200
So that's back to this.

50:05.200 --> 50:17.200
We were the photograph is already taken already developed a very hard of things in all points and all points in space at every point in space is the information for the whole.

50:17.200 --> 50:23.200
So we don't need a photograph and then you've got this next quote.

50:23.200 --> 50:30.200
Our zones of indetermination in organisms play in some sort the part of that screen they had nothing that what is there.

50:30.200 --> 50:36.200
The effect merely this the real action passes through the virtual action remains.

50:36.200 --> 50:49.200
So, remember in the previous picture, you know, you're seeing the virtual image, the virtual image of the cup, or the.

50:49.200 --> 50:52.200
So that's the virtual action remaining.

50:52.200 --> 50:55.200
So, what would be the real action?

50:55.200 --> 51:02.200
Well, the real actions going back to the other quote is every all those.

51:03.200 --> 51:23.200
The remember Berks and talk about the whole this is massive set of real actions were that if you look at the my little picture there of all the all of the lines and waves in my my little symbol symbol of the universe as a holographic field.

51:23.200 --> 51:27.200
We're only picking out that set of real actions.

51:27.200 --> 51:34.200
Those waves that are interesting to us that is that actually relate to the body's capability for action.

51:34.200 --> 51:42.200
Okay, so hence why why it's virtual action you're seeing how you can act.

51:42.200 --> 51:44.200
You're seeing the possibility of action.

51:44.200 --> 51:49.200
I can act on that cup I can act on that on that table.

51:49.200 --> 51:52.200
I see this one again, or it's enough.

51:52.200 --> 51:55.200
In other words, the cup presents affordances.

51:55.200 --> 52:00.200
Sure, the virtual action and the real action would be everything else that we don't perceive.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.200
Yes.

52:01.200 --> 52:05.200
Yes, we're embedded in the field of real actions.

52:05.200 --> 52:11.200
What we're seeing is the virtual is the virtual action that subset of the real actions.

52:11.200 --> 52:18.200
That the brain is in the body of picking out is interesting to it that relate to its capability of action.

52:18.200 --> 52:24.200
When you upgrade Berks into remember the holographic model.

52:24.200 --> 52:32.200
The notion of a hologram wasn't discovered until 1947 by Gabor.

52:32.200 --> 52:34.200
Matter of memory is 1896.

52:34.200 --> 52:36.200
That's why no one understood it.

52:36.200 --> 52:40.200
It didn't have this physical model there to get it.

52:40.200 --> 52:42.200
Even when I tell people about it now they still get it.

52:42.200 --> 52:44.200
That's another question.

52:44.200 --> 52:52.200
But when you upgrade Berks and then into the holographic language, you'd be taking these quotes.

52:52.200 --> 53:05.200
You'd be saying, well, the universe is a holographic field and the brain is a reconstructive way specific to a virtual image within that field, the coffee cup and stirring spoon.

53:06.200 --> 53:13.200
As we'll see, it's a modulated reconstructive way because coffee stirring itself is very dynamic.

53:13.200 --> 53:15.200
All these events are dynamic.

53:15.200 --> 53:21.200
The brain is constantly being modulated, dynamically transforming as we'll see.

53:21.200 --> 53:24.200
Can you define what modulation is?

53:24.200 --> 53:31.200
Well, that was back to the picture where we simply were changing from frequency 1 to frequency 2 to frequency 3.

53:31.200 --> 53:38.200
We're modulating a wave to a different frequency.

53:38.200 --> 53:40.200
But as I understand...

53:40.200 --> 53:42.200
Like frequency modulation.

53:42.200 --> 53:51.200
Sure, so forgive my ignorance, but I think when I think of modulation and let's try to be on the same page,

53:51.200 --> 54:03.200
I understand it as a signal that's sent to help the transmission of information or help...

54:03.200 --> 54:09.200
See, this is where the limits of my understanding kind of go, but does that make sense?

54:09.200 --> 54:14.200
It's like sending another signal through a signal.

54:14.200 --> 54:16.200
Right, but you simply...

54:16.200 --> 54:25.200
Even on that framework, I think you're trying to get to, you're basically modulating the wave into a certain pattern or form.

54:25.200 --> 54:27.200
So that it carries my...

54:27.200 --> 54:32.200
You modulate that wave, so it carries my voice pattern, my voice frequency.

54:32.200 --> 54:37.200
So that it's reflective of my voice up and down.

54:37.200 --> 54:39.200
It's a more complex modulation.

54:39.200 --> 54:45.200
In fact, this is going to be, and ultimately this is going to be a very complex form of modulation that we're talking about here.

54:45.200 --> 54:54.200
But the simplest form is you're simply changing from frequency 1 to frequency 2 to frequency 3 and back to frequency 2.

54:54.200 --> 54:58.200
Simply modulating that wave to the different frequencies.

54:58.200 --> 55:03.200
That's the simplest form of it.

55:03.200 --> 55:10.200
So, well, I got to see where I'm going here.

55:10.200 --> 55:19.200
So, as I was saying, so the brain is in this framework is a modulated reconstructive wave.

55:19.200 --> 55:24.200
Put the brain here, and it's specific to specifying the cup.

55:24.200 --> 55:27.200
Now that cup is right where it says it is.

55:27.200 --> 55:34.200
Now here's another, I have in the picture, modulation here, modulated reconstructive wave.

55:34.200 --> 55:42.200
Let me move from frequency 2 to the cup, frequency 3, the wine glass, frequency 1.

55:42.200 --> 55:44.200
Again, changing that.

55:44.200 --> 55:48.200
What would be the purpose of changing the frequencies?

55:48.200 --> 55:56.200
Well, if you remember, each of those objects was stored with a specific reference wave of the same frequency.

55:56.200 --> 56:02.200
That cup, that cube was stored with a reference wave of frequency 1.

56:02.200 --> 56:06.200
So the interference pattern is kind of related to frequency 1.

56:06.200 --> 56:09.200
It's a function of frequency 1.

56:09.200 --> 56:12.200
The cup was frequency 2.

56:12.200 --> 56:22.200
And the interference pattern, the way the waves all meshes a function of that frequency 2 and the object wave from...

56:22.200 --> 56:23.200
Sure.

56:23.200 --> 56:33.200
So, if you could, in our moment to moment existence, how many frequency waves are we talking about in terms of what we can perceive?

56:33.200 --> 56:40.200
Are we talking like an astronomically large number?

56:40.200 --> 56:48.200
Well, what we're going to see here is that this is a...

56:48.200 --> 56:58.200
Talking in terms of a simple frequency like this is a way to get the mind going into how this process works, how the holographic specification process works.

56:58.200 --> 57:05.200
But when you're talking the brain and the event that's driving the brain, the name of this coffee stirring,

57:05.200 --> 57:13.200
you're going to have an extremely complex pattern, modulation pattern, we'll call it,

57:13.200 --> 57:21.200
where the notion that it's a simple frequency kind of fades into...

57:21.200 --> 57:24.200
And you're looking at something far more complex.

57:24.200 --> 57:25.200
Sure.

57:25.200 --> 57:34.200
So, hang on, you'll see that in a second when we get there with a little more in Gibson, what has to be brought in.

57:34.200 --> 57:40.200
So, as I'm saying, it's specific to a specifying this wave.

57:40.200 --> 57:45.200
The brain is now specifying the cup right where it says it is in the external field.

57:45.200 --> 57:48.200
It's not right where it says it is.

57:48.200 --> 57:54.200
Common sense says to us when I'm looking at my coffee cup out here in the desk, that's where it is.

57:54.200 --> 57:57.200
It's not constructing an image.

57:57.200 --> 58:05.200
No, it's not an image inside the brain or in some mental space or perceptual space somewhere.

58:05.200 --> 58:09.200
Like you'll get theorists talking about like Yoshabak will say, well, it's in a perceptual space.

58:09.200 --> 58:14.200
Well, what's the perceptual space?

58:14.200 --> 58:18.200
So, this is what's called direct perception.

58:18.200 --> 58:27.200
That is, indirect perception would be the picture up there where the image of the cup is in the cloud.

58:27.200 --> 58:31.200
Shall we say in the mental space or in the brain somehow.

58:31.200 --> 58:40.200
And somehow that corresponds to the world out there in some magical way.

58:40.200 --> 58:43.200
Direct perception says, no, you're directly perceived.

58:43.200 --> 58:48.200
Seeing the cup right where it says it is external in the field.

58:48.200 --> 58:52.200
We're not constructing an image in the brain.

58:52.200 --> 58:56.200
Now, I'm saying, you know, when driving, here we're going to do your question.

58:56.200 --> 58:58.200
What's really driving the modulations?

58:58.200 --> 59:01.200
What I termed the invariant structure of the event.

59:01.200 --> 59:06.200
We'll talk about that where this event is extremely complex.

59:06.200 --> 59:16.200
It's got the velocity flow fields and the swirling of the liquid, the abodic ratios, which are when you're stirring it,

59:16.200 --> 59:21.200
energy of oscillation, the frequency of oscillation ratio to that,

59:21.200 --> 59:29.200
inertial tensors, which have the momentum of the spoon, the various forced momentum of the spoon,

59:29.200 --> 59:35.200
acoustical invariance, like the clinking of the spoon, which is always coordinate with the motion of the spoon, et cetera.

59:35.200 --> 59:39.200
So we're going to go into that because that's going to take us into Gibson.

59:39.200 --> 59:46.200
But every such event has such a structure and that's driving the brain.

59:46.200 --> 59:48.200
We'll get into that.

59:48.200 --> 59:58.200
And it's all being specified at a scale of time because that brain has chemical velocities.

59:58.200 --> 01:00:04.200
And this is a neural dynamics there, underlying which are chemical velocities,

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:08.200
which can be expressed in the Arrhenius eclage, and it can be modulated too.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.200
It can be changed.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:16.200
You can drop a catalyst, which lets the reactions occur more quickly with not as much energy,

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.200
raise the whole chemical velocities.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:22.200
So the brain is, we're seeing the world specified at a normal scale.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:27.200
Normally the buzzing fly, 200 wing beats per second.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:34.200
If you raise the energy state of the brain, increase the chemical velocities,

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:38.200
it could be specified as a heroin-like fly, barely flapping its wings,

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:45.200
or even raising it still higher, just a cloud of electrons.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:53.200
So we have to break what I like to call the scale policy, that the world just exists at this scale.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.200
It does not.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:59.200
There's multiple scales, and the brain is specifying a specific scale.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:09.200
So this wave is supporting, it's a reconstructive wave, and specific to a scale of time.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:15.200
So with a fair way to, I'm just trying to perhaps simplify it for the audience,

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:23.200
there's waves, there's a holographic field made up of waves out in the world.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:30.200
There's waves in my brain, and the waves in my brain are connecting with the waves out in the world.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.200
One could look at it that way.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.200
Okay, simplify.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.200
I mean, that's a really...

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.200
But, you know, because there's levels of description, you can see it as waves,

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:43.200
but now, notice I just described, okay, the copycups is set of waves,

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:50.200
but also at another level, and it shows you a scale, it's all these invariance logs.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:58.200
Okay, the swirling flow field, the adiabatic ratio of energy or oscillation of frequency as I stir.

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:01.200
So, what I had pictured there...

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:06.200
Do you mind just defining invariance for the audience?

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.200
We're going to see it in a second.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.200
Oh, great.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.200
Awesome.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.200
Thank you.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:15.200
We're going there, because this is why I have the picture of Gibson there,

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.200
and the fact that Shaw was a student of Gibson.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:31.200
Because Gibson was the pioneer in describing the importance of invariance laws in the world.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:41.200
And he saw this information as being part and parcel of the direct specification of the coffee cup out there.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.200
So, here's an example.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.200
Here's an example.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.200
You have what's called a texture gradient.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:53.200
And the texture gradient is a whole pile of texture units,

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:58.200
my little circles of the texture units, and they recede in the distance.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.200
The horizontal, there's a little mathematical law.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:09.200
The horizontal distance between each little unit is inversely proportional to the distance from the observer.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.200
S is proportional to 1 over D.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:18.200
And then the vertical separation going back, notice they get completely, completely compressed.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:24.200
That separation is special about the law, 1 over D squared.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:31.200
S, the separation is proportional to 1 over the distance squared from the observer.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.200
So, that's an interesting little thing.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:38.200
Does that have to do with our field of vision?

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.200
Or is this just how...

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:46.200
Sorry, if you could go back a step.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:50.200
Yeah, because I find this very interesting that there's different laws for horizontal versus vertical.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:55.200
The point I forgot to mention, these fields are ubiquitous.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:05.200
These are gravel, this is your gravel driveway, your field of grass, your beach sands, etc.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:13.200
If I turn it upside down, it becomes the cloud ceiling stretching off in the distance to the back.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:19.200
If I turn it on angles like this, it becomes the walls receding.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:33.200
What's being said here is this is an inherent intrinsic mathematical law within these fields, these texture gradients.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:49.200
And it becomes useful because if I move across this gradient, there's an invariance law relative to those texture rows that specify that the cup stays the constant size.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:53.200
Notice there's including roughly four texture rows.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:05:01.200
If I move it forward, it's now including two texture rows, but its height is doubling.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:07.200
So as the height doubles, the number of texture rows is halved.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:17.200
And again, you've got this invariance law where n is the number of rows, s is the height of the cup, or s times n equal k is always a constant.

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:32.200
And so this would be an example of an invariance law where there's this invariant ratio of size to the number of texture rows included as I move the cup back and forth across this gradient,

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:39.200
which is helping specify the role as stable when I move my cup back and forth.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:51.200
The size of the cup does not change, even though the size is growing under wet retina as I move the cup back and forth toward me.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:57.200
This ratio is constant, and so I don't perceive the cup as changing size.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:03.200
I forgot to say two texture rows included with height is doubling.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.200
Here's another one.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:11.200
This is an optical flow field. So we're putting this whole gradient in motion.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:22.200
Now it's a gradient of velocity vectors where, again, the value of each vector is proportional to one over the distance squared, again, the distance from the observer.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:32.200
So the fastest moving vectors are closest to you if I'm standing far away at the border versus optical flow field.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:37.200
The slowest moving vectors are furthest away near the mountains.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:42.200
There's a good example as I'm driving along, velocity flow fields.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:51.200
There's all kinds of interesting little things defined over these flow fields, like the tau ratio, which I've got specified there.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.200
Don't ask me to translate what it means.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:58.200
You can see it involves the velocity over time.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:10.200
But this ratio has been shown to be useful for things like coming in for landing because it specifies the severity of impact.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:18.200
If the tau value is too great that I'm coming up too fast on that flow field is too fast, I'm going to crash.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:27.200
As a bird coming into land, I'm using this tau value to modulate my wings so that I land nice and softly.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:33.200
Or as a pilot, I land nice and softly on the runway.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:44.200
So here we're starting to get a picture of the information in the light and dynamically transforming optical field that the brain is modulating.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:48.200
The brain is getting into the action systems.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:57.200
Those ratios are being used to specify virtual action, how I can act on the world.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:05.200
Here's an example of what's called grasping tau.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:12.200
As I'm moving the cup back and forth for modulating how I grasp the cup.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:21.200
Again, optical information is getting into the action systems to modulate and specify how I can act.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:25.200
Or affordances.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:33.200
If we get more dynamic, I like to do what I call the Gibsonian cube.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:40.200
If you were rotating a cube, you'd have a partition set of these flow fields.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.200
The top would be a radial flow field.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:53.200
As the right side moves toward you, the cube is rotating the opposite direction up there in the corner.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:58.200
If the side is rotating toward you, it's an expanding flow field.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:03.200
Directly presented to you, it's just a non-expanding or contracting flow field.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:11.200
As it rotates away from you, it's a contracting flow field.

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:22.200
The edges and the static features of the cube are really simply sharp discontinuities at the junctures of these flows.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:33.200
If you think they're not, well, here's an interesting little experiment or demonstration that Shaw discussed.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:41.200
I've got a rotating cube, a wire edged, and it's got a symmetry period of four.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:45.200
It carries itself into a symmetry period.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.200
It carries itself onto itself every 90 degrees.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.200
The cube maps right back onto itself every 90 degree turn.

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.200
It looks like the same thing again.

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.200
It's got a symmetry period of four.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.200
You'll do that four times.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:05.200
If I strobe the cube at an interval multiple of that symmetry period, four, eight, twelve times per revolution,

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:09.200
I'll get a rigid cube rotating.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.200
I've got a strobe there.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.200
It'll still look like a rigid cube.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.200
Here's my little picture here.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:23.200
I've got a symmetry period of four, sort of saying the same thing.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.200
In phase, four, eight, twelve.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.200
Out of phase, this would be out of phase strobe, five, nine, thirteen.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.200
It's no longer an integral multiple.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:37.200
Well, if I do the non-intergal multiple, out of phase strobe,

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:43.200
it becomes a wobbly, non-rigid, plastically deforming, not a cube.

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.200
Okay.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:51.200
Now, one could argue there's a constraint being violated

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:59.200
that normally spatial symmetry that our nice cube carries itself into itself four times per revolution

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.200
is no longer being specified.

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:06.200
You expect spatial symmetry should equal a temple symmetry,

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.200
but it's not when you add that out of phase cube.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:16.200
I didn't put another picture here of a rotating ellipse

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:23.200
that if, again, you can decompose the edge of the ellipse

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:27.200
into a whole pile of velocity vectors going around the ellipse,

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.200
and if the ellipse rotates too quickly,

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:34.200
it becomes a rigid, a non-rigid, wobbly object again.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:41.200
So the point being that these forms in the image,

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:50.200
the coffee cup, the table, are very dynamic.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.200
They're dynamic forms.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:55.200
They're actually qualia themselves.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:02.200
That's why I said that the whole image is the problem.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.200
I think I mentioned where Chalmers kind of misled us,

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.200
that the whole image is qualia.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.200
We're trying to explain the image of the external world.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.200
It's all qualia.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:16.200
Hence why we need the brain as a reconstructive wave

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:21.200
specifying a portion of the holographic field.

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.200
As we'll see, that holographic field is qualitative of itself.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:32.200
The cube, the coffee cup, is a qualitative portion

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.200
of a qualitative field.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:40.200
So all of these are examples now, I think, of invariance laws.

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:45.200
I think the velocity vectors in the distance,

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:50.200
the height of the cup, the rows occluded, the total ratio,

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:54.200
it's all information that is specifying or useful

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:57.200
part of the specification of the environment,

01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.200
the external world.

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:04.200
It's not Shannon's definition of information,

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:08.200
nor can it be brought under Shannon's umbrella.

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.200
This is Gibson's information.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.200
It's resolutely and adamantly ignored

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:19.200
in the neural net and computer model mind.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.200
As you can see, it can't be.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.200
Why can't it be?

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.200
It's obviously important.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:32.200
It's too important to ignore.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:39.200
So get put in all together, back to my coffee.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.200
It's got all these invariance laws

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:45.200
defined over that coffee cup.

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:48.200
The radial flow field, an adiabatic invariance,

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.200
there's the ratio of energy of oscillation,

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.200
the frequency of oscillation.

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:54.200
I moved that spoon.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:56.200
And inertial tens are defined in various momentum.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.200
These are all defined over time.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:04.200
You don't find the value of the energy of oscillation

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:08.200
and frequency oscillation as a static, instant, static point.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.200
We'll come back to that.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.200
Acoustical invariance, you've got the spoon

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:16.200
clinking against the cup as the spoon moves and sound.

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:20.200
You've got ratios relative to the extra gradients and flows.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.200
I can move that cup back and forth on the extra gradient,

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.200
remember.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.200
Constancy remains the same.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.200
If I had a cubocal cup, I could be rotating my cup.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.200
And now I have that Gibsonian cube with all the flow fields

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.200
defining the quote edges and vertices of the cup, et cetera.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:44.200
Grasping tau, as we noted, for grasping the cup, et cetera.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.200
So back to my picture.

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.200
Our little coffee cup, our innocent little coffee cup,

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.200
is this invariant structure.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.200
And the invariant structure is, that's what I say,

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:03.200
is driving the modulation of the brain as a reconstructive way.

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.200
But I think now, back to your question,

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.200
well, can we really talk about quote frequency one

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.200
or frequency two, really?

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.200
Only in a metaphoric sense that it helps us

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:17.200
understand the holographic reconstructive process.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.200
This is obviously very complex wave form at this point.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:28.200
If you visualize the brain dynamically changing over time,

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:33.200
being driven by this structure, it's obviously

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:37.200
a very complex structure that's being unfolded into the brain.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:40.200
And yet, ultimately, the vision is

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:45.200
that it's all comprising this reconstructive way.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:52.200
And as I noted before, all models of the brain

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.200
have to address this dynamic structure.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:01.200
Because it's obvious to the information that's specifying,

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:04.200
it's obvious to the information that's defining the event,

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.200
defining coffee stir.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:13.200
But neural nets do not and cannot, partly

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.200
because they're in this completely different model

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.200
in a different model of time.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:27.200
The neural net is simply an instantiation of a Turing machine.

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.200
And the Turing machine is a discrete state model of time,

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:37.200
or removing state 0 to state 1, et cetera, et cetera,

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:41.200
removing state to state as we move that tape.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:46.200
So you've got an intrinsically different model of time

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.200
in the computer model as opposed to what we're going to need

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.200
to support this holographic field, reconstructive wave,

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.200
invariant structure model.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.200
And we're going to get to that.

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:01.200
We're going to break it out in terms of the computer model

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.200
being a discrete view of time.

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.200
Yes.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.200
And we're going to, we're about to launch right into that

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.200
because that's another piece.

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.200
Continuous, OK.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.200
Yeah.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.200
I had one more thing to say about invariance laws.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.200
It's kind of interesting.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.200
Over here, another invariance law.

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.200
Here we have the aging of the facial profile.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:26.200
And the law specifying that aging is such.

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:29.200
If we take a cardioid, which is like a heart shape figure there,

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:32.200
and place it over a skull, and place the skull

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.200
on a nice coordinate system or matrix there,

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.200
then if we apply what's called a strain transformation, which

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.200
expands that coordinate grid in all directions simultaneously,

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:46.200
like stretching a rubber sheet, what you do

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:52.200
is start generating an aging of that profile.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.200
I have a picture there.

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:58.200
If you start with a child, as you do the strain transformation,

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.200
you'll get the second picture there,

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:01.200
and then the third.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.200
There's a whole series, obviously.

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.200
I just picked out three.

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:08.200
And you can see that we're getting an aging of that profile.

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:15.200
So interesting, because this aging is normally a very slow event.

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:22.200
It takes us, we perceive, we recognize that Joe aged after we,

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:27.200
when we meet him 30 years later, or watch him as he grows.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:32.200
But the interesting thing is here is that the same law is going to hold

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:38.200
in different space-time partitions of our relativity.

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:42.200
For example, the burden, the essence of relativity,

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:47.200
the real point of it, in Einstein's relativity,

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:54.200
was that the same law holds in either space-time partition,

01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:58.200
in the moving, in the stationary system on the bottom right there,

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.200
the law is D equal VT.

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:05.200
In the moving system, it's D prime equal VT prime.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.200
It's the same form of law.

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:09.200
It's just I've changed the distance units and the time units

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:14.200
in that moving system, or what I call the moving system.

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:18.200
So the same law holds in each partition D equal VT

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.200
or D prime equal to VT prime.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:23.200
Invariance laws are critical in special relativity.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:27.200
That's probably the most important piece of special relativity.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:32.200
It's the importance of invariance laws.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:35.200
And I got to see what I say here.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:39.200
Now, if I go back and notice, I said you could raise the energy state

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.200
of the body, increase the chemical velocity.

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:47.200
So I could take that buzzing.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:53.200
And if I raise the chemical velocities, I drop in frankly LSD

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:56.200
at the right proportion.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.200
There's a little paper on that.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.200
You're going to increase the chemical velocities,

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.200
but you're going to slow down the specification of the event.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.200
That fly is going to go from 200 wing beats per second

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:12.200
to looking like it's barely flapping its wing.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:16.200
And I got to keep moving you around.

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:20.200
The slow moving wing of that heron-like fly,

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.200
maybe it's a seagull, but we won't argue here.

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.200
What does that mean?

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:28.200
Well, it means it's got a relationship to action,

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.200
the possibility of action.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:33.200
I can reach out slowly and grab the wing.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:38.200
I mean, more startlingly, let's say I raise the energy state enough

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:41.200
so that the fly was stuck still.

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.200
I mean, the wing stopped.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:46.200
Now clearly, I could reach out slowly and grab it.

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:51.200
But this is the exemplar of perception being virtual action.

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:57.200
We're seeing the possibility of action, of how we can act.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:02.200
This must be so for perception to be ecologically valid

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.200
in all partitions.

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:07.200
Because I can change the velocity of processes just by changing

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.200
the temperature.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.200
I can get a fever and I can slow down time.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:13.200
Nature has to have allowed for this.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:22.200
That is, you have to have invariance laws specifying these events.

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:25.200
That is, the information has to be invariance laws

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:28.200
as invariant to the spacetime partition,

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.200
or the energy state of the body.

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:33.200
And the energy state is a range of energy states,

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.200
and the time scale that can be specified

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:38.200
is a massive range of time scales.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.200
Again, this is affordances.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:45.200
It's just an aspect of affordances that the Gibsonians

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.200
never seen.

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:50.200
Well, you can see it's too much of a stretch for them.

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.200
And I'm going to see why ultimately.

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:57.200
But obviously, if the fly is affording a certain action,

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.200
so is the gall affording a certain action.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.200
But it's at a different scale of time.

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:05.200
Change the scale of time, I'm going to change the form of affordance.

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:13.200
So, as I noted, back to where we started,

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.200
aging is a rapid event.

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.200
If I take it as a rapid event,

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:22.200
let's say that little Joe there is growing right in front of my eyes.

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:27.200
So the same law is employed to guide the modulation of the hand

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:29.200
if I wanted to grasp a transforming head,

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.200
the strain on the cardioid.

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.200
That's the information that would be getting into the action systems

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.200
to guide my grabbing that head as it transforms

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.200
at a very rapid rate.

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:44.200
Just a little aspect of the nature,

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:47.200
just the criticality of invariance laws.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:53.200
So, I noted Gibson was for direct perception.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:55.200
To him, the environment is directly specified

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:57.200
via all this information.

01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:01.200
The brain is resonating to this time extended information.

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.200
Another way to put it here in my little box,

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:07.200
the brain is resonating to the invariance in the external event.

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:10.200
And it's directly specifying the image out there.

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:13.200
There's no image in the brain.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.200
That's Gibson.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:17.200
No one can understand it.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.200
Purvis and Lotto, great perception theorist recently.

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:23.200
There's our little book.

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.200
Well, Gibson is now perceived as mystical.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:31.200
Stephen Leihar, who's the only perception theorist, goes through Gibson.

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:33.200
I've looked at Gibson.

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:37.200
I have no clue how direct perception can possibly be true.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:41.200
Because for all these people, somehow the image is in the brain

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:46.200
or in that perceptual space, that cloud I had up there.

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:49.200
Again, to make sense, Gibson's direct perception

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.200
must be placed within Berkson's holographic

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:54.200
brain as a reconstructive wave framework.

01:23:54.200 --> 01:24:02.200
And as we're going to see, it's a notion of time.

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:05.200
And into this, because notion of time.

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:10.200
Another aspect of what implicit aspect, we're specifying the past.

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.200
Okay?

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.200
The specification is to the past,

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:19.200
to the past extent of the transformation of the holographic field.

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:22.200
The wing beats of that fly.

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:27.200
By the time they get into the brain, they're processed a long gone.

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:30.200
Just 200 wing beats per second.

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.200
They're long gone.

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.200
So how are we seeing the past?

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:42.200
How is this past specification possible?

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.200
Well, what's the barrier to that?

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:48.200
The barrier is this conception of space and time that we have.

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:53.200
I call it the classic metaphysical space and time.

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:57.200
And we're going to compare that to ultimately the temporal metaphysics

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:03.200
of Berkson, which allows the specification of the past.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:07.200
So the classic metaphysics, in essence, is an abstract space.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:11.200
It's a three-dimensional continuum of points positions.

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:14.200
I'm showing a two-dimensional continuum of points and positions there.

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.200
My little points and positions.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.200
Ultimately, it's a three-dimensional.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:22.200
We're moving the cup through a three-dimensional continuum of points and positions.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.200
Because it's a space, it's instantly divisible.

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:31.200
In fact, as Berkson calls it, it's a principle of infinite divisibility.

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:38.200
He called it, in essence, a mental diagram, the meshes of which we can contract at will,

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:44.200
that we place beneath the extensity, the true concrete extensity of the concrete world.

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.200
We'll talk about extensity a little bit later.

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:52.200
But just imagine it's the concrete world and we place this abstract mental diagram of meshes

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:55.200
that we can make smaller and smaller.

01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:02.200
So when we look at motion in this framework, it's taken, as I move that cup from nearer to far

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:08.200
across the continuum, it's taken as a series of, that motion is taken as a series of points

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.200
on a line, which, again, is a space.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:14.200
In that line, the inner space is infinitely divisible.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:17.200
I can divide it into this little point after point after point.

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:24.200
But between each pair of points, I can imagine there's another line of points.

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.200
Again, infinitely divisible.

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:31.200
And so what we end up with is this is an infinite regress.

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:32.200
I can keep dividing.

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.200
Between each pair of points, I can do another line.

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:40.200
It's an absurdity because motion is now being reduced to a series of immobilities.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:43.200
How do you get motion out of a series of immobile points?

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:51.200
And I should add, it's precisely the source of Zeno's paradoxes where I'm taking that line

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:55.200
and I'm having it successively into smaller and smaller hands.

01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:01.200
But Achilles never reaches the tortoise because it's infinitely divisible.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:04.200
I can never quit the process of infinite division.

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:11.200
I can do it with a mathematical convention, but that's a magical mathematical convention

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.200
like taking a limit.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:20.200
But that's a mythology that mathematical convention has actually solved the problem.

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:28.200
Whitehead tried that solution, but it's just a mythology because infinity is infinity.

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:36.200
And the mathematical convention is simply conveniently stopping the infinite division.

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:41.200
Now time is interesting because now it's simply the fourth dimension of this abstract space.

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.200
So we really have a four-dimensional abstract space.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.200
It's this series of instants.

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:51.200
So each point along that moving cup is taken as an instant, shall we say.

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:57.200
And so each instant corresponds to a position of the moving cup.

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:04.200
And each instant can be taken as across the whole universe, as though the whole universe

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.200
at that point, at instant in time, is a cube of space.

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:17.200
For each cube, the time extent of each cube is a mathematical point equivalent to the mathematical

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.200
point on the line.

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:24.200
But as such, each of those blocks is frozen, is static.

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:30.200
You can't move from one block to another.

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:32.200
I jumped ahead of myself here.

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:35.200
But each block, then, is completely homogeneous.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:42.200
There's zero qualities, especially emotion, because you can't get a block or a series of such blocks

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.200
because remember, each block disappears as the next one arrives.

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:49.200
So all you ever have is one block, then the next, and the next, and the next.

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:56.200
So you're not going to get the quality of motion like Valerie Hardcastle's list in the context of a symphony.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.200
The patrons shift in their seats.

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.200
The musicians concentrate.

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:03.200
The curtains ever so gently waving.

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:09.200
Those are qualities of motion, which I've never talked about, by the way, the problem of quality.

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.200
But these qualities of motion.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:23.200
So the car, looking at this, in order to reintroduce motion in this metaphysics, actually thought that you had to have,

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:30.200
this is where you needed God because God would have to create each block, then the next block, then the next block,

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:31.200
and the next block.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.200
That's the only way you could get the universe to evolve.

01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:37.200
So once you've frozen it, it's a static block.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:41.200
You're not going to get the next block.

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:51.200
Again, this is precisely the metaphysics underlying the turbine machine and all of computation.

01:29:51.200 --> 01:30:03.200
It's why intrinsically, inherently intrinsically, the computer metaphor is not going to be able to deal with what we need for Berkson's framework,

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:06.200
shall we say, and mind.

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:08.200
So let's go to that.

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:12.200
The temporal metaphysics of Berkson.

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:20.200
Berkson, that transformation of the universal field, or motion itself, is indivisible.

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:23.200
It is not a series of discrete states.

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:30.200
Rather, each instant penetrates, permeates the next, like the notes of a melody.

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:33.200
Each note penetrates, permeates the next.

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:37.200
It's a melodic transformation, an organic continuity.

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:51.200
Also, the matter field, and this is characterized by extensity, as I noted.

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:56.200
There's a nice lake there.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:00.200
That's the concrete material field.

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:07.200
The abstract space placed over it at continual points in positions is not the same thing.

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:13.200
It's the ideal limit of this extensity, but it has never reached it.

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:15.200
It cannot be reached.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:20.200
It's simply an ideal mathematical limit.

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:29.200
This is why you can't exalt the abstract space into a reality

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:34.200
and make it your starting point for building a model of mind, as does AI.

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:39.200
The brain simply does not dwell in the world of the classic metaphysics.

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:43.200
It deals with the classic metaphysics, that abstract space.

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:48.200
It's created or derived by the brain in its development.

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:56.200
Piaget spends a great deal of time explaining, all the way from 8.0 to 8.7,

01:31:56.200 --> 01:32:01.200
it takes to truly construct that abstract space.

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:03.200
Okay.

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:04.200
How's that all?

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:05.200
One point, Steve.

01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:10.200
The top two points here.

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:19.200
I'm sure people disagree, but the current consensus in modern physics

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:23.200
is that space and time is discreet.

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.200
Yes.

01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:27.200
They would break it down in terms of the plank.

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:31.200
Of course, we don't experience it this way because it's so miniscule,

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:37.200
but you have the plank length, plank time.

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:44.200
If you had to discreetize space and time, you could possibly do it that way,

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.200
but this model is different.

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:48.200
Is that accurate?

01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:51.200
Yes.

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:56.200
The problem is all of mathematics is based in the classic metaphysics.

01:32:56.200 --> 01:33:07.200
And even the wave equation is based in this classic metaphysics

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:15.200
and ultimately involves this process of taking limits,

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:20.200
such that I can arbitrarily stop in infinity.

01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.200
Okay.

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:26.200
The basis of the wave equation is Euler's identity.

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:34.200
Or Euler's identity is Euler's description of the wave,

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:37.200
but in order to make that identity work,

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:44.200
eventually you take a limit to stop the basically Euler's identity.

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:49.200
You've got sort of a rotating cosine wave,

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:51.200
but it always comes back to zero.

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:54.200
In order to make it come back to zero, that's Euler's identity,

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:56.200
E to the i pi equals zero,

01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:01.200
you have to take a limit of that relation, E to the i pi,

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.200
our arbitrary mathematical limit,

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:05.200
but that sits at the heart of the wave equation.

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:12.200
And you're exalting that abstraction into the reality from which you're trying to start all theory.

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:17.200
Everything's inverted in our current theoretical world.

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.200
That's the problem.

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:32.200
So, yeah, I did a, speaking of quantum, I mean, I did a YouTube on Schroediger.

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:37.200
I think it's number 60 on quantum jumps.

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:44.200
Schroediger did a paper in 1952 where he utterly destroyed the whole notion of quantum jumps.

01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:46.200
He destroyed it, logically destroyed it.

01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:49.200
People don't realize this.

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:59.200
And so, you know, that's, but again, that comes back to the fundamental nature of the mathematics underneath it.

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:04.200
So, let's see.

01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:06.200
As I said, this is important.

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:11.200
The brain dwells or is embedded in dynamically transforming,

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:16.200
indivisibly transforming a holographic field or the world of temporal metaphysics.

01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:22.200
It derives the spatial metaphysics, the classic metaphysics, the abstract space.

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:27.200
This is just completely foundational if you're going to follow Bergson.

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.200
Okay.

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:33.200
So, let's find the past to bring it back.

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:37.200
The indivisible transformation of the field where there are no incidents falling into the past.

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:44.200
You don't have this model of instant after instant falling into the past,

01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:47.200
which is the symbol of non-existence.

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:55.200
Rather, you've got this indivisible flow, each instant permeating the next organic continuity.

01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:02.200
Well, that in effect forms a primary memory, still in the term from William James.

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:06.200
The field is already, in essence, got its own memory.

01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:11.200
It's not falling into the past, into non-existence.

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:18.200
So, then when you're specifying the holographic field,

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:23.200
the specifications to a past extent of this holographic field.

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:27.200
Now, this is interesting aspects of things that I haven't totally worked out,

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:32.200
because you're going to have to have the resonance field represented by that brain,

01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:37.200
the wave there is only lasting for a certain period of time,

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:43.200
relative to an extent of the past of the field, of the buzzing fly.

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:46.200
Again, as in, the wing beats are long gone.

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:52.200
So, this allows a past extent of the transformation to be specified.

01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:56.200
You don't need short-term storage areas in the brain,

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:59.200
which is a concept filled with logical problems.

01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:03.200
Because right now, if you think about when I said, for Berkson,

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:07.200
the essence of the problem of consciousness was his memory stored in the brain.

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:12.200
Well, when your perception is already the problem,

01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:16.200
you're looking at that spoon stirring and the fly buzzing.

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:20.200
Well, are you storing each instant of that in the brain,

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:24.200
sliced by, like, snapshot by snapshot by snapshot,

01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:28.200
then trying to reconstruct the motion?

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:30.200
How are you doing that?

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:34.200
Who reconstructs the motion, some internal scanner?

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.200
We'll talk about that in a second,

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:43.200
but you can see that the very fundamentals of perception itself,

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:46.200
of seeing that coffee cup already involves the problem is,

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:48.200
well, his memory actually being stored in the brain,

01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:51.200
his experience being stored in the brain.

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:57.200
And the answer is, no, it can't be.

01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.200
And something else we can see there, but I lost it.

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:03.200
So, but if I go back to Gibson for a second,

01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:06.200
you'll see what he's saying the same thing.

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:08.200
Notice this.

01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:10.200
This is back to the classic metaphysics.

01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:13.200
He says, the idea that space is perceived,

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:16.200
and time, as you remember, looks at the back of our thinking.

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:21.200
But these abstractions, space and time, the classic metaphysics,

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:26.200
borrowed from physics are not appropriate to psychology.

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.200
And this is adjacent to order and successive order,

01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:31.200
but are abstractions, and these are not found separate.

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:34.200
Oops, I can spell our other.

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:38.200
This is physical events that conform with relation before and after,

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:40.200
and not to the contrast of past and future.

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:43.200
Well, again, you've got to visualize that line of points,

01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:45.200
where one point is the present,

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:47.200
points before that are all past,

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.200
which have fallen away,

01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:52.200
and the points coming later are future.

01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:55.200
That's what he's saying is that's the classic metaphysics.

01:38:55.200 --> 01:39:01.200
When you take the classic metaphysics down to its logical conclusion,

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:07.200
and the brain itself only exists for one of those infinitely small points,

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:11.200
a point of mathematical extent and time.

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:14.200
That's just not applicable.

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:18.200
Unfortunately, the Gibsonians are not paying attention to that quote.

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:22.200
I mean, even my brilliant advisor, Bob Schaage,

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:28.200
the paper's trying to model the whole of the Gibsonian ecological theory

01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:33.200
on the wave equation with its inherent problem.

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.200
So, just an aside.

01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:41.200
Here's another thing that Gibson notes,

01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:43.200
the traveling moment of present time,

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:49.200
that infinitely tiny point that's called the present

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:52.200
between the past and the future,

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:54.200
the dispacious present,

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:57.200
that mathematical point that would be the dispacious present.

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.200
Again, Berks and Gibson notes,

01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:02.200
well, no one can say where perception leaves off when memory begins.

01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:05.200
In fact, I failed to put the quote there,

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:07.200
but when we're looking at the past,

01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:09.200
the specification of the past,

01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:14.200
it's really an essence of Berkson said is the case.

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:18.200
Perception is already a memory.

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:21.200
All of perception is memory already.

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.200
So, no one can say where perception leaves off,

01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:29.200
memory begins, it's difficult, it's an old one,

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:32.200
and notice he says in the blue,

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.200
there are animals of man perceived motions,

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:36.200
events, episodes, and whole sequences.

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:39.200
They don't see point after point,

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:42.200
it's an after incident on a line

01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:44.200
for the classic metaphysics.

01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:47.200
And he says the doctrine of sensation-based perception

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:50.200
requires the assumption that the succession of items can be grasped,

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:53.200
only if the earlier ones are held over,

01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:57.200
so as to be combined with later ones in a single composite.

01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:00.200
He says this can be pushed into absurdity.

01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:03.200
Well, notice I've got up there,

01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:07.200
Barcelona's theory of how you would store a biting transformation.

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:10.200
I'd store it there, I'm inviting a carrot,

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:13.200
there's three schematic states,

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:16.200
mouth closed, mouth open, mouth closed back on the carrot.

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:19.200
And so we store that in the brain, three schematic states.

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.200
Equivalent to storing, putting three snapshots

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:25.200
on photographs on a table.

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:28.200
Okay, the question is, well, how do I restore the motion?

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:33.200
How do I reconstruct the motion by some sort of internal scanner?

01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:36.200
Okay, but then I've got an infinite regress,

01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:39.200
I've now got to explain how the scanner, internal scanner,

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.200
registers the motion.

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:45.200
See, I'm doing there exactly in that picture what Gibson's saying,

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.200
a succession of items can be grasped,

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.200
only if the earlier ones are held over,

01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:52.200
like on the table, successively one after the other,

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:55.200
to be combined with later ones into a single composite.

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:57.200
It can be pushed into absurdity.

01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:59.200
Yes, it can.

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:04.200
Biting is actually a facial flow field.

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:07.200
There's Homer there, biting, or, you know,

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:10.200
look at the facial flow fields on these biting.

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:11.200
There we go.

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.200
Here's an actual, you know, biting a carrot.

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:15.200
Okay.

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:18.200
It's hard to store.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:20.200
Well, I screwed up.

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.200
We got to go back.

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:24.200
Sorry about that.

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:29.200
It's hard to store as the coffee stirrer into the rotating queue.

01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:32.200
See, again, notice.

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:35.200
Do you see anyone in memory theory,

01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:37.200
I'm just rhetorical questions as far as your concern,

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:41.200
addressing how you would store that coffee stirrer

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.200
with all those invariance laws that define it,

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:45.200
which define only over time.

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:48.200
The invariant radio flow field, the inertial tensors,

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:50.200
how do you store that?

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:53.200
And, you know, as a series of three-dimensional snapshots

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:56.200
in the brain, good luck.

01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:02.200
And then how do you restore it as reconstructed as motion?

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:06.200
Hence, you know, again, Gibson is relying on Berks.

01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:11.200
Which brings us to the last thing I got here.

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:15.200
That good old original question, the problem of subject and object.

01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:18.200
What is going on there?

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:22.200
Because we need to remove the viewer.

01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:26.200
Somebody looking, see, remember the hologram plate is the brain.

01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:32.200
And we have to review who's looking at that image out there.

01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:36.200
Or, equivalently, we need to remove the homunculus,

01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:41.200
looking at the image, whether it's in the perceptual space

01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:47.200
or out there, or somehow.

01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:50.200
So we're back to our coin.

01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:52.200
Questions related to subject and object.

01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:54.200
The distinction in the union is you put in terms of time

01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.200
rather than space.

01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.200
My original coin.

01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:04.200
So, here's the deal.

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:08.200
Defined over the dynamically transforming holographic field,

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:12.200
we've got an elementary awareness at the null scale of time.

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:16.200
When I say null scale, I mean the most infinitely small scale

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:18.200
of time you can imagine.

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:20.200
Things are still always changing,

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:24.200
but think of that change in the tiniest interval you can imagine.

01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:28.200
Again, each point or event in that field reflects

01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:32.200
the state of all of the points.

01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:36.200
So, in essence, you've got elementary awareness there.

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:40.200
At every point, every point is sort of elementary for,

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:43.200
not truly elementary, of all the other points,

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:47.200
taken at this infinitely small scale of time.

01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:50.200
And you've got elementary memory

01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:54.200
because of the indivisible transformation,

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:56.200
where there are no instants falling into the past,

01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:59.200
that primary memory.

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:04.200
So, as I've noted, if you take our fly

01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:08.200
and take it at that null scale,

01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:10.200
at a very tiny scale of time,

01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:14.200
where it's almost a cloud of electrons,

01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:17.200
it's not going to have the distinct outlines

01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:20.200
of the rest of the field, the rest of the whole erratic field,

01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:23.200
to include any distinct outlines from our body.

01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:25.200
Our body is going to be the same thing.

01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:28.200
In other words, the objects that we think are nice and separate,

01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:30.200
like the cup and the spoon and the body,

01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:33.200
don't actually have the distinct outlines.

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:36.200
They're all meshed into the field, ultimately.

01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:39.200
It's a big spatial unity.

01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:45.200
So, if I start lowering the energy state of that brain,

01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:48.200
I'm going to lower it now,

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:53.200
because I'm going to go from this very small scale to a bigger scale.

01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:56.200
I'll get my hair in like fly.

01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:59.200
And if I lower it still more,

01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:02.200
I'll get my normal scale, a buzzing like fly.

01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:06.200
So, we're starting to have subject differentiating from object,

01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:10.200
not in terms of space, but of time.

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:15.200
The unity of the two,

01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:18.200
the body and the fly there, is not broken.

01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:20.200
Spatial unity.

01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:23.200
Remember, there's no distinct outlines

01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:26.200
or borders between these objects.

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:31.200
But as I impose the scale of time,

01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:34.200
I start getting this nice separate object,

01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:37.200
the buzzing fly and the coffee cup from my body.

01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:42.200
And, you know, in terms of time,

01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:47.200
and then I think we have to add a bit more with the Piagetian development,

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:55.200
where ultimately, he describes this whole evolution

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:58.200
of the child's conception of object,

01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:01.200
where he starts to realize that he's a separate object

01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:03.200
from the coffee cup and the fly.

01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:07.200
Can I tell you a quick anecdote that this reminds me of?

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:09.200
Do you mind?

01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:10.200
Say what?

01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:12.200
I just have a quick anecdote on that.

01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:13.200
You just mentioned child.

01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.200
And this is reminding me.

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:18.200
I have a niece and two nephews.

01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:21.200
And this is just recalling something my nephew said to me years ago

01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:23.200
when he was a little younger.

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:25.200
I think he was five or six years old.

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:28.200
And we were just playing, hanging out.

01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:31.200
And he said something to me that we were separated.

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:34.200
He was standing on the, he was standing, you know,

01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:36.200
I was standing separate from him.

01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:41.200
And he goes, I'm touching you right now.

01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:42.200
I was like, what do you mean?

01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:44.200
He's like, well, I'm standing on the floor

01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:45.200
and the floor is touching you.

01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:47.200
You're touching the floor.

01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:49.200
And I was like, huh?

01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.200
And he said, yeah, it even,

01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:52.200
I'm touching the house across the street.

01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:53.200
I'm touching that.

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:56.200
And his conception, I think it has something to do with,

01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:57.200
I think about this a lot with kids.

01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:58.200
Like, what are they perceiving?

01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:00.200
What are they seeing?

01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:04.200
What is their kind, like the difference in terms of,

01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:06.200
and obviously as they grow up,

01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:11.200
they reach some critical period where they come into agreement

01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:15.200
with society, the people around them as to the nature of things

01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:16.200
and what's actually happening, right?

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:18.200
Or as we perceive it.

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:20.200
Yeah, they start to need to be one.

01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:21.200
Yeah.

01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:23.200
But the interesting thing is like,

01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:26.200
if you look at it in terms of a slice of time, let's say,

01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:31.200
and I hope this is, it follows with what you're saying.

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:35.200
If you were able to just take a slice of time, one plank time,

01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:40.200
let's say, you know, just one snapshot,

01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:43.200
everything would be the same object.

01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:45.200
Is that accurate?

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:46.200
Yeah.

01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:47.200
Yeah.

01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:50.200
Once you, because it's all, it's one big field.

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:54.200
And yeah, almost, yeah.

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:55.200
I'd say yes.

01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:57.200
I'd go for that.

01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:58.200
Something like that.

01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:01.200
Obviously language is tough because we're trying to put

01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:05.200
to words these very complex things and it might not even be

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:08.200
possible in our vocabulary to get there,

01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:13.200
but we can kind of analyze and get around it sort of.

01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:14.200
True.

01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.200
Okay.

01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:16.200
I think I may be one more thing.

01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:20.200
So this is where it's kind of interesting because really there is,

01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:23.200
the essence is there's no one seeing.

01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:26.200
This is where it gets Zen.

01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:31.200
The specification is to a time scale form of that elementary

01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:34.200
awareness that we're talking about elementary memory to find

01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:37.200
over the transforming holographic field.

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:40.200
And so, I mean, this is the kind of the essence of the Zen

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:45.200
Satori where all of a sudden you've been concentrated on your

01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:46.200
Koan.

01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:48.200
Who is it that sees?

01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:49.200
All right.

01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:52.200
And all of a sudden there's this Satori or Ken show where you,

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:54.200
you are the field.

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:58.200
You know, there's a famous book by Douglas E. Harding that I having

01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:02.200
on having no head where all of a sudden you realize there's just

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:07.200
this, there's no, there's, there's no, you're, you're that,

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:10.200
that you're, you know, there's no separate being.

01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:13.200
You're, you're his context.

01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:18.200
He became the Himalayas, you know, after time, but this,

01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:23.200
this is the essence of the Zen Satori.

01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:28.200
I spent some time on YouTube discussing, I know you said you

01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:30.200
watched the Zen experience.

01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:33.200
I think those are my favorites.

01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:34.200
Right.

01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:36.200
This is why Berkson is so Zen.

01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:38.200
I'm not sure what I got left here now.

01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:42.200
Well, like I said, so, well, I have a lot of questions even when

01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:45.200
you're, I have a lot of questions even when we complete the slide

01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:47.200
share, but

01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:54.200
so notice this is Berkson's unique panpsychism over on the

01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:55.200
left.

01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:59.200
It's, it's a panpsychic model because that field is conscious in

01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:00.200
essence.

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:03.200
It's got elementary awareness and elementary memory, but it's not

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:08.200
the consciousness of stirring spoons on that experience of the

01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:11.200
coffee cup and stirring spoon or if you're a frog, the fly buzzing

01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:12.200
or anything like that.

01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:17.200
It's, it's not yet the consciousness of frogs or humans or ants or

01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:22.200
anything, but it's panpsychic, but there is no aggregation

01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:23.200
problem.

01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:26.200
We're not trying to, this is Chalmers famous problem.

01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:30.200
We're not trying to aggregate or combine the consciousness of all

01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:34.200
the little tiny particles into the field and explain how we end up

01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.200
with the experience of coffee stirring.

01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:39.200
You know, how do you get coffee stirring on a bunch of little

01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:41.200
conscious particles?

01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:46.200
Well, or to make it even worse for Chalmers, how would you explain

01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:50.200
how you now get the time scale of the buzzing fly as opposed to the

01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:54.200
hearing like fly as opposed to the electron cloud fly out of your

01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:56.200
conscious particles too, right?

01:51:56.200 --> 01:52:01.200
Of course, time scale is never a problem for any quality of

01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:03.200
consciousness there's ever seen in my life yet.

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:07.200
So they just don't comprehend that one.

01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:13.200
So the deal is the reconstructive wave specification dynamics

01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:14.200
takes care of this.

01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:19.200
I'm specifying this field as a coffee cup and a buzzing fly.

01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:22.200
I don't know, in other words, I now have a dynamics.

01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:26.200
I have a mechanism to explain the conscious experience of the

01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:31.200
external world in this panpsychic field that panpsychism in and

01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:32.200
of itself does not have.

01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:33.200
It has no such thing.

01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:37.200
It fails miserably and drops dead on that.

01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:43.200
So that's my panpsychic.

01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:47.200
The only other thing I had that was, I just, I think it's worth

01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:51.200
mentioning is this.

01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:59.200
In this model, experience is not in solely within the brain.

01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:02.200
Therefore, it cannot be stored solely in the brain.

01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:10.200
Yes, the brain, the brain also as a reconstructive wave can resonate

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:16.200
in the same invariance law pattern as the coffee cup we saw,

01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:17.200
as the coffee stirring.

01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:23.200
And we can reconstruct or reintegrate in the old terminology

01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:25.200
that experience.

01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:29.200
So if you wreck the brain as a modulating device, it's going to

01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:33.200
look like the memory is gone.

01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:37.200
A memory stored in the brain is destroyed, but all you've done is

01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:43.200
wreck the brain's ability to assume the complex modulation pattern

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:48.200
that is involved in perception of that coffee cup as we've been

01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:50.200
discussing.

01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:54.200
Now, obviously then, in other words, what we really are,

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:58.200
and if you took Berkson's theory of the temporal metaphysics,

01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:00.200
we're four dimensional beings.

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:05.200
And we're elongated being of four dimensions in which all of that

01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:09.200
experience, all the coffee stirrings you've ever seen,

01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:12.200
are stored in detail.

01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:19.200
Not in that image form necessarily, but it's all there.

01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:23.200
And I can reconstruct it by re-assuming the right modulation

01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:26.200
or resonance pattern.

01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:31.200
And so obviously you've got a whole different theory of memory

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:32.200
implied.

01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:35.200
I've done a lot of talking about, but also a whole different

01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:41.200
theory of cognition, because we're using our experience,

01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:44.200
our experience of coffee cups, our experience of cubes,

01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:50.200
of rotating cubes, et cetera, to do cognition, to think.

01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:55.200
And this is where Penrose went when he was talking about why

01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:01.200
computers can't deal with consciousness.

01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:04.200
And he started up, obviously, with the Gettle's proof as being

01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:09.200
an indication or the problem basically showing this.

01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:13.200
But along the way, in the shadows of the mind,

01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:16.200
he started talking about what he saw as non-computational

01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:17.200
thought.

01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:20.200
And here's a little example I've got here of his non-computational

01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:21.200
thought.

01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:26.200
This would be a proof, a visual proof that he tried out of a

01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:28.200
computation that does not stop.

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:30.200
It's called the halting problem.

01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:33.200
How can I show that a computation does not stop?

01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:37.200
It goes on infinitely and always ends up with the next logical

01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:38.200
result?

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:44.200
Well, in this case, what he's doing is showing that a hexagonal

01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:48.200
number and added to a previous hexagonal number always makes a

01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:49.200
circle number.

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:51.200
And that never stops.

01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:58.200
And so what he does is an example there.

01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:01.200
You've got the number 19, which is a hexagonal number,

01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:04.200
and he folds that into a three-sided cube.

01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:09.200
And then he stacks that three-sided cube over the previous

01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:14.200
cube, which was an 8, 2 by 2 by 2, a 2 by 2 by 2 cube.

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:18.200
And now he's got a 3 by 3 by 3 cube of 27.

01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:22.200
He's going to go on and take another cubicle number, which is

01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:31.200
37, fold it in three sides, stack it over the 3 by 3 by 3

01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:35.200
cube, 4 by 4 by 4 cube, and now he's 64.

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:38.200
And obviously this can go on and on and on.

01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:41.200
So notice what he's doing.

01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:42.200
It's very visual.

01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:47.200
He's folding each hexagonal number into a three-sided cube.

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:52.200
He's stacking the cube always over the next to make an ever,

01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:54.200
ever larger cube.

01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:57.200
So this is a dynamic transformation.

01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:59.200
Hope I don't lose my slide.

01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:00.200
Yeah, over time.

01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:05.200
It requires a mind that's in indivisible flow, not state after

01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:08.200
state after state, where each previous state disappears as the

01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:11.200
next one comes, which is the essence of the computer model.

01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:14.200
You have to have this invisible flow or continuity else the

01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:20.200
globality of this transformation of continuous folding and

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:22.200
stacking cannot be perceived.

01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:26.200
And the invariance across this transformation, namely always a

01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:30.200
three-sided cube, always ultimately a stacked cube,

01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:33.200
the variance can't be registered.

01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:38.200
So Penrose was really pointing to the essence of invariance laws

01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:40.200
as being the essence of proofs.

01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:48.200
And I need this continuous, indivisible transformation.

01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:52.200
Him being a complete mathematician and totally stuck in the

01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:55.200
classic metaphysics didn't realize what he's saying.

01:57:55.200 --> 01:58:01.200
He never has grasped the implications of non-competitional

01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:02.200
thought.

01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:06.200
And of course he was trashed heavily in behavioral and brain

01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:09.200
sciences journal when he did a process of this book.

01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:10.200
They couldn't stand it.

01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:13.200
But this is what he was pointing to.

01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:16.200
This is the essence of true cognition.

01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:18.200
This is what you have to have.

01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:23.200
And this is why a computer and AI is never going to equal human

01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:24.200
thought.

01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:29.200
Because again, the intrinsic model of time is the classic

01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:30.200
metaphysics.

01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:32.200
The discrete instant state of time.

01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:37.200
No matter how concrete you look at the computer itself with all

01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:44.200
of its electrical flows and wires, et cetera, the essence of the

01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:46.200
machine is an abstraction.

01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:48.200
It's a logical model.

01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:53.200
It can be carried out on an abacus or a registered machine with

01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:56.200
beans and shoeboxes as long as you're carrying out the abstract

01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:57.200
operations.

01:58:57.200 --> 01:59:01.200
And the abstract operations are state after state after state

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.200
in discrete time.

01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:08.200
So inherently, intrinsically, it cannot do this type of thought.

01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:11.200
And you're never going to get AI.

01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:16.200
And if you notice, this is actually already simply a special

01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:20.200
case of the problem of common sense of knowledge, which AI

01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:22.200
can't deal with either.

01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:24.200
It's his bet noir, common sense.

01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:29.200
Yes, there's working on Lacrune trying heavily to solve it in

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:32.200
terms of neural net architecture.

01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:37.200
But neural nets are, again, simply instantiations of

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:39.200
Turing machines.

01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:41.200
So they're faced with this problem.

01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:44.200
This is just another common sense of knowledge problem.

01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:48.200
I mean, you can imagine myself, I'm going to build a mousetrap or

01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:51.200
even a lawn mower, and I got to stack a whole bunch of stuff on

01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:54.200
top of each other and make a big cube.

01:59:55.200 --> 02:00:00.200
So I think that's the main thing I wanted to say.

02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:03.200
Yeah, notice I have a little note here.

02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:07.200
Penrose identified this thought as demanding consciousness.

02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:12.200
But again, in other words, he's stuck in a classic metaphysics

02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:15.200
and doesn't understand that consciousness and pleasantness

02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:20.200
will flow as time at primary memory.

02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:26.200
This is just an example of the same thing.

02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:30.200
Piaget is just replete with this.

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:34.200
I mean, if Penrose actually understood the literature of

02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:37.200
developmental psychology and cognitive psychology that Piaget

02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:40.200
represents, he would probably be ashamed to do what he had said.

02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:44.200
But here's another simple example.

02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:48.200
Piaget is taking children age three to seven.

02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:49.200
He's got a tunnel there.

02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:52.200
He moves those little colored beads into the tunnel,

02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:54.200
and then he rotates the tunnel.

02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:56.200
There's a halter, and then he asks the child,

02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:58.200
well, what order will it come out now?

02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:02.200
And you can see if I do a semi-rotation, 180 degrees,

02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:04.200
the order is going to be reversed.

02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:08.200
I'm going to go in as ABC, but I'm going to come out as CBA.

02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:12.200
If I do a full rotation, I'm going to keep the order the same, right?

02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:15.200
I'm going to come out again as ABC.

02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:20.200
But three times, three half turns, I'm going to invert the order.

02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:25.200
And if I ask seven times, what's the order going to be?

02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:30.200
Well, if I know the rule by this time that the order changes,

02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:32.200
odd number of turns, the order reverses.

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:36.200
Even number of turns, the order is going to be the same as it went in.

02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:38.200
I can always tell you, 19.

02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:42.200
Okay, well, it's going to be, the order is going to reverse, right?

02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:47.200
It takes the children three to seven years to figure this out,

02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:49.200
this odd even rule.

02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:54.200
And in the course of it, what they do is they visualize,

02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:56.200
just like Penrose and his cubes,

02:01:56.200 --> 02:02:00.200
they visualize one half rotation, one semi-rotation.

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:01.200
What will happen then?

02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:02.200
What if I do it again?

02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:04.200
What if I do it three times?

02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:07.200
Okay, it's going to reverse.

02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:12.200
And they'll get to a point where they can maybe visualize four semi-rotations,

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:16.200
but ask, well, what will happen on number five?

02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:17.200
They can't.

02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:19.200
They flake out.

02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:20.200
They can't visualize it.

02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:25.200
They can't keep the train of visualization going anymore.

02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:28.200
So ultimately they come to a point where they can say,

02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:30.200
what's body seven?

02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:33.200
Oh, yeah.

02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:35.200
Odd number of turns, it's going to reverse.

02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:40.200
And this all comes down to what he describes as concrete operations,

02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:42.200
which develop over three to seven years.

02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:44.200
And here's this interesting quote.

02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:46.200
He says, well, operations, one might say,

02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:48.200
are nothing more than articulated intuitions,

02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:51.200
when they're adaptable and completely reversible,

02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:53.200
since they are emptied of their visual content

02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:56.200
and survive as pure intention.

02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:59.200
In other words, operations come into being in their pure state

02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:02.200
when there's skimethization.

02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:04.200
So notice that.

02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:11.200
In essence, the imagery, the dynamic transformation of imagery

02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:14.200
is absolutely essential in the course of development,

02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:17.200
exactly like Penrose was pointing to.

02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:20.200
It's just that as you do it enough,

02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:26.200
the images almost disappear in terms of very schematized form.

02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:29.200
And so he says, instead of demanding an actual representation,

02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:32.200
each inversion will be conceived as a potential representation,

02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:35.200
like the outline for an experiment to be performed,

02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:37.200
which is not useful to follow to the letter,

02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:39.200
even in the form of performing it mentally.

02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:44.200
So this is really the essence of Piaget's concrete operations

02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:48.200
or non-computational thought to put it in Penrose's term,

02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:51.200
which he didn't under the novel Piaget.

02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:54.200
In other words, you need Berkson's device

02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:56.200
to support this kind of thought.

02:03:56.200 --> 02:04:01.200
Again, this is just a common sense knowledge problem.

02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:06.200
I mean, this is a specific problem,

02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:12.200
but is this an example of the kind of, I mean,

02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:16.200
called a thought process, the kind of problem solving

02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:20.200
that a computer would find difficult to do at this point?

02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:22.200
Yeah.

02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:29.200
Common sense knowledge is the essence of the problem.

02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:34.200
I mean, they've tried to simulate this stuff with neural nets,

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:38.200
the developmental series, but people have looked at it

02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:41.200
and says, well, what's going on in the neural net weight,

02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:44.200
how the weight changes, nothing to do with how children

02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:46.200
actually develop.

02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:50.200
But when I say common sense knowledge problems,

02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:57.200
my metaphor, my example I like is creating a mousetrap

02:04:57.200 --> 02:05:00.200
out of arbitrary components.

02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:04.200
Where I should have put my picture in here.

02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:07.200
But you imagine you have a little cardboard box

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:10.200
and you have a pencil and rubber bands and paper clips

02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:13.200
and a piece of cheese and some strings and some toothpicks.

02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:18.200
And I actually ran across this when I was in my teens,

02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:20.200
it was in Reader's Digest.

02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:22.200
It was a creativity test for engineers.

02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:25.200
Well, here's this pile of stuff, can you make a mousetrap?

02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:26.200
OK.

02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:29.200
And you can visualize making a mousetrap with a,

02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:33.200
imagine a box with, you got the pencil drawn back.

02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:36.200
You've got rubber band outside the box

02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:38.200
and you have a little hole.

02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:40.200
The pencil goes through and you can draw the pencil back

02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:44.200
and maybe you put the toothpick lodged in a little groove

02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:48.200
in the pencil so that the pencil sticks there.

02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:53.200
The pencil would be in the inside of the box,

02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:57.200
holding the pencil and there's a string to the cheese

02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:59.200
and the mouse pulls the string, pulls the pencil out

02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:01.200
and sticks himself with the pencil.

02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:02.200
OK.

02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:04.200
The pencil flies and hits the mouse.

02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:06.200
In other words, it's a crossbow trap.

02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:08.200
It's analogous to a crossbow.

02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:09.200
OK.

02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:10.200
Get the picture.

02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:12.200
I could make, if I got a razor blade,

02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:14.200
I stick the razor blade into the pencil

02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:17.200
and I prop the razor blade up in a corner

02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:20.200
and prop it up with a pencil and maybe rubber bands

02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:21.200
pulling it down.

02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:25.200
Give myself some staples to work with.

02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:29.200
So there's force on the pencil.

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:31.200
The mouse has got to be a fairly strong mouse

02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:35.200
with that trap to pull the razor.

02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:37.200
It all depends.

02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:41.200
People whip up these traps all the time.

02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:42.200
Gotcha.

02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:44.200
So if you're, yeah.

02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:47.200
Maybe you have the stapler falling on the mouse.

02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:48.200
I don't know.

02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:50.200
This is the common.

02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:51.200
OK.

02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:56.200
The problem is that there's no finite set of features

02:06:56.200 --> 02:07:00.200
that you could put in the database that a machine could use

02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:05.200
because the features are emerging with the transformation.

02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:08.200
The rigidity of the pencil and the sharpness and the fact

02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:11.200
or the fact that I could lodge it in the box corner.

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:16.200
The box corner is a nice place to lodge a pencil for the axe.

02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:19.200
All these things are all these features of the pencil

02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:23.200
or the functions emerge with the transformation

02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:27.200
that you're the analogy transformation.

02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:28.200
You're sort of visualizing.

02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:31.200
I can make it into a crossbow or I could make it

02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:35.200
into a giant boulder trap like that destroys Wiley Coyote

02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:37.200
or something like that.

02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:40.200
OK.

02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:47.200
So it becomes a massive problem of representation,

02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:49.200
excuse me, of the features of objects

02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:53.200
because there's no finite list, excuse me,

02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:57.200
all the transformations that are necessary, et cetera.

02:07:57.200 --> 02:07:59.200
That's the common sense knowledge problem.

02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:01.200
And you can see why I'm saying, well, just

02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:06.200
tunnel rotation or stacking cubes of one another

02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:10.200
is just part of the same kind of problem, the same thought

02:08:10.200 --> 02:08:11.200
process.

02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:12.200
Cool.

02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:13.200
And yes.

02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:15.200
This is your last slide, right?

02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:16.200
Yeah.

02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:17.200
I do believe.

02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:19.200
If you have time, I have one more.

02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:20.200
Oh, one more.

02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:21.200
Yeah.

02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:26.200
But I thought that would be the one we, part two,

02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:29.200
if we ever do one, we'll go into relativity

02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:35.200
because that's another piece of the story of, excuse me,

02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:37.200
getting hit in the horse.

02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:43.200
This is another piece of the story that was interesting

02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:46.200
because I remember Berkson's argument

02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:48.200
with Einstein and relativity.

02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:54.200
And in that time I had with Shaw,

02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:59.200
I was trying to reconcile Berkson to relativity

02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:01.200
because Berkson believes in becoming,

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.200
the dynamic transformation of the universe

02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:05.200
is always evolving and coming.

02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:09.200
But you have that static block model of space time

02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:12.200
where everything's laid out in one big block

02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:14.200
because supposedly there's no simultaneity.

02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:19.200
Therefore, there's no plane that you can take through that block

02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:24.200
that represents a universal present across the entire block,

02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:29.200
a present instance that then grows as the block grows.

02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:34.200
Because I've destroyed simultaneity, supposedly.

02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:37.200
And I was trying to reconcile that

02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:40.200
and I found this article by Millik Kapek

02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:47.200
where he tries to show that the Minkowski formula

02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:53.200
for the space time manifold or matrix,

02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:58.200
the Minkowski space time, actually preserves becoming.

02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:02.200
And I thought that was cool and I wrote this paper up

02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:06.200
because then it seemed like, okay, Berkson's got to be coming

02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:09.200
and this interpretation says there's at least some becoming

02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:14.200
in the static block universe, there's got to be some becoming.

02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:17.200
And that seems to be the point of reconciliation.

02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:20.200
Shaw thought that was cool and he gave it to Gibson

02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:22.200
who was there at the time.

02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:27.200
And Gibson read the article and said,

02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:30.200
well, yeah, scribbled on the top half.

02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:33.200
Yeah, it's good to take big thoughts, big questions,

02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:35.200
but you should look at other things.

02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:39.200
He said, okay, he doesn't like that resolution.

02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:43.200
And the next day he was giving his talk at the University of Minnesota

02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:48.200
and he comes up with a statement out of the blue,

02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:51.200
to anyone there other than someone who happened

02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:54.200
to have written that particular paper, namely me.

02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:57.200
So I'm sitting there and I'm probably the only one who knew what he was saying,

02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:59.200
but this is the quote, he says,

02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:02.200
physicists must lead us when they say there is no simultaneity.

02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:05.200
When the camera pans to the hero and tied to the rails

02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:09.200
and then to the hero rushing to the rescue on his horse,

02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:12.200
these events are simultaneous.

02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:16.200
I guess we should add the train in to speed into the hero.

02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:22.200
So, and I recognized right away another one of those,

02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:26.200
I know this is, he's siding with Berkson.

02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:30.200
He's siding with Berkson against Berkson's argument against Einstein,

02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:32.200
because these are multiple, what's called multiple,

02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:39.200
I call multiple simultaneous flows that cannot be relativized.

02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:41.200
And that's another whole topic.

02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:43.200
I don't know if you want to share that.

02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:45.200
I think it would be interesting to go into, you know,

02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:50.200
where this absolutely destroys Einstein

02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:53.200
and very concretely and very easily.

02:11:53.200 --> 02:12:02.200
And why relativity in its current interpreted form,

02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:04.200
interpreted interpretational form,

02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:07.200
that is where the twin paradox is held to be true,

02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:09.200
it's got to be ditched.

02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:11.200
And so, but that's another.

02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:12.200
Okay, yeah.

02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:13.200
That's another topic.

02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:15.200
Already a lot we've covered so far.

02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:18.200
Can you, this is, this one's your last one, right?

02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:22.200
I hope so.

02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:24.200
I have a number of questions.

02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:27.200
I'd love if, if you still have time,

02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:30.200
I'd love to just cover up on a couple of things.

02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:32.200
I guess the first thing,

02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:36.200
I'm going to tackle this from different perspectives,

02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:41.200
but taking a step back and thinking about Berkson a little bit.

02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:47.200
One of the things I think is interesting is,

02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:53.200
and I'm trying to make a comparison here with,

02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:57.200
I think a lot about ancient symbols and semiotics generally,

02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:02.200
but are you familiar with the Yin Yang symbol, the Tai Chi two?

02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:04.200
Are you familiar with that symbol?

02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:08.200
It's like two, a white half and a black half.

02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:09.200
Oh yeah.

02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:11.200
And the pace, the pace is in between.

02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:14.200
Well, one thing I think is very interesting about Berkson is,

02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:21.200
he's spoken about as like a poetic philosopher oftentimes.

02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:25.200
And of course the debate we just talked at the beginning about

02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:30.200
between him and Einstein seems to be if there are two halves

02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:32.200
of the same coin, let's say,

02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:38.200
Berkson would be the intuitive Einstein representing rationality.

02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:41.200
Would you say that's a fair kind of,

02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:45.200
that's a very broad kind of statement, but that is where they kind of...

02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:51.200
Well, the other way, equivalently the classic metaphysics,

02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:55.200
classic spatial metaphysical space and time versus the temporal metaphysics.

02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:58.200
Sure, yeah, you can split it both ways.

02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:02.200
Which incorporates the latter incorporating intuition,

02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:04.200
which is another whole topic.

02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:06.200
Yeah, intuition was a big,

02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:10.200
intuition was a huge part of Berkson's framework

02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:11.200
and ideology.

02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:15.200
But so I bring up the Yang-Yang symbol because the way I perceive it's quite interesting

02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:18.200
because Berkson's usually portrayed as this poet.

02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:21.200
And that's part of the reason why he spoke, you know,

02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:26.200
he spoke and wrote in sort of beautiful language, flowery language.

02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:34.200
It was kind of tough sometimes, I think, to sort of provide boundaries

02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:39.200
or like specify exactly where he stood on certain issues perhaps.

02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:42.200
For other people, for other people that read Berkson.

02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:45.200
I bring up the Yang-Yang symbol because it's funny,

02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:49.200
because like within Berkson, that intuitive sense,

02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:53.200
what you've brought here is a very technical framework.

02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:59.200
And it's almost like you're bringing in the rationality within Berkson's poetry.

02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:01.200
Does that make any sense?

02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:07.200
Does that congeal it all to your, the way you see it?

02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:18.200
I could see it in a certain way, but I tend to look at it as,

02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:22.200
I'm just getting even more visual and more concrete than Berkson did.

02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:24.200
No, I mean, I agree.

02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:30.200
I think you are getting more concrete because Berkson was, you know, it's funny.

02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:32.200
He didn't have the language.

02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:34.200
He didn't have any particular stuff earlier.

02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:38.200
I'm doing this in a PowerPoint medium with all kinds of stuff.

02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:43.200
I mean, he, I mean, one of the, one of the reasons it kind of,

02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:48.200
I ended up doing this, whatever number I'm at, 75 or whatever of these things is,

02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:51.200
I mean, I published a lot in academic world,

02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:55.200
but you can't express all the stuff there is,

02:15:55.200 --> 02:16:01.200
and as dynamically and as neatly in articles as you can in this medium.

02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:10.200
It's, I mean, I think this was incredibly freeing up powerful medium.

02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:14.200
I mean, obviously, I'm, you know, I'm sure people look at me and think I'm,

02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:17.200
I'm in a stone age on it, but because, you know, even,

02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:23.200
I know even compared to you, I'm in a stone age, but, but, but it's,

02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:27.200
so some of that, some of it is this medium.

02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:32.200
When, when you, I guess if you looked at my academic articles,

02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:37.200
I would appear a little, I probably wouldn't be quite as,

02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:45.200
obviously you're going only put so many pictures in an academic article,

02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:50.200
and you have to, well, and I tend to get a little more concrete than Brugton

02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:54.200
and those things, but there sure seems to be a whole lot of people

02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:55.200
that you don't understand me.

02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:59.200
So I don't, I don't, like I said, it's very, it's very Zen.

02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:08.200
It's very, you have to have a certain intuition of soul in my mind to resonate to this stuff.

02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:10.200
Yeah.

02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:12.200
And I agree.

02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:19.200
I mean, the, and it actually speaks to perhaps a sub point of what Berkson was getting at

02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:23.200
in terms of duration with, and this is something I do.

02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:28.200
If you're, if we're going to talk about both creators of content on, on YouTube

02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:32.200
and another, you're another place, of course, you're, you're written work.

02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:40.200
I've always found showing things in motion to be, to have things,

02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:43.200
to explain things better than static imagery.

02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:48.200
So it's funny when you're showing your off your GIFs or GIFs on these slides

02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:50.200
and you show the stirring coffee cup.

02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:56.200
And you can kind of, I think, understand where Berkson was coming from,

02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:04.200
because would it be fair to say he'd argue most of science, the cutting edge physics,

02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:12.200
let's say, focuses a lot on the spatial component and doesn't give the temporal dimension,

02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:14.200
it's fair to do or it's fair emphasis.

02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:19.200
And actually, as far as the limited physics, I know it's funny.

02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:28.200
Many, most, not probably not all equations can be are agnostic to the direction of time

02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:31.200
can be done backwards and forwards.

02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:34.200
That's the bare minimum.

02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:35.200
I know.

02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:36.200
I think, I think that's the case.

02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:46.200
But of course, the temporal component is probably underappreciated or not.

02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:50.200
Oh, it's just absolutely, yeah.

02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:57.200
There's so many, like, there's so many subject matters where the temporal,

02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:02.200
the problem of time is just simply just not grass.

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:07.200
I mean, like I said, when you look at the whole literature on the hard problem,

02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:14.200
you just don't see any understanding of the problem of time, period.

02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:21.200
You know, like just as I noted, all the examples of qualia are probably like the redness of the sunset,

02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:23.200
the taste of the qualifier.

02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:27.200
So it's all fairly stacked, you know, qualities of motion,

02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:33.200
like the gently waving curtains of ballet hardcasts or the patients shifting slowly.

02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:38.200
And there seems to look, okay, that's just not even grasped or understood.

02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:39.200
And notice that it's all,

02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:43.200
if I made the field make this point,

02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:52.200
there's all dynamically changing qualities of form that say, hey, the whole image is form.

02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:58.200
And so your problem is how do you see the external image,

02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:01.200
the world, the image of the world out there externally,

02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:07.200
the coffee cup and changing with this in front of this gently waving curtains.

02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:09.200
That's the problem.

02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:17.200
See, it's because of that failure of the grasp of the time and all of all these dynamic forms and change

02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:23.200
that when you say, oh, I've got a, I've got a model of how you see the image of the world out there.

02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:26.200
They don't even know that that's a solution to the hard problem.

02:20:26.200 --> 02:20:30.200
They don't even, it doesn't even dawn on them that that's a solution.

02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:34.200
But physics, same problem.

02:20:38.200 --> 02:20:42.200
The fact that they think that they can get away with

02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:50.200
a completely discreet state model of time and capture what's actually going on

02:20:50.200 --> 02:20:55.200
in this, in the dynamically transforming matter of field is endemic to them.

02:20:55.200 --> 02:21:00.200
And on nice examples of it aren't coming to mind at this point.

02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:01.200
That's fine.

02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:02.200
Yeah.

02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:04.200
But they're, how do you think this model?

02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:05.200
Sure.

02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:07.200
How do you think, how do you think this model?

02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:08.200
Oh, sorry.

02:21:08.200 --> 02:21:09.200
Yeah.

02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:16.200
The, and also just to be clear for the audience, I don't believe Berkson, he didn't, he didn't

02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:19.200
create the term holographic theory of mind, right?

02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:20.200
You are.

02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:21.200
No.

02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:22.200
Yeah.

02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:24.200
Like I said, he was interpreting Berkson.

02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:26.200
It wasn't until 1947.

02:21:26.200 --> 02:21:28.200
So yeah, I guess it was after his death.

02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:29.200
I represent this.

02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:34.200
Let's take Berkson and, and upgrade him into the, how, how he probably would have talked

02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:36.200
that he knew about photography.

02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:37.200
Yeah.

02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:45.200
Can you intuit how, how does this model help explain qualia?

02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:57.200
Well, as I said, the transformation of the field is indivisible.

02:21:57.200 --> 02:21:59.200
Each instant permeates the next.

02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:02.200
It's already a qualitative transformation.

02:22:02.200 --> 02:22:10.200
So when you're specifying the brain is specifying the gently waving curtains, it's specifying

02:22:10.200 --> 02:22:17.200
the qualitative transformation of that field at a certain scale of time.

02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:23.200
Color itself is, is, is a time phenomenon.

02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:29.200
It's a, it's a, it's a certain vibration, vibration of a magnet electromagnetic field

02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:30.200
over time.

02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:36.200
That again, you're putting this, like Berkson noted, you know, if you take one second of

02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:44.200
red light and spread it out wave by wave by wave, such just that you could count in the

02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:48.200
normal amount of time people can distinguish events, you know, you've got 25,000 years

02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:54.200
that would require to count each wave of one second of red light for 400 billions of vibrations.

02:22:54.200 --> 02:23:01.200
But in essence, we're compressing the, you know, now notice when you spread it all out,

02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:07.200
it's almost, almost back to my, my cubes of space.

02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:14.200
It's almost one giant big pile of cubes homogeneous, you know, no quality.

02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:21.200
But now when you're specifying that color, it's compressed into a, you know, one second

02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:23.200
of red light is now, you know, that's what we see.

02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:25.200
We don't see 25,000 waves.

02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:30.200
You see this, you know, glob of color of pulsating red.

02:23:30.200 --> 02:23:31.200
Okay.

02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:37.200
It's, it's, it's this, it's this huge amount of time being compressed by our perception

02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:39.200
and by the brain processes.

02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:47.200
So it's not, now it's becoming more, it's, it's now obviously more qualitative, you know,

02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:52.200
perceptually than that huge spread out field as it would look at virtually what I call

02:23:52.200 --> 02:23:55.200
the null scale of time.

02:23:55.200 --> 02:24:01.200
But it's, but that, but again, the null scale of time is, it's an abstract limit.

02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:08.200
It never becomes the homogeneous space instant after instant of the classic metaphysics.

02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:16.200
So all quality, all qualia is a function of time and motion.

02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:23.200
And at a scale where there's buzzing flies, Aaron flies, brown flies versus red flies

02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:29.200
versus white flies versus gently waving curtains versus violently waving curtains.

02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:30.200
Sure.

02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:38.200
And I'm going to jump around a lot here, but if we're thinking about the, say the double

02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:45.200
slit experiment, does this, well, I mean, this is a theory of every sort of a theory

02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:51.200
of everything or theory, at least our state, our perception of things.

02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:54.200
Does this relate to the double slit experiment in some way?

02:24:54.200 --> 02:25:01.200
And if so, how?

02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:09.200
I'm sure it does, but I, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't even know how to answer

02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:10.200
that question.

02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:14.200
I know it's a very broad question, but I make, I make connections here between,

02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:20.200
obviously the double slit is, you know, particles.

02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:22.200
Oh, sorry.

02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:28.200
There seems to be a connection between at least the wave particle duality, the observation

02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:29.200
of that.

02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:32.200
So our measurement of that.

02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:38.200
And then it's, it's a resultant effect on, you know, the pattern that's found on the

02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:39.200
screen, right?

02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:47.200
So this seemingly, you know, so this theory would have to at least incorporate that, or

02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:52.200
at least I don't have to explain it per se, but it has to be at least perhaps consistent

02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:57.200
with that observation.

02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:02.200
Yeah, I'm drawing.

02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:07.200
It's like, it's a giant disc loaded to my head that I can't do it right now.

02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:11.200
Yeah, we just, this is a long conversation.

02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:18.200
But I think that there is probably a connection here if you were trying to make the case.

02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:19.200
Yeah.

02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:20.200
Yeah.

02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:26.200
I, you know, and I don't think, I mean, I've looked a lot at the quantum theory of them.

02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:33.200
I've done stuff at it, you know, videos on it, like I noted, you know, about, but I,

02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:40.200
you know, I would say that making that final link that you're asked actually asking for

02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:48.200
that resolution, that's kind of a physics problem, more so than my problem.

02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:51.200
I can't, I can't, I can't do it.

02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:53.200
But yeah, sure.

02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:57.200
It's a good question, but yeah, don't don't get the answer for me.

02:26:57.200 --> 02:26:58.200
No, absolutely.

02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:00.200
I understand that's something to consider for the future.

02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:07.200
The other thing I'd say or question I have is it's sort of coming back full circle to

02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:11.200
well, sort of the top of our conversation.

02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:17.200
And some of my favorite videos of yours on your channel actually were the Zen related

02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:20.200
Zen Buddhism and how it relates to this theory.

02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:25.200
I think you have two, maybe more related.

02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:33.200
I did one on Zen number 24 and I did one on Zen and the art of mule cycle maintenance.

02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:37.200
Yes, I think those are, those are my, those are some of my favorite videos of yours.

02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:46.200
So I wonder if, and this is, you know, speculative or let's say thinking out loud kind of territory.

02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:57.200
Do you think there's any relationship between the mind and meditation and perhaps the process

02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:05.200
of quieting those potential say waves or that modulated reconstructive wave as you put it.

02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:14.200
Is there some perhaps relationship between that and the, the sense of say oneness, say

02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:19.200
with the world or the outside, what's outside the brain?

02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:26.200
Yeah, when you go, I think, I think I kind of get the Zen Satori experience.

02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:33.200
When you go to the, in the context of Berkson framework, but when you go to meditation.

02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:42.200
Yeah, that's just another whole subject matter what's actually going on there.

02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:52.200
Obviously the, the Berkson framework, which that says we're a four dimensional being to be were embedded in this

02:28:52.200 --> 02:29:02.200
holographic field in which we have no actual difference distinction from lays a framework for lots of things that can happen in meditation.

02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:15.200
You know, but I just haven't really gone into that whole subject of how meditation or the brain waves and how it's operating.

02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:18.200
And I don't, I just haven't gotten into it.

02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:23.200
Actually, I don't think there's all that much understood really to go into it.

02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:36.200
I mean, I know you have people like, you know, the biology of beef and these kinds of books that are written, but no, I'm, I'm just not.

02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:43.200
I'm just not, it's just, it's just a bridge too far for me to walk over.

02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:44.200
Yep.

02:29:45.200 --> 02:30:02.200
I'll say also, I'm jumping around a lot here, but one of the, one of the interesting videos on your channel as well deals with the holographic theory of mind and how it relates to a holographic principle more broadly.

02:30:02.200 --> 02:30:10.200
And what I was surprised by was how those two things are actually, in your opinion, not compatible.

02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:11.200
Right.

02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:16.200
Yeah. Can you, can you talk about that a little bit?

02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:17.200
Hmm.

02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:20.200
I can.

02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:22.200
Probably wouldn't, wouldn't.

02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:24.200
Pictures would have been good, but.

02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:25.200
What's up?

02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:39.200
See, Susskin, I mean, I looked at Susskin's stuff on it and, you know, they're, they're trying to

02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:52.200
describe the hologram as being on a two-dimensional surface, some, somewhere, basically digital, like bits.

02:30:52.200 --> 02:30:53.200
Okay.

02:30:53.200 --> 02:31:05.200
So volume, you know, and they're expressing, we can express all the information of the, in the universe, volume wise, in terms of bits on a two-dimensional surface.

02:31:05.200 --> 02:31:06.200
Right.

02:31:06.200 --> 02:31:24.200
First of all, I have major problem with their bits because, as I noted to you before, bits are a massive abstraction that don't exist except over some sort of concrete embodiment.

02:31:24.200 --> 02:31:31.200
It's like, you know, to represent a bit, it takes tons of transistors on a breadboard.

02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:35.200
It takes magnetic cores and more stone age philosophy.

02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:44.200
Something is very concretely, you know, doing voltage changes or whatever to represent those.

02:31:44.200 --> 02:31:47.200
And we're looking at it and say, ah, that's a bit.

02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:53.200
Well, what is that on a surface of a black hole for God's sakes?

02:31:53.200 --> 02:32:02.200
What is, what is, what is your bit other than highly imaginary piece of information stuck mentally on your black hole?

02:32:02.200 --> 02:32:06.200
I mean, you know, it's, it's not a breadboard.

02:32:06.200 --> 02:32:13.200
It's not a, it's, it's not a, oh, we can see even worse if you look at Cubis.

02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:15.200
It's even worse.

02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:25.200
You know, now you have LC circuits that are, you know, with resistors and capacitors that are representing the qubit.

02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:30.200
I mean, like with Joseph, Joseph, Josephus and junctions.

02:32:30.200 --> 02:32:33.200
I mean, come on, you know, that's your bit.

02:32:33.200 --> 02:32:34.200
That's your qubit.

02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:35.200
It's on a black hole.

02:32:35.200 --> 02:32:39.200
What, you know, not that there's all kinds of instantiations of Cubis, but they're all worse.

02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:41.200
But that's number one.

02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:46.200
Number two, what, what the heck is the reconstructive wave?

02:32:46.200 --> 02:32:55.200
What is the source of the reconstructive wave that's beaming through your two-dimensional surface to project the three-dimensional world?

02:32:55.200 --> 02:32:56.200
Okay.

02:32:56.200 --> 02:33:07.200
Four, and then problem C, where, how do you introduce time into this thing when you have a whole series of flashes of your reconstructive wave?

02:33:07.200 --> 02:33:12.200
Do you have projection after projection after projection to create the coffee stirring?

02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:19.200
Oh, how is these bits, how are they suddenly becoming concrete coffee cups with liquid in them?

02:33:19.200 --> 02:33:21.200
Stirring, rotating.

02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:22.200
Come on.

02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:27.200
I mean, you know, when you, when you look at the conception, it's ludicrous.

02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:34.200
So it does, it is not Bergson's conception of a holographic field.

02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:39.200
Suskins 2D hologram.

02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:41.200
Sorry, but not the same thing.

02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:46.200
Not even, and not even worth looking at.

02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:48.200
See, you got me in my head.

02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:50.200
No, that's okay.

02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:51.200
I mean, you're passionate about it.

02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:52.200
I get it.

02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:59.200
It's something that I have to do a lot more research on and try to understand better myself.

02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:10.200
So the idea that they're going to use the holographic principle is somehow, somehow it's got something to do with mind and consciousness and holographic theory is just, just insane.

02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:12.200
Gotcha.

02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:14.200
I just lost my, my light.

02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:16.200
So we're coming up on time.

02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:27.200
The question, like what question I would say, one of the last questions I want to ask you is, how is this, this theory Bergson in general?

02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:32.200
I mean, you've been a fan of Bergson's for decades now.

02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:35.200
How is this conception?

02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:44.200
How does this influence your day to day life or your moment to moment existence, if it does at all?

02:34:44.200 --> 02:35:13.200
Well, if I were to say spiritually, it would, it would, it would say, hey, I for one think that science, physics, psychology, cognitive science, given Bergson's framework absolutely backs the spiritual vision of man.

02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:24.200
The Zen vision, if nothing more, but probably also the Hindu vision of what our actual capabilities are.

02:35:24.200 --> 02:35:42.200
I mean, when I say Hindu vision, I'm thinking of people like saints like Ananda Maima, you know, or Yogananda that could read anyone's thoughts or, or could.

02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:51.200
You know, Ananda Maima supposedly stopped the train engine with a wheel spinning on a train platform.

02:35:51.200 --> 02:36:11.200
But that's another, in other words, I think that there's no conflict between science and this whole notion that's permeating people's minds right now that neuroscience says we're just human robot forms with no spiritual component whatsoever.

02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:26.200
It is utterly destroyed by Bergson and gives us a very solid grounding in science and our own mystical experience that supports it.

02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:33.200
So I guess bottom line from, from that perspective, Bergson is a great comfort.

02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:49.200
And if people want to shed the transhumanist vision of where they were, where they were, the idea where we're all getting nice bunch of chips, because it's just all we really are anyhow, and just become enhanced robots.

02:36:49.200 --> 02:37:07.200
And also there is no, there's no God, there's no karmic laws and etc. etc. that they'll get into Bergson and you can, and you'll see quickly how just shallow and superficial and ununderstanding they, you know, they actually are.

02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:24.200
They don't include people like Sam Harris or Daniel Dennett, etc. These are, these people are in my mind are extremely badly misled because they extremely do not understand the problem of consciousness and time.

02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:42.200
That's one thing. After that, it's been a giant pain because, because I never thought that after 50, what are we 50 years that this particular conception would be so buried yet.

02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:54.200
It's, it's buried in cognitive science that no one wants to look at. It's, it's buried in memory theories, buried in perception theory. It's buried by the Gessonians for Christ's sakes. They won't even look at it.

02:37:54.200 --> 02:38:09.200
It's buried by the Bergsonians for that matter. Even, even Bergsonian philosophers, who can't deal with it. I guess, feel it. They don't want to deal with it. Oh, it's too, too much. Can't deal with that.

02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:21.200
Well, it's become, it's become a frustrating pain. And I feel like my life's mission has been a bust. So I feel right now, I'm just telling you that's true. It's been a good, it was a good try.

02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:30.200
Maybe someone later will come along and take it. Because right now, to me, it's, it's, it's completely being ignored.

02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:47.200
Yeah. Well, I'm glad I, you know, it's your life's passion or part of your life's passion. And you've, you've picked up the torch. It sounds, it seems like from Bergson on this, and try to keep his ideas alive. So

02:38:48.200 --> 02:39:00.200
Yeah, well, you know, I'm a little different from Bergson in that respect. I mean, he, he watched himself be buried, you know. Along came Skinner and his, and his rats.

02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:01.200
Sure.

02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:22.200
And after that, the computer model of mine, I mean, the complete antithesis, the absolute computer being the absolute embodiment of the classic metaphysics, the realization almost the wet dream realization of how we can instantiate the classic metaphysics as quote mind.

02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:36.200
I mean, he, he, he watched that. He didn't see the computer thing coming, I'm sure, but I got to live through that one. Yeah, it's still there.

02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:48.200
All right, Steve, is there anything else? Anything you want to leave us on? Tie this thing up in a bow? Where can our viewers, how can people learn more about you and your work in Bergson?

02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:49.200
Well, yeah.

02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:56.200
My I have a little website. It's Steven E Robbins.com STPHN.

02:39:56.200 --> 02:39:58.200
I'll put it below. Yeah.

02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:25.200
That's all it's got all my articles on it. It's got a link to the, the videos, the videos I think is the same channel, I think, Steven, Steven, Steven, Steven E Robbins, I'd have to flip out and look at it, but

02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:33.200
Yeah, so yeah, I'm, I have stuff there that people can look at.

02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:34.200
Yes, you do. You have your website.

02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:40.200
It's probably like 20, it's probably like 20 academic articles, you know, yeah, academic journals.

02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:54.200
They're all it's all linkable. I'll link in the description below your website, your YouTube channel. And I, I think I might parse out a couple of my favorite of your favorite videos of yours to share with with my audience.

02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:57.200
So Steve, I want to say thank you so much for your time.

02:40:57.200 --> 02:41:11.200
It's been great energy. This has been fun is so much to think about and kind of let's steal in my brain to try to make this all congeal. But thanks again, and this has been a wonderful time, wonderful conversation.

02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:16.200
Oh, it was great fun, Carl, isn't it? I do hope people get something out of it. Enjoy it.

02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:18.200
I'm sure they will.

02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:19.200
All right.

02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:20.200
Thanks, Steve. See you.

02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:21.200
See you later.
