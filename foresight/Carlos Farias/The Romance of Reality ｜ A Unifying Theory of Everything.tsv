0	3080	You're intuition, let's say, you know, deep inside yourself.
3280	8960	Something maybe some of you can't prove, but why why do you think this is all how
9160	11760	it's laid out? Why do you think we're here?
11960	14200	Basically, the universe is moving towards this.
14400	16440	It's the system moving towards an attractor.
16640	19400	The wave function collapse isn't random.
19600	22200	If you have an isolated quantum system, it's going to look random.
22400	27680	But when everything is interacting, everything, all those wave functions must be collapsed.
27720	31000	If the universe is becoming more complex, that puts constraints on how the wave
31200	35560	function collapses, such that the collapse is much in totality add up towards going
35560	36560	towards this omega point.
36560	39720	There is a multiverse, but it's not like every possibility exists.
39920	44080	There was this evolutionary process where in Lee Smollin's model of cosmological
44280	48200	natural selection, when you have a universe form and then a black hole forms in that
48400	52760	universe, since a big bang is like a singularity event that creates a universe.
52760	56880	The idea is that when a black hole forms in the universe, that's a big bang event
57080	58640	that creates a new universe.
58840	62920	That's how you have this evolutionary process that's creating more and more
62920	66600	universes and the universes that are good at creating black holes and black holes
66800	70800	come from stars, and stars create the chemistry that's needed for life.
71000	73640	Then you'll get more and more universes that create more and more black holes.
73760	75800	So more and more universes that have more and more stars.
76000	78360	And so then this process will lead to more and more universes that are
78360	81600	firmly for life, because stars create the higher elements that are needed for life.
81800	86320	And then so if this evolutionary process is true, you'll have the selection pressure
86320	89440	towards getting more life-friendly universes.
89440	92280	My ultimate understanding was that nature
92280	94800	has this life-generating principle.
94800	96400	It's really hard to determine, you know,
96400	99960	we still have that why something from nothing problem,
99960	102040	but we are making progress.
102040	104400	It's not introducing unnecessary stuff
104400	105840	by going outside this universe
105840	107560	because we have the fine-tuning mystery
107560	110280	that is begging for a solution that we don't have
110280	111960	unless we think about these other things.
111960	115400	Creator, cosmological selection, the multiverse theory,
115400	117000	which I don't think is a good explanation
117000	119000	because it introduces everything
119000	120920	just to explain away a creator.
120920	122720	When we shouldn't necessarily need to explain a creator
122720	125000	with every possible universe exists.
125000	127200	It's just, I don't think it's the right,
127200	129360	I don't think it's superior epistemologically,
129360	131320	Occam's Rage, all the things we mentioned.
131320	136320	So ultimately I'm left with the process itself being God
136720	138600	and that we could be created by an agent,
138600	140360	but it wouldn't be this all-powerful,
140360	143560	fundamental thing that was there forever.
143560	145560	It would be a product of this process,
145560	147320	but that process seems to be eternal.
147320	150000	So even if we have a God, a creator,
150000	151520	I don't think if I learned about him,
151520	152880	I don't think I'd pray to him.
152880	155000	I think if we have a creator,
155000	156440	it might be like us creating things
156440	158880	and then we wouldn't ask our AI, like, is there a God?
158880	161080	Like maybe if we do have a creator,
161080	162640	they're looking for us to answer us.
162640	164960	Maybe we're the AI that's gonna inform them.
164960	166920	But so even if we had a creator,
166920	168200	I'm not necessarily sure
168200	170340	that I don't think that would be the end of all answers.
170340	173200	I think it's more spiritually satisfying
174120	178000	to just recognize there is a process that leads to life,
178000	181120	leads to consciousness and unending consciousness,
181120	183760	reaching higher and higher levels of experience.
183760	187240	So it's a journey for me, but what I am convinced by
187240	189480	is that you do have this trajectory
189480	193160	and once you start asking why it's this way,
193160	195840	you get into all the explanations that I've just said
195840	198800	and I think they're better than the nihilistic multiverse
198800	201200	where just weak anthropic principle version.
201200	203360	Bobby Azarian is a cognitive neuroscientist,
203360	206840	journalist and author of The Romance of Reality,
206840	208480	how the universe organizes itself
208480	211880	to create life, consciousness and cosmic complexity.

214320	216560	I hope you enjoy our conversation.
216560	218520	Bobby, thank you for coming up.
218520	220360	Hey, Carlos, thanks for having me.
220360	221600	Yeah, it's such a pleasure.
221600	223800	So excited to speak with you.
223800	226920	We're gonna talk about your book, The Romance of Reality
226920	230920	and for this kicked off before I outline
230920	234680	the three parts that we're gonna cover in today's discussion.
234680	237400	I wanna start off with something that I usually start,
237400	240920	how this is the last question for guests on the podcast
242520	244040	and I'm not gonna ask you this question directly.
244040	246000	It's more of something I was just thinking about.
246000	248320	I usually ask people, if you could go back
248320	251360	and give your 18 year old self one piece of advice,
251360	252920	what would it be?
252920	255760	And I'm thinking about it in terms of this book
255760	260760	because if I could go back and give myself one book
260960	264600	say like the summer before college, it would be this book.
264600	266160	Oh, wow, that's awesome.
266160	268560	Honestly, I mean that wholeheartedly
268560	273560	because it's fantastic, I had no knowledge
274440	277560	of complexity science up until a few years ago
277560	280480	and this book is just an excellent synthesis
280480	284120	of so many big ideas and I give it my highest recommendation.
284120	286520	People watching this right now,
286520	288280	I hope you listen to the whole conversation
288280	290200	but there'll be a link below in the description
290200	293880	if you'd go out and buy this book because it's incredible.
293880	294720	Thank you so much.
294720	296840	I put a lot of time and thought into it
296840	300320	and it's so nice to hear things like that
300320	304040	because yeah, the intention was to kind of give
304040	307320	a big picture view of complexity science
307320	309000	which includes all these other sciences
309000	313800	but like what those sciences are showing us
313800	315560	as far as like the big picture questions
315560	317560	which a lot of the complexity books don't really get into.
317560	319320	They kind of hint at things
319320	322520	but this was just kind of putting all the existential things
322520	324680	out there but to hear that, yeah,
324680	328280	that really makes me feel like the work is worth it
328280	332840	and motivates me for the follow-up book that I'm starting
332840	334440	and so thank you for that.
334440	335280	That's awesome.
335280	338280	I really appreciate that and that's great to know.
338280	339920	Yeah, absolutely and I mean it.
339920	342080	I mean, even a few months ago a commenter
342080	345120	on one of my videos asked me for my top 10 list
345120	346520	and so I have to revise that
346520	348280	because I have to knock somebody off
348280	350240	and put this book in.
350240	352880	Sorry to the person to get snagged off.
352880	354920	No, see Nicholas Taleb, I'm sorry.
354920	356120	He didn't pick that off.
356120	357720	Knock that guy off, yeah, yeah.
358920	359760	Yeah, well let's book it.
359760	361040	I really like his book at Ty for Agile.
361040	362120	I thought it was fantastic.
362120	362960	I haven't read it.
362960	365280	He's a brilliant guy but I've seen some of his tweets
365280	367800	where I was like, huh, I don't know.
367800	368640	He's a troll.
368640	369480	He's a professional troll.
369480	371000	Yeah, he's kind of but maybe that's cool.
371000	373240	Maybe, you know, he mixes it up.
373240	374880	Yeah, I know, yeah, I don't know personally
375440	378200	so I just wanna let the audience know that.
379120	381360	Also as we, for the audience to know,
381360	385120	I'll have links in the description for all of your stuff,
385120	388240	for your blog, Road to Omega,
388240	389680	your Psychology Today articles
390920	392840	and of course the link to buy the book as well.
392840	394680	So I want folks to know,
394680	396480	sort of this is gonna be in three parts.
396480	399440	I hope we have time to allocate across all three
399440	401160	but the first one we're gonna,
401160	405200	I think about in terms of crawl, walk, teleport.
405200	408600	So we're gonna crawl,
408600	411720	we're gonna start ground ourselves in the science,
411720	413120	the major ideas behind the book.
413120	415560	We don't have time to dive into every last detail
415560	416400	because there's so much in here.
416400	417840	It's very densely packed.
417840	420080	We're gonna start there, part two
420080	422320	where I wanna spend a lot of time on.
422320	423160	I know this is something
423160	425360	that you're focusing a lot of time on right now.
425360	427760	Your current projects is how people can use this
427760	430200	in their daily lives, how they can integrate it,
431160	432640	into their habits, their routines.
432640	435080	So I wanna spend a lot of time there.
435080	436600	And then at the end, if we have time,
436600	438520	we'll push the boundaries a little bit,
438520	440280	talk about the more speculative stuff,
440280	443800	allow ourselves to talk about things like,
445080	448000	universal Darwinism, baby universe is spawned
448000	449720	from black holes, things that are a little bit more
449720	451840	out there, time permitting.
451840	456400	So let's get into, let's crawl before we walk.
456400	457240	And if you wouldn't mind,
457240	458960	can you lay the groundwork for the audience?
458960	459920	Can you set the table
459960	462320	and provide us with really high-level description
462320	465800	of the book and some of the core ideas?
465800	468760	Yeah, I realized I didn't answer your question
468760	471400	about if I could go back in time to being 18.
471400	473840	So I don't know if I should address that later
473840	475280	or we should go into it.
475280	476120	Was it if I-
476120	477600	If it's on your mind, yeah.
477600	479320	Yeah, and the structure is great
479320	483200	because Walk, Crawl, Teleport matches the structure
483200	485360	of the book, which is organized into three parts.
485360	487560	Origins, about the origin of life,
487600	490720	evolution, and transcendence.
490720	492000	So yeah, there'll be a logical flow
492000	494960	and I will not go into much detail
494960	497120	about the evolutionary mechanisms in part one.
497120	498960	That's mostly what the book is about.
500320	503280	But I've talked about that in a lot of detail
503280	506560	and other interviews and wanna just give a good,
506560	508160	big picture overview of all the stuff
508160	509600	that you just mentioned.
509600	511560	So if anyone's interested in more details,
511560	513360	you can go to my sub-sacro to Omega.
514720	517280	My book is available on Amazon and other retailers
518200	520440	and yeah, those and other talks online.
520440	525440	But this will be less detailed and more philosophical,
526560	529600	I guess, you know, bigger picture focused on that.
530480	534600	If I was 18, so was it, what book would I read at 18
534600	537280	or what would I tell myself at 18?
537280	539520	So that's funny, I answered what book
539520	541640	because I was thinking so much about your book.
541640	543560	But yeah, you could either one.
543560	546840	Yeah, but the first, the original question was
546920	548240	if I could go back in time
548240	549800	and kind of give myself advice.
549800	551560	Yeah, yeah, that's the original question.
551560	552560	That's what you ask everybody?
552560	554360	Yeah, yeah, I gotta watch all those.
554360	556400	I love the Donald Hoffman interview.
556400	558000	I haven't got to watch the other ones,
558000	560600	but I know you're reading Graham Dempsey and Greg
560600	562640	who are friends and I saw Michael Levin
562640	563480	and some really cool people.
563480	565040	So I gotta go see their answers to that
565040	566960	because that's a good question.
566960	571360	So I don't know if this is how I would normally answer,
571360	572960	but this has been on my mind.
572960	576200	So it's like when you understand the paradigm
576200	577040	presented in the book,
577040	580560	which is not necessarily, not really my paradigm,
580560	582400	I've approached this like a scientist
582400	585640	who definitely, I guess had a hypothesis,
585640	587040	but also as a journalist.
588280	589880	So as a person who's a scientist
589880	594240	and who believes in the importance of evidence
594240	596340	for your beliefs and your arguments,
598040	602360	you know, I couldn't see myself just having some hypothesis
602360	604520	that was never out there and like really like putting it
604520	607880	for like the reason that I feel confident
607880	611080	about the argument in the book is because
611080	614800	it's based on so many people
614800	618880	who have seen the same cosmic narrative,
618880	622440	you could call it this new story of nature.
622440	625800	And it's really interesting because,
627520	629880	you know, you could bring up some of these ideas
629880	632600	to some people and especially like 15 or 20 years ago
632600	634360	and some people like, no, that sounds like new age stuff.
634360	635200	No, they can't be right.
635200	638080	The universe is waking up or becoming conscious
638080	639000	or something like that.
639000	641640	Or it's growing more and more complex always
641640	642480	without limit.
642480	643960	And they're like, no, that's not scientific.
643960	646480	That violates this law and this or this idea
646480	648720	or that was shown to be like,
648720	652200	it's amazing that that was the stance toward this narrative
652200	653640	which we'll get into.
653640	658640	And it was just totally ideological.
658680	659760	And there have been other people
659760	660840	that have been saying this other thing
660840	662960	and somehow for cultural reasons,
663680	668240	most people got convinced that certain things
668240	669720	that people could say about the universe
669720	671720	were just completely wrong and pseudo-scientific.
671720	673840	And we're seeing that's completely not true.
673840	678200	And it's been exciting because I've written certain articles
678200	680080	like challenging the heat death hypothesis
680080	682120	and that life has to come to an end in the universe.
682120	684600	For example, I just wrote one for Noema.
684600	686640	The physicist David Deutch shared it.
686640	688480	Sabina Hossenfelder and Richard Hansen,
688480	690080	big names were like commenting.
690080	692560	She had written something similar in a chapter in her book.
692560	693400	I haven't read it yet.
693400	695960	And Robert Hansen was like, yeah, maybe life can go.
695960	698560	It depends on if entropy has an upper bound.
698560	702800	But my point is with all of the articles that I've published,
702800	705320	I thought we're saying something super radical.
705320	707440	The one that kind of planted the seed for the book
707440	710400	was called Is the Universe Pro-Life for Courts?
710400	712320	And Sean Carroll gave me a quote for that
712320	714560	and retweeted that and said,
714560	716720	controversial topic, opinions may differ,
716720	721200	but he thought that was a good potential argument
721200	726200	that life was inevitable based on thermodynamic arguments.
728440	732640	And I think he'd probably even say that was the case now.
732640	734680	So there were things where I thought
734680	739680	that it was gonna be a real challenge to say this stuff
743040	745520	because of just consensus
745520	746920	and all of that's changing.
746920	748480	It's the most exciting time ever.
748480	750800	So one thing I would tell myself
750800	752840	if I went back is like,
753960	756800	but I kind of followed this advice anyway.
756800	758400	It's not what I was gonna say originally.
758400	763400	I was gonna say, again, it wasn't based off anything.
765160	767600	Looking around me, reading tons of stuff
771520	772920	gave me a strong feeling
772920	775480	that the universe is becoming more complex.
775480	777680	It's not becoming increasingly disordered.
777680	778800	And I need to look into this.
778800	782440	So as long as you feel like you're basing your something,
782440	784600	basing your belief on like evidence
784600	786440	and you have a strong argument,
786440	789360	do not pay attention to like current consensus.
789360	791040	Don't be afraid if like someone's like,
791040	792880	oh, you're a crackpot because of this.
792880	797720	Just put the time into articulating your idea
798800	800480	because if you articulate it well,
800480	801640	it's really interesting.
801640	805280	Like there's things in the book where if I were to,
805280	807600	if the chapters were only a paragraph long
807600	809280	people were reading little summaries,
809280	810520	they might not be convinced all of them.
810520	812880	They're like, this goes against everything we know.
812880	815800	But then you read the book and you see the arguments
815800	818600	and it's specifically the technical arguments
818600	822240	that just went through that skepticism.
822240	823360	For example, Michael Schermer,
823360	825480	I didn't know what he was gonna think of the book.
825480	827600	And he ended up giving a blurb to actually
827600	830640	on the cover talking about like people having a purpose
830640	833440	to your purposes, discover your own purpose.
834440	839440	But so that was thrilling and it's still happening
842160	846160	to see these kind of ideological ideas
848400	853440	that were kind of cemented as like, this is the truth
853440	855040	are starting to be dismantled
855040	857480	because they were never on a firm basis.
857480	862480	And yeah, so basically stick with it.
863440	866000	And stick to your beliefs like, I mean,
866000	868880	yeah, don't get deterred from something
868880	872000	if you feel that is right.
872000	874480	Quickly, because we need to get into all the other stuff.
874480	876840	But this is kind of already getting into those topics.
876840	880400	But I will say that the ideas in the book
880400	881880	made me look at life in a different way
881880	886720	as far as like life does have this intrinsic goal
886720	888720	which is to stay in existence.
888720	892160	And that gives us an intrinsic purpose.
892160	894440	And once you see things in that way
894440	896920	you can kind of start to interpret life as being a game
896920	899160	where there's challenges and goals.
899160	901320	And then you start to think of your moment,
901320	903120	your life on a moment to moment basis
903120	904280	as sort of being this thing
904280	906360	where you're like accumulating points.
906360	908080	I mean, you don't wanna get carried away with this
908080	910960	but overall I think it's a good way to optimize life
910960	912800	where you're just really thinking like,
912800	914680	okay, I'm not wasting time today
914680	919320	because I've had this game kind of framework
919320	920840	where I have these goals
920840	923880	and I'm not doing things right now to get to my goals.
923880	925040	That doesn't mean you don't relax,
925040	925880	you don't have fun
925880	927880	because that's part of getting to your goals.
927880	929840	But if I could go back to when I was 18
929840	933200	or even before high school, like starting high school
933200	936840	I would have imagined my life as being a type of game.
936840	939280	So I wouldn't miss opportunities
939280	942840	and I would take advantage of things
942840	946240	where I just miss certain opportunities of life
946240	950680	because I didn't have this mindset that I have now.
952840	957840	Yeah, so I do think this game lens that we'll get into
958080	962000	is really helpful for sort of like optimizing your life.
962000	964240	And once you realize it, then you're like,
964240	969240	oh man, I kind of wasted time being suboptimal.
970920	972160	Interesting, yeah.
972160	973240	In life, yeah.
973240	975520	Cool, yeah, we'll spend a lot of time
975520	977880	and I'll make sure that our fattest section
977880	982880	is the game of life throw to Omega that we're on
984040	985400	before we get into that a little bit,
985400	987560	just to help an audience.
987560	990280	And I think, well, you just alluded to it a little bit.
990280	993600	This, I think that your book is a response
993600	997080	to the failure of reductionism in science.
998040	999880	So could you tell us a little bit about,
999880	1001680	I guess, that changing paradigm
1001680	1005400	and then also sprinkle in your unified theory of reality
1005760	1008320	which you have a great flow chart from infinity maps
1008320	1011840	that I'm sure I'll overlay at some point in this discussion.
1011840	1013480	But I know there's a lot there
1013480	1016040	because there's a few different frameworks
1016040	1018320	that you bring in, but I love to just get,
1018320	1020600	if you could provide us with a little bit of an overview,
1020600	1022120	that'd be super helpful.
1022120	1024640	Yeah, let me, there's so many things
1024640	1025920	I've been talking about writing about,
1025920	1028080	like there could be a conversation,
1028080	1030120	full podcast on each of these topics.
1030120	1032960	So I'm just trying to be mindful to like say,
1032960	1036200	be brief and say the most important things
1036200	1038480	because there's so many cultural factors.
1038480	1041680	So you can trace this back to like this question
1041680	1045000	to like understanding the different eras,
1046160	1050800	basically like pre-modernism, modernism, post-modernism
1050800	1052600	and whatever we're getting into now.
1052600	1055800	But like pre-modernism was kind of the time before science
1055800	1057600	where like religion ruled
1057600	1059240	and people believed supernatural beliefs.
1059320	1061400	And there was this strict hierarchy
1061400	1065480	and modernism was basically a response to that.
1065480	1068480	And it happened, it's kind of started
1068480	1071640	with the Enlightenment period in like the 17th century,
1071640	1075280	18th century and the scientific,
1075280	1078160	kind of the birth of the scientific method.
1078160	1080840	And when I started writing the book,
1080840	1083720	I thought that's kind of when there was like
1083720	1086240	the onset of reductionism and atheism
1086240	1087840	and kind of this idea that the universe
1087840	1090000	was meaningless and purposeless.
1090000	1092200	But I found out that that's not true at all.
1093760	1098760	And basically there was this modern movement
1098760	1102160	that was like very pro-science and pro-reason and logic.
1103200	1105280	But it wasn't what we have now
1105280	1108800	or wasn't what the kind of scientific ideology
1108800	1112240	of the 20th century, which was more nihilistic,
1112240	1115200	you know, nothing has any meaning, there's no purpose,
1115200	1120200	there's no design and basically,
1124000	1126720	oh, and there's no such thing as like continued
1126720	1129800	complexification because that kind of implies progress.
1131240	1136240	And so basically modernism started off
1136480	1139000	like it was still pretty religious
1139000	1142680	and I'm not advocating for organized religion
1142680	1143960	by any means.
1143960	1146880	But what I'm saying is there's a different mindset.
1146880	1148920	Newton was extremely religious.
1148920	1153000	A lot of the greatest physicists of our time,
1153000	1154720	a lot of the founders of thermodynamics,
1154720	1157800	James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin,
1157800	1159760	they were all very religious.
1159760	1164760	And we're driven by this idea that reality is mysterious
1164800	1168320	and they're basically trying to understand
1168320	1170120	what they described as the mind of God.
1170120	1171920	And you see that language retained
1171920	1173600	in like Stephen Hawking and stuff.
1173600	1175960	And you'll find videos of like Richard Dawkins saying,
1175960	1177840	you know, you can make a good argument for a God
1177840	1179800	if you basically are a creator,
1179800	1183600	if you put them behind, you know, at the very, you know,
1183600	1185760	that they designed the system and then let it evolve
1185760	1187400	to its own dynamics.
1187400	1188920	And he says, the God of Paul Davies,
1188920	1190840	the God of the physicist.
1190840	1192480	And I was like, the God of the physicist.
1192480	1194000	And it was again, I was like looking more
1194000	1195600	into the different physicists.
1195600	1197520	And you know, a lot of people know Newton as Christian.
1197520	1199440	Some people know like Goldil,
1199440	1202320	who's a mathematician, was very Christian.
1202320	1204920	But like, I didn't know like the founders,
1204920	1206200	a lot of, you know, the founders
1206200	1208120	of the second law of thermodynamics
1208120	1208960	were Christian as well.
1208960	1211360	And actually the heat death theory,
1211360	1213480	I believe had Christian motivations
1213480	1216560	because basically Lord, yeah, it's super fascinating,
1216560	1220160	but Lord Kelvin, who kind of popularized
1220160	1221400	the second law of thermodynamics,
1221400	1222760	which, you know, he and Colossia
1222760	1225520	has kind of independently put forth.
1225520	1226640	And just for anyone who doesn't know,
1226640	1229280	second law of thermodynamics is the law that entropy
1229280	1232120	always must increase in the universe.
1232120	1234000	Well, in system, see, that's the thing.
1234000	1237000	It was supposed to be applied just to like close systems.
1237000	1239600	And then people immediately started to try
1239600	1241400	to apply it to the whole universe.
1241400	1245320	But a lot of the impetus for doing that
1245320	1248720	was like Lord Kelvin knew that if the universe had an end,
1248720	1251520	it kind of had to imply there was a beginning.
1251520	1252680	And at the end of the universe,
1252680	1254720	the heat death kind of paralleled
1254720	1258120	sort of judgment, you know, day of judgment type stuff.
1258120	1260080	So interesting dissertation online,
1260080	1262920	which talks about the religious motivations
1262920	1264800	underlying the second law of thermodynamics.
1264800	1266520	Sir Arthur Eddington, who made the quote,
1266520	1268840	the second law of thermodynamics is, you know,
1268840	1271280	if you have a theory that goes up against that,
1271280	1273000	I can only, you know, whatever, you know,
1273000	1274880	but it was like, yeah.
1274880	1277720	And he was very Christian as well
1277720	1281200	and referred to himself as a rational mystic,
1281200	1282600	which I thought was a nice, you know,
1282600	1284880	kind of paradoxical term that kind of,
1284880	1286600	I felt like a relation to,
1286600	1290360	because reality is very mysterious.
1290360	1292720	And I'm not saying we can't understand,
1292720	1295320	I'm actually saying we can, but we haven't yet.
1295320	1297440	There's lots of secrets to uncover.
1297440	1299760	We'll never understand it completely,
1299760	1302720	but that's what this complexification process,
1302720	1304320	the world's getting more complex,
1304320	1307480	that happens when organisms start modeling the world
1307480	1310040	and when they start modeling the world to survive in it,
1310040	1313320	they start getting a larger and more detailed map
1313320	1315360	of the world and that allows them to manipulate
1315360	1318640	the world around them, which allows life to spread.
1318640	1323640	So you have this story that is basically, yeah,
1327480	1330600	it's really different than what we've been taught in science.
1330600	1333600	So yeah, my point was in modernism,
1334880	1337560	scientists still were, you know,
1337560	1342480	driven by this kind of mystical, you know,
1342480	1347320	desire to understand nature, the mystery of nature.
1347320	1351600	And really the whole idea was that, you know,
1351600	1356360	we could use science to achieve unlimited progress,
1357440	1360200	but this became associated with like capitalism
1360200	1361880	and colonialism and stuff like that.
1361880	1365440	So then postmodernism was just kind of this school of thought
1365440	1368360	that emerged that was a critique of modernism.
1368360	1370360	So it was a critique of like science thinking
1370360	1371800	you could find objective truth
1371800	1374000	that like there's really subjectivity.
1374000	1374840	That's really important.
1374840	1376520	There's maybe no objective truth
1376520	1379880	and that whatever cultural culture believes is relative
1379880	1381040	in a social construct.
1381040	1382360	So there's cultural relativism,
1382360	1385120	which has like no culture is really objectively better
1385120	1389680	than others, which suggests that science is really not any,
1390440	1394560	not in any way more fundamentally more solid
1394560	1398240	than any religions or, you know, kind of folk mythologies.
1398240	1402600	And so it was idea, postmodernism was good
1402600	1406320	because there were a lot of things to critique about modernism,
1406320	1410920	but it should have been a critique that improved, you know,
1410920	1414200	how we think about these things and, you know,
1414200	1416680	the limits of science or, you know,
1416680	1418480	how certain we should be about things.
1418480	1421440	But like I think it was really bad
1421440	1424920	that it basically tried to eliminate this idea
1424960	1428800	that there is this, you know, progress towards, you know,
1428800	1430320	higher intelligence in the biosphere
1430320	1432280	because I think it's a law that you can't,
1432280	1434640	it's something that you see a principle of nature
1434640	1435480	that is real.
1435480	1438280	And if we don't understand that we have no idea
1438280	1441320	how our civilization is evolving and where we're going,
1441320	1443440	because it's not driven by some mystical force.
1443440	1445160	It's not something where progress is like,
1445160	1447240	just keeps happening like perfectly.
1447240	1450240	It's this air correction process that's similar to AI.
1450240	1452240	Life is facing challenges.
1452240	1455600	It's like life is similar to an AI being trained on data
1455600	1459120	and the data is the chaotic world around us.
1459120	1461600	And so we keep being faced with problems
1461600	1463640	and we keep having to overcome those problems
1463640	1466440	and a lot of organisms die out during that,
1466440	1468720	but the ones that can solve those problems
1468720	1471520	get to make copies of themselves.
1471520	1475760	And so we get all these designs of organisms and AIs
1475760	1479720	and everything basically, there's a natural selection,
1479720	1481800	applies not just to living organisms,
1481800	1485400	but all designs in life and basically the dysfunctional
1485400	1488120	and inefficient designs get filtered out.
1488120	1492000	So we have these designs that get more and more robust
1492000	1495000	and that leads to this process of basically
1495000	1497600	life-spreading inevitably, but it's not the straight line.
1497600	1501000	It's always, there's always like two steps back
1501000	1503680	for one step forward, but you can see the trend clearly
1503680	1506640	and people like Ray Kurzweil have mapped out these trends
1506640	1510240	of technological increase, but showing the technological
1510240	1515120	increase as continuous with the complexity increase of life
1515120	1518640	because life is really information processing.
1518640	1523640	And so life is fundamentally different than inanimate matter,
1524000	1526720	but AI, I wouldn't say is that fundamentally different
1526720	1527640	from life.
1527640	1529840	I mean, it's not, AI is not alive,
1529840	1531280	but it's an extension of life.
1531280	1534960	It's got designs that would never appear in nature
1534960	1537240	unless life first emerged.
1538120	1541800	So you had pre-modernism, which was supernatural.
1541800	1546240	Then you had the modern movement, which was like science,
1546240	1548120	but that science could solve everything.
1548120	1551360	And then maybe some people took that idea too far
1551360	1553080	and thought, you know, let's do eugenics.
1553080	1557400	And the Nazis exploited that theory of increasing
1557400	1560520	complexification and opening the evolution to justify
1560520	1562760	like superior and inferior races.
1562760	1565800	So there were all these cultural issues that led people
1565800	1569080	to not like certain ideas,
1569080	1571280	whether it was the Nazis using this idea
1571280	1572960	of like evolutionary progress,
1572960	1577960	or Tihar Deshardin was a priest, a Catholic priest
1579080	1582080	that wrote this book that the church actually hated
1582080	1585160	because they thought it was like against
1585160	1588080	in Christian teaching, but it was that evolution,
1588080	1589920	you know, everything's becoming more complex
1589920	1592120	and that maybe God is in the future.
1592120	1594680	Maybe there seems to be some sort of design,
1594720	1596880	but that everything, for example,
1596880	1600840	the network of humans is approaching
1600840	1602800	some sort of global mind that will emerge
1602800	1604560	and this process will continue.
1604560	1607680	So Tihar Deshardin wrote this book called
1607680	1610080	The Phenomenon of Man that put out this omega point theory
1610080	1612600	that my book is largely based on
1612600	1614080	and all the scientists who have been writing
1614080	1615840	about this stuff, complexity scientists,
1615840	1617800	people at the San Jose Institute,
1617800	1621440	they all know that Tihar kind of put that idea out there
1621440	1622880	and made it like really salient
1622880	1624380	that the world's getting more complex.
1624380	1628620	But people didn't like the religious associations
1628620	1631780	that he made, but so then people were against it
1631780	1633900	because they felt like if they acknowledged
1633900	1635980	that the world was getting more complex
1635980	1639300	and that it might be going towards some final goal state
1639300	1642860	that that would just be like saying that God is right
1642860	1645860	and God is real and there's a design,
1645860	1648540	there's some sort of trajectory
1648540	1650820	that's been planned from the beginning
1650820	1652860	and people thought that was dangerous.
1652860	1655780	So then there was a backlash against anybody saying
1655780	1657500	anything that life had a purpose.
1657500	1659940	They wanted to erase that language from biology.
1659940	1662780	If you said life does this in any language
1662780	1664420	that had a purpose, they wanted you to reward it
1664420	1668180	to be like in this sort of neo-Darwinian language
1668180	1671300	where you get rid of purpose and you say, oh no,
1671300	1674180	like people were mad that people were asking little kids
1674180	1678060	like why does the plant grow towards the sun
1678060	1680100	and the kids would say because it wants the light
1680100	1683220	and like there's evolutionary theorists who are,
1683220	1686300	you know, kind of motivated by atheism.
1686300	1687980	No, it doesn't want to grow towards the light.
1687980	1689300	That's teleological language.
1689300	1690260	That's purposeful language.
1690260	1691860	You have to get that out of science.
1691860	1693020	It grows towards the light
1693020	1694340	because the ones that were worse
1694340	1696260	that growing towards the light died off
1696260	1698220	and that one just happened to be better
1698220	1700420	and it just got out of control.
1700420	1702700	But now because of AI and emergence
1702700	1705460	and just engineering, when you talk like an engineer,
1705460	1709340	you kind of talk about agents, even if they're not living,
1709380	1711140	you kind of use this purposeful language
1711140	1713780	so you can't really get rid of this language
1713780	1715220	when you're talking about the universe
1715220	1718700	because we do see these things and it's just natural
1718700	1722100	but also it seems to be the way reality is
1722100	1723780	at least this emergent phenomenon
1723780	1726260	does have goals and purposes purposes.
1727700	1732700	But yeah, so that backlash created this kind of
1733660	1736700	whole worldview of meaninglessness
1736700	1739020	and it was perfect for science.
1739020	1741100	Science was already going in that kind of direction
1741100	1743980	because it was at this war with religion a lot of times
1743980	1746340	and so reductionism is just the idea that
1748540	1750460	there's just a bunch of particles in the universe.
1750460	1752900	It's a system of particles that are bouncing off each other
1752900	1754620	and then you can use laws of motion
1754620	1756660	to understand those interactions
1756660	1758660	and then if you have those laws of motion,
1758660	1760260	there's no room for human agency
1760260	1761660	because everything would be determined
1761660	1763980	by these fundamental equations
1763980	1766500	that are specifying these trajectories in advance.
1766500	1768980	But what my book argues is that that's not right.
1768980	1772340	It's a simplified version of causality
1772340	1774540	and dynamics in nature.
1774540	1776980	And basically when agents emerge,
1776980	1780180	they're these information processing systems
1780180	1783620	that exists in a universe that's not completely deterministic.
1783620	1785420	There's a lot of deterministic processes
1785420	1790220	but at the very bottom level, there's random,
1790220	1793060	there's an element of probability and randomness
1793060	1798060	or stochasticity and so there is room for freedom
1798260	1799780	and when agents emerge,
1799780	1804780	they basically, when you're making a conscious decision,
1807220	1809380	the results of your decision weren't determined
1809380	1812900	by particle physics at that lower level.
1812900	1816620	You can basically, you as a physical system,
1818220	1819700	when you initiate a movement,
1819700	1821980	it's not something that's violating the laws of physics.
1821980	1824180	You're metabolizing energy that you ate before
1824180	1826740	but you're not in an animate system that can't move.
1826780	1828300	You can make these decisions
1828300	1831180	and you're truly making these decisions in real time.
1831180	1835900	So determinism in the classical sense,
1835900	1840900	that kind of Laplace kind of made applied Newton's paradigm
1841220	1844020	to the whole world and you have this strict determinism
1844020	1846180	that's really determinism at the level of particles
1846180	1848900	as opposed to other people talk about determinism
1848900	1852660	saying that your actions are a result of your life preferences.
1852660	1856140	I mean, your experiences and your beliefs and your genetics
1856180	1857380	and that's a different discussion
1857380	1860500	and people conflate those two types of determinism,
1860500	1862420	biological versus physical determinism
1862420	1865020	and physical determinism is a much stricter thing.
1865020	1867500	That's saying there's no room for biological anything,
1867500	1869780	even genes in that view aren't doing anything.
1869780	1871940	You could reduce genes to particles.
1871940	1873260	So it got really weird
1873260	1874820	because you would see evolutionary theorists
1874820	1876340	being reductionists and I would be like,
1876340	1877820	if you wanna be a real reductionist,
1877820	1881500	then like Jerry Coyne, genes don't even matter.
1881500	1883900	Your whole field would be completely irrelevant.
1883900	1885500	If you really knew what you were talking about,
1885500	1890180	like the ideology that you're advocating for,
1890180	1892700	we could just say genes are epiphenomenal too
1892700	1896020	and just talk about particles.
1896020	1897060	Sure.
1897060	1901620	The book is a pushback on postmodernism and reductionism
1901620	1905140	and kind of wanting to return to this narrative of science
1906340	1910220	and not just science, but logic and I mean, arts,
1910220	1912380	in this view, we see science as something,
1913060	1917260	we see science as part of the evolutionary process
1917260	1919860	because testing theories is just like how nature
1919860	1921380	has been testing organisms.
1921380	1925940	And in this book, organisms are basically embodied models
1925940	1928900	or embodied theories about how to survive in the world.
1928900	1933500	Your genome and your brain has encoded information
1933500	1935940	that makes predictions about how to survive in the world.
1935940	1939300	So basically scientific theories are just kind of
1939300	1944300	extensions of organisms and they're kind of,
1945100	1949900	it's kind of just an elaboration of this process of life,
1949900	1953140	creating models that will allow it to survive
1954460	1958300	in a world that has this tendency to break down.
1958300	1960100	Otherwise, aside from life,
1960100	1962100	because that's not the full story when people say,
1962100	1964060	the world's going towards more disorder.
1964060	1965740	What I discovered in the book
1965740	1968780	is that there's this dialectical dynamic
1968780	1971300	where you have order and disorder
1971300	1974380	and kind of this tension
1974380	1979380	and it's because life has to always evade this tendency
1982140	1985620	towards disorder that life spreads through the universe
1985620	1987140	and the universe becomes more complex
1987140	1988740	because you have life spreading.
1989900	1993260	So if you didn't have that tendency towards disorder,
1993260	1995980	there would be no evolutionary pressure
1995980	1998660	towards designs that are more functional
1998660	2000340	that can survive better in the world.
2000340	2002260	So you need the tendency towards disorder
2002260	2004100	described by the second law of thermodynamics
2004100	2007500	to have this whole complexification process work.
2007500	2009060	But that's one big insight of the book
2009060	2011300	that almost no people talk about.
2011300	2013140	I mean, this dialectical dynamics.
2013140	2015900	You need the constraint on the system.
2015900	2016820	Problems create progress.
2016820	2017780	That's Popper's principle.
2017780	2019260	It's a big, yeah.
2019260	2021060	Yeah, so, yep.
2021060	2023780	And so this whole idea,
2023780	2026100	everybody was against this idea of teleology,
2026100	2029700	which was just a word for continual inevitable progress
2029700	2031980	and complexification towards some higher people.
2031980	2033140	And I understand why it's
2033140	2034660	because they thought it was a supernatural idea,
2034660	2037060	but now I'm saying it's not supernatural.
2038140	2040220	And people are saying like evolution is blind.
2040220	2041140	That was wrong too.
2041140	2042820	So it's just more complicated.
2042820	2045700	There is this tendency towards progress
2045700	2049340	and the whole system isn't conscious at this point.
2049340	2050180	I don't believe it is,
2050180	2052340	but there is an intelligence distributed
2052340	2054900	throughout this network that we call the biosphere.
2054900	2057220	And so you do see this tendency towards that,
2057220	2059780	but it happens through mistakes
2059780	2062300	that basically get corrected
2062300	2064780	if you look at the whole biosphere as a system
2064780	2067620	and you look at organisms dying
2067620	2068980	and some living and reproducing.
2068980	2070100	If you look at natural selection
2070100	2074220	as basically the biosphere doing its own scientific testing,
2074220	2076140	you have this new story of life.
2076140	2080500	And you see that evolution actually does have this tendency
2080500	2081860	towards more complexity.
2081860	2086860	Why? Because as that natural selection process proceeds,
2087860	2090420	knowledge from the successful,
2090420	2091340	when I say knowledge,
2091340	2093020	I'm not just talking about human knowledge,
2093020	2094620	although that's part of it.
2094620	2099420	But when animals that are less adapted,
2099420	2101660	more dysfunctional designs die out
2101660	2103940	and the better designs stay,
2103940	2107300	the genome, the genomes in the biosphere
2107300	2109940	are also accumulating knowledge about how to survive.
2109980	2113300	So when I say the evolutionary process creates knowledge,
2113300	2116500	I'm talking about the evolutionary process creates knowledge
2116500	2120300	in genes, in brains, in cultural memory,
2120300	2125420	and then now digital memory, like the internet.
2125420	2127460	In cultural memory, I mean like books and stuff.
2127460	2129220	So when you look at the trajectory of evolution,
2129220	2131140	it's really this emergence of these
2131140	2133660	information processing systems and memory systems.
2133660	2135100	So you have the emergence of life,
2135100	2137460	you have genes, then you have the emergence of brains,
2137460	2138580	you have neural memory,
2138580	2140180	then you have the emergence of societies,
2140180	2141380	you have cultural memory.
2141380	2143300	So you get like language
2143300	2145540	and you get these ideas spreading from brain to brain
2145540	2146980	through memes basically.
2146980	2149140	We start telling stories
2149140	2150980	and then you get the invention of books
2150980	2152940	and written language and art.
2152940	2154860	And it's all part of the same process
2154860	2157940	of basically life exploring the design space
2157940	2161180	because it's looking for solutions
2161180	2162620	to this problem of survival.
2162620	2165100	And at first it's doing it unconscious.
2165100	2166460	And then when brains emerge,
2166460	2167900	you have the emergence of consciousness
2167900	2169820	and then we start to become aware
2169820	2171420	of our need to survive.
2171420	2176420	And we start, it's just another layer of our motivation
2177580	2180020	to do what nature has already programmed us to do.
2180020	2181780	And what the book argues is,
2181780	2183260	because I always talk about these details,
2183260	2185100	but I don't always give the bigger picture.
2185100	2188060	A lot of it is because when you say this,
2188060	2189500	the bigger things behind it,
2189500	2190780	sometimes it turns people off.
2190780	2192580	So I would save that stuff to the end
2192580	2193940	or maybe not even talk about it all
2193940	2195860	if it's a technical talk.
2195860	2198420	But the main point of the book is that this process
2198420	2202660	implies that there's some sort of design or logic.
2202660	2203900	There's some sort of,
2203900	2206820	the universe isn't an arbitrary system.
2206820	2210020	You can imagine the universe being full of marbles
2210020	2211180	like that, the particle story.
2211180	2213180	If the particle story was true
2213180	2218180	and they were just little spherical objects bouncing around
2218980	2220300	because when Boltzmann,
2220300	2223140	when the second law of thermodynamics was,
2223140	2227420	and this idea that Laplace had of everything is just particles
2227420	2228620	at the lowest level.
2228620	2229740	If you could zoom in on this,
2229740	2232020	you would see these particles bouncing around.
2232020	2235940	The periodic table wasn't even invented until like 1920.
2235940	2239260	So people were, the model of particles were that,
2239260	2241220	they were these perfect spherical balls
2241220	2243380	that bounce off each other elastically,
2243380	2246700	just like real pool balls or marbles would.
2246700	2247740	And if we had that,
2247740	2251620	you can have a bag of marbles bouncing around for eternity
2251620	2254300	and it's not going to form the complexity of life.
2254300	2258180	You need specific elements with specific properties,
2258180	2260580	bonding properties like carbon and specific forces.
2260580	2265380	You need all of these things to be very specific
2266380	2267740	for all of this to work.
2267740	2269940	And that's known as the fine tuning problem.
2269940	2272380	And the fine tuning problem basically says that
2272380	2274020	if you change any of these parameters,
2274020	2275060	like the force of gravity,
2275060	2278100	the force of the stronger weak nuclear force,
2278100	2280660	even by hair, you wouldn't have life,
2280660	2282700	but you probably wouldn't have any structure in the universe.
2282700	2284700	You just would have just like my universe
2284700	2288380	that expanded forever or contracted into, you know,
2288380	2290220	singularity again, you wouldn't even have,
2290220	2291220	it's not that you wouldn't have life,
2291220	2292460	you wouldn't have structure.
2293820	2296380	So then the, so, so the book makes the argument though,
2296380	2299460	first it makes the argument that there is this new cosmic
2299460	2302340	narrative where the universe is becoming more complex.
2302340	2303700	And that involves, you know,
2303700	2305780	the emergence of planets and stars,
2305780	2308180	because planets, you need planets to have life.
2308180	2310220	You need stars to provide the energy for life.
2310220	2313140	You need stars to fuse the simple elements together
2313140	2317260	to get the elements that are in living organisms and biology.
2317260	2321660	And so, but then you get the emergence of life
2321660	2324500	and then you get information processing systems in the world.
2324500	2328780	And then life begins to slowly spread.
2328780	2330700	And because of this evolutionary process
2330700	2333140	being this knowledge accumulation process,
2333140	2335100	it just keeps learning and modeling the world.
2335100	2336660	And as it's extracting information
2336660	2339460	about the world around it, it just keeps expanding.
2339460	2342100	And that's what we're seeing now with like us
2342100	2343940	leaving the planet to go into space.
2343940	2346140	It's something that was part of the trajectory.
2346140	2350500	It's not the smart idea of a billionaire or something.
2350500	2354660	It's what would happen on any biosphere
2354660	2359660	with intelligent creatures who have discovered science
2360380	2363300	and discovered thermodynamics, for example,
2363300	2368020	because any advanced intelligence will learn
2368020	2372300	that their days are numbered unless they get off the planet.
2372300	2373780	So what I'm saying is that we have to have
2373780	2375140	a new picture of the universe.
2375140	2376700	There is some sort of design.
2376700	2379140	It's almost like life is like AI.
2379140	2382380	It's almost like life is like the system being trained
2382380	2385060	and life shouldn't be seen as separate from the universe.
2385060	2386060	It's part of the universe.
2386060	2387900	It's actually the universe.
2387900	2391220	Universe is simplest components organizing themselves
2391220	2394900	into a functional form that can experience itself.
2394940	2398140	So life is the universe's conduit or vehicle
2398140	2400340	for experiencing itself.
2400340	2403180	And that's a very different story
2403180	2405060	and it raises all kinds of implications.
2405060	2406700	And some people would reject it flat out
2406700	2407820	and be like, yeah, you're talking about God.
2407820	2409020	You're saying that it has a design
2409020	2410260	and that implies a designer.
2410260	2412140	I'm done with your theory.
2412140	2414540	But what I would say to that is when you look
2414540	2416180	at this argument and you look at the trends,
2416180	2418900	it does seem like this story is the true story.
2418900	2421220	Like we have to accept that or we have,
2421220	2424460	it has to at least, I think if you do a Bayesian analysis,
2424500	2427220	which just is analysis of the evidence for each theory
2427220	2430060	that this theory would come out on top.
2430060	2432700	And the funny thing is though,
2432700	2433860	where people were rejecting it,
2433860	2436620	if you say, oh, but we don't necessarily need a designer.
2436620	2439180	There are theories of cosmological natural selection
2439180	2442180	where there is more that you need to explain
2442180	2443380	about the fine-tuning problem,
2443380	2446420	but you don't need to introduce a God,
2446420	2448820	at least not a God from like an organized religion.
2448820	2451020	I mean, and I say that in that way
2451020	2452580	because you have the simulation theory,
2452580	2455820	which argues that we're a creation of an intelligent agent.
2455820	2458420	So what I realized right in the book
2458420	2459860	is that the simulation theory
2459860	2463660	and intelligent creator theory are effectively the same theory.
2463660	2464860	And that now that we understand
2464860	2467180	that we can create simulations with agents,
2467180	2469660	possibly conscious agents we don't know,
2469660	2470940	then scientifically,
2470940	2473060	since we've demonstrated that it has happened,
2473060	2476060	we have to take the possibility,
2476060	2478420	we have to consider a new scientific theory
2478420	2479780	that we're such a creation.
2480260	2483860	And there's epistemological justification for that
2483860	2484740	because we did it.
2484740	2485620	But here's the funny thing.
2485620	2486540	Before we did it,
2486540	2488980	there wasn't as much justification to say
2488980	2491660	that we needed to take the creator theory seriously.
2491660	2494420	But once we have created simulations
2494420	2497060	and we know that that's possible in this physical world,
2497060	2500020	we immediately have to write down a new theory
2500020	2501780	that we are such a thing.
2501780	2506420	And so basically this says the atheists,
2506420	2508780	the theory that there's no designer fine-tuning,
2510780	2513420	there's the appearance of a design.
2513420	2515620	First of all, there's something that needs to be explained.
2515620	2516460	And to do that,
2516460	2518900	we have to understand why these laws and not others.
2518900	2521340	So we have to think bigger than the universe.
2521340	2523620	And then so we have these different options.
2523620	2525060	Is it a creator?
2525060	2528700	Is it a multiverse explanation
2528700	2532340	where maybe there's this large ensemble of universes
2532340	2537340	and we're just in one out of a multiverse
2537740	2538820	that's mostly lifeless,
2538820	2541220	which is in the atheist position,
2541220	2543620	or cosmological natural section,
2543620	2545300	which we'll talk about later,
2545300	2548660	or the simulation theory that we're made by an agent,
2548660	2549740	intelligent agent.
2551220	2553580	And then maybe there's even another theory from that.
2553580	2558020	But my point is you can't say that there's no design
2558020	2561500	and given what we know about the universe,
2561500	2563260	you can't say this is the only universe
2563260	2564420	and there's no design.
2564420	2567340	Because that would be the most improbable thing
2567340	2569460	that there's one universe.
2569460	2570620	It's random.
2570620	2573220	And then it just happens to have the parameters
2573220	2574300	that would allow for life
2574300	2575860	when it could have been everything else.
2575860	2577140	And that's why no one says that.
2577140	2579180	That's why the multiverse theory
2579180	2580980	is the rebuttal against this now,
2580980	2584060	because to destroy the God theory,
2584060	2588060	you need a multiverse with all of these other options.
2588060	2589140	Here's the bad thing about it.
2589140	2590340	Soon as you introduce that,
2590340	2593260	you get wilder ideas than a creator.
2593260	2595780	The ideas of every universe existing,
2595860	2597340	if you're doing every possible thing,
2597340	2600020	here's the tricky, here's the funny thing too.
2600020	2601580	If you believe the multiverse,
2601580	2602820	and we've also demonstrated
2602820	2605380	that we can create new virtual worlds
2605380	2606500	that might have a conscious agent,
2606500	2608700	we can create our own universes.
2608700	2611820	The multiverse theory then starts to include gods too,
2611820	2614220	because it includes people who create universes,
2614220	2616900	just like where we could or we have,
2616900	2618620	but we haven't created conscious agents.
2618620	2620300	Let's say we could,
2620300	2625140	then you, in the infinitude of all possible universes,
2625140	2626660	you have universes with creators
2626660	2630100	creating new universes nested in those universes.
2630100	2631500	If you follow Occam's razor,
2631500	2633540	the multiverse theory gives you God,
2633540	2634740	created the universes,
2634740	2638660	it gives you every universe you could conceive of and more.
2638660	2642340	So it seems to be worse on Occam's razor grounds.
2642340	2644620	It introduces all of these things.
2644620	2645740	It gives us the same thing
2645740	2646900	that the God creator thing was.
2646900	2650140	So what I argue in the book is that
2651060	2652420	we have to explain the design.
2652420	2654380	You can explain it playing with infinities
2654380	2655980	with your multiverse theory,
2655980	2659500	but I don't think that's the best explanation.
2659500	2663100	I think, and we can get into that more later,
2663100	2664660	but I just, so yeah,
2664660	2667220	maybe we should just talk more about the meat,
2667220	2669220	you know, I know, or the practical stuff.
2669220	2672140	I actually talked a lot about the tech.
2672140	2672980	Yeah, you did.
2672980	2674180	I didn't talk about the technical details,
2674180	2675940	but I kind of summed it all up, I guess.
2675940	2678460	Yeah, you like touched and brought in,
2678460	2680740	I mean, I could talk to you for a long time
2680740	2682660	about any one of those things you brought up.
2682700	2683980	Well, before we get into the,
2683980	2686540	because I do want to segue into the practical in a moment,
2686540	2690660	but before we do, just perhaps to put a button on it.
2690660	2694420	And you just mentioned a few minutes ago, Bayesianism.
2694420	2696220	I spoke with Carl Friston last week.
2696220	2697260	I interviewed him.
2697260	2698100	Yeah, that's not out.
2698100	2700860	Yeah, it will be out in the next couple of days.
2700860	2704580	So for viewers watching this, that one will be out already.
2704580	2707620	So if you want to deep dive into,
2707620	2710220	and Friston is one of the most cited people in the book,
2710220	2712460	you know, you bring him in quite often.
2712460	2713780	And actually, I think,
2713780	2717380	because I first read romance or reality around the holidays,
2717380	2718620	and I had heard of Friston before,
2718620	2721820	but how much he's in the book, really.
2721820	2723020	Really put him on your radar.
2723020	2725220	Put him up to the top of the list.
2725220	2726060	Yeah.
2726060	2728780	So you inspired me to speak with Carl Friston,
2728780	2729620	you know, so thank you.
2729620	2730620	That's awesome.
2730620	2733300	And it was a great conversation, very high level.
2733300	2734140	Oh my God.
2734140	2736980	I did not know the term high research load
2736980	2738700	before talking to Friston.
2738700	2743060	That means you need all these different pieces of information
2743060	2745020	from different disciplines coming together
2745020	2746460	in order to understand what he's talking about.
2746460	2748420	Because he's a neuroscientist,
2748420	2749980	he's bringing neuroscience,
2749980	2751140	he's bringing information theory,
2751140	2753820	he's bringing stuff from physics.
2753820	2756660	But one thing that I thought was quite interesting
2756660	2759900	is that, and he wrote a blurb for your book also,
2759900	2762500	he said it was, I think a synthesis of his favorite thing,
2762500	2765140	something that degree, which is amazing.
2765140	2768500	And I think I was also surprised,
2768500	2773020	he said that it doesn't get any more fundamental or simpler
2773020	2775620	than the free energy principle.
2775620	2776980	Which I thought was really interesting,
2776980	2779260	because I asked him, that was sort of in response to
2779260	2784060	when I brought up Jeremy England's dissipative adaptation.
2784060	2784900	Yeah.
2786340	2788460	Which he said, I think to a degree,
2788460	2789580	I hope this is correct,
2790700	2794220	that that's one subset of the free energy principle.
2794220	2797660	That would be like something the free energy principle describes,
2797700	2799620	but that's one of many things
2799620	2804140	that the free energy principle would have a descriptor for.
2804140	2805820	Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up.
2805820	2806940	I'm glad you said that too,
2806940	2809860	because that's what I argued in the book.
2809860	2813180	I don't know how much he thought about that before he read my book.
2813180	2815380	That would be cool if that kind of...
2815380	2817380	Because, you know,
2817380	2820260	I mean, he probably knew of Jeremy England's work.
2821500	2822420	But as far...
2822420	2824340	Yeah, that's one thing I tried to do in chapter six,
2824340	2826980	was to show that this dissipative adaptation process
2826980	2829140	that's been used to explain the origin of life
2829140	2831340	is a process of Bayesian inference.
2831340	2835220	That was like the one big novel thing that I put in the book that...
2837940	2839540	I don't always talk about it.
2839540	2840940	You know, it's pretty technical,
2840940	2844060	so it's not something that has been highlighted.
2844060	2847980	But that it is a process of Bayesian inference,
2847980	2850340	and we can look at all self-organization processes,
2850340	2852660	as processes of inference.
2852660	2853900	Please go on, Zach, if you need me.
2853900	2857540	Yeah, so, well, and that was very useful for him to clear that up for me,
2857540	2861700	because, you know, if you'll forgive my ignorance,
2861700	2866100	I had thought that dissipative adaptation was something that was a sub...
2866100	2867660	Free engineering principle was something that...
2867660	2869100	You can look at it that way too.
2869100	2871420	Yeah, so it's like, which way is this going?
2871420	2872900	Yeah, it's all...
2872900	2875740	And he actually, I think, specifically said
2875740	2880700	that he was a little bit dismissive of the thermodynamic interpretation
2880700	2882460	as that being the underlying idea.
2882460	2883460	Yeah.
2883540	2887500	And that the free engineering principle, I think, has far more applications
2887500	2888860	than just that.
2888860	2891620	So, do you have any thoughts about that?
2891620	2894500	Yeah, yeah, so a colleague also mentioned this about him,
2894500	2900820	which I think I knew, but it was interesting to hear this kind of emphasized,
2900820	2904660	but that Carl likes to put, say, you know,
2904660	2906700	everything in terms of inference,
2906700	2910300	but doesn't like to reduce everything to evolution, for example.
2910300	2912940	But you could say the same thing about thermodynamics.
2913140	2916260	You know, that he doesn't want to reduce everything to thermodynamics.
2916260	2918820	What my book tried to show is that the thermodynamic story
2918820	2922580	and the evolutionary story and the inference story are the same story.
2922580	2925020	And that inference processes are...
2925020	2926860	And we'll talk about in detail what I mean by that,
2926860	2932580	but that they are evolutionary processes and they are self-organization processes.
2932580	2934700	So they're kind of dissipative processes.
2934700	2940260	So it's pointless to be like, this is a subset of that.
2940260	2941260	So...
2941260	2943420	Well, in a way, he's right,
2943420	2953500	because the origin of life mechanism is one instance of the free energy principle.
2953500	2956060	But you could...
2956060	2961980	So if he's talking about dissipative adaptation as an origin of life theory,
2961980	2963700	it's a subset of a larger inference
2963700	2965860	because dissipative adaptation is an inference process
2965860	2967460	and this is one instantiation of that.
2967460	2969460	It's just the origin of life.
2969460	2974300	But you could also look at all inference processes
2974300	2977140	as being dissipative adaptation processes at higher levels.
2977140	2981700	So you could say the whole biosphere is evolving through dissipative adaptation
2981700	2985180	because they're just adapting and as they adapt, they extract more energy.
2985180	2987420	And if they use more energy, they're dissipating more energy.
2987420	2990260	So you could look at the biosphere as a dissipative process.
2990260	2994500	And before dissipative adaptation was a theory put forth by England,
2994500	2995580	tons of people were saying this.
2995620	2999820	Eric Cheyesson, Eric Smith, and here more with Santa Fe Institute,
2999820	3001620	this whole thermodynamic narrative,
3001620	3005420	it had been told much in detail way before Jeremy England.
3005420	3008380	Jeremy England just came up with this specific equation
3008380	3010660	about self-organizing molecules
3010660	3013180	and demonstrated that you could simulate this
3013180	3014860	and show that this is the case,
3014860	3021300	that basically if you have a lump of particles driven by a force of energy
3021300	3026140	and those particles have the right profile such that they interact
3026140	3028900	like with life, you need carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrene.
3028900	3030020	You need those molecules.
3030020	3035460	For example, carbon makes bonds to four other elements or molecules.
3035460	3039020	And if you don't have something that can bond to a lot of things,
3039020	3041420	you can't get complex structures.
3041420	3044220	So if you simulate the properties of those molecules,
3044220	3048540	you can show that just a system being pushed by a flow of energy
3048580	3051500	with the right properties will begin to organize.
3051500	3054820	And as they organize, so that's really what we need to focus on
3054820	3058660	is that that's the mechanism of self-organization.
3058660	3062340	As a result of this process, because it takes physical work,
3062340	3064820	I mean, stuff is happening when it's organizing itself,
3064820	3067340	it has an energetic cost.
3067340	3073300	So for that process to happen, to go against this tendency toward disorder,
3073300	3077460	an organism or the system, maybe it's something that hasn't emerged,
3077460	3080260	life hasn't emerged yet, but it's you're seeing like a proto organism,
3080260	3083460	some sort of chemical, you know, autocatalytic network,
3083460	3086340	some sort of chemical system that is self-sustaining.
3086340	3089220	It has to get energy from the environment.
3089220	3093460	So living systems have to extract energy from the environment to survive.
3093460	3098060	And when they are extracting it to build that order to organize themselves,
3098060	3100620	so that cost energy, that's the thing to understand.
3100620	3104340	And when you're using that energy, it's always getting dissipated.
3104340	3108300	It's always getting used up in the system's releasing heat.
3108300	3110660	And that heat is entropy.
3110660	3114060	So there's, I didn't get into it here, I'm kind of on purpose,
3114060	3115900	but there's multiple definitions of entropy.
3115900	3118060	There's entropy, which is dissipated energy.
3118060	3119460	It's like heat entropy.
3119460	3122100	And then there's entropy with the statistical definition,
3122100	3125500	which just talks about disorder things and their different concepts.
3125500	3128660	They really shouldn't even have the same name.
3128660	3134340	Well, but, but, but the energy concept is kind of a subset of this disorder thing,
3134340	3140580	but it just, it order form and that system release heat.
3140580	3143140	So you can have the whole universe, if life's spreading,
3143140	3147580	becoming more and more organized at the, at the whole global scale.
3147580	3149980	While more heat is being generated.
3149980	3154220	So whether entropy goes up or down, it depends on your definition of entropy.
3154220	3157420	Heat entropy goes up because energy is always being used and spread out
3157420	3159100	and you can't use that energy again.
3159100	3162060	So if entropy is defined as the energy unavailable for work,
3162060	3166700	that entropy is going up, entropy defined as organization, as disorder,
3166700	3167820	that entropy is going down.
3167820	3170940	So you have Boltzmann entropy going down as the world gets more complex
3170940	3173860	and you have energy just being used up.
3173860	3175820	And then that is called entropy.
3175820	3178020	That's, that's a classical version of entropy.
3178020	3183060	So my point is, and Jeremy England makes his point in his book,
3183060	3185980	all of the evolutionary processes that happen in the biosphere
3186020	3189020	are also using up energy from the sun.
3189020	3192980	And as the biosphere becomes more complex, it uses more, it needs more energy.
3192980	3195100	So it uses it.
3195100	3198020	I think when you talk about dissipation too much, it gets the focus off.
3198020	3201500	It makes it sound like life is trying to create entropy when it's not.
3201500	3204500	It's trying to survive and it needs energy to survive.
3204500	3206540	And entropy is the byproduct.
3206540	3208420	So it's just like, art needs gas.
3208420	3209860	It's not the goal to buy product.
3209860	3211100	It's just exhaust.
3211140	3217420	Yeah. So if you want to say the origin of life is an example of inference,
3217420	3220340	that's right, and you have this dissipated adaptation mechanism,
3220540	3223740	but you could also turn it around and be like, well,
3225620	3228300	the inference process that Carl's describing in brains,
3228620	3231420	which we'll quickly sum up in a second,
3232700	3235300	is something that allows brains to better model the world
3235300	3236540	so it can extract more energy.
3236540	3239980	And then it is always extracting that energy and it's using that energy.
3240020	3244460	So really, you have dissipated adaptation,
3244460	3248220	which I believe is just another word for self-organization.
3248220	3250180	It's thermodynamic self-organization.
3250180	3254020	You have that on every level and that inference is also self-organization.
3254020	3259100	So I think that there's things that are equivalent,
3259740	3262060	learning and evolution
3264180	3266940	and self-organization.
3267420	3269620	Yeah. And so I think it's Bayesian inference.
3269620	3271980	Evolution is, you know, variation and selection.
3271980	3277020	And then self-organization is this dissipated adaptation.
3277020	3279740	They're all the same things.
3279740	3282980	So it doesn't really you don't you don't need to like put one
3284700	3285900	having priority over the other.
3285900	3287180	And that was a mistake a lot of people made
3287180	3288940	because when Jeremy England's working that stuff,
3288940	3290580	they're like, oh, it's well, it's all thermodynamics.
3290580	3292180	The world just wants to create instruments.
3292180	3294460	No, the world is organizing itself
3294820	3298820	and it does it through this process and this mechanism.
3299100	3301580	You can look at one aspect where you go to the systems learning.
3301580	3304220	You can look at another aspect or say the system's using energy
3304220	3308100	and creating entry and you can use another aspect and say it's adapting.
3308100	3310740	It's evolving. Yeah. All. Yeah.
3310740	3312580	You have a great time.
3312580	3313540	It's not even an equation.
3313540	3314940	It's just much equivalences in the book.
3314940	3317180	It's adaptation equals statistical correlation,
3317180	3321340	equals mutual information, equals model optimization, equals creation.
3321500	3325180	I mean, that's I mean, but you're that gets to the crux
3325180	3328220	of what we're talking about here is that.
3328220	3330620	And I actually find this
3330620	3333420	not specifically with with the gentleman we're talking about now,
3333420	3336460	but if you may like zoom out a little bit,
3336460	3338740	the word games that get played a lot.
3338740	3341180	And I mean, it's just because that you need different
3341180	3344340	terminal, different terms for different concepts, right?
3344340	3346220	But a lot of times you start
3346220	3348300	when you think about it a little bit more deeply,
3348300	3350500	you realize, oh, that's pretty much the same thing.
3350500	3354100	You know, we're just we're using languages is fungible
3354100	3355260	and we're kind of getting around it.
3355260	3357740	But I do and I mean, we could talk so much more about this stuff.
3357740	3360340	I have a lot of questions in this area that I'm going to have to speak
3360340	3363540	because I do want to focus while we have some remaining time.
3363540	3365340	It looks like part three might not happen today.
3365340	3368140	But what should we do with this information?
3368140	3370820	If we might go from crawling, you know, we have
3371540	3374820	organized some information and people should get the book to get all these details
3374820	3379220	for themselves and also read your read your blog posts on Road to Omega,
3379220	3382100	the Substack and Psychology Today as well.
3383220	3384140	What do we do?
3384140	3386460	Like, how do we make this practical?
3386460	3388980	How do we bring this information into our day to day lives?
3389540	3392700	Yes, so you can talk about that while I explain
3393380	3396380	first sense theory in the context of that, because it's really.
3398940	3402380	Yeah, first sense work and so he has the Bayesian brain
3402380	3405700	hypothesis and the free energy principle, which is just the same
3405980	3408900	Bayesian brain hypothesis, but apply the things without brains.
3409460	3412940	And I realized there's so much here combined with the other work that I was,
3413060	3416260	you know, looking at, you know, self organization and thermodynamics.
3416540	3418940	There's so much here to inform practical living.
3418940	3423180	And it's just crazy that, you know, no one has kind of
3423860	3426940	used that information to not many people.
3426940	3429500	I won't say no one, but not many people have used that information
3429500	3431300	to inform people on how to live life.
3431300	3433060	And the reason is because of the free energy principle.
3433060	3435060	It's funny, Carl says it's simple and I agree with him.
3435060	3436300	It is the simplest thing.
3436300	3439180	But if you read the papers, it's the most complicated.
3439180	3440980	thing in the world. Yeah, I disagree.
3440980	3444540	I mean, it might be the most fundamental, but I explain why.
3444540	3447700	So it's like both things are true at the same time.
3447700	3451420	And it's like it is insanely complicated if you want to make it.
3451420	3454260	But the general principle can is super simple.
3454740	3458820	But I don't think people have applied it because they don't understand it.
3458820	3459860	And I didn't understand it.
3459860	3463540	I wasn't even sure if it was like legitimate science.
3463540	3465580	That when I first looked at it, because it kept using these
3465580	3470620	thermodynamic terms like free energy, which were defined not thermodynamically.
3470620	3473620	It's like information theoretic free energy and comes from machine learning.
3473620	3475860	It's based on thermodynamic free energy.
3475860	3477580	But so I was like, what's this guy talking about?
3477580	3481060	Like minimizing free energy in this way, but that's not free energy.
3481060	3485260	So yeah, you just have to accept that new language will emerge
3485260	3488260	because you need new words to explain new ideas.
3488580	3489980	And it often comes from other fields.
3489980	3492260	So there's going to be that confusion.
3492300	3496260	And you just have to embrace all that and read the read the literature.
3496660	3499060	And once you read it, you start understanding there's a lot of value.
3499060	3500780	But basically, here's the story.
3500780	3502820	You have this tendency towards disorder in the world.
3502820	3505980	And it was great because I was already, you know, finished with part one
3505980	3506780	all the thermodynamics.
3506780	3509900	If I had already said all this stuff and talked about cybernetics
3509900	3511740	and systems have them having to model the world.
3511740	3513180	And then I found the free energy principle.
3513180	3516780	And it was like everything that I was like the path I was down.
3516940	3519060	It was like completed by that.
3519060	3521620	So I'd already saw this picture before that.
3521620	3525180	But basically, but it's cool because that's how Friston frames it.
3525860	3528380	And for people who don't know, he's the most cited neuroscientist in the world.
3528380	3531220	He developed these statistical techniques for analyzing FMI data
3531220	3533500	that all FMI studies use pretty much.
3534100	3538540	And so you have this tendency towards decay.
3538540	3539820	So how do you explain life?
3539820	3541660	He wants to explain the organization in the world.
3541660	3545700	He says, OK, specifically organisms, which are the most interesting to us.
3545980	3549980	They evade this tendency towards decay because they model the world
3550260	3552420	and they because they have to survive.
3552420	3555020	And if they don't have a map of the world, you can't survive in the world.
3555020	3557620	So the the the brain has to create a map.
3558140	3560260	And the free energy principle basically extend that and said,
3560260	3563900	even organisms without brains, how encode some sort of map of the environment
3564300	3569220	in their dynamics, in their genome, maybe in their metabolic processes
3569220	3572260	and general functional dynamics at the system level.
3573340	3576460	But so basically, it's the story of how do we, you know,
3576460	3578780	how does life emerge and survive?
3579180	3580180	It emerges.
3581380	3584540	Well, OK, so yeah, how does life survive?
3584540	3585860	Let's start there.
3585860	3587780	Life survived because that's the model of the world.
3587940	3590900	And if its model isn't accurate, if its map of the world isn't accurate,
3590900	3592300	the thing is probably going to die.
3592300	3594660	If you you have a wrong map of the world and something comes out
3594660	3598180	and kills you because you didn't know about that variable, you're dead.
3598500	3603260	And then that design of you is gone unless you've made copies of yourself.
3603260	3604380	But that's a bit of a different design.
3604380	3608060	And the people who do have good maps are successful.
3608100	3611220	So those good maps keep getting encoded into the biosphere
3611220	3612380	and to the network of organisms.
3612380	3615180	And we keep updating our maps through natural selection.
3615180	3616340	People die out.
3616340	3618180	But when you have brains, you don't.
3618180	3621060	Things don't have to die to get better maps in the biosphere.
3621060	3622660	You can learn during your life.
3622660	3623980	Things without brains, they can't learn.
3623980	3627740	So if they're born in a certain way, they just have those characteristics.
3627740	3629860	But so we can learn.
3629860	3635700	But so what is simple about it is Carl Friston is basically saying this.
3636660	3639620	All organisms minimize what's called free energy.
3639620	3641660	Don't get hung up on you for the audience.
3641660	3644060	Don't get hung up on the word free energy.
3644060	3651300	He's saying in this context, free energy is defined as the model's prediction error.
3651300	3655460	So the amount of mismatch between your model and reality is getting minimized.
3655460	3657700	So forget free energy minimization.
3657700	3663300	Just let's say that Carl Friston, Sirius says your model error needs to be minimized
3663300	3664820	or else you'll die.
3665780	3667620	And that we're always trying to do that.
3667620	3672340	And if we don't pay attention to the evidence, like if we don't.
3673340	3680580	OK, so for example, someone who has a belief that is contradicted by tons of evidence
3680580	3684420	and tons of stuff they're seeing in the real world where it's just completely like,
3684420	3689300	let's say you believe in purple fairy god and that's just your belief.
3689300	3691460	Oh, that's hard one to disprove.
3691460	3694020	Let's say you let's just do something a little more grounded.
3694380	3700020	Let's say you think that gravity doesn't exist in Antarctica or something.
3700460	3705500	You go to Antarctica and you you throw a ball from like a roof and it exists.
3705500	3708420	If you if you don't update your model, if you don't go, oh, yeah,
3708420	3710380	gravities exist because I came here and I did that test.
3710860	3714820	And if you're denying the evidence that reality is giving you,
3714820	3718660	then you're not minimizing your model's prediction error.
3719060	3723420	You're you're you're choosing to stick with a model
3723420	3726340	that has uncertainty or air or ignorance.
3727220	3731300	And if you're living that way, you don't have an optimal map of the world.
3732500	3735180	And if you don't have an optimal map of the world, you're not living optimally.
3735940	3739620	So the book, you know, this is really what the second book's about
3739620	3741460	and what I write about on Substack.
3741460	3744060	But because I didn't have enough time with the deadline
3744060	3746580	to really incorporate all this, you know, practical living stuff.
3746580	3751620	But basically what this whole story tells you is that for or, you know,
3751700	3756460	ordered things for for sentient, any sentient system to exist in the world,
3756460	3762100	to continue existing, it has to be updating its map of the world to be more accurate.
3762100	3764100	And that's just called minimizing free energy.
3764220	3767420	Free energy is an information theoretic term between the difference
3767420	3769580	between your model and reality.
3769580	3774540	So we always want to be being our ignorance and we don't live that way a lot.
3774540	3776780	We're not always updating based on our knowledge.
3776780	3777980	We sometimes ignore it.
3777980	3779340	We have confirmation bias.
3779340	3780580	We want to keep that out.
3780580	3782500	And if we do that, we're living suboptimally.
3782500	3786420	So basically, there's different principles that you can follow.
3786420	3788340	Be curious. That's one thing.
3788340	3790380	There's a great paper by a friend of mine
3792260	3798460	who wrote a paper with Carl Friston on active inferencing curiosity.
3798780	3803660	So you got to be curious because your model is always going to be limited.
3803740	3808060	None of us have infinite computational storage space.
3808060	3809380	So we can't know everything about the world.
3809380	3810500	The world's super complex.
3810500	3811820	There's no way to know everything.
3811820	3813220	So we're all living in ignorance.
3813220	3819020	The best we can do is try to make our model as accurate as possible while living life.
3819020	3821020	You know, you can't spend all of your time learning everything.
3821020	3825700	So you have to decide how much information you want to acquire.
3825700	3828420	But we should always be living in that way.
3828420	3830820	We shouldn't get too stuck to our beliefs.
3830820	3836940	We should always be open to new ideas because our model is limited.
3836940	3838540	It's going to have ignorance.
3838540	3840940	And once you accept that, then, for example,
3842260	3847500	let's say people are asking questions about the origin of the coronavirus.
3848140	3851980	It became un-PC to talk about a lab leak theory.
3852300	3855140	That's very bad, according to this approach,
3855140	3857820	because it could possibly be the theory.
3858820	3861260	And maybe it's not, but you got to look into it.
3861260	3864260	And if you notice, oh, there's no chance that it was a lab leak thing,
3864860	3870540	then you can go, OK, you know, based on this stuff, there's very little reason,
3870860	3872980	almost no reason to think that was the case.
3872980	3875900	But that wasn't true when people analyzed it, what came out.
3875900	3877500	And then seeing in everybody had it.
3877500	3881220	And they didn't even like really say, oh, well, we did a terrible thing
3881220	3884540	by telling everybody, do not think this like it is wrong.
3884540	3886260	Think to think this way.
3886260	3888380	And then everybody started talking about, well, it could be a lab leak.
3890100	3893380	And there are tons of reasons why, you know, there's I'm, you know,
3893380	3897820	I won't get into the political stuff, but the point is.
3900740	3903100	A lot of people like Flat Earthers make this problem
3903100	3905740	where they're not living in reality.
3905740	3907380	They're not updating their model of the world.
3907380	3909620	They're just denying what's out there.
3909620	3914220	But you also have other situations where scientists
3914260	3916180	maybe have this reductionist ideology.
3916180	3919860	They're just over certain about life is transient.
3920060	3921020	It's going to come and go.
3921020	3923700	There's no such thing as free will because it goes against our Newtonian
3923700	3925380	understanding of the world.
3925380	3929900	That's a failure of being a good Bayesian to you because they are too certain.
3929900	3932900	And if you look at history, every paradigm, every model,
3932900	3935460	every theory has proven to have some inaccuracies.
3936740	3939380	Thanks from, you know, Newton's laws, relativity,
3939660	3942300	quantum mechanics hasn't been unified with relativity.
3942540	3943740	So there's all these things.
3943740	3945260	And in the nineties, we didn't even know.
3945260	3946220	We thought we were at there.
3946220	3947580	John Horgan wrote a book.
3947580	3950620	It's the biggest mistake that you could do writing a book called.
3950620	3953900	But, you know, it was worth it to help this, but it was called the end of science.
3953900	3957820	And the idea was that we had we're almost done with understanding everything.
3957820	3959620	And we thought we understood everything about physics
3959620	3961860	is before we knew about dark matter, dark energy,
3961860	3964260	which we only understood dark energy in the late nineties.
3964660	3966260	And people thought we understood everything.
3966260	3968900	And then they just try to explain to a consciousness as being an illusion.
3968900	3971300	So they can back up science understands everything.
3971300	3974740	Nothing, no mystery, definitely no supernatural, definitely no creator.
3975100	3979100	But then she hit the fan and we realized we barely understand anything
3979100	3982100	like most of the universe is stuff that we don't even know what it is.
3982500	3984700	It's incredible. So.
3986300	3990060	Basically, yeah, if you go on the road to omega
3990780	3993700	subsec, I have these posts called the teleological stance.
3993700	3995540	This post called that.
3995540	4000060	I said first, yeah, actually, there are multiple posts on the teleological stance.
4000060	4003500	But basically it's saying all living systems have an intrinsic goal
4003500	4006220	and that's to survive against this tendency towards decay.
4006660	4010940	So life does have a goal and a goal gives us a purpose.
4011380	4014460	And the purpose is to see that life continues to exist
4014940	4018140	because we're part of this larger system that's becoming more complex.
4018580	4021100	And what I didn't mention is that it seems to be going towards
4021100	4024140	a fully integrated self-aware state of the universe.
4024140	4028260	And I'm definitely not arguing for panpsychism that everything's conscious.
4028740	4032100	I'm saying that consciousness emerges because of some plan
4032100	4035820	that we don't fully understand and that.
4038460	4042980	And that consciousness, because it might be a scale invariant
4042980	4046580	or substrate independent thing, that you're conscious
4046580	4050060	because you have this collection of neurons that are exchanging information.
4050060	4052140	And somehow consciousness emerges from that.
4052140	4054340	In the book, I try to explain why that's probably happening.
4055020	4057460	But if consciousness can emerge from a collection of cells,
4057460	4060620	who's to say that consciousness can emerge from an interacting system
4060620	4062300	of humans exchanging information?
4062300	4064580	So that idea has been called the global brain.
4064580	4067140	Maybe you could have some people think there's already a consciousness.
4067140	4068220	This level, I don't think there is.
4068220	4069540	I think there's a collective intelligence
4069540	4071260	because you don't need intelligence to have consciousness.
4071260	4075860	So as fear is intelligent, it's a self-regulating system.
4077620	4078900	But I don't think it's conscious.
4078900	4081500	But I think consciousness can emerge at these higher levels
4081860	4085900	and that if life continues to spread through the universe and to do so,
4085900	4090420	it has to keep extracting energy and it will keep molding the universe.
4090820	4093660	It'll basically keep it will start incorporating the inanimate matter
4093660	4098100	of the world into its computational substrate until the entire universe gets subsumed.
4099780	4103220	And but it's not as if life is just taking over the universe.
4103620	4106140	This was the story of the universe self-organizing
4106140	4112740	into this completely functional, conscious, computational state mind.
4112740	4114900	God, whatever you want to call it, doesn't really matter.
4115100	4118260	It's just this unified state that will be this computational state
4118260	4122060	of unimaginable power that that everything is moving towards.
4123980	4127580	So it was really just a self-organizing system that has this dynamic
4127580	4130020	and like part of it's being trained and accumulating knowledge
4130020	4134940	until the whole system is an integrated system, the way an organism is the integrated system.
4134940	4136340	So I think that's where it's headed.
4136340	4138060	I'm about to come out with an article on Big Think
4138060	4142580	analyzing new papers that have emerged from the small one in Jerellania
4142820	4146100	and Microsoft Physicists saying that the universe is a learning machine.
4146620	4151700	That was kind of influenced by another paper from 2020 by Vitaliy Vanshurne,
4152060	4154860	who says the world's a neural network and these got articles, you know,
4154860	4158140	popular mechanics articles, you can read these a couple of years ago.
4158140	4162060	And what I'm arguing is that life is basically the universe is something
4162060	4165580	like a neural network or an organism or a complex adaptive system.
4165580	4168580	It's all just an information processing network that's emerging.
4168980	4172460	And that life is part of this process and that's where it's headed.
4172460	4176220	You can call it a God, you know, there's lots of crazy answers about like what that is.
4176500	4178540	But that's what Ray Kurzweil believes.
4178540	4181860	That's what the neural network guy that I mentioned.
4181860	4185660	He also believes that that's inevitable that it's going towards that state.
4185660	4188980	I talked to him a couple of days ago in person and he confirmed that.
4189900	4194420	So it's a radical new story saying that the universe is waking up through life.
4195180	4196260	But that gives us a purpose.
4196260	4200900	We're part of this larger grand process and we need to do what we can to continue
4202460	4205900	intelligence and consciousness and experience and all those things that
4205900	4207780	come from sentience.
4207780	4211620	We need to do what we can to ensure that spreads throughout the universe.
4212060	4216700	And that involves a collective mindset change where we realize to solve
4216700	4220580	our existential problems, we have to come together because we to solve
4220580	4224980	these problems are so big that the whole system needs to be using all of its
4224980	4225940	computational power.
4226540	4230180	So any civilization that emerges anywhere will have to go through
4230180	4234500	the same sort of trajectory where they come together.
4234700	4236300	And we've always been coming together.
4236300	4238020	We've been coming together into societies.
4238020	4241100	But the thing is when we come together into a society, we come together
4241100	4244100	under a belief system and then a society emerges on this part of the world.
4244100	4245700	And it's a different belief system.
4245700	4248780	So there's those are two super organisms that are going to be in conflict
4248780	4250860	because they basically have different genomes.
4250860	4252140	They're different belief systems.
4252140	4253700	So it's a genome at a higher level.
4253700	4255020	It's a knowledge system.
4255020	4259620	So they're going to compete until they learn that cooperation is easier
4259660	4261180	and that makes every task easier.
4261180	4266020	It makes extracting any, any, any, it makes extracting energy easier in any task.
4266020	4266300	Really.
4266820	4268820	So it's part of a process.
4268860	4269740	It's inevitable.
4269780	4274780	This is a trajectory that civilizations will go through on any biosphere
4274780	4278340	where you have an intelligent civilization like this, but it's leading
4278340	4282700	to that larger story and that gives us that frames life in a way that's never
4282700	4283860	been framed by science before.
4283860	4287740	It says we have a cosmic purpose and we can carry out this cosmic
4287740	4292420	purpose by trying to facilitate a mindset of coming together, but it's also
4292420	4294820	at the individual level where you try to live optimally.
4294820	4297860	You don't do what's bad for the environment because it's going to hurt you.
4298180	4301420	You don't live with an ignorant or an accurate model of the world because
4301420	4302140	it's going to hurt you.
4302140	4304020	And if it hurts you, it's not good for the collective.
4304340	4307580	So we need to align our interests and we need to figure out how people can
4307580	4313100	act in their own selfish interest, but at the same time, do good for humanity.
4313380	4317500	So we just need to align the interests of the individual and the group
4318940	4322660	to where we're getting synergy and
4325180	4329460	without consciously adopting this mindset.
4329460	4333140	And I think for people to adopt this, because without all the science behind it,
4333140	4337300	it just kind of sounds like positive psychology or like self help, self
4337300	4339620	help guru stuff or new age stuff.
4340380	4344180	But I think with the science, you know, if people go, OK, the universe
4344180	4347580	does seem to be self organized and there is this trend, there is a meaning.
4347580	4348420	We don't know what it is.
4348420	4349660	We don't know if there was a designer.
4349660	4350140	We don't know.
4350140	4351180	And we'll talk about that next time.
4351180	4354060	But we don't know if it was a cosmological natural selection process.
4354060	4359260	But all we know is that reality seems our reality seems to have this trajectory
4359260	4360740	and we're part of this process.
4360740	4364180	And that process is good because it leads to more experiences.
4364180	4366620	If life ends, that's the end of experience.
4366620	4367500	That's the end of love.
4367500	4370660	That's the end of feeling, at least in our universe, that's the end of all that.
4371140	4373180	So it's a good thing for life to exist.
4373180	4377220	And out of this story, we get like a self help system.
4377220	4380500	We get a way to optimize your life based on, you know, just
4381540	4387420	acquiring information and behaving in a way that is compatible with your future goals.
4388100	4394260	So is there is there like an exercise or is there prescribed activities
4394260	4395780	or things, methods?
4395780	4396620	I mean, yeah.
4396620	4403140	So so this basically says it's basically an umbrella that goes, hey,
4403700	4408340	that meditation stuff, you're improving executive control, you know,
4408340	4413700	networks in your brain, like you're you're improving your ability to not act impulsively.
4415940	4418860	So you're optimizing your behavior.
4418860	4423060	It's an optimization process because if you behave,
4423060	4426820	let's say someone makes you mad and you punch them or you stab them,
4426820	4428500	you're in jail, you're done.
4428500	4430700	That's like your goals are gone.
4430700	4436900	So part of living optimally in like a base optimal way is making decisions
4436900	4441940	and being aware of all of the possibilities and the consequences of those decisions.
4441940	4445780	So the space of counterfactuals and choosing the decision that is in line
4445780	4449220	with your goals and the idea is that your specific goals,
4449740	4454660	if everyone is working towards those optimal goals,
4454660	4459500	then that kind of harmonizes society overall, moving in the right direction.
4459980	4462700	So meditation,
4465820	4469980	any sort of like new age practice, spiritual practice, religious practice,
4469980	4473660	even like praying, for example, makes you like aware, you know,
4473660	4475780	people get mad at people, Christians are saying,
4476740	4480380	pray for these people in the Middle East, like when they should really be doing
4480380	4481780	something, your prayers aren't going to do anything.
4481780	4485180	I don't think that's right because, yeah, they're not doing anything,
4485180	4486540	but they could not be praying.
4486540	4489180	And what praying is doing, at least they're making an exercise.
4489180	4491980	They're going, there's people on the other side of the world that don't have my culture.
4491980	4495460	And I'm going to imagine these people suffering and I'm going to ask them for help.
4495860	4498700	They're building out a theory of mind when they're doing that.
4498700	4502980	They're caring about those people because of that praying action more than they would
4502980	4504820	if they never did that act.
4504860	4508060	If they don't do that act, they're basically like an inanimate object.
4508060	4511260	It's kind of like how we, you know, we don't really treat people from other cultures.
4511260	4515340	Like the more we find in common with them, the more we start to treat them like ourselves.
4515340	4521060	But so what I'm saying is the act of prayer is do all kinds of good stuff.
4521060	4524020	Like also, like when you pray at night, you know, like, I'm thankful for this and this,
4524540	4528100	that stuff that emerged through evolution because it's adaptive.
4528100	4530940	So for us to throw that away, and that's what atheists have been doing.
4530940	4532180	They're like, oh, we hate new age stuff.
4532180	4533380	We hate religion.
4533420	4538420	It's just going back to dark ages in some way, because all of those things are adaptive.
4538860	4544220	So we need a new paradigm that merges science with spirituality and says all those practices
4544220	4547580	aren't bad, believing bullshit is bad.
4547580	4551500	You can die because you think homeopathy is going to cure your cancer.
4551900	4552940	So that's not amazing.
4552940	4557180	But what, but so I'm not, you know, saying everything is good about religion.
4557540	4560980	But I'm saying these practices, most of them, the reason people,
4561020	4564220	religion's not dying is because people find value in them.
4564500	4567700	And for scientists and atheists to be like, we're just going to do
4567820	4570380	whatever's the opposite of religion, which is what has happened.
4570940	4574500	They're putting scientists, you know, these people had a big disadvantage
4574500	4579580	or giving them an eye and actually religion, organized religion is sticking around
4579580	4582220	because science is having that mindset.
4582420	4584780	They're not realizing the power of that.
4584780	4588820	And then the regular person is like, I don't give a shit about your multiverse theory.
4589300	4593900	I want a belief system that's going to help me in life and give me a community
4593900	4596620	and make me wake up in the morning feeling good about life.
4597260	4602100	So they're actually hurting science by being like, oh, the spiritual practices are stupid.
4602500	4604700	Oh, meditation is bullshit.
4604700	4606900	Thinking that there's something higher is bullshit.
4607260	4609380	So very unproductive.
4609380	4614300	And I'm very passionate about this because these people are supposed to be
4614300	4617420	like our thought leaders and tell us like what's right or wrong are saying things
4617420	4620100	that are causing people mental harm.
4620140	4621220	I mean, really.
4621220	4624020	And Sabine Hassanfelders talked about this in her book.
4624020	4626020	She even wrote like a disclaimer at the beginning.
4626020	4628060	Like I've read an article saying free will isn't real.
4628060	4631540	And I'm worried because people have contacted me saying that they've been very
4631540	4633100	disturbed by this and people contact me too.
4633100	4636900	And odd people say I got out of this nihilistic trap by reading your book
4636900	4638620	and the free will arguments.
4638620	4641820	So those people are not being good Bayseans either.
4641820	4645100	They're way too certain where they're like free will is ridiculous.
4645140	4647820	It's like, well, you don't understand high level causality
4647820	4651860	because integrated information theory and Julio Tononi has two hour talk
4651860	4653020	on the mechanisms of free will.
4653020	4656700	And he says absolutely free will is a mechanistic thing.
4656700	4658540	It's not supernatural and it's real.
4658780	4663340	David Deutsch, one leading physicist who Sabine argues, you know, interviews
4663340	4667580	in her book for a chapter on interviewed by John Horgan, the guy I mentioned earlier.
4667580	4669220	He says, I'm sure we have free will.
4669780	4671380	So it depends on how you define free will.
4671380	4672740	And I've defined it in a certain way.
4672740	4675380	But the idea is that there really is freedom.
4675380	4678300	And if we're not using that freedom because we don't think we have it,
4678420	4682180	we're living in a way where we're we're not going to exercise our agency.
4683060	4686060	I think everything's determined and you're like, I want to help the world.
4686060	4689740	And I have an idea like you might not put that idea out there.
4689740	4692980	But if you realize I'm an agent and there it's everything is not determined
4692980	4695900	like I can actually make a difference on the world, you're much more likely
4695900	4698540	to to actually go through with what you're doing.
4698700	4700740	Oh, sure. Yeah, I've said it for a long time.
4701380	4703580	I'm not sure if I came up with this or I've read it somewhere else.
4703580	4707620	But I believe in free will because when I don't, I make terrible decisions.
4708780	4710460	You know, that's great.
4710460	4713420	I can, yeah, I can rationalize, geez, anything.
4713820	4715540	But I know you do have to.
4715540	4718060	Yeah, it really does optimize your decisions believing in it,
4718060	4720620	which suggests that it's real because if you didn't give anything.
4720700	4724980	Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a great that's a that's a huge conversation
4724980	4726220	that can have to. Yeah.
4726220	4730340	But one thing I do want to if you do have to run to wrap up a little bit
4730340	4734740	and maybe give it like sort of a teaser for next time, this idea of cosmic
4734740	4738900	complexity, you know, this heading towards this omega point.
4739620	4741380	Can you give us and feel free to speculate?
4741380	4745740	Feel I know you're the book is grounded in the great science and well researched.
4747260	4750700	But your intuition, let's say, you know, deep inside yourself,
4750940	4752460	something maybe some of you can't prove.
4752460	4758420	But why why do you think this is all how it's laid out?
4758700	4761540	Why do you think we're here?
4761540	4765180	Like the ultimate question of like, why this big story?
4765580	4768460	This, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, what's the purpose?
4768460	4770460	Like, what's going on?
4770460	4773140	Yeah, so I won't be able to answer that today.
4773140	4775020	I'll give the short answer.
4775020	4779100	But mechanistically, I think what's go like what explains it is basically
4779100	4780900	the universe is moving towards this.
4780900	4783100	It's the system moving towards an attractor.
4784100	4789660	And so when you ask like, and I think this theory can inform quantum mechanics
4789660	4791100	because it's like, oh, there's this wave function.
4791100	4793220	There's all these different possibilities.
4793220	4796460	And that's what kind of overthrew determinism is that we understand
4796460	4800340	that there's this probabilistic nature due to quantum mechanics.
4801060	4806980	But what I'm saying is actually the wave function collapse isn't random.
4808020	4810780	If you have an isolated quantum system, it's going to look random.
4811020	4815260	But when everything is interacting, everything, all those wave functions
4815260	4816380	must be collapsed.
4816380	4820660	And I know some people, you know, I haven't defined these terms, but yeah,
4820660	4823540	just for like a high level thing, we'll talk about it more next time.
4823540	4827380	But that that the collapse is if the universe is becoming more complex,
4827380	4830740	that puts constraints on how the wave function collapses such that the collapse
4830740	4834540	is much in totality add up towards going towards this omega point.
4834540	4839740	So I think it is a new motivates a new theory of quantum mechanics.
4839980	4842060	I mean, there are interpretations like quantum Darwinism,
4842060	4843700	which are consistent with what I'm saying.
4843700	4846100	But I think the universe is moving towards an attractor.
4846100	4851860	And it's this this functional state of like the universe,
4851860	4856180	being the self aware computational conscious state with the power of a God,
4856180	4861860	basically, and a God would be nothing more than a mind that has freeman Dyson said,
4861860	4867300	a God is just a mind that has achieved power beyond our comprehension.
4868300	4872940	So why do I think there's this design that's leading to that?
4873180	4879220	Well, one explanation is cosmological natural selection is that the universe basically.
4881100	4885500	Our universe, there is a multiverse, but it's not like every possibility exists.
4885820	4890020	There was this evolutionary process where in Lee Smallman's model of cosmological
4890020	4894660	natural selection, when you have a universe form and then a black hole forms in that universe,
4895140	4899020	since a big bang is like a singularity event that creates a universe.
4899020	4901500	The idea is that when a bit of black hole forms in the universe,
4901900	4904620	that's a big bang event that creates a new universe.
4905100	4908340	And that's how you have these ever this evolutionary process
4908340	4912620	that's creating more and more universes and the universes that are good at creating black holes
4912620	4917140	and black holes come from stars and stars create the chemistry that's needed for life.
4917580	4920180	Then you'll get more and more universes that create more and more black holes.
4920220	4922300	So more and more universes that have more and more stars.
4922540	4925740	And so this process will lead to more and more universes that are firmly for life
4925740	4928180	because stars create the higher elements that are needed for life.
4928860	4931940	And then so if this evolutionary process is true,
4932300	4936620	you'll have the selection pressure towards getting more life-friendly universes.
4938020	4943940	And then if the intelligence in that universe can engineer new universes by engineering black holes,
4943940	4948300	and Alan Gooth, the creative cosmic inflation theory, says we should be able.
4948340	4952220	He doesn't necessarily believe this theory, even though people do consider it.
4952220	4955620	I mean, Leonard Susskin, string theory guy, said he's surprised at least more.
4955620	4959260	And this theory hasn't gotten as much attention, like more attention.
4959780	4964620	But even now, in Gooth's model, he still thinks we can create a universe
4964620	4967260	by creating some sort of singularity event,
4967260	4969820	even if he doesn't think that black holes are always creating these universes,
4970300	4974500	which cosmic inflation kind of has a similar model where universes are created.
4974500	4977420	But I'm not sure. I don't think it's the mechanism is to black holes.
4977420	4981820	There's just these, yeah, I guess a little more complicated into inflation.
4981820	4986740	But so the whole point of that and what small one isn't saying is
4986740	4989940	if you look at the structure of this cosmological natural structure universe,
4989940	4994420	it still inevitably leads to life and then it leads to life dominating and taking over.
4994900	4999940	And that would lead to universes that become more and more complex and more and more intelligent.
5000420	5004540	And ultimately, that would lead to an evolutionary process towards universes
5004540	5009260	that lead to fully integrated omega point states,
5009860	5014220	just because it's the pinnacle of this process and doesn't have to end there.
5014220	5017300	Maybe our universe, once it reaches this fully integrated state,
5017380	5023540	maybe there's some interaction with these other universes and that these omega points
5023540	5027180	at this higher level will merge and form a larger super organism.
5027180	5033620	If this story of nature's particles coming together and forming these aggregates
5033620	5036940	at these higher levels keeps going on, maybe it's larger than this universe.
5036940	5039420	So maybe it continues, I don't know.
5039900	5042660	But the point I'm emphasizing here, which I haven't really emphasized before,
5043020	5048460	is that it's still a teleological story.
5048580	5050940	It's the one that we were trying to get rid of.
5050940	5052340	Like, why is this universe designed?
5052340	5054060	Oh, cosmological natural selection.
5054060	5057420	But if you look at the multiverse of the cosmological natural selection world,
5057820	5063500	it still starts off empty, I mean, lifeless and inevitably gets dominated by life.
5063540	5065620	So it's the same teleological story.
5065620	5069620	So even with the cosmological natural selection theory, we cannot get away
5069620	5072060	from the teleological nature of the cosmos.
5073860	5078260	There still seems to be a life generating principle, not just where it produces life
5078260	5085180	in one universe of this vastly sterile multiverse, but that life spreads
5085180	5091540	and the multiverse becomes fully biophilic.
5092180	5097260	So whatever the answer is, there's still this life giving principle
5097260	5099340	that I see as equivalent to God.
5099740	5104020	And here's the thing, if you have this process, it's going to lead to intelligent
5104020	5108580	beings like us who, because the laws of physics don't disallow this,
5108780	5112540	create virtual worlds that then might have their own agents.
5113900	5117580	So if we're creating that, then the process leads to creators too.
5118540	5122820	And so in my view, it's kind of arbitrary to say, was our universe
5123780	5127620	created or is it cosmological natural selection?
5127820	5130820	I'm like, well, we don't know it could be cosmological natural selection
5130820	5132340	or maybe that's not the right answer.
5132340	5136860	Maybe our universe really is nested in another reality and we're a simulated world
5137420	5140420	with a physical substrate, you know, just like we create computers
5140420	5143540	with a physical substrate, but then there's a simulated world of virtual agents.
5144300	5148860	There's no reason to to say that that's not a possibility.
5149620	5153260	But here's my point, even if we were created by a creator, you have to explain them
5153860	5158220	and then you could explain them as a as a result of this evolutionary process.
5158940	5164500	But it's not the atheist one that leads to mostly still it's still a biophilic one.
5164500	5170060	So my ultimate understanding was that nature has this life generating principle.
5170380	5171780	It's really hard to determine.
5171780	5175020	You know, we still have that why something from nothing problem.
5175540	5177700	But we are making progress.
5177700	5181460	It's not introducing unnecessary stuff by going outside this universe
5181460	5184820	because we have the fine tuning mystery that is begging for a solution
5184820	5187820	that we don't have unless we think about these other things.
5187820	5191300	Creator cosmological selection and the multiverse theory,
5191300	5194620	which I don't think is a good explanation because it introduces everything
5194860	5198260	just to explain away a creator when we shouldn't necessarily need to explain
5198260	5200780	a creator with every possible universe exists.
5200820	5203020	It's just I don't think it's the right.
5203020	5205220	I don't think it's superior epistemologically.
5205220	5207020	Occam's are all the things we mentioned.
5207020	5212260	So ultimately, I'm left with the process itself being God
5212260	5214220	and that we could be created by an agent,
5214220	5218340	but it wouldn't be this all powerful, fundamental thing that was there forever.
5219980	5223780	It would be a product of this process, but that process seems to be eternal.
5223780	5227940	So even if we have a God, a creator, I don't think if I learn about him,
5227940	5229340	I don't think I'd pray to him.
5229340	5233020	I think if we have a creator, it might be like us creating things.
5233020	5235420	And then we want to ask our AI, like, is there a God?
5235420	5239180	Like, maybe if we do have a creator, they're looking for us to answer.
5239180	5241460	Maybe we're the AI that's going to inform them.
5241780	5245060	But so even if we had a creator, I'm not necessarily sure
5245060	5247180	that I don't think that would be the end of all answers.
5247180	5252140	I think it's more spiritually satisfying to be like to just recognize
5252460	5256060	there is a process that leads to life, leads to consciousness
5256060	5260420	and unending consciousness reaching higher and higher levels of experience.
5260900	5265180	And to me, that's kind of a Spinoza type
5265420	5268780	pantheism thing. It's but it's beyond that because pantheism is
5268780	5272220	oh, this world could be inanimate and sterile, but it's God.
5272220	5275340	But like, this is really giving more of a reason to say
5275580	5278340	the universe is God because it's not this arbitrary random thing anymore.
5278340	5280340	It's this life generating thing.
5281060	5285300	And so to me, that has all of the same qualities of a God.
5286180	5289580	And I do think we could be somewhere far along in the process
5289580	5292140	where we could be the product of an intelligent agent.
5292140	5296100	And that agent could have created a moral moral art to this trajectory
5296420	5299980	where our universe, they want to create something that improves and gets better.
5299980	5300820	And that's what you're seeing.
5300820	5304620	We're getting away from our original roots, kind of like
5305100	5307740	kind of compatible with like this theory of original sin.
5307740	5310460	But like we evolve from this animalistic thing.
5310460	5313220	And as this trajectory happens, we get more moral.
5313220	5314660	We develop a theory of mind.
5314660	5316660	We start to understand that there are other conscious things.
5316660	5317940	We start to treat them better.
5317940	5320780	We start to understand we're part of the biosphere and the universe.
5320780	5322780	We start to care more about the environment.
5322780	5326100	So I think our evolutionary trajectory has a moral arc
5326100	5330420	that is further evidence for some sort of purpose or design.
5330980	5336740	And that part of me says, OK, there is something maybe to it.
5336740	5338140	And maybe we're farther along the process.
5338140	5339060	Maybe there is a creator.
5339060	5343420	Maybe they do care about what happens the way we create programs
5343420	5345260	and we're interested in what happens.
5345260	5347700	But it's a personal journey for me, too.
5347700	5351740	I don't know. I mean, if is it why is there evil in the world?
5352100	5352940	Why isn't it more perfect?
5352940	5354940	I have questions for that. I'm like, trying.
5355300	5357260	I think, you know, there can't be good without evil.
5357260	5357980	It's all spectrum.
5357980	5360460	There's no way to even define good unless you have something opposite.
5361060	5364260	So maybe it starts off of good and evil because that's the only way it can go.
5364260	5368580	But it evolves towards a more moral existence
5368580	5370740	towards as you get closer to the omega point.
5371060	5372780	So it's a journey for me.
5372780	5376780	But what I am convinced by is that you do have this trajectory.
5376780	5380140	And once you start asking what that should why it's this way,
5380380	5382700	you get into all the explanations that I've just said.
5383060	5386060	And I think they're better than the nihilistic multiverse.
5386060	5388460	We're just weak anthropic principle version.
5388900	5391820	And I think that's super exciting because I really think a Bayesian analysis.
5391820	5394460	Anybody, I think Sean Carroll, if we have long enough talk,
5394460	5398500	if you brought me and five leading physicists who are open minded,
5398580	5400980	Sean Carroll, Lee Smollon, maybe have some neuroscientists,
5400980	5405460	Christoph Carl Friston, I think if you lay all these things on the table,
5405820	5409940	we would quickly come to the consensus that at least what I'm putting forth
5409940	5414460	is a good theory. Some people might say, oh, it's not as likely.
5414460	5417620	They might say the multiverse thing in there, according to all of their stuff,
5417620	5419340	is a little bit more likely than this.
5419340	5423700	But there's no way that you can say that this isn't a legitimate scientific theory,
5423700	5426100	whether it's our universe was created by an intelligent agent
5427060	5428660	or cosmological natural selection.
5428660	5431500	Like, and that's what I've been happy about.
5431500	5434380	You know, the book could have come out and people could have said crackpot.
5434420	5438420	Like, and it just could have got killed by like, you know, reviews and stuff like that.
5438420	5441500	And no one might have given a blog who is not like a Christian person.
5442020	5445420	But all the people that gave it blurbs and stuff were were scientists,
5445420	5447540	people called themselves atheists or agnostics.
5447980	5451700	I mean, there's not one Christian out of like the dozen blurbs I got.
5451700	5454540	There's not one religious person.
5454540	5458420	So I know the argument is compelling,
5459380	5464980	but the argument makes all these other wonderful spiritual weird implications.
5465700	5468700	And since people were willing to accept the first book, I'm like, OK,
5468700	5471180	now it's time to open up the bag of worms.
5471180	5474540	If you're going to put this on the table, which really, you know,
5474540	5476740	it's not this opening up the bag of worms.
5476740	5480020	The fact that you had all these unsolved mysteries that this starts to solve.
5480380	5482860	But it's exciting because I think with what's going on in AI
5482860	5486660	and these papers coming out arguing that the universe is a complex adaptive system,
5486660	5488500	a learning system, a neural network or stuff.
5488660	5493580	It's the it's the right time that this is about to like become, you know,
5493580	5495340	there's going to be a cafes transition.
5495340	5498940	There's going to be a shift in perspective that changes everyone's ideology.
5498940	5501620	And that ideology will lead to greater harmony around the world.
5501940	5504260	So I want to be part of that happening.
5506100	5510220	And it's really exciting, but it just has to be done with care
5510260	5514780	because it's very easy to scare people off when you talk about like the religious stuff
5514780	5517700	and religious people are scared of evolution and stuff.
5517700	5523140	So it would be wonderful if people go, OK, we don't know shit really.
5523140	5525220	And we can.
5525220	5528020	But there's stuff that we don't we that we know is not true.
5528020	5529060	And there's stuff that we don't know.
5529060	5532580	Like we can start to come together and be like, you know, religious and,
5533100	5535740	you know, scientific people can be like, there does seem to be this purpose.
5535740	5536980	And we do need to cooperate.
5536980	5538100	We do need to come together.
5538100	5539580	We do like all those things.
5539580	5542860	So I'm excited to see where this goes.
5544660	5550980	And I'll just make a prediction that in 10 years, if we have a conversation again,
5551700	5555220	that this paradigm will be considered and I may not even be mentioned.
5555220	5557420	I may not even be on like the wiki page for it.
5557420	5561100	But I do believe that in 10 years,
5561820	5564180	the idea that the universe is a self organizing system going
5564180	5567820	towards this kind of a mega point computational, fully integrated state
5568300	5573460	will be if not the leading theory, it will do basically
5573660	5577220	with the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics that go from complete obscurity
5577220	5582980	to like start being like kind of like at one of the competing main interpretations.
5583460	5584740	Yeah, that's so cool.
5584740	5586860	And I hope it doesn't take 10 years for us to talk again.
5587020	5590740	But one question before you go, I have to know, how did you choose
5590860	5592860	that is a hop vibration on the cover, right?
5594540	5596660	Yeah. So I don't know.
5597260	5599380	I've heard I'm pretty sure it is. Yeah. Yeah.
5599380	5603980	So I there was an interview for Eric Weinstein.
5603980	5607580	I know he has a geometric unity theory and there was a similar structure on his.
5607580	5609980	And I wonder if it was is that from like gauge theory?
5610380	5612740	I bring it up. Well, partly it has.
5612740	5616940	Oh, I bring it's really speaking to me now because I was very fortunate.
5616940	5621300	About a month ago, I have a video on the hop vibration on that on that object.
5621300	5623940	You got to watch it. Yeah. Well, I was so fortunate.
5623940	5629340	It blew up a few weeks ago, and now it's like 800,000 views and counting,
5629340	5631660	which is awesome. So congrats.
5631700	5633340	Yeah, it's great. Thank you.
5633340	5637860	And I don't know why it just kind of took off on its own.
5638260	5640220	Yeah, that's what people shared it, too.
5640220	5641180	Yeah, maybe.
5641180	5644580	And I think Eric Weinstein was on some podcasts recently,
5644580	5646460	so that might have just picked it up.
5646460	5652020	But people are really drawn to this this geometric object for some reason.
5652020	5655900	A lot of a lot of the comments have been people seeing this while,
5655900	5659100	say, meditating or an altered state of consciousness.
5659260	5661180	Very cool. I mean, a lot of people.
5661180	5663700	And I mean, that's probably not so uncommon for.
5665260	5668420	And a geometric object that's kind of interesting and has,
5668860	5671060	you know, an undulate and stuff like that.
5671060	5674380	But but I want to know if there was any like deeper significance behind.
5674380	5676460	Yeah, so I'll cover because it's not in the story.
5677340	5678460	Yeah, I could tell you the story.
5678460	5682540	And I think I don't think she would mind me saying this.
5682540	5685820	So the artist's name, Francesca Lorenzini,
5686100	5689380	and on Instagram, she's Francesca Acacia.
5689860	5695260	But she had all this art that was kind of she has a background
5695260	5697140	in psychology and philosophy.
5697140	5702260	So it's very scientific and database.
5702260	5705260	And so I'll link to I'll link to our stuff, too.
5705540	5707780	Yeah, yeah, that'd be awesome.
5707780	5712420	So I was looking through all of that art to like find
5713420	5715700	the right thing, because I knew that had a certain stick.
5715700	5717260	I have a few artist friends, too.
5717260	5721100	I had in mind and the original one fell through.
5721100	5722100	They just didn't have time.
5722100	5724700	And it was going to be very similar to Anika Harris,
5724700	5728300	this conscious cover where it's like all the sprawling organically,
5728300	5729580	like kind of cosmic stuff.
5729580	5731180	And that's where we were going to go with.
5731180	5733940	But since she kind of stole the I mean, she didn't know about it.
5733940	5735660	But I mean, I got scooped on that idea.
5735940	5739460	So I was looking for this picture and I saw that and I asked her
5739460	5740180	where she got it from.
5740180	5745540	And she was like, I did acid like I saw that.
5745860	5748260	I bring that up because you said people see that.
5748260	5751380	So she had a psychedelic experience where she saw something like this.
5751380	5754020	But then she went out looking for it and she found that.
5754020	5757180	And it was like a MATLAB data visualization that someone had made.
5757460	5759540	Yeah. But she tweaked it.
5759540	5760420	She tweaked it.
5760420	5763700	And then we put the person in it and we put it on the background.
5763700	5764340	It's beautiful.
5764340	5767060	But I didn't I didn't know what the structure was called even.
5767060	5771060	And I had heard about those structures and I knew it was something like that.
5771060	5774180	But I don't know if it's exactly the same thing.
5774540	5776860	Oh, it is. I'm 99 percent sure it is.
5777780	5779260	It shows loops and levels.
5779260	5782700	It shows like the theme of the book, sort of like this recursive nature.
5782700	5784140	And that's kind of mine.
5784140	5785860	I think it's an important structure.
5785860	5789260	It's technically a it's a mapping from a four
5789620	5793540	hypersphere onto a traditional what we would call traditional sphere.
5793780	5796780	So it's the fiber bundled and you can visualize it in many different ways.
5796780	5798580	You just cut away most of the fibers.
5798580	5802020	And those are sort of that's the visualization that she has there.
5802260	5806220	And there are perhaps I don't quite know.
5806580	5809780	I can't quite tell how important it is in physics.
5809980	5813220	Apparently, there are seven, seven or eight different
5813580	5817300	applications of it in fundamental physics situations.
5817820	5820540	I've been trying to reach out to the physicist who wrote a paper about it
5820620	5823020	like 20 years ago, but I can't get in touch with him.
5823260	5825980	So maybe I'll talk to Eric Weinstein about it
5826260	5829820	because he thinks it's the most important object in the universe.
5830220	5832500	But I can't tell, honestly, I don't want to.
5832500	5833420	I can't tell either.
5833420	5837140	I have an audience that I'm just not sure how important it is.
5837140	5838060	It could be very important.
5838060	5840940	It could be, you know, I don't know enough.
5841020	5843180	I don't know enough Eric Weinstein's interesting
5843180	5845980	because he's a person where I feel like I know a lot about science.
5846260	5849500	I do not know enough about math that you to understand
5849940	5852860	whether he's got some substantial ideas or not.
5852860	5855180	So that's something I want to deep dive into
5856220	5859460	because anytime anyone's like I figured it out,
5859460	5861860	I think it's worth looking into.
5861860	5864740	But like I have no idea if it's important as he says to.
5864740	5866820	It's interesting. I definitely want to learn more about it.
5867340	5868460	But I do I do think it is.
5868460	5871740	I mean, some in some way, like that's why I used it.
5871740	5873500	I think it captures everything.
5873500	5876140	And I think we're like an early stage in mathematics
5876140	5878060	where we haven't started to understand.
5878060	5880940	I've been talking to people about this, like recursive sets and stuff.
5880940	5882380	There's these structures.
5882380	5887820	I do think he's on to something and we need to to learn more about it.
5887820	5890220	But yeah, I think if anything,
5890220	5894500	it kind of supports this idea that reality is structured
5894500	5896700	through loops and levels, which we didn't really talk about.
5896700	5898540	But there's there's hierarchical organization
5898540	5900900	and there's all these feedback loops.
5900900	5903900	And so I think it probably is like
5904900	5908460	some kind of key to unlocking the secrets of reality.
5908820	5910060	Yes, possibly.
5910060	5911740	And it's funny because we didn't talk about it.
5911740	5913580	And I think you do mention in the book,
5913580	5915740	but Douglas Hofstadter's girl, Esher Bach,
5916100	5918260	which is all about loops and levels.
5918260	5922420	And I read that like two summers ago for the first time
5922740	5924260	and blew my mind. Yeah.
5924260	5928500	But I will say since that book, my favorite book is yours.
5930100	5931860	The romance of reality.
5931860	5933820	Please go out and read it, people. It's fantastic.
5933820	5935420	So thanks so much, Colin.
5935420	5936820	This has been a lot of fun.
5936820	5938300	Yes, I can't wait for round two.
5938300	5940260	I have a bunch of questions I'll say for next time.
5940260	5941740	And I just really appreciate your time.
5941740	5943220	Thank you, Bobby. Let's do it.
5943220	5944620	All right. Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
