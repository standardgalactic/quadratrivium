00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
By the end of this video, you'll understand this. A Hopf vibration. You may have heard

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,760
mathematician Eric Weinstein comment on Joe Rogan. Hopf. And this is going to be H-O-P-F.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:20,480
H-O-P-F. You are looking at the most important object in the universe. What?

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,360
Discovered by Heinz Hopf in 1931, Hopf fiber bundles hop up in at least eight different

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:34,280
physics situations. So what you are seeing is, as legendary physicist Roger Penrose put it,

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,840
an element of the architecture of our world. We'll build to an understanding of the Hopf

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,200
vibration and the fewest steps necessary. If you're not yet familiar with higher dimensional

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,080
shapes, you might want to first watch my video explaining a 4D hypercube known as the Tesseract,

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:00,200
linked above and below. In my opinion, hypercubes are easier to understand than hyperspheres,

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,440
and that video more gradually builds from the 0th to the 4th dimension.

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:14,640
So what's the simplest definition of a Hopf vibration? It's just a map from a hypersphere

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:24,240
in 4D onto a sphere in 3D. How is it mapped? A sphere is fully covered by points. Each

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,080
point is mapped to a circle from the hypersphere. The circles are the fibers that compose the

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:43,240
hypersphere. We'll unpack this in a bit, but first we need

15
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,120
to briefly cover the concept of stereographic projection, which is the process of mapping

16
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:56,560
a sphere onto a plane. First, imagine a light source at the north pole of this circle in

17
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,000
2D. As this light beam passes through the circumference, you can see there is projection

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,040
of a purple point on the x-axis in 1D. Now here we have the light source at the north

19
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,720
pole of the sphere in 3D. As the light passes through the boundary, you can see a circle

20
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,400
is projected onto the 2D plane. Note how the circle is larger closer to the north pole.

21
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:29,240
Next, we inflate a polyhedron with four colored faces. We project in all directions from a

22
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,800
fixed point on the north pole. You can see how the faces on the sphere are projected

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,360
onto the two-dimensional plane below. We are demonstrating how a circle or sphere

24
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,440
appears in lower dimensions, so we can build intuition of how a hypersphere projects into

25
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:56,760
one lower dimension, the third dimension. The top row is the view of a circle or sphere

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,160
in what you might call their traditional space, 2D for the circle and 3D for the sphere. The

27
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:09,280
bottom row is how that is projected onto a lower-dimensional plane. Before we explain

28
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,440
the hop-fibration, it's important to note I'm skimming over imaginary numbers, quaternions,

29
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,680
and the complex plane to keep this as straightforward as possible. But if you wish to dive into

30
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:28,040
the nitty-gritty math, there are links in the description.

31
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,920
In our first example, we are stereographically projecting from the north pole of a sphere.

32
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:44,040
As we rotate around the circle, you can see how this one point corresponds to one circle.

33
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:58,160
If we view this continuously, all of the circles fill up the hypersphere.

34
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,120
Let's track just one point as it moves from north to south. We'll start at the equator.

35
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,200
The red point on the sphere relates to the red circle within the hypersphere. The white

36
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:18,600
torus or doughnut corresponds to connected points around an axis.

37
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,120
As the point spins southward, you can see the circle getting smaller and tighter around

38
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,720
the center, until it's a non-skewed circle through the south pole. As the point moves

39
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,080
north, the corresponding circle gets much larger until, when it goes to true north,

40
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,600
it appears as a straight line. It's hard to imagine, but this is actually a circle

41
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:47,240
through infinity. This is how the circles would appear around a single axis, say the

42
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,760
equator. It's easy to see this interaction if we look at just two complex points and

43
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:00,600
their complementary circles.

44
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,640
As you view them move around an axis, you can see how they are linked like a chain.

45
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:18,220
A third linked circle joins the dance. And we can keep on adding circles to fit the

46
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:26,240
entire hypersphere. Algebraic topology professor Niles Johnson at Ohio State University created

47
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,800
this excellent visualization of the hopf vibration with its corresponding points on

48
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:41,040
a sphere. Some hopf vibration facts. None of the circles intersect. Each circle links

49
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:48,960
to every other circle exactly once. True south, in 3D, is a circle at the core of the hopf

50
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,880
vibration. Visualize this as the tightest circle in the center of the torus or doughnut.

51
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,240
True north, in 3D, is that circle through infinity. Remember, this is the stereographic

52
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:10,120
projection of the hypersphere in our familiar three dimensions.

53
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,200
While this is running, two plugs. First, if you're enjoying this video, please subscribe

54
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,520
to my channel. And second, I highly recommend a similar visualizer and interactive tool

55
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,880
created by Nico Belmonte. It allows you to draw your own circles within the hopf vibration

56
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,640
and rotate the structure as well. This awesome learning tool is linked below in the description.

57
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,200
And now we stereographically project these villarso circles on a few latitudes on the

58
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:49,680
sphere. As this runs, I need to recommend the excellent resource dimensions-math.org and

59
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,840
the corresponding Joe Slay's YouTube channel. Joe's and a team of brilliant minds created

60
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,240
an amazing nine-part series on dimensions, which you should check out. Many of the visuals

61
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,240
in this video come from that series, which they so graciously distributed under a Creative

62
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,280
Commons license. Everything is linked below in the description. We then rotate around

63
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,400
for the space.

64
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,800
I also want to share some still images of the hopf vibration from another angle, which

65
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,840
I think better illustrates the fiber-bundledness of the structure. While we're here, why not

66
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,280
take a ride inside a hopf vibration? You can see all the circles which look like lines

67
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:11,120
are made up of zero-dimensional points, which kind of look like spheres. As we mentioned

68
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:19,680
earlier, the hopf vibration is a fundamental element across a range of physics applications.

69
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,120
Even if you'll never understand these advanced physics concepts, I hope you gained an intuitive

70
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,880
understanding of an essential feature of our universe, the hopf vibration.
