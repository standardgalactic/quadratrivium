1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
You know, you take it as something like the free energy principle, you try to think,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,800
okay, what's even more fundamental than that?

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,680
What's behind that?

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,960
What's below that?

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,240
What kind of feeds into that?

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,080
I have to say, also, you won't get more fundamental or simple than the free energy principle.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,080
When you realize that your environment is composed of other things very much like you,

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,520
right, when you're young, your mom or as your own or your colleagues and your friends and your

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,880
family, I think that's interesting because now we're getting to a much more symmetrical

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,880
sort of relationship between me and the environment and certainly in this context,

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,680
you know, most of my universe is basically you and me.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,400
So now there's a certain kind of symmetry in play, whereas you are my environment and I am

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,680
your environment and yet we both have gelatine models of our environments, which basically means

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,760
I have a gelatine model of you and you have a gelatine model of me, but the best way to minimize

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:04,640
surprise when I surprising signal that generated by things like me, namely you, is to ensure that

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,640
I was much like you as possible so that I can predict what you're going to do next,

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,160
because that's what I was going to do next.

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,640
And exactly symmetric is so for you.

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,080
So that basically means that we come to share a gelatine model,

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,880
a shared narrative we're seeing from the same PIM sheet and everything becomes mutually predictable.

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,480
What it doesn't describe though is the going back to your

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,280
firelight zone and the man in the nice hell, the epistemic hell.

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,360
So if it was the case that we could become completely mutually predictable and just keep

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,120
on singing the same song together for hour after hour after hour, that will become boring.

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,920
And at this point, I think you're now into sort of social neuroscience and joint free energy

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,760
minimization that can sometimes lead to quite paradoxical results or

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,600
understandings of the way that we search for information or engage with people.

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,000
On the one hand, I want to make my world as predictable as possible, so I don't get any

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,200
nasty surprises.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,200
So I'm going to go to those kinds of news channels, I've talked to this kind of person,

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,480
because I think that we have a lined frame of reference, we have common grounds,

32
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,760
we speak the same language.

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,160
On the other hand, I'm going to be compelled to be slightly curious about other ways of thinking.

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,600
It's not, you know, we're not all going to merge into one massive community and we are

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,960
one massive hive mind, one massive collective intelligence.

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,480
It's not going to work because we are compelled to, you know, what would happen if I looked at it

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,360
this way? Or what's that kind of person like? What's this culture like?

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,040
So, you know, I haven't got any answers, but there's a really, really interesting

39
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,760
field of information in sort of social neuroscience.

40
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,840
Professor Carl Friston is a world-renowned neuroscientist and researcher.

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,720
He is best known for his work in developing groundbreaking statistical methods and mathematical

42
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,680
models to understand the workings of the brain and how it gives rise to complex behaviors.

43
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
Our discussion mainly tackles his free energy principle, which states that the brain is

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,920
constantly working to minimize the amount of free energy in its system.

45
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,160
According to this principle, the brain is a predictive engine that is constantly trying

46
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,720
to make accurate predictions about the world in order to minimize its own uncertainty.

47
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,360
If you got this far, please subscribe and I hope you enjoy our conversation.

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,960
Professor Friston, thank you for coming up.

49
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,640
Thank you for inviting me.

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,640
Yes, it is a pleasure. For the folks watching this on YouTube, I just want to say they should

51
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,440
know that you are one of the most cited scientists in the world and have made, you know,

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,920
monumental impacts on the field of neuroscience.

53
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,160
So, it is the highest honor, honestly, to be speaking with you today.

54
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,440
And thank you so much for coming on.

55
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,920
It's very gracious for you. Thank you.

56
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,720
Yeah. And, you know, your time is very valuable.

57
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,480
So, I do want to jump right into it.

58
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,120
And as we discussed over email, the primary focus of the conversation

59
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,960
will be on your free energy principle.

60
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,080
So, I think it will be awesome as it is discover.

61
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,760
Let's maybe set the table, so to speak.

62
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,560
Could you provide a high level, sort of simple description of the free energy principle?

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,360
And then I have a number of specifics to ask you about it.

64
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,760
Right. So, when confronted with that challenge, I normally say there are two ways you can

65
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:29,200
know description. So, there's a sort of intuitive low road approach, which I'll describe first.

66
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,840
And then there's the appreciation of the principle from them through the lens of a

67
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,720
physicist to understand self-organization.

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:45,360
But from the point of view of a psychologist or a neuroscientist, we're talking about a very

69
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:53,680
longstanding way of formulating our capacity to make sense of our world in terms of being able

70
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,960
to predict. So, these ideas go all the way back to Plato and probably Kantian in nature,

71
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,200
but probably best articulated by Helmholtz in the 19th century.

72
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,800
In the sense that perception is a constructive act.

73
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,320
It is, in the words of people like Richard Gregory, it is the brain actively constructing

74
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,600
explanations, hypotheses, fantasies for what might have caused my sensations.

75
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,040
So, this is very much, as Andy Clark would say, an inside-out process that you're creating a fantasy,

76
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,800
an explanation for what I would have seen if this was the right explanation.

77
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:47,840
And then you're using the actual sensations to correct, update, revise your internal hypothesis,

78
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,440
your internal fantasies. On that view, you could regard the brain as literally a fantastic organ.

79
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,560
It's a purveyor of fantasies that are trying to make sense of the lived world, or at least the

80
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:10,160
sensed world. And if you cast that in terms of inference mathematically, abductive reasoning,

81
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:19,680
and write down the rules that would have to obtain if we were in the game of inferring the

82
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,760
causes of our sensations, then you get to a formalism that can be described in terms of

83
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,680
optimizing a quantity called variational free energy. And this quantity is quite ubiquitous in

84
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,160
statistics and machine learning, also known as an evidence lower bound. And it simply scores the

85
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:48,080
surprise that is inherent in any sensory evidence or any sensation. And we use that surprise, if you

86
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:56,480
like, to revise our beliefs. And that mathematically can be written down as minimizing free energy.

87
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,360
So all that you can think of in terms of what constitutes a good brain, and possibly a good

88
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,160
mind, can thereby be described as trying to minimize free energy or minimizing surprise.

89
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,080
You can understand that in terms of the average surprise, which would be uncertainty.

90
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,600
So all of this is really saying, it's a mathematical statement, that self organizing

91
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:28,800
sentient system, look as if they are trying to minimize uncertainty, trying to find the most

92
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,720
the best guess, if you like, the best hypothesis for the causes of their sensation.

93
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,360
You can understand this in a very generalized sense. You don't have to think of it in terms

94
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,960
of sentience, you could understand this is just a kind of homeostasis.

95
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,280
Both your body and my body is in the same game of trying to minimize surprising deviations from

96
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,160
states of being. And we do so, certainly at the level of physiology, by trying to keep ourselves

97
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:07,520
within prior ranges of states, a temperature or blood sugar and the like, that would be very

98
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,760
surprising if we found ourselves outside those regimes under very, very cold or

99
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,200
in some kind of physical extremists. So that would be, if you like, a sort of biological

100
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:26,080
perspective of the energy, the physicist would come along and say, okay, there are certain,

101
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,960
or possibly quite remarkable systems in my universe that seem to restrict themselves to

102
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:39,200
certain characteristic states of being. They have a peculiar capacity to resist

103
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,800
the second law of thermodynamics, which I should say just applies to some closed systems, but

104
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,680
I think it's a useful concept here in relation to this notion of homeostasis.

105
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,040
So what characteristics must these systems possess in order to keep themselves within

106
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,600
characteristic states, technically, mathematically, of course, a pullback attractor,

107
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,520
is it just states of being that look as if they're attracting certain systems so that

108
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,720
they gather themselves up and keep themselves within these characteristic states. And it turns

109
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:23,680
out if you write down the equations for the dynamics of these kinds of systems, then you can

110
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,160
explain or you can describe these in terms of a variational principle of least action that just

111
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,120
says you're always trying to flow down gradients established by these surprises, these prediction

112
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,080
errors that's quantified by the free energy. And that's a really nice, or that has a very nice

113
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:53,680
interpretation. Because mathematically, this surprise is the negative of what statisticians

114
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:01,120
would call log evidence. It is a quantity that measures the goodness of your model,

115
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,440
of the negative of this goodness of your model, which is simply the probability of my sensations

116
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,200
given a model of how I think those sensations were generated. So this is exactly the same kind

117
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,400
of generative model you'd find in generative AI or say large language models and the like.

118
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:31,280
So that sort of gives you a theological gloss on this free energy minimizing process.

119
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,880
There's just a way of describing self-organizing systems that have this particular capacity

120
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,560
to organize themselves and resist this entropic dissipation on dissolution, decay and death.

121
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,600
And you can describe this as effectively looking as if they're trying to maximize the evidence

122
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:58,000
for their models of the world. So this can either be read as basically gathering evidence from my

123
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,160
own existence if I am a model of my lived world, also in philosophy by nicely denoted

124
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,680
self-evidencing. So it's a special kind of self-organization that can be read

125
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,280
as self-evidencing in the sense of gathering evidence from the way I think my world works

126
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,200
and how I operate within that world. So those would be two sort of perspectives on the same

127
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,880
phenomenon. Yeah, it's wonderful. Thank you. That's a great summation. And we're going to dive

128
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,440
into this and we're going to slice this up in many different ways. But one thing that I haven't

129
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,640
heard and I've listened to many of your podcast interviews and watched some of your presentations

130
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,840
and read your papers. What I haven't heard yet is what is the origin story of the free energy

131
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:50,720
principle? How did this all come together for you? I know you have a long history in the field,

132
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:58,640
but was there an aha moment or a eureka moment at some point? When did this kind of all start to

133
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:05,600
come together? What was the origin of this idea? Well, I think the first thing to say

134
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,920
in response to that question is that this idea has been around for, if not millennia, certainly centuries

135
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:20,480
and has been increasingly formalized and simplified. So there could be many starting

136
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,000
points to this story and each will have their precedent. So this is a legacy and a legacy of

137
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,960
what? Well, you could argue it's a legacy of ideas proposed by Helmholtz and refined by psychologists

138
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:40,640
like Richard Gregory, notions of analysis by synthesis and all sorts of the brain as a

139
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,600
constructive organ, statistical organ and trying to make sense of its world that you'll find in

140
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,800
the 20th century. Ideas which were taken up to great effect in machine learning by people like

141
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:58,000
Jeffrey Hinton and Peter Diane, they actually invented a Helmholtz machine that had this sort of

142
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:08,160
this Bayesian mechanics under the hood, borrowing from another legacy left by Richard Feynman,

143
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,000
which was the technical, resolving the technical differences of doing this kind of

144
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,720
this kind of inference, hence the variation of free energy that he brought to the table

145
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:27,840
in the context of quantum electrodynamics. Personally, it all started to make a lot more

146
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:36,800
sense when reading the work of people like Raj Rao and Dana Ballard. That story was a

147
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,800
predictive coding story, but it transpired that this was just another way of telling the same

148
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,120
story, but you are using a slightly different rhetoric. So the prediction errors in predictive

149
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:55,920
coding just are a measure of free energy under certain simplifying assumptions. But the key insight

150
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,680
in the late 90s was that exactly the same objective function could be used to describe

151
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,080
both perception in the spirit of predictive processing as championed by people like Andy

152
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:18,880
Clark and predictive coding, but also the learning, the updates to connection strengths

153
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,400
of the kind that you'd find in machine learning, but also you find natural intelligence and

154
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:33,200
experience dependency in the brain. The thing that I found particularly intriguing was that

155
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,760
if you just stood back and I repeat, so looked at this through the lens of a physicist,

156
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,240
you could also explain all of action through minimizing exactly the same quantity.

157
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:53,440
So bit by bit, everything that needed to be explained sort of fell into the camp of

158
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,640
it's just minimizing free energy. And everywhere you looked, everything could suddenly be very

159
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:06,000
simply explained in terms of minimizing free energy, attention, and even in the past few years,

160
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,160
your natural selection is just another free energy minimizing process. So this is,

161
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,160
I haven't really answered your question in this period which we've asked because

162
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:24,720
there was no one moment. But every few years, I certainly get a nice aha, oh, it's just another

163
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:33,120
instance of minimizing free energy. And then you write a paper usually using numerical simulations

164
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,600
with a bit of analysis to say, well, this is another way of looking at it. And it looks very

165
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,840
much like this kind of thing. Because it's all, if you like, a reflection of the same fundamental

166
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:50,720
process of self-organization. Can you give us a sense of, I guess, the scope of this discovery?

167
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,040
So as far as I understand it, it explains, you know, process of dynamic happening in the brain,

168
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,800
which is the most complex object that we know of in the universe. What is the simplest scale?

169
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:10,960
What is the smallest, say, dynamic or thing that would adhere to this principle? Does that make

170
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,840
sense? Like, basically, what is this principle start? Yeah. Yeah, no, I just wanted to interrupt

171
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,680
to congratulate you on the question because that's the second focus of many colleagues

172
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,800
in vertical biology and physics. So I'm thinking here, people like Mike Levin and Chris Fields

173
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,800
and Jim Glazebrook. So that is, that's absolutely key, I think, that notion. It does this apply

174
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,360
to a particular thing? Or does it apply to everything? And if it applies to everything,

175
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,560
what scale does it apply? And does it apply at every scale? And the answer should be,

176
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,040
it's scale invariant, and it applies to everything, literally. And that sort of

177
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,120
perspective is being championed, I repeat, by my colleagues, Mike, Jim, and Chris,

178
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,840
in the context of quantum information theory, on the one side, on the point of view of physics.

179
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:12,480
But on the other side, there's this story, which I think is very nicely articulated by Chris Fields,

180
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,200
it is time to remove the bright lines between physics, biology and psychology. They're all

181
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,000
just the same thing. And you get this notion of basal cognition, which is something I think Mike

182
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,440
Levin has brought to the table, that all self-organization can be read as this kind of basic

183
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,920
sentence, this sort of basal cognition, that is just a reflection of the existence of things.

184
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,640
And this may sound a little bit like an overstatement, but the interpretation

185
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,520
of self-organization, in terms of the interpretation of self-organization as self-evident thing,

186
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:59,360
is a relatively straightforward consequence of the individuation of anything from the rest

187
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:08,800
of the universe. And this separation appeals to what is now a little literature on Markov

188
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,080
Blankets, in this particular context. So the Markov Blanket is just a definition of

189
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,760
thingness, where you start with the notion, okay, I want to explain the states of something.

190
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,440
And then you ask, well, what's a thing? Now, maybe you have to appeal to

191
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,920
scrolling and formulation of boundaries. Can you explain what goes on within the boundaries

192
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,880
of living things? And of course, as soon as you say that, you realize it's the boundary that's

193
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,520
the important structure that allows you to individuate something from everything else or no thing.

194
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:52,640
And indeed, if you just then look back with that view on what you learned at school,

195
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,000
in terms of physics, you suddenly realize how important that boundary is,

196
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,480
let's say the heat path in physics, for example. So wherever you look, there's this crucial notion

197
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:13,280
of a separation, an individuation, and simply by thinking carefully and articulating formally

198
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,360
how you would define that boundary. There is, if you like, a partial separation from

199
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,600
states on the inside of something and states on the outside of something.

200
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,400
But there's a two-way traffic across this blanket or this boundary, this Markov boundary.

201
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,120
And this two-way traffic enables you now to describe the internal dynamics or dynamics on the

202
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:45,040
inside as holding beliefs about probabilistic subpersonal beliefs about the outside. And it is

203
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:52,720
that that enables you then to assign this free energy functional to belief structures in the brain.

204
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,680
And you can do this for anything. You can do this for a droplet of oil. You can do it for a virus.

205
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,520
You can do it for a person. You can do it. In fact, I've just signed off on a wonderful paper

206
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:15,280
by my colleagues, Saugir and Lanceter Costa, where they've actually applied it to the biosphere.

207
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,920
So the same maths unfolds. Once you've identified the separation of something from anything else,

208
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:30,320
you just apply this mechanics as Bayesian mechanics. And then you can interpret the

209
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:37,120
self-organisation in terms of sense-making and self-evidencing and an implicit or a description

210
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:44,240
of that sense-making in terms of belief updating by minimising this surprise or maximising this

211
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:53,360
Bayesian model evidence. So it can be applied to single cells or it can be applied to the biosphere.

212
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,120
So it should apply to everything. And Saugir, that's what Chris Fields would say,

213
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,880
at what level of analysis then it comes to quantum information theoretic applications of the emission.

214
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,080
Yeah, that's fascinating. I'm familiar with Chris Fields' work. I've read some of his research

215
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,960
and actually spoke with Michael Levin a few weeks ago. I interviewed him. Yeah, we actually covered,

216
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,000
I mean, in great detail, one of his papers, I think it was 2019 paper called the Computational

217
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Boundary of the Self. I don't know if you happen to see that, but he has this visual cognitive

218
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,760
light cones, sort of the boundary, the assumed boundary of nested cells, let's say, all going

219
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,520
all the way down to the cell. Say the cell, then you have ants, then ant colony, and it sort of,

220
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,160
he brings up just fascinating ideas around collective intelligence. All intelligence is

221
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,320
being collective and stuff like that. So yeah, a little bit, those things I'm quite a little

222
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,480
bit familiar with. So it's great that you could call them out. Can you define, one thing would be

223
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,600
great to get some definitions down. Can you define free energy? So I believe in a thermodynamic sense,

224
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,320
it's the amount of available energy for a system to do work, because a simpler, perhaps one of the

225
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,040
simpler definitions for it, is that applied in the same way in your free energy principle?

226
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah, again, an excellent question. Yes and no. So the functional form of the variational free energy,

227
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,560
and that's why I tend to say the variational free energy, so that we do not misinterpret it as a

228
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:33,520
thermodynamic free energy. The functional forms are identical, and they inherit from the same kind

229
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:42,400
of physics and probability institute dynamics. However, thermodynamic free energy is, I think,

230
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:50,720
a very particular application of this kind of mechanics to certain systems. So it is, you know,

231
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,600
I think, from the point of view of, you know, so somebody is not a physicist, I think it's

232
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:04,960
important to say that the variational free energy is an information theoretic measure. It has no

233
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,440
commitments to joules or Boltzmann's constants or anything of that nature. So it's very much like

234
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:20,640
a statistical measure, like you're a variance or an average or an entropy. So the free energy has

235
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:29,280
a free energy is just defined effectively in terms of a relative entropy, or sometimes known as a

236
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:40,080
KL divergence, and a constraint or an internal energy. So the variational free energy is talking

237
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,680
about probability distributions, it's talking about information, and crucially it's talking about

238
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:54,080
information about things. And then we come back to the central foundations of the Markov blanket,

239
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,040
and separating the inside from the outside. So the whole point of the free energy principle

240
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:06,720
is that you can interpret the inside states as holding information or probabilistic beliefs

241
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,920
about outside states. So this is, if you like, something quite fundamentally different from

242
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,720
Shannon information on the surprise of finding the brain in this state. So the brain will have

243
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:25,280
two kinds of free energy, it'll have a variational free energy, which is a comment about its goodness

244
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:32,000
of fit or its beliefs about what's going on outside, which a statistician would understand,

245
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,320
but it will also have a dynamic free energy in terms of the actual metabolism and electrochemical

246
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:49,520
signalling, and the metabolic states of the world that requires a further commitment to, I repeat,

247
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:57,920
sort of interpreting certain quantities, you know, for the amplitude of random fluctuations in terms

248
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:04,640
of thermal constructs, and applying things like Boltzmann's constant to it. So there is a difference,

249
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:13,840
you know, between the two. Having said that, I think that difference is specious on two counts.

250
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:21,760
First of all, you know, taking again a Feynman-esque point of view, information is energy and energy

251
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,720
is information. And at the level of analysis that we're talking about, you know, a thermodynamic

252
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,280
interpretation is just another interpretation. You don't need to start self-organization

253
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,480
if you wanted to talk to a sort of business system, the 19th or 20th century will be useful,

254
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:48,640
but it's not necessary. Another, the other point is if you did talk to that kind of thermodynamic

255
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,800
person, then you would find that there is a, that these free energies share the same minimum.

256
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:07,520
There is a necessary thermodynamic cost to any variational free energy minimization or

257
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,040
belief updating by things like that was principle. So there is a physics which really binds these

258
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:21,040
two things together. The final point of contact, or perhaps the final, you know, some of your

259
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,320
more technical viewers, the free energy principle that we're talking about can be

260
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:33,040
regarded as dual to James's maximum entropy principle. So James's maximum entropy principle

261
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:41,520
basically says that the universe or anything in the game of measuring anything else

262
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:50,800
will conform to the principle of a maximum entropy and the constraints. And those constraints

263
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,880
are what are supplied by the generative model that generates the predictions that are necessary to

264
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:05,440
provide the surprise. So the surprise part, the internal energy part of the free energy principle

265
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,840
is that which rests upon or is defined in terms of our world models, our generative models.

266
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,200
So we come back to this notion of what is a free energy? Well, it's an internal energy

267
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,920
minus an entropy. So where you want to minimize your free energy, you're going to maximize your

268
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,680
entropy in a chord which changes its maximum entropy principle, but under constraints that

269
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,840
you're trying to minimize the internal energy. And that internal energy just is a surprise that

270
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:38,240
we were talking about before. So on that view, I think there's a deep connection between

271
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:45,760
a certain kind of free energy in physics, but it would have to be a Jamesian kind of free energy.

272
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,760
What is the kind of free energy you did at school when you boiled in water, like?

273
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,320
Sure, yes. Okay, it's so interesting. And actually, you bring up William James' maximum entropy

274
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,240
principle, something that I learned about listening to one of your lectures, because I believe you

275
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,000
said, I think it's a quote, if I have no preferences at all, then my best bet is to keep options open.

276
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,160
So it's a bit of, so that's like the non-technical kind of layman's way to look at it,

277
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,480
which I hadn't thought of before. And I was actually thinking, and it's one of the questions that I

278
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,800
have for you, and it's something that I think is really interesting about this principle is that,

279
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:30,160
please correct me if I'm wrong or fill in here, the preferences are built into the

280
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:39,840
Bayesian beliefs. Is that correct? Yes, you've immediately gone into a much more glorious world

281
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,400
of preferences and purpose and plan of intentions. Yeah, I'm sorry, we can go there later if you

282
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:51,280
want, because it's a great place to be. But just at the moment, we've just been talking about

283
00:28:51,280 --> 00:29:01,920
self-organization, self-evidencing, but what you've done is really speak to the active part of this.

284
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:10,960
So you're just to set the scene. When you look at certain kinds of systems, and specifically

285
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,520
systems that have very precise internal dynamics, so the random fluctuations are suppressed, or at

286
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,960
least at the scale of observation that you might want to apply, that all the random fluctuations

287
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:30,320
are averaged away. But these kinds of systems, basically systems like you and me, but not

288
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,920
systems that are very, very small and very, very hot thermodynamically, that would have

289
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,840
lots of random fluctuations. But if you get a big enough system like you and me,

290
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:50,640
then it is the case that the solution or the variational principles that have to be in play

291
00:29:51,280 --> 00:30:02,640
in order for this separation to persist, separation of self from non-self to be in play,

292
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:12,080
and you apply it to the way that you act upon the world, then you can describe this in terms of

293
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,320
minimizing the free energy that you would expect if you pursued this course of action.

294
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,040
It's at that point, I think you get notions of preferences and how you could interpret

295
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:32,640
this expected surprise. Very much as we said before, the one way of reading expected surprise

296
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:40,720
just is in terms of entropy. But there's another way of avoiding surprises, which is just to avoid

297
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:49,440
surprising outcomes, which means complying with the constraints that were implicit in

298
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,160
James's constraint maximum principle. The complement of avoiding surprising outcomes

299
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:02,960
is that it looks as if I am always acting in a way that convinces preferred outcomes,

300
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,040
outcomes that just are the characteristic states that define the kind of states that you'd find

301
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:16,480
the inner. I think you're absolutely right that these prior preferences are just a way of articulating

302
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:29,520
the typical or characteristic states that define who I am. You can either put a teleology on that

303
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,320
and say, oh, this thing is behaving as if it prefers to be in these states. It's actively

304
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:43,920
choosing these causes of action, these paths into the future. The result that those consequences

305
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,720
are that you end up in your preferred states. On the physicist's point of view,

306
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,320
you start off with a system that seems to be able to occupy these preferred characteristic states

307
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:05,280
and then you work out what dynamics must these systems have. That's the deflation part of the

308
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,480
free energy principle. It's just a description of things that have preferred states effectively,

309
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,840
and these preferred states are literally the attracting set that constitutes the pullback

310
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,000
attractor that was mentioned before. You're absolutely right in one sense that these

311
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,960
preferences are part of Bayesian beliefs, but that does, if you like, commit you to a

312
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,880
rather teleological interpretation of the energy principle. You don't have to do that.

313
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,560
You can't do that. You don't have to do that. Please forgive my ignorance here, because I might

314
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,800
shrug my hand a little bit here, but is the brain trying to minimize free energy

315
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,880
because it's trying to use as much of it as possible? I know it's trying to minimize surprise

316
00:32:51,440 --> 00:33:00,400
uncertainty, but I imagine something like a resourceful, greedy brain. Is the minimization

317
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:08,960
of free energy sort of like the byproduct? Is this a downstream effect, or is it the real pump

318
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,760
that's moving the water along? Does that make sense? It makes sense. In a sense, it's exactly the

319
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,320
question which I try to intimate. There are two completely contradictory answers to, so if you're

320
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:32,640
talking to a physicist, I know there's no sort of pump here. There's no aspirations to deploy my

321
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,000
free energy in the most efficient way. It's just that's what systems do. Systems just settle down

322
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,320
to a free energy minimum. That's another way. Those systems that settle down to an attractor

323
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,600
set them to their free energy minimum, that is their definitional attribute, the stipulation,

324
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:58,240
that is what things are. So it is no surprise that when you describe their dynamics, they'll

325
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,400
look as if they're trying to minimize their free energy, because that's what defines them.

326
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:08,400
But if you now talk to a biologist or a psychologist, then your description is perfectly

327
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:15,600
out. It will look as if these systems, particularly systems like you and me,

328
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:26,000
are actively trying to minimize a surprise in a resourceful way. I would actually frame that more

329
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,720
in terms of in a very efficient way. So if you go to Wikipedia and you say, well, free energy is

330
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,840
the amount of energy available to do work, I mean, that's a thermodynamic interpretation.

331
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,680
I don't think it's quite necessary to put that out of all the size things in quite a

332
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,760
but it certainly, I think, would be

333
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:05,360
you would be perfectly licensed just to interpret various parts or decompose

334
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:11,520
variation of free energy. And as for what would it look like if we just focused on this particular

335
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,760
part or that particular part? I think one really interesting decomposition of

336
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,600
variation of free energy is that which a statistician would usually appeal to. And that's

337
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:34,320
basically accuracy minus complexity, where accuracy is effectively how accurate your

338
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,360
predictions of the world are, how good is your explanation of these sensory data, or if you're

339
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,400
a statistician, sort of your empirical data that they're trying to make sense of.

340
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:52,000
The other thing, the complexity, I think, is even more interesting. So in the same way you were

341
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,640
talking about before, keeping your options open and maximizing your entropy in accord with James's

342
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,920
maximum entropy principle, the same sort of Occam's like principle emerges in terms of this

343
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,120
complexity term. So the complexity is just a way of lumping together part of the internal energy

344
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,560
with the entropy to give you this relative entropy or this KL divergence. And then to put

345
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:25,840
this very simply, what it measures is effectively the degree to which some sensory data or some

346
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:32,240
sensations or some sensory evidence changes your mind. So if you're trying to describe this as a

347
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:39,600
statistician, this is the degree to which you move from your state of privilies to your state of

348
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:46,480
posterior beliefs. So it's degrees of freedom you're using up in terms of providing an accurate

349
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:55,520
account of your data. And it is this that is minimized. Remember, free energy equals accuracy

350
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,920
minus complexity. So, well, actually it's going to be around negative free energy is equal to

351
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,320
accuracy minus complexity. So as you're minimizing the free energy, you're also, you're trying to

352
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,200
maximize the accuracy, but at the same time you minimize the complexity. So this is where

353
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:18,880
I think you get what you're alluding to. You're trying to accurately navigate the world

354
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,560
in the most efficient way possible using up the least resources. But why do I say resource as well?

355
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,760
Because of this link between the information and energy, you're afforded by things like

356
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,880
the Jinsky equality and the Handao's principle. It costs energy to change your mind. It costs energy

357
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:48,160
to create and well, to destroy information. So that complexity is also a cost. Technically,

358
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:55,600
it's also an information game, but it's also a complexity cost. So what it looks as if

359
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:03,360
a brain of this kind would be in the game of updating itself, changing its biophysical

360
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:12,000
state in a way to make predictions that are as accurate as possible, whilst at the same time

361
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,240
complying with complexity constraints. So do it in the most parsimonious way that it can. So hence

362
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:27,680
Occam's principle. So that would also translate into the most energetically efficient way of

363
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:37,680
making sense of the world. And if you sort of unpack that principle in terms of computation

364
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,960
in silico, then what that tells you is that the good computers are those computers that work on

365
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,800
the edge very cheaply with small amounts of electricity. They're doing it very in the simplest

366
00:38:50,800 --> 00:39:00,400
way possible with a cool head, literally. So these are really interpretations of, if you like,

367
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,040
unpacking the terms that go into a variational free energy and making sense of them. And I think

368
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,480
that's exactly what should be done. It's a wonderful game. And you could also repeat that

369
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:19,520
game in terms of the expected free energy. So now you have expected accuracy and expected complexity.

370
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,480
And when you look at the functional forms of these terms, you suddenly see things that people have

371
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:32,640
been dealing with and optimizing for nearly a century. So for example, the expected accuracy

372
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:42,320
or the negative expected accuracy is just the ambiguity or the negative precision

373
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:50,640
that would be used to explain an efficient sampling of the world of the kind that you might find in

374
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,880
the visual cortex and the organization of the visual brain. The expected complexity becomes risk

375
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:05,920
of the kind you'd find in economics. It is basically the distance I move from my prior beliefs

376
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,000
if I pursued this course of action. And of course, we've just said that the prior beliefs

377
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:15,840
about the consequences of action are our preferences. They describe our attracting

378
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:23,680
set of preferred states. So now the expected complexity, the risk, is just scoring the degree

379
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:30,720
to which I expect to be displaced from my third states of being probabilistically speaking.

380
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,920
We just measure that with the KL divergence on the relative entropy. So that's, you know, that's

381
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:44,080
bread and butter for many economists. Another way of, if you're like unpacking or rearranging the

382
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:58,000
terms is in terms of what is referred to as expected information gain and expected cost. So

383
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:08,720
those two components are exactly those things that you find in the two aspects of being base

384
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:16,640
optimal. So there are two ways of being base optimal. One way is to minimize your expected cost

385
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:23,120
or maximize your expected utility or valuable log preferences. And that's the kind of base

386
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,840
option you'd find in Bayesian decision theory. And you can look at that as grandfathering things

387
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:34,080
like reinforcement learning and utility theory. On the other hand, though, you've got this sort of

388
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:39,760
again, this sort of, it's not ambiguity, it's ambiguity with bells on, which is the expected

389
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:46,480
information gain. And that was exactly the objective function devised at the inception

390
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,680
of the principles of optimum Bayesian design. So if you have the problem of designing an experiment

391
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,880
that's going to yield some data, and you now ask yourself the question, what's the best kind of

392
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,040
experiment I could possibly design that will give me the kind of information that's going to resolve

393
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,040
the most uncertainty about hypothesis? What's going to maximize the expected information gain?

394
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:18,000
And it is exactly that quantity, that part, that epistemic value, this measure of the resolution

395
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:23,680
of uncertainty that defines Bayes' optimality in the context of experimental design.

396
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,280
That may seem a little bit sort of unconnected to you and me in conversation or just walking down

397
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,960
the road. But of course, we are experiment, we are actively experimenting all the time,

398
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:41,360
just by looking around. The way that we move our eyes, the category every 250 milliseconds,

399
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,720
every little act of this kind is an experiment. So we come back now to the notion of Richard

400
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,800
Gregory, that perception just is hypothesis testing. What's the experimentation? It's just

401
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,080
palpating the world in the right kind of way to get that kind of information that's going to resolve

402
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:04,800
the most expected surprise or the most uncertainty. And you can have that at the level of

403
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:14,000
visual palpation every four times a second, or the news channels that you would afford epistemic

404
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:23,280
trust, which is probably quite a hot issue. Or the kind of, whether you've got a Wikipedia,

405
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:35,760
who would you consult? We make choices all the time in terms of what's the best way to act,

406
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:43,120
and what are the, what this notion of expected free energy brings to the table is that there are

407
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:52,480
the imperatives of a dual aspect, this pragmatic aspect that is formally this expected cost,

408
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,720
where the cost of the negative or the surprise in relation to my preferred states of being.

409
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,640
But also, to my mind, even more important is this epistemic part, this sort of expected

410
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,280
information gain that actually makes us all little scientists of one sort or another.

411
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,400
Yeah, that's incredible. I'm glad I'm recording this conversation, because I'm going to have to

412
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,680
listen to that a few times over to fully pull together all the pieces, because there's so much

413
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,320
there. I actually found this when I was doing research on the free energy principle that I was

414
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,520
going off and finding definitions for things, because to bring it all together is, well,

415
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,560
it's amazing that it incorporates so many different ideas from different disciplines.

416
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,920
I mean, you have your neuroscience, but you also have information theory. I mean, it's

417
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,600
physics, you know, you have all these different things that you're pulling together

418
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,600
and finding these deep truths that I think are fascinating.

419
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,720
Well, it's nice you said that, because that's exactly what Chris Fields wants. He wants to

420
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:56,640
sort of physics, psychology, biology, they're all the same thing. And again, you know,

421
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,360
when I was trying to answer your question, when was the harm moment? There really wasn't one, but

422
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:09,120
every few months you say, oh, that's just one of those. So to my mind, in a sense,

423
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:17,760
it is that capacity to accommodate very gracefully things that definitely have worked in the past,

424
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,680
that haven't been framed in this sort of simplifying, sort of unifying framework. It's that

425
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:30,480
capacity which lends the free energy principle of a veracity and a utility that you continually

426
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,880
impresses me, that when you were able to articulate something that's endured for

427
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,640
centuries or at least decades, that we all use in work, and that in terms of our understanding,

428
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:48,240
and suddenly fits in with the free energy principle, that to my mind is a reflection

429
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:54,320
of the utility of the free energy principle, but also interestingly, it means that the free

430
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:59,200
energy principle is conforming to itself. So if you remember, the whole point of the free energy

431
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,120
principle is finding accurate explanations as simple as possible. So it should provide a simple

432
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:16,800
explanation for everything. That's its foundational premise. So you shouldn't really be surprised

433
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:23,840
that you can do economics and move forward with learning. Yeah, one of your my favorite papers

434
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:29,840
is yours. I think it's the free energy principle made as simple as possible, but no simpler,

435
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,360
I think is the title, or it's close. I'll link to that in the description for folks who want to

436
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,760
read that. I may have butchered that title, sorry, but it's close.

437
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,400
It was Einstein's famous quote. Yes, it's from Einstein, yeah.

438
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,520
I even found that I didn't know this, but there's a great little article in Wikipedia called

439
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,640
the principle of simplicity. So there's actually people like Nick Chaitre and colleagues

440
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:02,080
have found this formalization of what comes principle. I think the free energy principle

441
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:08,480
could also be read as a dual to that kind of imperative to find the simple minimally complex

442
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:15,520
explanations for stuff. So I'd love to, I'll just focus somewhere in time on surprise,

443
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:23,120
the idea of surprise. It's central to this theory. And correct me if I'm wrong. So we're

444
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,360
trying to minimize surprise or slash uncertainty, right? Does the system want

445
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,680
zero surprise, precisely zero surprise? Or that might be, I imagine that might be impossible,

446
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:40,640
actually. So is it trying to approach zero? Is that optimally, is that better? Does that make

447
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:47,440
sense? It does, but again, you're, you're, you're asking as a, as a biologist, not a physicist.

448
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,520
I'll keep mixing that too, sorry.

449
00:47:53,680 --> 00:48:00,960
But there is a lovely paradox here. The notice we've been saying in the past exchange that we are

450
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:08,400
compelled if we exist as certain kinds of things that have these very precise internal dynamics

451
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:16,880
to maximize information gain. So we are compelled to seek out novel novelty. We are compelled to

452
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:26,320
seek out surprising informative, informative outcomes, which needs to be contrasted with

453
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,520
what you've just brought to the table, which is the underlying, the underlying imperative really

454
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:38,400
is that of homeostasis to minimize surprise. So you've got this interesting dialectic here,

455
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:46,160
which just falls out of the maths, that in the service of trying to minimize my surprise to

456
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:53,360
maintain my homeostatic to keep myself within these, within these attracting sets that have a

457
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:58,800
low entropy. Remember that the entropy is just the average surprise. So if I spend my life minimizing

458
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:06,160
surprise, I am by definition, when averaged over time, minimizing my entropy, this minimizing

459
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:12,720
that's the other number of surprising physiological and mental and emotional states that I experience

460
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:21,360
during that period of time. But to do that, I have to actually go and minimize, maximize my

461
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:28,400
expensive information gain. So I'm going to look as if I'm actually very curious. So part of keeping

462
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:36,240
my home, keeping myself out of unfulfilled states and minimizing surprise, which you can

463
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:43,040
read as like this prediction error, for example, part of underwriting my capacity to minimize my

464
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:50,480
prediction error is actually to go and seek out surprising or apparently surprising outcomes.

465
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,280
So I will, I will be quintessentially curious, I will be sensation seeking,

466
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,880
I will be wanting to answer, it'll look as if I'm going to want to answer the question,

467
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:09,760
what would happen if I did that? So it is, you know, when you say we all want to minimize surprise,

468
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:17,760
we certainly want to avoid surprising sensations. Yes, you know, no deception underwrites our,

469
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:24,000
you know, beliefs about being in pain, for example, being very cold, being very poor,

470
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,480
being very unloved, being dead. You know, these are all very surprising states of being,

471
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:36,240
which we will in the moment avoid. But that does not mean to say that we will not seek out

472
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:45,280
those outcomes that can have, have information. So we're still very, very curious. And I say that

473
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,760
at length, because there was an interesting philosophical paradox called the dark room

474
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,880
paradox that was brought to the table around the inception of the free energy principle

475
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,760
in neurophilosophy. And it went along the following, well, perhaps you know this,

476
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,960
you probably know this better than I do, do you want to tell, tell your viewers what it was?

477
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,080
No, I wish I did, I'm sorry, I don't know about it.

478
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,960
It's a very commonsensical argument, but if it's the case, you want to minimize surprise,

479
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,440
why don't you just go into a dark room, turn off the lights, lie down, stay there forever.

480
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,000
Okay, that's kind of an idea, question ahead, why not just jump off a cliff, right? That's,

481
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,280
you'll know, the surprise will be over and then that'll, yeah, for extreme, but.

482
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:34,560
Yes, it's interesting that. So why don't we do that? And yet we go bungee jumping.

483
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:43,440
This is interesting. Yeah, let's go. Jumping off cliffs and bungee jumping are, you know,

484
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,560
they should be explainable under the free energy principle. And of course there's a crucial,

485
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,600
there's a crucial difference between the bungee jump and the jumping over a cliff.

486
00:51:54,320 --> 00:52:00,720
But to come out to the dark room problem, I repeat, it's just the paradox that why don't surprise

487
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:09,920
minimizing machines or artifacts or systems basically sequester themselves from their environment

488
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:15,440
and close their eyes or turn the lights off and remove themselves from any particularly

489
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:21,440
surprising sensations. And the answer to that, well, there are a number of different answers

490
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,640
depending upon how seriously you take the question. Well, less serious answer is, well,

491
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,680
that's exactly what I do every day when I go to bed. So it's not quite that surprising.

492
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,160
Interesting. Yeah, that's a good counter. Yeah.

493
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:41,040
But, you know, ignoring the fact that we do need some downtime. And there are good reasons for

494
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,880
that, which come back to this separation of free energy into accuracy and complexity.

495
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,640
But more importantly, the first thing I do when I go into a dark room, imagine, you know,

496
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,520
you're at a conference and you go back to your hotel room and the lights don't work in your hotel

497
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:03,200
room because you can't find the switch. So, you know, what tells you first of all, the first thing

498
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,880
you do, you and I would do as free energy minimising creatures in the future, minimising the expected

499
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:15,120
free energy, maximising my expected information gain, it's a turn on the light. That's the first

500
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:23,280
thing that any free energy minimising system would do. And the second thing that that little

501
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:29,440
analogy tells you is that if you can't find the light, you just kind of feel your way around.

502
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:37,600
So, again, this is exploration, this curiosity that is coming to the imperative to resolve uncertainty.

503
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:44,000
Remembering that uncertainty is average surprise. So, in resolving uncertainty, you are minimising

504
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:51,280
your expected surprise. But this is about outcomes in the future that are not yet witnessed. So,

505
00:53:51,360 --> 00:54:02,240
again, when you talk about things I do, then you are now talking about the imperatives that

506
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:08,640
underlie action upon the world and the consequences that live in the future. And in those instances,

507
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:15,280
it's all about minimising uncertainty. When you're talking about things, you know,

508
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,560
my states of being, surprise, it's just a measure of my state of being, it's just a likelihood of

509
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:30,720
these sensations given my model, my predictions of the sensations at this point in time. So,

510
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:36,160
they're fundamentally different ways of using the notion of surprise. I hope that makes sense. It's

511
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,920
probably a little bit over answered. I've over shared. No, no, it's great. That was useful. I mean,

512
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:48,000
it is something that I think that's why I wanted to remain at this, on this topic, on this level,

513
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,120
because it is, I think, the area where I still still have the hardest time

514
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:01,680
intuiting the difference between information gain and minimising surprise. Those two things,

515
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:08,400
they seem counter, or they seem like, you know, you can't have both, right? But I think it's

516
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:15,280
partly perhaps a problem of language in terms of like assigning a positive or negative valence

517
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,280
to the term surprise. So, something like, like an example, so I was thinking about this the other

518
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,360
day, if you won the lottery, if you had a winning lottery ticket, right, you won $100 million,

519
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:33,360
that's extremely surprising, and also very good, right? But it seemed to be counter to

520
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:39,520
minimising surprise, right? So, but I think it's a difference of scale, perhaps, like,

521
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:47,600
it's like the difference between perhaps the overall model and a particular event within

522
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:52,720
that model, you know, you know, perhaps using that example, could you possibly help

523
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,200
help me into it, sort of the difference in where, or these tensions kind of resolve?

524
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,520
Well, I think you've identified, well actually, it's a wonderful, let's talk about winning the

525
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,760
lottery, which is very surprising. Yes, I left you some day.

526
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:20,880
But also, I think just to reiterate what you implicitly just said, that, you know,

527
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:28,800
the word surprise is applied to many different constructs, sometimes more anthropomorphic and

528
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:37,360
sometimes less. So, when surprise is used in the context of the free energy principle or

529
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:44,960
and mathematically, it has a very specific and very deflationary meaning, it's just the

530
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:54,480
negative log probability of some data given your model of how those data were caused. So,

531
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:01,920
it's a measure of the implausibility of getting these data given a particular commitment to how

532
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,240
you think these data were generated. So, I repeat, it's probably best thought of as a

533
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:13,200
prediction error, you know, I've got some outcome, and I had a prediction of that outcome,

534
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:18,560
and the surprise is just the measure of the mismatch or the distinction, discrepancy between

535
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:27,760
my prediction and what I actually observed. This is also known as the prival, a l, an information

536
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:35,920
theory, a term coined by Tribus. More formally, more generically, it's also called self-information.

537
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:43,600
It's just a negative log probability of an event conditioned upon the model or the context in which

538
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:51,840
that event occurred. So, I think that's, if I was talking to, you know, students of

539
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:56,400
physics or information theory, I wouldn't use the word surprise, I'd use self-information because

540
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:04,320
immediately they know that the expected self-information is entropy of a Shannon sort.

541
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:11,280
So, when I talk about minimizing self-information, I'm using that as a shorthand that's saying,

542
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:20,320
I'm trying to describe systems that resist a tendency to dispersion of their states. So,

543
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:27,200
notice that this is, again, because it can be very confusing, again, this is, if you like,

544
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,600
almost the opposite of James's maximum entropy principle, and there's a reason for that because

545
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:38,400
what we're talking about here is the entropy, the average self-information or the average surprise

546
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:51,120
of actual outcomes, of real deterministic variables that constitute technically the

547
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:57,840
sensory states of my Markov blanket, the way that the world impresses itself upon me.

548
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:02,800
So, this has nothing to do with beliefs or probability distributions. It's the surprise

549
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:08,160
afforded this outcome, and I want to, you know, being a good homeostat to you,

550
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:15,520
cybernetics notion, I'm going to want to make sure that everything that the world impresses

551
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:21,520
upon me is within the bounds of, you know, that something like me can take, and this is just

552
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:28,480
a statement basis again. So, that kind of entropy, we're trying to minimize. So, remember before,

553
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,280
we were talking about James's maximum entropy principle, but the entropy was about the beliefs

554
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,240
about the causes. It wasn't about the actual outcomes. So, this is, again, if you like,

555
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,920
a dialectic or a paradox. On the one hand, they're trying to minimize the surprise or the

556
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:55,360
self-information of my, of the actual outcomes that the world impresses upon me, but when it comes to

557
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:04,240
the Occam's principle view of free energy minimization, I'm now going to try to maximize

558
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:10,400
the entropy of my beliefs about the causes of that. So, it is complicated, and perhaps I

559
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:19,520
won't should apologize for that. It's a little bit, it's a same kind of like dialectic that you get

560
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:25,600
into if you commit to James's maximum entropy principle as the right way of measuring things

561
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:31,440
and understanding things. Then you have to say, well, hang on a second. I thought the whole point

562
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:38,720
of biological self-organization was to resist the natural tendency to an increase in entropy.

563
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:44,720
I thought the whole point of Schrodinger's formulation of life was to minimize entropy. So,

564
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:50,160
who's right? Schrodinger or James? Well, they're both right. It's just that the entropy of the

565
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:56,800
things I talk about are completely different. James and the free energy principle are talking

566
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:06,400
about the entropy of measurements and beliefs. Schrodinger and homeostasis and syllogetics,

567
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:17,520
for example, are talking about the entropy of outcomes, of measurements, of the data that you

568
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:27,520
use to make your inferences and build your beliefs and update your beliefs. So, it's a fascinating

569
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:35,200
sort of yin and yang, and it really forces you to think about the nature of these mathematical

570
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:41,120
descriptions and to what they pertain. So, things like entropy and surprise and self-information

571
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:47,600
are just attributes of probability distributions. So, you have to say, of what? Is it the outcomes

572
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:53,520
or is it your beliefs about things? And with that sort of in mind, weighing the lottery,

573
01:01:53,520 --> 01:02:00,640
is that surprising? Well, if you imagine the probability of it happening to you being surprising,

574
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:08,400
I can see that you might think, oh, that's highly implausible. So, it's not. It is very surprising.

575
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:16,000
On the other hand, if you believe that you are the kind of lucky chap that good things happen to,

576
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,200
which you have to believe in order to actually self-evidence your way, predict your way into

577
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:25,360
being a happy chap and that good things happen to you, winning a lottery is not that surprising.

578
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:29,200
That's the kind of thing that happens to people like me. I'm a successful New Yorker.

579
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:34,160
And I wouldn't be that surprised because that's consistent. It's egocintonic.

580
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:42,320
Winning the lottery is not going to put me in a truly surprising state that if I had a car accident

581
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:49,360
or I had a stroke or my partner let me, these are truly surprising things. Winning the lottery

582
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:54,080
is not surprising because it doesn't take me out of my comfort zone, my attracting center,

583
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:00,160
my callback attractor. Furthermore, I'm not sure that this example works so well,

584
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:09,600
in practice, but certainly you can now, if you win the lottery, if you did actually win the lottery,

585
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:14,800
that actually reduces a lot of surprise in terms of what you're going to do next.

586
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:23,440
So, that puts you in a certain position with a certain attitude of ways forward and ways of

587
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:30,240
behaving, which actually resolves uncertainty about whether you're going to be able to pay these

588
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,880
bills, whether you're going to be able to support an elderly relative, whether you're going to be

589
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:39,600
able to pay for your children to go to college. All of these uncertainties are exactly what

590
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:45,280
you're trying to actively resolve, but if you're very rich, a lot of those uncertainties resolve

591
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:51,040
themselves. So, that kind of, if you like, expected surprise, which is all about the surprise that

592
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:55,200
attends the things that you're going to do, is actually resolved by winning the lottery.

593
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,880
So, winning the lottery is both good of that simple level of analysis. I'm sure if you actually

594
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,320
speak to people that actually won the lottery, you probably get a very different impression,

595
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:12,240
but at least at this level of analysis, it's both good and surprise minimizing.

596
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,400
That's interesting. Right, it depends on the frame, almost the frame of reference,

597
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:24,160
which state are you looking at it at. Are you familiar? Just came to mind the other day,

598
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,160
as I was thinking about this principle. Do you ever watch The Twilight Zone?

599
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,440
Yes.

600
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:35,760
From back in the day, there's an episode called A Nice Place to Visit and Spoiler Alert for anyone

601
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:41,680
watching, but it's an old show, so if you haven't seen it by now. But basically, in the episode,

602
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:48,160
a thief, a robber dies and it goes to heaven, and they're a gambler. They like to gamble. So,

603
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:54,560
in a casino, basically, the way it works is they win every game at the casino. They're playing

604
01:04:54,560 --> 01:05:00,400
craps, they're playing blackjack, and every time they win, right? And the robber is happy. You

605
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,800
know, he's like, oh my god, this is amazing. Everything I play, it's so great. And then,

606
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:10,000
please stop me if you've seen this episode already, but for folks watching, he's happy at first,

607
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,720
but then it goes a month later and he's sitting at the table and he's bored out of his mind,

608
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:20,560
right? He's winning every time and he's just like, oh, I won again. Like, oh, why even play, right?

609
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:25,760
And maybe you think about this, I mean, maybe this is completely off, but in the fact that

610
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:31,120
there's no more surprise in the games that he's playing, right? So he's lost all of the will,

611
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:35,040
basically, to go on. And of course, at the end, you find out he's not in heaven, he's in hell,

612
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:40,320
right? He's got everything that he wanted, but it wasn't the right thing that he wanted,

613
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:44,960
sort of, you know, the lesson in the story, I guess. But maybe think about this a little bit,

614
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:52,720
because basically, the surprise is zero. And actually, all the veil, it's only a negative

615
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:58,480
outcome, really, for him. You know, he hasn't realized that the folly of his actions, you know,

616
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:04,240
there's no more hypothesis testing happening here. Every time it's the same thing and what a dull life

617
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,480
to live. And maybe think about this a little bit, and please tell me if that's anywhere close to

618
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,480
this idea. I know it's art. I know it's different. It's television, but...

619
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:19,520
No, I think that's spot on. I hadn't seen that episode. That's a marvelous, marvelous story.

620
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:28,480
I know you're absolutely right. So this is, you know, not only do you see this in psychology,

621
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:34,160
but when you start to simulate, you know, little animals minimizing their sanity, you see exactly

622
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:42,640
this kind of behavior. And as you say, it's just the fact that the expected surprise entails

623
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:54,400
the motivation to do those things that resolve uncertainty. And if you're denied the opportunity,

624
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:59,920
because there is no more uncertainty to resolve, there's no more curiosity out there. There's no

625
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:05,680
more epistemic importance. There's no more expected information gain that you expect because you know

626
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:11,440
everything. And this keeps happening the same again and again and again and again. That would be awful.

627
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:20,640
You know, when you actually simulate it, you actually can simulate little artifacts who just

628
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:27,040
get so bored. They do nothing. And certainly if you have, you know, once they attain their preferred

629
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:34,640
state, so they're maximized their expected utility or minimized their expected cost,

630
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,000
because there's nothing to shape their behavior, because there's no now reducible uncertainty

631
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,440
out there. There's no more, there's no more epistemic affordance. There's nothing to do.

632
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:51,280
They just sit there and do absolutely nothing. And that must be an awful situation to be in.

633
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:59,680
And I say that because, you know, 99% of your life is not chasing, you know, if you are a mouse,

634
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:04,720
cheese, it's not putting yourself in a position where you're going to win the lottery. It's actually

635
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:12,880
indulging in your curiosity. The very fact you're doing these podcasts, having this exchange,

636
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,880
is just an expression of the fact you are compelled to be a curious creature. So this

637
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:24,160
is part of our makeup. And if we didn't do this, then, you know, at least from a mathematical

638
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:31,120
perspective, it's highly unlikely that we would exist over an appreciable period of time. So,

639
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:36,720
yes, I hadn't seen that episode, but I love the twist that you end up in.

640
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:42,400
Yeah, he was a thief, so he deserved it.

641
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:49,600
So about the, let's see here, I'm trying to figure out where we're going to go.

642
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,280
I believe there's two ways, right, to minimize prediction error.

643
01:08:54,800 --> 01:09:00,240
They were change the model to better fit sensory input, and or change the world,

644
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:04,320
act on the world in order to better fit the prediction. But I wasn't sure, are these two

645
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:08,640
mutually exclusive? I mean, do you have to choose between the two? And if so, how does

646
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:15,360
the system decide which one to do? Right, so we're now at a sort of more elemental

647
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:21,520
application of the energy principle, just to understand the fundamental, you know,

648
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:26,480
the fundamental drives to both perception and action, and you face up beautifully. So,

649
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:35,520
if we now simplify things, and then just read surprise and free energy in the moment

650
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,320
as prediction error, then there are two ways, as you say, that I can minimize my prediction error.

651
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:45,680
I can either change my mind, so my prediction error has become more like the sensory data at hand,

652
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:52,320
or I can act upon the world to solicit some more or a different set of sensory input that are

653
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:58,240
closer to my predictions. So what would that look like? It would look as if I am basically

654
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:02,480
acting to fulfill my predictions, which is what I meant before, is that if you weren't

655
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:10,400
optimistic, successful New Yorker, if you didn't have that prior, that optimism, that sort of

656
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:19,440
optimism bias, then you wouldn't be able to act in a base optimal way, because you need

657
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:25,680
to fulfill your own predictions to survive. There's something quite fundamental about that,

658
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:33,040
but at the level I think we're talking, the kind of self-fulfilling purposes we're talking about

659
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:40,240
are very sub-personal. So all we're talking about, basically, is effectively reflexes. So,

660
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:48,320
when we move, when we talk or move our eyes, what's happening is that we're sending predictions

661
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:57,680
down to the Pontine nuclear to the spinal cord about the kind of signals we're getting from

662
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:05,360
the state of our body. Technically, it's called proprioception. And if I predict that I'm going

663
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:10,560
to be moving in a particular way, I would expect to get these signals from my muscles.

664
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:17,600
And if I don't get them, there's a prediction error. So by acting, all I mean or all that one

665
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,880
means in this setting is that you send these prediction errors back to the muscle so that

666
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:27,920
it contracts to the right length. So it sends the signals that you predicted. So this is just

667
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:39,280
like a thermostat. It's just like feedback control that we find in many, many devices.

668
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:44,880
All you need to supply is the set point, the temperature you want or the length of the muscle

669
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:51,120
you predict will happen. And then the body does the rest. So this is how a very sort of elemental

670
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:59,760
level of just moving around. You can understand action, motor action, motor being the use of

671
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:05,040
particular kinds of muscles as minimizing prediction error or minimizing free energy.

672
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:14,640
So it's not quite this more deliberative kind of action. It's not how do I imagine myself

673
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:20,960
behaving tomorrow or generally unfolding in this conversation. We're talking about action in the

674
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:26,880
moment as basically eliminating prediction errors, reflexes very, very, very quickly.

675
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,200
So in answer to your question, how do we decide which to do? And are they

676
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,440
mutually exclusive? They're certainly not mutually exclusive in the sense that the whole point

677
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:43,360
of this explanation of action and perception and the action perception cycle

678
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:50,240
is that there is a common theme. It's just all driven by minimizing prediction error

679
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:57,440
or minimizing free energy in a more general context. However, in practice, I think you're

680
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:04,080
absolutely right that we do seem to be built to switch between the two. So in principle,

681
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,920
you could do them both at the same time. In principle, you could dynamically adjust your set

682
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:14,640
points and your reflexes could try to fulfill those set points or those predictions and the

683
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:20,800
two could go hand in hand contemporaneously. But in fact, in practice, it looks as if there was

684
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:29,360
actually a turn taking. And it looks as if certainly sort of larger mammals have a very

685
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:34,480
particular schedule of turn taking. I mean, this may sound very specific, but I think it's really

686
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:41,440
interesting that it speaks to the cognitive moment. So it looks as if if we just take say vision,

687
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:51,760
then our vision, certainly active vision, where sometimes it's kind of active sensing,

688
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:59,600
where we actually have to go and palpate and select little parts of the visual scene,

689
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,920
bearing in mind, we can only actually see a very, very small part of the visual scene

690
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:10,080
without, you know, with high resolution in our familial representations. So basically,

691
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,800
although we think we can see everything, we're not, we just see little patches and we're knitting

692
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:21,120
it together in our heads. It's fantasy that I can see everything. That's not true. You could see

693
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:25,680
something if you looked over there. And that gives you the illusion that you can see everything.

694
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:31,680
In fact, you can't. So this is part of this sort of debate as a fantastic organ, having a fantasy

695
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:39,280
you can see all around me. You can't, you have to go and get the most epistemically rich,

696
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:45,680
maximize the expected information gain, arts of the visual field to knit together and to

697
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:51,760
accumulate the right kind of information that builds your hypothesis about the scene that

698
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:57,200
I'm currently constructing in my head. But this process happens very, very quickly. So we move

699
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:04,480
our eyes about four times a second. Interestingly, well, yeah, he's amazing. But it's also, well,

700
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:09,040
I've had even more amazing is that everything seems to be about four times a second. And by

701
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:12,640
everything I made, if you were a mouse, you wouldn't really be using your eyes so much,

702
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:19,360
you'd be using your whiskers as your burrows in the field. And you whisk about four times a second.

703
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:27,280
If you are talking, you produce little chunks of information called phonemes about four times

704
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:32,480
per second. When you're listening, you're listening about four times per second. When you sniff,

705
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:38,960
you sniff it about four times per second. The way that we sample, the way that we sort of

706
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:46,160
gather our information from the world, seems to have this very saltatory aspect that you're

707
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:50,880
roughly at four hertz, technically a theta rhythm. We seem to be going to sample in the

708
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:58,400
information. But even more interestingly, during the action, during the actual movement itself,

709
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:07,600
the way that you adjudicate between changing your mind and updating your, allowing your brain to

710
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12,400
revise its beliefs by changing its neural activity to provide better predictions.

711
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:21,440
During movement, you actually attenuate the consequences of that movement to enable you to

712
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:25,680
act. So this is a really interesting phenomenon called sensory attenuation.

713
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:33,680
But simply, if I had the prior belief that I was going to lift my arm,

714
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:40,240
and I didn't ignore or attenuate the prediction errors that were coming from my arm,

715
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:46,240
telling me my arm is not moving, then I wouldn't be able to lift my arm because those predictors

716
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:53,680
would come and revise my beliefs. Oh, no, my arm's not moving. But if I can ignore the sensations

717
01:16:53,680 --> 01:17:00,160
that I am going to generate, then I can use my reflexes to fulfill my predictions that my arm

718
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:07,760
is actually raising. So in order to move, I have to attenuate the prediction errors that are,

719
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:12,560
if you like, undermining my predictions. And this is called sensory attenuation.

720
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:20,160
And it's beautifully exemplified in eye movements. So if you now look at this finger,

721
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:26,640
and then it's the card to this finger, whilst you were moving,

722
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,680
saccading and moving your eyes from one finger to the other finger,

723
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:37,280
you were suppressing and attenuating all the prediction errors. I know that because you didn't

724
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:43,680
see the massive optic flow, the shift of the world induced by moving your eyes.

725
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:49,200
You can actually see it, if you press your eye, this is Helmholtz's famous experiment,

726
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:54,800
if you just gently nudge the outer edge of your eye, you'll see the world shift around.

727
01:17:55,680 --> 01:18:01,760
Huh. I don't want to push it too hard. I like being quite careful of the viewers at home,

728
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:10,080
don't poke your eye out. Okay. Yep. Can you see the world just jump around a little bit?

729
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:16,480
It does, yeah. So that's because your eyes weren't causing the motion,

730
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,800
and you were able to actually register and attend to that visual motion, that visual,

731
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,360
if you like, retinal slip. Exactly the same signals were being generated when you were

732
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:33,520
moving your eyes with your eye muscles. You didn't see that. You didn't see the world jump.

733
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:40,800
All you saw was my finger, and my finger again in a different position, the world had not moved.

734
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:47,200
So you were actually attenuating your sensory prediction errors, your visual prediction errors

735
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:53,440
during the movement. That's called saccadic suppression. It's a remarkable capacity of the

736
01:18:53,440 --> 01:19:00,400
brain to temporarily suspend attention to self, the consequences of self-generated

737
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:09,040
sensations. And this happens everywhere. It's a wonderful explanation for the phenomena

738
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:16,000
when you've got two children in the back of the car, and he hit me hard, and I hit him,

739
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:21,040
and the escalation and the argument came out absolutely right, because when they're hitting,

740
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:27,440
they attenuate the sensory information from the reports, how hard they're hitting.

741
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:35,760
So they actually feel being hit as more intense than they feel they're doing the hitting.

742
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:41,280
So they're just like a little arms race, they just ratchet up, and this is due to sensory

743
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:46,080
attenuation. You could actually use that metaphor for a political excitation.

744
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:50,080
Sure. Is that related to, I know if you've ever heard this, I actually don't know if it's technically

745
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:54,400
true. I think it is. I've tested it out. I've asked people to test this out. How you can't tickle

746
01:19:54,400 --> 01:20:02,560
yourself. Yep. Yep. The same kind of. That's a brilliant observation. So that example comes from

747
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:08,000
people like Daniel Wolpert, who I think is now actually in New York, and Sarah Jane Blakemore,

748
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:17,840
and trying to understand the remarkable, first of all, it is remarkable you can't tickle yourself

749
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:23,520
because you're attenuating the consequences of self-generated behavior. So in a sense,

750
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:30,080
the fact you can't induce visual motion by moving your own eyes with your eye muscles

751
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:35,840
is an example of that. But you can circumvent that by tickling your eye, by using something you're

752
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:41,760
not used to, which is your finger. So it is exactly that notion. You can't tickle yourself,

753
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:49,200
which explains this little experiment. It's actually devised by hell health, so you can

754
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:54,640
perform on yourself. The interesting thing is that what Sarah and colleagues and Chris

755
01:20:54,640 --> 01:21:02,320
Frith were pursuing was that people with schizophrenia have great difficulty

756
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:10,400
in this kind of sensory attenuation in another paradigm called the force-matching paradigm,

757
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:21,840
which means that people, there may be certain psychopathologies that interfere with your

758
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:29,120
ability to suspend attention to the consequences of your own actions. So for example, if you had

759
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:35,840
inner speech and you heard yourself because you were not attenuating the consequences of your

760
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:43,200
inner speech, you might then try to explain away these unattainuated auditory or pseudo auditory

761
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:49,840
inputs as if somebody else was speaking. So this is the notion that Chris Frith bought the table

762
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:58,240
as an explanation for auditory hallucinations. If you were able to sense your own movements

763
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:06,960
and were not, if you moved and you were not able to attenuate the sensations of movement,

764
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,560
it might feel as if somebody had caused your movement. So you've got this phenomenon made

765
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:19,280
acts. So there are all sorts of very quite frightening experiences that would ensue if you

766
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:25,280
failed to have this sort of turn-taking between action and perception, especially at this very,

767
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:33,760
very fast time scale. And some of these frightening consequences, one could argue,

768
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:39,600
are seen quite frequently in many guises in psychiatry and in the neurology. For example,

769
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:47,280
Parkinson's disease, an abnormality of dopaminergic neurotransmission, where dopamine in this context

770
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:57,200
is thought to affect the capacity to do this kind of sensory attenuation at a particular level

771
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:03,680
in the motor system, and therefore subverting your capacity to realise your intentions to move.

772
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:07,520
So what would that look like? Or it would look like somebody who can't initiate an act.

773
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:12,480
And that, of course, is one of the common symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

774
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:18,640
So this adjudication between acting and perceiving, quickly going out there,

775
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:22,640
moving actively, ignoring the consequences of that movement until you get there,

776
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:28,560
and then fixating, not moving, getting the information, sorting it out, doing your processing,

777
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,560
and then starting again, the cycle of action perception, where you have actually got the

778
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:40,320
separation in play, at least from a biological perspective, seems to be a sort of ubiquitous

779
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:47,360
way that we actively sense our world, or actively make sense of our world, and is very,

780
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:54,880
very reliant upon this notion of selective attention, sensory attenuation, to get that dance

781
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:02,080
between action and perception exactly right. Sure. That reminds me, if I tell you just a

782
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:06,960
personal anecdote from last summer, it was a random day, I was out on my fire escape

783
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:14,240
eating smoke meal, and, you know, I do this in some days, and all of a sudden,

784
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:22,560
there was, I live on a one-way street, but coming the opposite way was a police chase.

785
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:30,960
There was a dark SUV being chased by a cop car. And I remember the first, second, or two,

786
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:39,280
where I was looking over at what was happening, I didn't quite see the vehicles.

787
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:49,840
I saw what I can describe as like a fuzzy black cloud. It took a second or two for my brain to

788
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:56,800
catch up to what was happening, and to construct a car being chased by another car. It was very

789
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:01,280
bizarre, because I mean, it was highly unexpected, right? It just doesn't happen every day.

790
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,760
And I'm not sure if that's a common thing with people who see things that are extremely uncommon,

791
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:15,200
but I did have that, and perhaps I was just getting into sort of the perceptual science

792
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:19,760
literature and reading about the stuff, so perhaps it's hard to disentangle that from

793
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:27,280
expectations, let's say, but I mean, it really stuck with me as, you know, one, confirming,

794
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,600
although it's well-confirmed, obviously, in the science, but that this is what our brain is doing,

795
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:37,200
is constructing, you know, correcting for errors, because that's a, you know, highly uncertain,

796
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:42,720
or really surprising thing to happen, and my brain in real time took a second or two to

797
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:46,800
cohere and make that a solid, those solid objects.

798
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:54,320
Yes, well, that's a wonderful story. And, you know, as you say, I mean, it really speaks to the,

799
01:25:54,320 --> 01:26:02,480
you know, the brain as a constructive organ, as an organ that really is trying to actively

800
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:08,720
make sense of what's going on, and sometimes in a bigger situation, that can take many,

801
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:15,760
many seconds. So you would also, I think you may be able to rediscover that remarkable,

802
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,760
if you like, suspension of the fantasy that we can perceive immediately,

803
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:29,840
sort of see yourself seeing using things like ambiguous figures. So psychophysicists have

804
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:34,400
a whole range of really beautiful experiments, you know, using ambiguous figures and different

805
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:42,560
kinds of illusions that deliberately put you on the edge, so that you can experience

806
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:47,120
the sense making and all the sort of settling down a option or another option, you know,

807
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:53,120
resolving the fuzzy cloud into, ah, yes, that's the percept that makes the most sense in this

808
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:58,000
instance. And sometimes it's, you know, when you're looking at ambiguous figures, for example,

809
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:03,360
sometimes it stops making sense, and you cannot voluntarily stop yourself

810
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:11,120
seeing the other interpretation. So, you know, famous two faces or a vase example. So, you know,

811
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:15,920
I think these kinds of experiments, that kind of experience really do speak very powerfully

812
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:22,960
to the kind of experiments you can do at home to convince yourself you've got a very

813
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:30,080
fantastic organ, but it takes time to construct the fantasies in situations which you're not

814
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:38,000
used to. And either you'll wait until you experience a police car chase, or you can go and look at some

815
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:45,040
sort of illusory stimuli devised by psychophysicists. I should just add though, if my

816
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,040
erstwhile colleague Alan Hobson was here, he'd just remind you that, you know,

817
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:58,000
if you want evidence that your brain constructs all your percepts, just think about dreaming.

818
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:07,120
That is such clear evidence that our vision is actually something we built from the inside.

819
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:14,320
And it's just gently constrained by, in the form of prediction errors, the actual sensations.

820
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:22,240
Then just think about your visual experiences, you know, during dreaming.

821
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,400
So, I want to ask you about that. While you're dreaming, let's say having a

822
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,400
standard dream. I don't know what a standard dream is, but you know, let's say having a

823
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:35,200
typical dream where you're in it and you're non-lucid, let's say, and you're out and you're on the

824
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:41,680
beach or something. Is there, and so while you're in the dream, you're experiencing it,

825
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:45,120
you're not realizing it's a dream, you're not realizing that you're constructing the

826
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:53,920
environment, the beach. So, is there, in a sense, a Markov blanket between your personal,

827
01:28:53,920 --> 01:29:00,560
your first-person experience in that dream and the dream world? Or is that making it

828
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:07,680
like, am I getting fuzzy here? I mean, is there technically the same thing or is it different?

829
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:17,920
I think, technically, it is the same thing. It's just, you know, you introduced a really

830
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:23,520
challenging issue there, that you know that you are dreaming or not. I mean, sometimes you do

831
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:28,720
know you're dreaming, certainly as you're moving into lucid phases or sort of only working, making

832
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:34,320
up. So, I'm just thinking, you know, a proper answer to your question would have to accommodate the

833
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:45,520
fact that you perceive and you act in this world, and yet you're not aware that you are actually

834
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:50,880
dreaming. And that must, as you say, induce a whole series of Markov blankets. First of all,

835
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:57,200
you're sequestered from the sensorium. So, you know, the biological state of dreaming

836
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:02,240
rests upon a particular kind of sensory attenuation, which is very enduring, unless for many hours,

837
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:06,800
if you're sleeping halfway. But it's mediated by the same neurochemical, the same modulated

838
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:11,200
neurotransmitters that we were talking about before in relation to Parkinson's disease,

839
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:17,040
different kinds, but basically the same kind of functional role. So, basically, you're switching

840
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:26,320
off sensory import from the periphery upon the body. So, you're now letting your brain free wheel

841
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:35,680
in terms of generating predictions and resolving, in a hierarchical context, where you're resolving

842
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:42,960
the self-generated predictions by other parts of the brain, trying to explain them away. So,

843
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:49,280
effectively, you're rehearsing your prior beliefs about the narratives that you usually

844
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:56,000
are certainly constrained by the experiences you've had the previous day. And yet, as you say,

845
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:01,120
you're not aware that you are dreaming. So, there are certain very high levels of this hierarchical

846
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:07,120
construct, or say, deep levels, if we think of centripetal like hierarchy or heterarchy,

847
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:17,680
that have dissolved that sense of presence and Belford, or no, sorry, that is associated with

848
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:26,640
the reality monitoring. So, yes, not only is there a Markov blanket established that separated you

849
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:30,960
from the sensorium, but there's possibly another higher one that separated your normal

850
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:39,920
reality checking and self-modeling from certain parts of the brain that are engaged in

851
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:45,840
rehearsing particular fantasies that you are experienced as dreams. One of the things I

852
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:54,160
was thinking about with your model, with the principle, is I can understand what the system

853
01:31:54,160 --> 01:32:01,200
is doing a bit in terms of like having its own internal states. Can we think of the environment

854
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:07,840
as doing anything with surprise, or are we staying agnostic on what the environment is doing?

855
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:23,280
Right. So, again, a very leading question. So, I'm just, there's a whole other

856
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:30,000
sort of podcast under the hood. Possibly, I'm not the best person to have that conversation. There

857
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:35,840
are people who speak, I think, in an informed and very fluent way about this perspective. But

858
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:44,880
what you are suggesting is that one can appeal to the mathematical symmetry of this

859
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:49,280
way of partitioning the inside and the outside of the Markov blanket,

860
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:57,920
which has an exact symmetry. So, technically, certainly at the level of sort of basic

861
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:05,440
sentience and sense-making of the kind we were discussing earlier on, it is mathematically

862
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:13,440
true that you can also interpret the environment as inferring your internal states, because you've

863
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:20,080
got this generalized synchrony, which is another manifestation of self-information or surprise

864
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:26,720
or surprise minimization when the surprise of the measure of your sensory impressions. So,

865
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:39,040
on that view, the environment now is acted upon by you in the way that, from the environment's

866
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:45,040
perspective, render your actions sensory inputs, and the way that the environment acts upon you

867
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:52,080
is by providing you with sensory impressions. But, yes, mathematically speaking, the environment

868
01:33:52,160 --> 01:34:04,080
should certainly be modeling you. There are various flavors of that truism that you could pursue.

869
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:12,720
One would fully acknowledge that there is clearly a vast asymmetry between you and your environment.

870
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:18,960
The environment is usually making it bigger. It doesn't always have the same delicate structures

871
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:23,760
or the precise mechanics that would require the sort of planning that we're talking about in terms

872
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:30,160
of the expected free energy. So, we're not saying the environment plans, but in terms of still trying

873
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:35,760
to minimize prediction errors and doing the right kind of learning about you, I think there is good

874
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:41,040
evidence. Well, you can certainly read certain aspects of the environment as doing exactly that.

875
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:47,920
So, the favorite example is the elephant path of a desire path, the shortcut that is worn by repeated

876
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:55,440
use across a grassy lawn when you're getting to what the cutter corner to walking through the park

877
01:34:55,440 --> 01:35:03,520
or to your favorite coffee cafe. So, one way of looking at this is something I've done

878
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:10,240
to my environment, and I've done it with my conspecifics, and I've created a little path to

879
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:15,760
my favorite place, or the place that is the favorite of me and my conspecifics,

880
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:22,640
from the environment's point of view, it's learned a lot about the behavior of its inhabitances,

881
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:30,240
of its denizens. So, you think you are impressing yourself from the environment's point of view,

882
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:34,880
it's just a bit of plasticity, an experience-dependent kind of learning,

883
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:40,880
where it's remembering things about you. And you can take that argument right through to

884
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:47,200
those kinds of parts of the environment that are actually constructed by conspecifics,

885
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:54,000
by traffic lights, by signs that have a semiotics and sort of deontic value.

886
01:35:55,920 --> 01:36:03,040
So, you could say that the lived environment you would express if you walked out onto the street,

887
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:10,800
it's all man-made, and it's all built to maximize expected information gain. I mean,

888
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:16,960
what is a sign? It is there to create an environment that states our curiosity in terms of making it

889
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:24,800
easy to respond to epistemic affordances that you're underwrite our curiosity or our plans

890
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:29,760
to maximize expected information gain. But we build that. So, then you go into the role of

891
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:35,920
into the game of cultural niche construction, the notion of the designer environment from Andy

892
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:44,480
Carr, for example. So, all of these, I'm just summarizing conversations you could have,

893
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:50,560
probably with other people who I want to. The final kind of conversation you might have is that

894
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:56,640
when you realize that your environment is composed of other things very much like you.

895
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:03,760
When you're young, your mum, or as you're older, or your colleagues, and your friends,

896
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:11,440
and your family, and your specifics on the street. I think that's interesting because now we're

897
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:17,280
getting to a much more symmetrical sort of relationship between me and the environment.

898
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:23,680
And certainly in this context, most of my universe is basically you and me. So, now there's a certain

899
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:30,400
kind of symmetry in play, whereas you are my environment, and I am your environment. And yet

900
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:35,200
we both have gelatine models of our environments, which basically means I have a gelatine model of

901
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:39,760
you and you have a gelatine model of me. Minimizing the surprise in the exchange

902
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:49,760
is one description of, can be understood as leading to a generalized synchrony,

903
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:56,560
literally a meeting of minds, a mutual predictability. The rest of all certain things, such as

904
01:37:56,640 --> 01:38:01,600
communication and language, and certain common frames of reference, common ground.

905
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:07,440
But you could actually argue that in this setting, it is an inevitable consequence

906
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:14,560
of joint free energy or surprise minimization. When we put two of the things that are sufficiently

907
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:23,440
similar together, that this would be inevitable. The best way to minimize surprise, when I

908
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:31,440
surprising signal that generated by things like me, namely you, is to ensure that I was much like

909
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:35,280
you as possible, so that I can predict what you're going to do next, because that's what I was going

910
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:41,040
to do next. And exactly symmetrically so for you. So that basically means that we come to share a

911
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:45,600
gelatine model, a shared narrative, we're seen from the same hymn sheet, and everything becomes

912
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:51,520
mutually predictable. And that would be what explanation for the kind of in-group formation

913
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:58,400
and the kind of, you know, the mechanisms you might find in evolutionary psychology,

914
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:06,640
could be described in terms of niche construction. What it doesn't describe though, is the going

915
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:13,280
back to your twilight zone, and the man in the nice hell, the epistemic hell. So if it was

916
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,600
the case that we could become completely mutually predictable and just keep on singing the same song

917
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:23,920
together for hour after hour after hour, that would become boring. So now we come back to,

918
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:30,560
you know, what would this kind of mechanics and this way of understanding self-organization look

919
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:37,440
like when I'm packed in societies and in exchanges between different kinds of conspecifics. And you

920
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:43,040
get to really interesting questions about polarization in-group, out-group, the spread of

921
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:49,760
ideas and the spread of memes that can be simulated. At this point, I think you're now into sort of

922
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:57,520
social neuroscience and joint free energy minimization that can sometimes lead to quite

923
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:05,680
paradoxical results or understandings of the way that we search for information or engage with

924
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:10,640
people. On the one hand, I want to make my world as predictable as possible, so I don't get any

925
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:15,840
nasty surprises. So I'm going to go to those kinds of news channels. I've talked to this kind of person

926
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:21,280
because I think that, you know, we have a lined frame of reference. We have common grounds. We

927
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:27,360
speak the same language. On the other hand, I'm going to be compelled to be slightly curious

928
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:32,720
about other ways of thinking. It's not, you know, we're not all going to merge into one

929
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:37,680
massive community, you know, one massive hive mind, one massive collective intelligence. It's

930
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:42,880
that's not going to work because we are compelled to, you know, what would happen if I looked at it

931
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:48,640
this way? Well, what's that kind of person like? What's this culture like? So, you know, I haven't

932
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:55,120
got any answers, but there's a really, really interesting field of information in the social

933
01:40:55,120 --> 01:41:02,960
neuroscience. Sure. It reminds me a bit about, I think you've spoken to it a bit, the Explore,

934
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:12,960
Exploit, TradeOff, EETO, a little bit because it's sort of this balance between exploiting sort of the

935
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:21,680
linearist, say, most accessible forms of energy or, say, news content, but then also having this

936
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:27,920
balance between doing that and exploring, say, other modes of thought or, you know, exploring

937
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:33,200
what else is out there and that balance, that getting that balance right. And I think you said

938
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:38,880
something to the effect once about the free energy principle that it gets, was it solves it in the

939
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:46,160
right order? Something to that effect? I think it's in the way I perceived it was or viewed it was

940
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:50,480
in order to know what's surprising, you have to know what's possible, kind of, does that make any

941
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:57,120
sense? Is that performing it? Absolutely. So, yeah, I probably said it sort of dissolves the

942
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:01,280
exploitation, exploration dilemma, but you're absolutely right, it does so in a particular way.

943
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:10,080
And it does matter in terms of the order in exactly the way you say. So, if I go to this

944
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:20,000
gambler's heaven, there's an enormous opportunity for me to resolve uncertainty and to indulge my

945
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:26,800
curiosity, to respond to epistemic affordances, which is the expected information part of the

946
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:32,320
expected surprise and the expected free energy. So, I'm going to, first of all, explore all

947
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:37,360
possibilities. What is possible in this particular new environment? I moved to a new city or I put

948
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:43,440
a new device in the kitchen. So, the first thing I'm going to do is explore by becoming a little

949
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:50,480
scientist and trying out this and that and going there and seeing what happens until I have resolved

950
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:56,560
sufficient uncertainty that there's no more irreducible uncertainty there. At that point,

951
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:05,200
the component, the expected information gain will fall below the expected costs or the expected

952
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:14,320
utility. So, I'll have innate preferences that put constraints on my exploration. So,

953
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:23,840
at the point where you literally, your epistemic expected information gain falls below the expected

954
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:29,840
value, then the expected value will take over and I will switch deterministically to exploitative

955
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:36,240
behavior. So, that means the first thing I'm going to do is explore and then, so there is no

956
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:44,080
uncertainty left to resolve and then I will exploit. So, exactly, secure the possibilities

957
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:51,920
and then just act in a way that is predominantly dictated by my prior preferences or my constraints.

958
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,000
Another way of looking at that is,

959
01:43:54,320 --> 01:44:06,560
we are primarily surprise minimizing or uncertainty minimizing creatures, but we do

960
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:12,160
so in the constraints. The constraints are provided by our prior preferences or by our,

961
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:19,360
the constraints afforded by the fact that I would be in this state would be very, very surprising.

962
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:30,000
So, one way of looking at this resolution of the exploration dilemma is that it's not a dilemma.

963
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:37,440
In any sense, we are quintessentially exploration machines, exploration curious artifacts,

964
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:44,880
but we have constraints that we can't become dead or disabled or dehydrated or dissipated.

965
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:52,160
We can't allow ourselves to be damaged, but under those constraints, our primary

966
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:59,680
imperative is to explore. Unless, of course, there's nothing left to explore and then we get bored.

967
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:07,360
Yeah, sure. It's the train off. Are you familiar at all with, I believe it's called a number of

968
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:11,120
different things, but it's like a game theory question. So, they're called like the marriage

969
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:17,680
problem or the secretary problem. Have you ever heard this before? Yeah, so, would you like to

970
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:23,600
hear it? I don't know. Yeah, so basically the way the game works is you're looking for a partner,

971
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:30,560
a life partner, and the question is how many partners, how many people should you date

972
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:39,760
before settling on one person? How do you know the available options? I guess, how do you know when

973
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:42,960
to stop looking is kind of the question. It's also called the secretary problem. It can be called

974
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:47,920
the hiring problem because sort of like the question of, you see one applicant, you have to

975
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:52,240
say yes or no to that one applicant, and if you say no, you can't go back to them, right?

976
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:57,520
The jilted x, let's say. You can't ever go back to, apparently, what's optimal is,

977
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:02,000
and you have to know, what's interesting is you have to know kind of how long you're willing

978
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:06,400
to date. How many partners are you willing to sort of to suss out?

979
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:17,360
The answer is you basically date and you say no to the first 37% of potential partners,

980
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:22,720
or potential applicants, let's say it's for a job, and then after that point, you say yes to

981
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:27,040
the first person who's better than all the options you saw already.

982
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:32,880
It's kind of how it works, right? So it's like you have to date around, you have to kind of explore,

983
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:37,440
but even if you find someone that's incredible by this model, you're not supposed to say yes to

984
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:43,280
anybody until you've seen a little more than a third of the whole people that you're trying to

985
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:48,640
observe, and that just makes you think about EETO a little bit because it requires a certain amount

986
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:53,840
of exploration. Obviously, there's certain parameters here that are more firmly set than

987
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:58,400
you'll find for most system environment dynamics, but that there is actually technically a

988
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:04,240
mathematically precise sort of strategy that works across the board, so I just thought I'd share that.

989
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:12,480
No, I haven't heard that. That's brilliant. It reminds me of sort of evolutionary game theory,

990
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:17,520
having sort of stay wins, or tip-a-tap, like different strategies and which super things

991
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:23,840
that an evolutionist has done as well. The free energy principle. How it reacts to or how it's

992
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:30,240
related to Hamilton's principle of least action. Can you possibly make that help make that link?

993
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:38,000
Yeah, well, so the free energy principle, as we were discussing earlier on, can be regarded either

994
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:43,760
as a variational principle of least action or a constrained maximum entry principle, just depending

995
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:52,080
upon your favourite way of understanding the maths. So the variational principle of least

996
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:58,560
action just is an instance of how it's this principle of least action. Technically, both

997
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:05,280
when applying Hamilton's principle of least action, say to mechanics or movement of massive

998
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:14,560
objects, for example, what these principles prescribe is a prescription of the trajectory

999
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:21,840
or path that something will take. So you could apply Hamilton's principle of least action to

1000
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:28,320
the trajectory of a ball if thrown at a particular angle with a particular velocity

1001
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:35,040
from this point. And it would be the case that the trajectory caused out by that ball

1002
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:42,880
would be a path of least action. It would be the path that minimised a certain energy

1003
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:51,040
when averaged along that path. So this is a path integral, meaning sort of adding things up.

1004
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:56,640
So the path of least action, the path of least at least resistance, if you like,

1005
01:48:57,200 --> 01:49:03,360
where the resistance scores the expenditure of energy because it deviates from the path,

1006
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:09,680
is prescribed by the principle of least action. And you can use that principle then to predict

1007
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:17,440
or to describe the most likely path that anything will take. And indeed, that sort of path integral

1008
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:23,120
view is exactly where free energy, the variational free energy comes from. But here we're talking

1009
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:28,880
about sort of Feynman trying to work out the probability of various paths of small particles

1010
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:36,640
or electrons. So a very difficult mathematical problem that was finessed by introducing this

1011
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:44,640
notion of a variational bound on the probability of a particular path in his pathological formulation

1012
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:49,840
quantum electrodynamics. The math is identical to the free energy principle. And it just says that

1013
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:58,560
there is a particular path through a space of beliefs that is the most likely. And in the same

1014
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:04,080
way that there is a particular path, if I throw a ball, that is conforms to Hampton's principle

1015
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:14,400
least action. And the space through which we're talking about how traveling now is the space

1016
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:20,160
of probabilistic beliefs encoded by the internal states of something. So slightly more abstract,

1017
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:28,000
it's more about the measurement thing, more like the sort of James in use of the word entropy,

1018
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:37,600
or the way that James would apply his entropy to belief structures. But the mathematics,

1019
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:45,280
the variational calculus is exactly the same. It just tells you, given a particular initial

1020
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:55,600
condition and some sensory input, for example, I can tell you the most likely trajectory of

1021
01:50:55,600 --> 01:51:02,320
beliefs that would be described in terms of belief updating, for example, that will ensue

1022
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:08,320
using this variational principle of least action, which is the free energy principle. It's exactly

1023
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:17,440
the same math. I'm just trying to think of even more intuitive ways of describing it. It's a path

1024
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:24,480
of least effort. It's just a mathematical way of describing the path of least path into the

1025
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:31,920
future or the past of least effort, where the effort is effectively scored by the amount of

1026
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:44,480
surprise I can avoid. Are you familiar with Jeremy England's work with dissipative adaptation?

1027
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:53,920
Yes, well, I was about four years ago pre-COVID. Yes, I haven't read what he's been up to recently.

1028
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:58,880
So he moved recently. He moved to Georgia, I think. Oh, really? Oh, I didn't realize he moved. Yeah,

1029
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:04,560
but it's far more of it. I know it's more of a thermodynamic. It's solely, I think,

1030
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:13,040
a thermodynamic, but it makes me, because one of my general interests or one of the things I try to

1031
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:18,000
get to is, you take something like the free energy principle, you try to think, okay,

1032
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,000
what's even more fundamental than that? You keep trying to cut away and say, okay, well,

1033
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:28,240
how do you make this even, what's behind that? What's below that? What kind of feeds into that?

1034
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:37,440
And I don't, I mean, to be completely transparent, I don't fully understand how

1035
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:41,200
dissipative adaptation works. I think that's something to do with the environment,

1036
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:48,480
adjusting itself to best accept the energy that's flowing through it, something like that.

1037
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:53,920
But of course, it's very technical. Is that, at least, I know it's maybe been a few years since

1038
01:52:53,920 --> 01:53:00,160
you follow the, follow the idea, but does that, does it conform? Well, I guess it would have to,

1039
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:05,760
but does this play into the free energy principle at all, or is this a dynamic that kind of works?

1040
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:12,640
No, I mean, it's fascinating work. And you may also want to invite Suzanne Still

1041
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:17,280
to one of these conversations who's been doing very similar work from the point of view of

1042
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:21,520
sort of predictive information theory. And recently, she's also been looking at this sort of

1043
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:32,880
remarkable capacity of systems to, again, resist the second law, and, you know, use their free

1044
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:39,520
energy thermodynamically, but she would frame it in terms of information theory, to, if I could,

1045
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:45,680
extract order from, from else. And you know, common to a lot of these notions, there's a notion of a

1046
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:54,080
ratchet, that you, you, you, you, you, you can make little random jumps, but you, you, you maintain them.

1047
01:53:55,280 --> 01:54:02,400
And each jump is maintained. If it's heading in the right direction, you know, if they are

1048
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:08,800
minimizing sort of free energy at the expense of something else. However, I have to say,

1049
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:17,440
it's not really addressing the same kinds of issues that the free energy principle is addressing.

1050
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:24,400
I have to say, also, you won't get more fundamental or simpler than the free energy principle. So,

1051
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:29,600
I look at thermodynamics as one particular domain of application of that kind of mechanics.

1052
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:34,720
The only difference between thermodynamics and the free energy principle is that the free energy

1053
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:40,400
principle actually commits to a thickness, it commits to a Markov blanket. So, it's now got a

1054
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:47,280
partition of states where you can start to talk about beliefs in a non-trivial sense, in the sense that

1055
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:56,160
there is a morphism from the internal states of a physical system to the states beyond the heat

1056
01:54:56,160 --> 01:55:00,080
path or beyond, beyond the blanket. And all the more interesting questions really about

1057
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:04,480
maintenance of that blanket or the heat path. It's not about the equilibrium physics of things on

1058
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:13,200
the inside. Most of them are just rather uninteresting descriptions of ensembles of things on the

1059
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:18,560
inside that have some particular exchangeability criteria. And then you can apply classical

1060
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:24,000
equilibrium physics to that. That's not terribly interesting from the point of view of people

1061
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:29,280
looking at non-equilibrium physics. And even less interesting from the point of view of people

1062
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:34,960
looking at real randomly dynamical couple systems because these systems are not exchangeable.

1063
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:42,400
You mentioned before that Mike Levin's description of sort of cells of cells of cells of cells of

1064
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:46,720
cells are boundaries of boundaries of boundaries of boundaries. Markov blankets of blankets of

1065
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:52,800
blankets of blankets. There's a heterogeneity to implicit in that scale invariant description

1066
01:55:52,800 --> 01:56:00,240
of actual systems that will not allow you I think to apply to adopt the assumptions that we

1067
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:07,200
would have to commit to if you wanted to apply thermodynamics. So I have a missing attitude

1068
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:18,160
to thermodynamics. So in that sense, trying to understand the thermodynamics of

1069
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:22,720
self-organization, I think it's possibly misguided because you have to make too many

1070
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:27,680
commitments to the kind of systems, particularly the exchangeability of ensembles

1071
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:35,200
to make it really interesting. On the other hand, the the the questions that people like Jeremy

1072
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:41,920
England and Suzanne Still more recently have been addressing are I think deeply interesting

1073
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:45,520
and are not really addressed by the free energy principle. I think what you're talking about here

1074
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:52,720
is the sort of the complexification that seems to be an inevitable property certainly

1075
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:57,120
of biotic self-organization. You could argue other kinds of self-organization but certainly

1076
01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:03,760
biotic self-organization are far from equilibrium systems that have this kind of stale freeness and

1077
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:13,200
implicit heterogeneity in them. I think that there has yet to be a simple story to explain why we

1078
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:22,320
are becoming increasingly more sophisticated increasingly, but if we are organized. I think

1079
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:29,120
that's a fascinating issue. I don't have a clear answer and I will repeat. The free energy principle

1080
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:33,920
itself does not properly address that because the free energy principle starts by saying,

1081
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:40,480
let's assume something has self-organized its house and attracting set. That's where it starts

1082
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:46,800
and that's really where it finishes. I think if you want to think about how these attracting

1083
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:51,600
sets evolve and contextualize each other, I think you're going to be in a slightly more

1084
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:56,960
challenging frame which lots of people are addressing. It's a really interesting question.

1085
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:02,880
I'm not sure thermodynamics is the right toolkit to address that to be honest. I think you need

1086
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:08,880
to look at more fundamental maths probably quantum information theory at different scales and think

1087
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:15,520
about that through the lens of say theoretical biology and evolutionary thinking. I'm so glad

1088
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:18,720
you brought up quantum information theory because that's where I wanted to go next.

1089
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:27,920
I was wondering if the free energy principle lends any credence to the idea or has any

1090
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:34,640
relationship to, I'm not sure if you're familiar with some theories about the universe being

1091
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:39,840
like a quantum air correcting code. If you're familiar at all with that landscape,

1092
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:47,120
basically it's a speculative idea but looks like there's some evidence to support it that the

1093
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:53,200
fabric of space-time itself is actually like a quantum air correcting code. When I hear that

1094
01:58:53,200 --> 01:59:00,080
and I think about the free energy system trying to minimize uncertainty, it's trying to close to

1095
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:05,120
air correction or it seems kind of similar too. I wonder if there is a potential link there and

1096
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:11,680
if you have any comments about that or if that's something that's come across your desk.

1097
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:17,600
Well no, it literally came across my desk about three or four weeks ago so suddenly

1098
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:24,560
sent me this paper on the universe being an air correcting code. I'm delighted and if I remember

1099
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:30,400
the sentiment of the email was it would be great to get this chaps or this woman's take

1100
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:36,800
on this in relation to free energy, theoretic formulation because it seemed as if there was

1101
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:43,440
a very very close connection as you have spotted. I think the best person to comment on that would

1102
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:52,400
be Chris Fields. I did quantum physics as a young man but that was 40 years ago.

1103
01:59:52,400 --> 02:00:03,840
I usually defer to Chris when he comes to quantum information theory. He has a beautifully rounded

1104
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:07,120
perspective on these things and will probably be able to give you quite a definitive answer. He'll

1105
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:11,280
probably say yes it's the same thing but then try to explain why it's the same thing. Yeah,

1106
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:19,520
it's hard to link to. I can't do that. Again, I will be surprised if all of these things weren't

1107
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:26,800
entirely conciliant and I probably ultimately, you know, you probably aren't going to fall back

1108
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:32,400
on something like James' maximum entropy principle, certainly if you're in the quantum

1109
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:40,720
information theory. You will probably find an equivalent description of the kind we've already

1110
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:46,640
mentioned in terms of variational principles of least action but you may also find similar

1111
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:52,240
explanations in gauge theory and ultimately category theory but they should all, I think,

1112
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:57,120
be internally consistent. You should be able to sort of morph from one to the other without doing

1113
02:00:57,120 --> 02:01:02,160
too much damage to your governments and anyone, your favourite way of framing them. I'm sure the

1114
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:08,240
other directing universe is one example of this. Yeah, this is very well could be. It reminds me

1115
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:13,760
too of Chris Fields, a frequent collaborator of his is a cognitive scientist, Donald Hoffman.

1116
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:18,560
I'm not sure if you're familiar with his work. I've interviewed him a couple of times on this

1117
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:24,400
channel as well but one thing that you said that stood out to me and it's something that

1118
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:30,080
he said as well or something similar is that we don't need to know the truth. We just need to

1119
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:34,080
minimize prediction error. You know, it's like this very separate thing and I don't know if you

1120
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:40,080
are familiar with it. He's got a few different theories. I mean, one of which is fitness beats

1121
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:47,760
truth theorem that we've evolved in order to basically maximize fitness instead of to see

1122
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:53,360
what's vertically actually there in the environment. So much of what we see is or all of what we see

1123
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:59,040
is an illusion. We can never, he posits that we can never actually get to the base reality, the

1124
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:05,680
base truth. And I'm sure if you have any thoughts about that or if it's something that you've come

1125
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:13,040
across or if you've spoken with Don. No, I think that's absolutely right. And it sort of leads you

1126
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:18,480
to interesting discussions. Should you want to go there in terms of skepticism versus realism,

1127
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:24,160
internalism versus externalism and the like with philosophers, but certainly from the point of view

1128
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:34,240
of the maths, the physics of this kind of sentence, it is all about making, forming or

1129
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:43,280
understanding internal dynamics as encoding subpersonal probabilistic Bayesian belief about

1130
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:48,640
stuff which is fundamentally hidden beyond your mark of blood, beyond your sensory veil.

1131
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:54,640
It is inaccessible. It is unknowable. And I think that probably Chris Fields would frame this in

1132
02:02:54,640 --> 02:03:00,160
terms of holographic streams, sort of appealing to the holographic principle that, you know,

1133
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:05,760
classical exchange of information across your sensory veil or your mark of blanket

1134
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:10,640
can be construed as a holographic stream from the point of view of quantum information theory.

1135
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:17,200
But that's the only way you can entangle a couple, two systems, you know, with classical information.

1136
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:23,920
So, you know, again, we come back to this fundamental separation between the inside and the

1137
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:31,040
outside, which, you know, read in terms of your conversations would be exactly,

1138
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:37,040
you can never know what's out there. We don't need to. If you can keep your prediction errors

1139
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:42,800
very, very small for as long as you live, job done. I mean, that's perfectly, that's perfectly

1140
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:49,440
okay. It does raise the interesting issue, though, is there an outside, which would involve

1141
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:54,400
philosophical issue. So both Chris and I, I think, would have to commit to the fact that probably

1142
02:03:54,400 --> 02:04:00,800
is an outside in order to help to actually be able to read and write to your holographic screen,

1143
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:07,600
or to be able to transact with an environment, you know, in terms of in both directions over

1144
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:12,320
your mark of blanket. So the free energy principle puts you in a slightly ambiguous position when

1145
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:18,320
it comes to philosophy. So on the one hand, you can be entirely skeptical, everything that needs to

1146
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:26,480
be done is beneath your mark of blanket within the skull bound brain. There is nothing else.

1147
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:33,440
On the other hand, you're making sense of signals that are provided by something

1148
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:39,840
out there. So you have to commit to at least a mathematical description of stuff being out there.

1149
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:45,200
What the something is, sure. I'm just really looking at the time and I realize we've gone way

1150
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:52,400
over what we had sort of planned out to go. I hope you've enjoyed this discussion. I mean,

1151
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:58,960
I've gotten so much out of it, Professor, and thank you so much. Anything else you want to?

1152
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,920
I mean, I literally have so many questions I could continue to ask you, but I do want to be

1153
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:08,800
mindful of your time and energy as well. So please let me know if, you know, if you have a few extra

1154
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:12,720
minutes, I can ask you a couple more. But if, you know, if you've reached your limit, please let me

1155
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:19,600
know also. Please ask me two more questions and then I'm going to go and have a nice cigarette.

1156
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:25,920
Okay. Oh, that sounds nice. That sounds lovely. Yeah, one of those once in a while isn't so bad.

1157
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:31,680
I think, okay, okay, two questions. So now I have to really narrow it down here. But

1158
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:40,640
we'll see it's a little bit. Well, one, one I'll ask you is, and I'm surprised we actually haven't

1159
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:47,280
touched on it, active inference, which honestly for, I mean, maybe the first couple of weeks I

1160
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:51,360
was looking into the free energy principle, I actually thought they were the same thing. I

1161
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:56,000
actually think it's written in other places, I think Wikipedia maybe kind of writes them as

1162
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:01,200
equivalent. And I believe active inference is a subset of the free energy principle or it's like,

1163
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:06,000
well, perhaps, I mean, you could probably, you could definitely do the best job. Can you help

1164
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:11,200
separate the two or help us make a distinction between free energy principle and what active

1165
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:17,040
inference is? I think you could be forgiven by by using them synonymously. And so, you know,

1166
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:23,680
that's how it was portrayed, I think, in the in the Wikipedia links. Having said that,

1167
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:33,440
you know, in the world of philosophy, one's got to be a little bit more rigorous in the way that you

1168
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:42,320
you frame various offerings. So nowadays, I mean, I am, and then one of my friends

1169
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:48,080
in the philosophy are also very careful to distinguish between the free energy principle,

1170
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:52,080
which is just a method. So very much like we were talking about Hamilton's principle of

1171
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:58,960
least action as a method for determining the path of least action or least effort.

1172
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:05,600
But the free energy principle is just what that what it is, it's just a method. It's a tool

1173
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:12,160
for describing the most likely kind of active sense making or belief updating,

1174
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:22,400
or, as you say, active inference. So it's not falsifiable. It's not a theory. This is a principle.

1175
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:29,280
This is a tool. It's a method. If you apply that to purposeful behavior,

1176
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:33,840
then you have active inference. So active inference, I think, is an application of the free energy

1177
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:43,440
principle to usually simulate or predict or emulate or to model purposeful section behavior,

1178
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:49,280
basically. So I've given you a long winded technical answer, but so you you can you can

1179
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:54,160
so free energy principle is usually for sort of physicists and philosophers that

1180
02:07:54,160 --> 02:07:58,240
the fossils like to shout about it. The physicists think it's probably quite trivial.

1181
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:05,120
The active inference is more an application that you might want to actually apply if you're

1182
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:13,680
a psychologist or artificial intelligence researcher wanting to emulate this kind of behavior

1183
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:20,560
or understand, say, given subjects behavior by fitting an active inference model to that

1184
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:25,040
subjects behavior using the much more practical way. I mean, you can regard the free energy

1185
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:33,760
principle as only having utility in that ability to simulate active inference. Just technically,

1186
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:40,080
the only thing you get from the free energy principle is really a way of writing down the

1187
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:48,240
dynamics of self organization as a gradient flow on the on the generative model on those prior

1188
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:53,280
preferences on the probabilistic description of those attracting sense, which means instead of

1189
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:59,840
just just looking at the way a system behaves, given its dynamics and trying to reverse engineer

1190
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:07,040
its Lagrangian. What you could do is actually write down the Lagrangian as a Jamesian constraint

1191
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:11,760
as a set of prior preferences and then just apply the rules of the free energy principle

1192
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:18,240
to simulate the behavior of a system that self organizes to that set of attracting states on

1193
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:24,320
that particular set of preferred states. That's basically what we do in computational neuroscience

1194
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:29,360
and machine learning research. Okay. Thank you very much. That helps. The distinction is super

1195
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:35,200
helpful. Great. Now, last question. I had to kind of a bunch of different ones. I'm like,

1196
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:40,480
oh, I forgot to ask them about attractor landscapes and strange loopiness, but I will

1197
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:45,360
instead ask you if you, this is more of a metaphor, this is a personal question, but

1198
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:50,720
if you could give your 20 year old, 20 year old self one piece of advice, what would it be? So if

1199
02:09:50,720 --> 02:10:13,440
you go back. I think it would. No, I'm trying to be too clever about this. Probably to go

1200
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:24,320
to the dentist more often, to be honest, if you're much less trivial answer. I think it would be

1201
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:32,320
nice to do a couple of years of philosophy. I always say when people, when my children and

1202
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:37,600
when my students and when other people ask me what's good career advice is keeping your options

1203
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:40,880
open. You've used that phrase earlier on today. I think there's something quite fundamental about

1204
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:47,280
that. As broad a foundation as possible, bearing in mind that we are all quintessentially curious

1205
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:52,400
creatures. And therefore, if you omitted your academic career, you are indulging that. But

1206
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:59,040
the best way to explore is to have a very broad foundation. And I managed to do that to a certain

1207
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:06,080
extent. I didn't, I didn't miss out a lot of history and a lot of philosophy. And I remember

1208
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:11,440
one of my mentors, Jerry Edelman, used to refer to me. I won't say fondly. He just used to refer

1209
02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:21,600
to me as an intellectual thug because of my lack of scholarly understanding and very little finesse

1210
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:27,920
when it comes to sort of mechanical or history. So it would have been nice. I don't know what would

1211
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:32,000
have happened if I had spent time doing that, but it would have been nice just to involve myself

1212
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,560
with what somebody is and not trying to try. Sure to have that base. But there's still time.

1213
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:40,880
I mean, it's not like, you know, I mean, I'm sure you're busy, so you don't have too much free time,

1214
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:48,160
but you know, it's always available. Well, Professor Friston, thank you so much. This has been,

1215
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:54,880
I mean, this has been amazing speaking with you. And I'm so honored, so blessed that you

1216
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:59,680
take the time to speak with me. And I'm sure the audience will appreciate everything here.

1217
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:03,600
And I'll include links in the description of this video for people who want to learn more,

1218
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:06,160
who want to read your papers, I'll link to some of your papers and some of your

1219
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:11,600
some of your presentations. And thanks again. It's a treat.

1220
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:16,560
Well, thank you. I really enjoyed talking to you. And I'm going to find out how long we've been

1221
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:20,800
talking. I deliberately haven't looked. I shouldn't have said anything. I wish I had

1222
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:24,480
said anything now because I'm going to ask you about attractor landscapes. But no, yeah,

1223
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:27,600
it has been a while and I appreciate so appreciate you going over.

1224
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:34,720
Right, I shall go away thinking about attractor landscapes and what I should have advised myself

1225
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:38,960
to do when I was 20 years of age. That's a great question. Bye.
