00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
You're intuition, let's say, you know, deep inside yourself.

00:03.280 --> 00:08.960
Something maybe some of you can't prove, but why why do you think this is all how

00:09.160 --> 00:11.760
it's laid out? Why do you think we're here?

00:11.960 --> 00:14.200
Basically, the universe is moving towards this.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.440
It's the system moving towards an attractor.

00:16.640 --> 00:19.400
The wave function collapse isn't random.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.200
If you have an isolated quantum system, it's going to look random.

00:22.400 --> 00:27.680
But when everything is interacting, everything, all those wave functions must be collapsed.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.000
If the universe is becoming more complex, that puts constraints on how the wave

00:31.200 --> 00:35.560
function collapses, such that the collapse is much in totality add up towards going

00:35.560 --> 00:36.560
towards this omega point.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.720
There is a multiverse, but it's not like every possibility exists.

00:39.920 --> 00:44.080
There was this evolutionary process where in Lee Smollin's model of cosmological

00:44.280 --> 00:48.200
natural selection, when you have a universe form and then a black hole forms in that

00:48.400 --> 00:52.760
universe, since a big bang is like a singularity event that creates a universe.

00:52.760 --> 00:56.880
The idea is that when a black hole forms in the universe, that's a big bang event

00:57.080 --> 00:58.640
that creates a new universe.

00:58.840 --> 01:02.920
That's how you have this evolutionary process that's creating more and more

01:02.920 --> 01:06.600
universes and the universes that are good at creating black holes and black holes

01:06.800 --> 01:10.800
come from stars, and stars create the chemistry that's needed for life.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.640
Then you'll get more and more universes that create more and more black holes.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.800
So more and more universes that have more and more stars.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.360
And so then this process will lead to more and more universes that are

01:18.360 --> 01:21.600
firmly for life, because stars create the higher elements that are needed for life.

01:21.800 --> 01:26.320
And then so if this evolutionary process is true, you'll have the selection pressure

01:26.320 --> 01:29.440
towards getting more life-friendly universes.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.280
My ultimate understanding was that nature

01:32.280 --> 01:34.800
has this life-generating principle.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.400
It's really hard to determine, you know,

01:36.400 --> 01:39.960
we still have that why something from nothing problem,

01:39.960 --> 01:42.040
but we are making progress.

01:42.040 --> 01:44.400
It's not introducing unnecessary stuff

01:44.400 --> 01:45.840
by going outside this universe

01:45.840 --> 01:47.560
because we have the fine-tuning mystery

01:47.560 --> 01:50.280
that is begging for a solution that we don't have

01:50.280 --> 01:51.960
unless we think about these other things.

01:51.960 --> 01:55.400
Creator, cosmological selection, the multiverse theory,

01:55.400 --> 01:57.000
which I don't think is a good explanation

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
because it introduces everything

01:59.000 --> 02:00.920
just to explain away a creator.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.720
When we shouldn't necessarily need to explain a creator

02:02.720 --> 02:05.000
with every possible universe exists.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.200
It's just, I don't think it's the right,

02:07.200 --> 02:09.360
I don't think it's superior epistemologically,

02:09.360 --> 02:11.320
Occam's Rage, all the things we mentioned.

02:11.320 --> 02:16.320
So ultimately I'm left with the process itself being God

02:16.720 --> 02:18.600
and that we could be created by an agent,

02:18.600 --> 02:20.360
but it wouldn't be this all-powerful,

02:20.360 --> 02:23.560
fundamental thing that was there forever.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.560
It would be a product of this process,

02:25.560 --> 02:27.320
but that process seems to be eternal.

02:27.320 --> 02:30.000
So even if we have a God, a creator,

02:30.000 --> 02:31.520
I don't think if I learned about him,

02:31.520 --> 02:32.880
I don't think I'd pray to him.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.000
I think if we have a creator,

02:35.000 --> 02:36.440
it might be like us creating things

02:36.440 --> 02:38.880
and then we wouldn't ask our AI, like, is there a God?

02:38.880 --> 02:41.080
Like maybe if we do have a creator,

02:41.080 --> 02:42.640
they're looking for us to answer us.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.960
Maybe we're the AI that's gonna inform them.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.920
But so even if we had a creator,

02:46.920 --> 02:48.200
I'm not necessarily sure

02:48.200 --> 02:50.340
that I don't think that would be the end of all answers.

02:50.340 --> 02:53.200
I think it's more spiritually satisfying

02:54.120 --> 02:58.000
to just recognize there is a process that leads to life,

02:58.000 --> 03:01.120
leads to consciousness and unending consciousness,

03:01.120 --> 03:03.760
reaching higher and higher levels of experience.

03:03.760 --> 03:07.240
So it's a journey for me, but what I am convinced by

03:07.240 --> 03:09.480
is that you do have this trajectory

03:09.480 --> 03:13.160
and once you start asking why it's this way,

03:13.160 --> 03:15.840
you get into all the explanations that I've just said

03:15.840 --> 03:18.800
and I think they're better than the nihilistic multiverse

03:18.800 --> 03:21.200
where just weak anthropic principle version.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.360
Bobby Azarian is a cognitive neuroscientist,

03:23.360 --> 03:26.840
journalist and author of The Romance of Reality,

03:26.840 --> 03:28.480
how the universe organizes itself

03:28.480 --> 03:31.880
to create life, consciousness and cosmic complexity.

I hope you enjoy our conversation.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.520
Bobby, thank you for coming up.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.360
Hey, Carlos, thanks for having me.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.600
Yeah, it's such a pleasure.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.800
So excited to speak with you.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.920
We're gonna talk about your book, The Romance of Reality

03:46.920 --> 03:50.920
and for this kicked off before I outline

03:50.920 --> 03:54.680
the three parts that we're gonna cover in today's discussion.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.400
I wanna start off with something that I usually start,

03:57.400 --> 04:00.920
how this is the last question for guests on the podcast

04:02.520 --> 04:04.040
and I'm not gonna ask you this question directly.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.000
It's more of something I was just thinking about.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.320
I usually ask people, if you could go back

04:08.320 --> 04:11.360
and give your 18 year old self one piece of advice,

04:11.360 --> 04:12.920
what would it be?

04:12.920 --> 04:15.760
And I'm thinking about it in terms of this book

04:15.760 --> 04:20.760
because if I could go back and give myself one book

04:20.960 --> 04:24.600
say like the summer before college, it would be this book.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.160
Oh, wow, that's awesome.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.560
Honestly, I mean that wholeheartedly

04:28.560 --> 04:33.560
because it's fantastic, I had no knowledge

04:34.440 --> 04:37.560
of complexity science up until a few years ago

04:37.560 --> 04:40.480
and this book is just an excellent synthesis

04:40.480 --> 04:44.120
of so many big ideas and I give it my highest recommendation.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.520
People watching this right now,

04:46.520 --> 04:48.280
I hope you listen to the whole conversation

04:48.280 --> 04:50.200
but there'll be a link below in the description

04:50.200 --> 04:53.880
if you'd go out and buy this book because it's incredible.

04:53.880 --> 04:54.720
Thank you so much.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.840
I put a lot of time and thought into it

04:56.840 --> 05:00.320
and it's so nice to hear things like that

05:00.320 --> 05:04.040
because yeah, the intention was to kind of give

05:04.040 --> 05:07.320
a big picture view of complexity science

05:07.320 --> 05:09.000
which includes all these other sciences

05:09.000 --> 05:13.800
but like what those sciences are showing us

05:13.800 --> 05:15.560
as far as like the big picture questions

05:15.560 --> 05:17.560
which a lot of the complexity books don't really get into.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.320
They kind of hint at things

05:19.320 --> 05:22.520
but this was just kind of putting all the existential things

05:22.520 --> 05:24.680
out there but to hear that, yeah,

05:24.680 --> 05:28.280
that really makes me feel like the work is worth it

05:28.280 --> 05:32.840
and motivates me for the follow-up book that I'm starting

05:32.840 --> 05:34.440
and so thank you for that.

05:34.440 --> 05:35.280
That's awesome.

05:35.280 --> 05:38.280
I really appreciate that and that's great to know.

05:38.280 --> 05:39.920
Yeah, absolutely and I mean it.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.080
I mean, even a few months ago a commenter

05:42.080 --> 05:45.120
on one of my videos asked me for my top 10 list

05:45.120 --> 05:46.520
and so I have to revise that

05:46.520 --> 05:48.280
because I have to knock somebody off

05:48.280 --> 05:50.240
and put this book in.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.880
Sorry to the person to get snagged off.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.920
No, see Nicholas Taleb, I'm sorry.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.120
He didn't pick that off.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.720
Knock that guy off, yeah, yeah.

05:58.920 --> 05:59.760
Yeah, well let's book it.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.040
I really like his book at Ty for Agile.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.120
I thought it was fantastic.

06:02.120 --> 06:02.960
I haven't read it.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.280
He's a brilliant guy but I've seen some of his tweets

06:05.280 --> 06:07.800
where I was like, huh, I don't know.

06:07.800 --> 06:08.640
He's a troll.

06:08.640 --> 06:09.480
He's a professional troll.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.000
Yeah, he's kind of but maybe that's cool.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.240
Maybe, you know, he mixes it up.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.880
Yeah, I know, yeah, I don't know personally

06:15.440 --> 06:18.200
so I just wanna let the audience know that.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.360
Also as we, for the audience to know,

06:21.360 --> 06:25.120
I'll have links in the description for all of your stuff,

06:25.120 --> 06:28.240
for your blog, Road to Omega,

06:28.240 --> 06:29.680
your Psychology Today articles

06:30.920 --> 06:32.840
and of course the link to buy the book as well.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.680
So I want folks to know,

06:34.680 --> 06:36.480
sort of this is gonna be in three parts.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.440
I hope we have time to allocate across all three

06:39.440 --> 06:41.160
but the first one we're gonna,

06:41.160 --> 06:45.200
I think about in terms of crawl, walk, teleport.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.600
So we're gonna crawl,

06:48.600 --> 06:51.720
we're gonna start ground ourselves in the science,

06:51.720 --> 06:53.120
the major ideas behind the book.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.560
We don't have time to dive into every last detail

06:55.560 --> 06:56.400
because there's so much in here.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.840
It's very densely packed.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.080
We're gonna start there, part two

07:00.080 --> 07:02.320
where I wanna spend a lot of time on.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.160
I know this is something

07:03.160 --> 07:05.360
that you're focusing a lot of time on right now.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.760
Your current projects is how people can use this

07:07.760 --> 07:10.200
in their daily lives, how they can integrate it,

07:11.160 --> 07:12.640
into their habits, their routines.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.080
So I wanna spend a lot of time there.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.600
And then at the end, if we have time,

07:16.600 --> 07:18.520
we'll push the boundaries a little bit,

07:18.520 --> 07:20.280
talk about the more speculative stuff,

07:20.280 --> 07:23.800
allow ourselves to talk about things like,

07:25.080 --> 07:28.000
universal Darwinism, baby universe is spawned

07:28.000 --> 07:29.720
from black holes, things that are a little bit more

07:29.720 --> 07:31.840
out there, time permitting.

07:31.840 --> 07:36.400
So let's get into, let's crawl before we walk.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.240
And if you wouldn't mind,

07:37.240 --> 07:38.960
can you lay the groundwork for the audience?

07:38.960 --> 07:39.920
Can you set the table

07:39.960 --> 07:42.320
and provide us with really high-level description

07:42.320 --> 07:45.800
of the book and some of the core ideas?

07:45.800 --> 07:48.760
Yeah, I realized I didn't answer your question

07:48.760 --> 07:51.400
about if I could go back in time to being 18.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.840
So I don't know if I should address that later

07:53.840 --> 07:55.280
or we should go into it.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.120
Was it if I-

07:56.120 --> 07:57.600
If it's on your mind, yeah.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.320
Yeah, and the structure is great

07:59.320 --> 08:03.200
because Walk, Crawl, Teleport matches the structure

08:03.200 --> 08:05.360
of the book, which is organized into three parts.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.560
Origins, about the origin of life,

08:07.600 --> 08:10.720
evolution, and transcendence.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.000
So yeah, there'll be a logical flow

08:12.000 --> 08:14.960
and I will not go into much detail

08:14.960 --> 08:17.120
about the evolutionary mechanisms in part one.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.960
That's mostly what the book is about.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.280
But I've talked about that in a lot of detail

08:23.280 --> 08:26.560
and other interviews and wanna just give a good,

08:26.560 --> 08:28.160
big picture overview of all the stuff

08:28.160 --> 08:29.600
that you just mentioned.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.560
So if anyone's interested in more details,

08:31.560 --> 08:33.360
you can go to my sub-sacro to Omega.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.280
My book is available on Amazon and other retailers

08:38.200 --> 08:40.440
and yeah, those and other talks online.

08:40.440 --> 08:45.440
But this will be less detailed and more philosophical,

08:46.560 --> 08:49.600
I guess, you know, bigger picture focused on that.

08:50.480 --> 08:54.600
If I was 18, so was it, what book would I read at 18

08:54.600 --> 08:57.280
or what would I tell myself at 18?

08:57.280 --> 08:59.520
So that's funny, I answered what book

08:59.520 --> 09:01.640
because I was thinking so much about your book.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.560
But yeah, you could either one.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.840
Yeah, but the first, the original question was

09:06.920 --> 09:08.240
if I could go back in time

09:08.240 --> 09:09.800
and kind of give myself advice.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.560
Yeah, yeah, that's the original question.

09:11.560 --> 09:12.560
That's what you ask everybody?

09:12.560 --> 09:14.360
Yeah, yeah, I gotta watch all those.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.400
I love the Donald Hoffman interview.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.000
I haven't got to watch the other ones,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.600
but I know you're reading Graham Dempsey and Greg

09:20.600 --> 09:22.640
who are friends and I saw Michael Levin

09:22.640 --> 09:23.480
and some really cool people.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.040
So I gotta go see their answers to that

09:25.040 --> 09:26.960
because that's a good question.

09:26.960 --> 09:31.360
So I don't know if this is how I would normally answer,

09:31.360 --> 09:32.960
but this has been on my mind.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.200
So it's like when you understand the paradigm

09:36.200 --> 09:37.040
presented in the book,

09:37.040 --> 09:40.560
which is not necessarily, not really my paradigm,

09:40.560 --> 09:42.400
I've approached this like a scientist

09:42.400 --> 09:45.640
who definitely, I guess had a hypothesis,

09:45.640 --> 09:47.040
but also as a journalist.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.880
So as a person who's a scientist

09:49.880 --> 09:54.240
and who believes in the importance of evidence

09:54.240 --> 09:56.340
for your beliefs and your arguments,

09:58.040 --> 10:02.360
you know, I couldn't see myself just having some hypothesis

10:02.360 --> 10:04.520
that was never out there and like really like putting it

10:04.520 --> 10:07.880
for like the reason that I feel confident

10:07.880 --> 10:11.080
about the argument in the book is because

10:11.080 --> 10:14.800
it's based on so many people

10:14.800 --> 10:18.880
who have seen the same cosmic narrative,

10:18.880 --> 10:22.440
you could call it this new story of nature.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.800
And it's really interesting because,

10:27.520 --> 10:29.880
you know, you could bring up some of these ideas

10:29.880 --> 10:32.600
to some people and especially like 15 or 20 years ago

10:32.600 --> 10:34.360
and some people like, no, that sounds like new age stuff.

10:34.360 --> 10:35.200
No, they can't be right.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.080
The universe is waking up or becoming conscious

10:38.080 --> 10:39.000
or something like that.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.640
Or it's growing more and more complex always

10:41.640 --> 10:42.480
without limit.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.960
And they're like, no, that's not scientific.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.480
That violates this law and this or this idea

10:46.480 --> 10:48.720
or that was shown to be like,

10:48.720 --> 10:52.200
it's amazing that that was the stance toward this narrative

10:52.200 --> 10:53.640
which we'll get into.

10:53.640 --> 10:58.640
And it was just totally ideological.

10:58.680 --> 10:59.760
And there have been other people

10:59.760 --> 11:00.840
that have been saying this other thing

11:00.840 --> 11:02.960
and somehow for cultural reasons,

11:03.680 --> 11:08.240
most people got convinced that certain things

11:08.240 --> 11:09.720
that people could say about the universe

11:09.720 --> 11:11.720
were just completely wrong and pseudo-scientific.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.840
And we're seeing that's completely not true.

11:13.840 --> 11:18.200
And it's been exciting because I've written certain articles

11:18.200 --> 11:20.080
like challenging the heat death hypothesis

11:20.080 --> 11:22.120
and that life has to come to an end in the universe.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.600
For example, I just wrote one for Noema.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.640
The physicist David Deutch shared it.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.480
Sabina Hossenfelder and Richard Hansen,

11:28.480 --> 11:30.080
big names were like commenting.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.560
She had written something similar in a chapter in her book.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.400
I haven't read it yet.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.960
And Robert Hansen was like, yeah, maybe life can go.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.560
It depends on if entropy has an upper bound.

11:38.560 --> 11:42.800
But my point is with all of the articles that I've published,

11:42.800 --> 11:45.320
I thought we're saying something super radical.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.440
The one that kind of planted the seed for the book

11:47.440 --> 11:50.400
was called Is the Universe Pro-Life for Courts?

11:50.400 --> 11:52.320
And Sean Carroll gave me a quote for that

11:52.320 --> 11:54.560
and retweeted that and said,

11:54.560 --> 11:56.720
controversial topic, opinions may differ,

11:56.720 --> 12:01.200
but he thought that was a good potential argument

12:01.200 --> 12:06.200
that life was inevitable based on thermodynamic arguments.

12:08.440 --> 12:12.640
And I think he'd probably even say that was the case now.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.680
So there were things where I thought

12:14.680 --> 12:19.680
that it was gonna be a real challenge to say this stuff

12:23.040 --> 12:25.520
because of just consensus

12:25.520 --> 12:26.920
and all of that's changing.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.480
It's the most exciting time ever.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.800
So one thing I would tell myself

12:30.800 --> 12:32.840
if I went back is like,

12:33.960 --> 12:36.800
but I kind of followed this advice anyway.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.400
It's not what I was gonna say originally.

12:38.400 --> 12:43.400
I was gonna say, again, it wasn't based off anything.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.600
Looking around me, reading tons of stuff

12:51.520 --> 12:52.920
gave me a strong feeling

12:52.920 --> 12:55.480
that the universe is becoming more complex.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.680
It's not becoming increasingly disordered.

12:57.680 --> 12:58.800
And I need to look into this.

12:58.800 --> 13:02.440
So as long as you feel like you're basing your something,

13:02.440 --> 13:04.600
basing your belief on like evidence

13:04.600 --> 13:06.440
and you have a strong argument,

13:06.440 --> 13:09.360
do not pay attention to like current consensus.

13:09.360 --> 13:11.040
Don't be afraid if like someone's like,

13:11.040 --> 13:12.880
oh, you're a crackpot because of this.

13:12.880 --> 13:17.720
Just put the time into articulating your idea

13:18.800 --> 13:20.480
because if you articulate it well,

13:20.480 --> 13:21.640
it's really interesting.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.280
Like there's things in the book where if I were to,

13:25.280 --> 13:27.600
if the chapters were only a paragraph long

13:27.600 --> 13:29.280
people were reading little summaries,

13:29.280 --> 13:30.520
they might not be convinced all of them.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.880
They're like, this goes against everything we know.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.800
But then you read the book and you see the arguments

13:35.800 --> 13:38.600
and it's specifically the technical arguments

13:38.600 --> 13:42.240
that just went through that skepticism.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.360
For example, Michael Schermer,

13:43.360 --> 13:45.480
I didn't know what he was gonna think of the book.

13:45.480 --> 13:47.600
And he ended up giving a blurb to actually

13:47.600 --> 13:50.640
on the cover talking about like people having a purpose

13:50.640 --> 13:53.440
to your purposes, discover your own purpose.

13:54.440 --> 13:59.440
But so that was thrilling and it's still happening

14:02.160 --> 14:06.160
to see these kind of ideological ideas

14:08.400 --> 14:13.440
that were kind of cemented as like, this is the truth

14:13.440 --> 14:15.040
are starting to be dismantled

14:15.040 --> 14:17.480
because they were never on a firm basis.

14:17.480 --> 14:22.480
And yeah, so basically stick with it.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.000
And stick to your beliefs like, I mean,

14:26.000 --> 14:28.880
yeah, don't get deterred from something

14:28.880 --> 14:32.000
if you feel that is right.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.480
Quickly, because we need to get into all the other stuff.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.840
But this is kind of already getting into those topics.

14:36.840 --> 14:40.400
But I will say that the ideas in the book

14:40.400 --> 14:41.880
made me look at life in a different way

14:41.880 --> 14:46.720
as far as like life does have this intrinsic goal

14:46.720 --> 14:48.720
which is to stay in existence.

14:48.720 --> 14:52.160
And that gives us an intrinsic purpose.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.440
And once you see things in that way

14:54.440 --> 14:56.920
you can kind of start to interpret life as being a game

14:56.920 --> 14:59.160
where there's challenges and goals.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.320
And then you start to think of your moment,

15:01.320 --> 15:03.120
your life on a moment to moment basis

15:03.120 --> 15:04.280
as sort of being this thing

15:04.280 --> 15:06.360
where you're like accumulating points.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.080
I mean, you don't wanna get carried away with this

15:08.080 --> 15:10.960
but overall I think it's a good way to optimize life

15:10.960 --> 15:12.800
where you're just really thinking like,

15:12.800 --> 15:14.680
okay, I'm not wasting time today

15:14.680 --> 15:19.320
because I've had this game kind of framework

15:19.320 --> 15:20.840
where I have these goals

15:20.840 --> 15:23.880
and I'm not doing things right now to get to my goals.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.040
That doesn't mean you don't relax,

15:25.040 --> 15:25.880
you don't have fun

15:25.880 --> 15:27.880
because that's part of getting to your goals.

15:27.880 --> 15:29.840
But if I could go back to when I was 18

15:29.840 --> 15:33.200
or even before high school, like starting high school

15:33.200 --> 15:36.840
I would have imagined my life as being a type of game.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.280
So I wouldn't miss opportunities

15:39.280 --> 15:42.840
and I would take advantage of things

15:42.840 --> 15:46.240
where I just miss certain opportunities of life

15:46.240 --> 15:50.680
because I didn't have this mindset that I have now.

15:52.840 --> 15:57.840
Yeah, so I do think this game lens that we'll get into

15:58.080 --> 16:02.000
is really helpful for sort of like optimizing your life.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.240
And once you realize it, then you're like,

16:04.240 --> 16:09.240
oh man, I kind of wasted time being suboptimal.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.160
Interesting, yeah.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.240
In life, yeah.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.520
Cool, yeah, we'll spend a lot of time

16:15.520 --> 16:17.880
and I'll make sure that our fattest section

16:17.880 --> 16:22.880
is the game of life throw to Omega that we're on

16:24.040 --> 16:25.400
before we get into that a little bit,

16:25.400 --> 16:27.560
just to help an audience.

16:27.560 --> 16:30.280
And I think, well, you just alluded to it a little bit.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.600
This, I think that your book is a response

16:33.600 --> 16:37.080
to the failure of reductionism in science.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.880
So could you tell us a little bit about,

16:39.880 --> 16:41.680
I guess, that changing paradigm

16:41.680 --> 16:45.400
and then also sprinkle in your unified theory of reality

16:45.760 --> 16:48.320
which you have a great flow chart from infinity maps

16:48.320 --> 16:51.840
that I'm sure I'll overlay at some point in this discussion.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.480
But I know there's a lot there

16:53.480 --> 16:56.040
because there's a few different frameworks

16:56.040 --> 16:58.320
that you bring in, but I love to just get,

16:58.320 --> 17:00.600
if you could provide us with a little bit of an overview,

17:00.600 --> 17:02.120
that'd be super helpful.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.640
Yeah, let me, there's so many things

17:04.640 --> 17:05.920
I've been talking about writing about,

17:05.920 --> 17:08.080
like there could be a conversation,

17:08.080 --> 17:10.120
full podcast on each of these topics.

17:10.120 --> 17:12.960
So I'm just trying to be mindful to like say,

17:12.960 --> 17:16.200
be brief and say the most important things

17:16.200 --> 17:18.480
because there's so many cultural factors.

17:18.480 --> 17:21.680
So you can trace this back to like this question

17:21.680 --> 17:25.000
to like understanding the different eras,

17:26.160 --> 17:30.800
basically like pre-modernism, modernism, post-modernism

17:30.800 --> 17:32.600
and whatever we're getting into now.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.800
But like pre-modernism was kind of the time before science

17:35.800 --> 17:37.600
where like religion ruled

17:37.600 --> 17:39.240
and people believed supernatural beliefs.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.400
And there was this strict hierarchy

17:41.400 --> 17:45.480
and modernism was basically a response to that.

17:45.480 --> 17:48.480
And it happened, it's kind of started

17:48.480 --> 17:51.640
with the Enlightenment period in like the 17th century,

17:51.640 --> 17:55.280
18th century and the scientific,

17:55.280 --> 17:58.160
kind of the birth of the scientific method.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.840
And when I started writing the book,

18:00.840 --> 18:03.720
I thought that's kind of when there was like

18:03.720 --> 18:06.240
the onset of reductionism and atheism

18:06.240 --> 18:07.840
and kind of this idea that the universe

18:07.840 --> 18:10.000
was meaningless and purposeless.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.200
But I found out that that's not true at all.

18:13.760 --> 18:18.760
And basically there was this modern movement

18:18.760 --> 18:22.160
that was like very pro-science and pro-reason and logic.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.280
But it wasn't what we have now

18:25.280 --> 18:28.800
or wasn't what the kind of scientific ideology

18:28.800 --> 18:32.240
of the 20th century, which was more nihilistic,

18:32.240 --> 18:35.200
you know, nothing has any meaning, there's no purpose,

18:35.200 --> 18:40.200
there's no design and basically,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.720
oh, and there's no such thing as like continued

18:46.720 --> 18:49.800
complexification because that kind of implies progress.

18:51.240 --> 18:56.240
And so basically modernism started off

18:56.480 --> 18:59.000
like it was still pretty religious

18:59.000 --> 19:02.680
and I'm not advocating for organized religion

19:02.680 --> 19:03.960
by any means.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.880
But what I'm saying is there's a different mindset.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.920
Newton was extremely religious.

19:08.920 --> 19:13.000
A lot of the greatest physicists of our time,

19:13.000 --> 19:14.720
a lot of the founders of thermodynamics,

19:14.720 --> 19:17.800
James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin,

19:17.800 --> 19:19.760
they were all very religious.

19:19.760 --> 19:24.760
And we're driven by this idea that reality is mysterious

19:24.800 --> 19:28.320
and they're basically trying to understand

19:28.320 --> 19:30.120
what they described as the mind of God.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.920
And you see that language retained

19:31.920 --> 19:33.600
in like Stephen Hawking and stuff.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.960
And you'll find videos of like Richard Dawkins saying,

19:35.960 --> 19:37.840
you know, you can make a good argument for a God

19:37.840 --> 19:39.800
if you basically are a creator,

19:39.800 --> 19:43.600
if you put them behind, you know, at the very, you know,

19:43.600 --> 19:45.760
that they designed the system and then let it evolve

19:45.760 --> 19:47.400
to its own dynamics.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.920
And he says, the God of Paul Davies,

19:48.920 --> 19:50.840
the God of the physicist.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.480
And I was like, the God of the physicist.

19:52.480 --> 19:54.000
And it was again, I was like looking more

19:54.000 --> 19:55.600
into the different physicists.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.520
And you know, a lot of people know Newton as Christian.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.440
Some people know like Goldil,

19:59.440 --> 20:02.320
who's a mathematician, was very Christian.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.920
But like, I didn't know like the founders,

20:04.920 --> 20:06.200
a lot of, you know, the founders

20:06.200 --> 20:08.120
of the second law of thermodynamics

20:08.120 --> 20:08.960
were Christian as well.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.360
And actually the heat death theory,

20:11.360 --> 20:13.480
I believe had Christian motivations

20:13.480 --> 20:16.560
because basically Lord, yeah, it's super fascinating,

20:16.560 --> 20:20.160
but Lord Kelvin, who kind of popularized

20:20.160 --> 20:21.400
the second law of thermodynamics,

20:21.400 --> 20:22.760
which, you know, he and Colossia

20:22.760 --> 20:25.520
has kind of independently put forth.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.640
And just for anyone who doesn't know,

20:26.640 --> 20:29.280
second law of thermodynamics is the law that entropy

20:29.280 --> 20:32.120
always must increase in the universe.

20:32.120 --> 20:34.000
Well, in system, see, that's the thing.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
It was supposed to be applied just to like close systems.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.600
And then people immediately started to try

20:39.600 --> 20:41.400
to apply it to the whole universe.

20:41.400 --> 20:45.320
But a lot of the impetus for doing that

20:45.320 --> 20:48.720
was like Lord Kelvin knew that if the universe had an end,

20:48.720 --> 20:51.520
it kind of had to imply there was a beginning.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.680
And at the end of the universe,

20:52.680 --> 20:54.720
the heat death kind of paralleled

20:54.720 --> 20:58.120
sort of judgment, you know, day of judgment type stuff.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.080
So interesting dissertation online,

21:00.080 --> 21:02.920
which talks about the religious motivations

21:02.920 --> 21:04.800
underlying the second law of thermodynamics.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.520
Sir Arthur Eddington, who made the quote,

21:06.520 --> 21:08.840
the second law of thermodynamics is, you know,

21:08.840 --> 21:11.280
if you have a theory that goes up against that,

21:11.280 --> 21:13.000
I can only, you know, whatever, you know,

21:13.000 --> 21:14.880
but it was like, yeah.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.720
And he was very Christian as well

21:17.720 --> 21:21.200
and referred to himself as a rational mystic,

21:21.200 --> 21:22.600
which I thought was a nice, you know,

21:22.600 --> 21:24.880
kind of paradoxical term that kind of,

21:24.880 --> 21:26.600
I felt like a relation to,

21:26.600 --> 21:30.360
because reality is very mysterious.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.720
And I'm not saying we can't understand,

21:32.720 --> 21:35.320
I'm actually saying we can, but we haven't yet.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.440
There's lots of secrets to uncover.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.760
We'll never understand it completely,

21:39.760 --> 21:42.720
but that's what this complexification process,

21:42.720 --> 21:44.320
the world's getting more complex,

21:44.320 --> 21:47.480
that happens when organisms start modeling the world

21:47.480 --> 21:50.040
and when they start modeling the world to survive in it,

21:50.040 --> 21:53.320
they start getting a larger and more detailed map

21:53.320 --> 21:55.360
of the world and that allows them to manipulate

21:55.360 --> 21:58.640
the world around them, which allows life to spread.

21:58.640 --> 22:03.640
So you have this story that is basically, yeah,

22:07.480 --> 22:10.600
it's really different than what we've been taught in science.

22:10.600 --> 22:13.600
So yeah, my point was in modernism,

22:14.880 --> 22:17.560
scientists still were, you know,

22:17.560 --> 22:22.480
driven by this kind of mystical, you know,

22:22.480 --> 22:27.320
desire to understand nature, the mystery of nature.

22:27.320 --> 22:31.600
And really the whole idea was that, you know,

22:31.600 --> 22:36.360
we could use science to achieve unlimited progress,

22:37.440 --> 22:40.200
but this became associated with like capitalism

22:40.200 --> 22:41.880
and colonialism and stuff like that.

22:41.880 --> 22:45.440
So then postmodernism was just kind of this school of thought

22:45.440 --> 22:48.360
that emerged that was a critique of modernism.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.360
So it was a critique of like science thinking

22:50.360 --> 22:51.800
you could find objective truth

22:51.800 --> 22:54.000
that like there's really subjectivity.

22:54.000 --> 22:54.840
That's really important.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.520
There's maybe no objective truth

22:56.520 --> 22:59.880
and that whatever cultural culture believes is relative

22:59.880 --> 23:01.040
in a social construct.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.360
So there's cultural relativism,

23:02.360 --> 23:05.120
which has like no culture is really objectively better

23:05.120 --> 23:09.680
than others, which suggests that science is really not any,

23:10.440 --> 23:14.560
not in any way more fundamentally more solid

23:14.560 --> 23:18.240
than any religions or, you know, kind of folk mythologies.

23:18.240 --> 23:22.600
And so it was idea, postmodernism was good

23:22.600 --> 23:26.320
because there were a lot of things to critique about modernism,

23:26.320 --> 23:30.920
but it should have been a critique that improved, you know,

23:30.920 --> 23:34.200
how we think about these things and, you know,

23:34.200 --> 23:36.680
the limits of science or, you know,

23:36.680 --> 23:38.480
how certain we should be about things.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.440
But like I think it was really bad

23:41.440 --> 23:44.920
that it basically tried to eliminate this idea

23:44.960 --> 23:48.800
that there is this, you know, progress towards, you know,

23:48.800 --> 23:50.320
higher intelligence in the biosphere

23:50.320 --> 23:52.280
because I think it's a law that you can't,

23:52.280 --> 23:54.640
it's something that you see a principle of nature

23:54.640 --> 23:55.480
that is real.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.280
And if we don't understand that we have no idea

23:58.280 --> 24:01.320
how our civilization is evolving and where we're going,

24:01.320 --> 24:03.440
because it's not driven by some mystical force.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.160
It's not something where progress is like,

24:05.160 --> 24:07.240
just keeps happening like perfectly.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.240
It's this air correction process that's similar to AI.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.240
Life is facing challenges.

24:12.240 --> 24:15.600
It's like life is similar to an AI being trained on data

24:15.600 --> 24:19.120
and the data is the chaotic world around us.

24:19.120 --> 24:21.600
And so we keep being faced with problems

24:21.600 --> 24:23.640
and we keep having to overcome those problems

24:23.640 --> 24:26.440
and a lot of organisms die out during that,

24:26.440 --> 24:28.720
but the ones that can solve those problems

24:28.720 --> 24:31.520
get to make copies of themselves.

24:31.520 --> 24:35.760
And so we get all these designs of organisms and AIs

24:35.760 --> 24:39.720
and everything basically, there's a natural selection,

24:39.720 --> 24:41.800
applies not just to living organisms,

24:41.800 --> 24:45.400
but all designs in life and basically the dysfunctional

24:45.400 --> 24:48.120
and inefficient designs get filtered out.

24:48.120 --> 24:52.000
So we have these designs that get more and more robust

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
and that leads to this process of basically

24:55.000 --> 24:57.600
life-spreading inevitably, but it's not the straight line.

24:57.600 --> 25:01.000
It's always, there's always like two steps back

25:01.000 --> 25:03.680
for one step forward, but you can see the trend clearly

25:03.680 --> 25:06.640
and people like Ray Kurzweil have mapped out these trends

25:06.640 --> 25:10.240
of technological increase, but showing the technological

25:10.240 --> 25:15.120
increase as continuous with the complexity increase of life

25:15.120 --> 25:18.640
because life is really information processing.

25:18.640 --> 25:23.640
And so life is fundamentally different than inanimate matter,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.720
but AI, I wouldn't say is that fundamentally different

25:26.720 --> 25:27.640
from life.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.840
I mean, it's not, AI is not alive,

25:29.840 --> 25:31.280
but it's an extension of life.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.960
It's got designs that would never appear in nature

25:34.960 --> 25:37.240
unless life first emerged.

25:38.120 --> 25:41.800
So you had pre-modernism, which was supernatural.

25:41.800 --> 25:46.240
Then you had the modern movement, which was like science,

25:46.240 --> 25:48.120
but that science could solve everything.

25:48.120 --> 25:51.360
And then maybe some people took that idea too far

25:51.360 --> 25:53.080
and thought, you know, let's do eugenics.

25:53.080 --> 25:57.400
And the Nazis exploited that theory of increasing

25:57.400 --> 26:00.520
complexification and opening the evolution to justify

26:00.520 --> 26:02.760
like superior and inferior races.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.800
So there were all these cultural issues that led people

26:05.800 --> 26:09.080
to not like certain ideas,

26:09.080 --> 26:11.280
whether it was the Nazis using this idea

26:11.280 --> 26:12.960
of like evolutionary progress,

26:12.960 --> 26:17.960
or Tihar Deshardin was a priest, a Catholic priest

26:19.080 --> 26:22.080
that wrote this book that the church actually hated

26:22.080 --> 26:25.160
because they thought it was like against

26:25.160 --> 26:28.080
in Christian teaching, but it was that evolution,

26:28.080 --> 26:29.920
you know, everything's becoming more complex

26:29.920 --> 26:32.120
and that maybe God is in the future.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.680
Maybe there seems to be some sort of design,

26:34.720 --> 26:36.880
but that everything, for example,

26:36.880 --> 26:40.840
the network of humans is approaching

26:40.840 --> 26:42.800
some sort of global mind that will emerge

26:42.800 --> 26:44.560
and this process will continue.

26:44.560 --> 26:47.680
So Tihar Deshardin wrote this book called

26:47.680 --> 26:50.080
The Phenomenon of Man that put out this omega point theory

26:50.080 --> 26:52.600
that my book is largely based on

26:52.600 --> 26:54.080
and all the scientists who have been writing

26:54.080 --> 26:55.840
about this stuff, complexity scientists,

26:55.840 --> 26:57.800
people at the San Jose Institute,

26:57.800 --> 27:01.440
they all know that Tihar kind of put that idea out there

27:01.440 --> 27:02.880
and made it like really salient

27:02.880 --> 27:04.380
that the world's getting more complex.

27:04.380 --> 27:08.620
But people didn't like the religious associations

27:08.620 --> 27:11.780
that he made, but so then people were against it

27:11.780 --> 27:13.900
because they felt like if they acknowledged

27:13.900 --> 27:15.980
that the world was getting more complex

27:15.980 --> 27:19.300
and that it might be going towards some final goal state

27:19.300 --> 27:22.860
that that would just be like saying that God is right

27:22.860 --> 27:25.860
and God is real and there's a design,

27:25.860 --> 27:28.540
there's some sort of trajectory

27:28.540 --> 27:30.820
that's been planned from the beginning

27:30.820 --> 27:32.860
and people thought that was dangerous.

27:32.860 --> 27:35.780
So then there was a backlash against anybody saying

27:35.780 --> 27:37.500
anything that life had a purpose.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.940
They wanted to erase that language from biology.

27:39.940 --> 27:42.780
If you said life does this in any language

27:42.780 --> 27:44.420
that had a purpose, they wanted you to reward it

27:44.420 --> 27:48.180
to be like in this sort of neo-Darwinian language

27:48.180 --> 27:51.300
where you get rid of purpose and you say, oh no,

27:51.300 --> 27:54.180
like people were mad that people were asking little kids

27:54.180 --> 27:58.060
like why does the plant grow towards the sun

27:58.060 --> 28:00.100
and the kids would say because it wants the light

28:00.100 --> 28:03.220
and like there's evolutionary theorists who are,

28:03.220 --> 28:06.300
you know, kind of motivated by atheism.

28:06.300 --> 28:07.980
No, it doesn't want to grow towards the light.

28:07.980 --> 28:09.300
That's teleological language.

28:09.300 --> 28:10.260
That's purposeful language.

28:10.260 --> 28:11.860
You have to get that out of science.

28:11.860 --> 28:13.020
It grows towards the light

28:13.020 --> 28:14.340
because the ones that were worse

28:14.340 --> 28:16.260
that growing towards the light died off

28:16.260 --> 28:18.220
and that one just happened to be better

28:18.220 --> 28:20.420
and it just got out of control.

28:20.420 --> 28:22.700
But now because of AI and emergence

28:22.700 --> 28:25.460
and just engineering, when you talk like an engineer,

28:25.460 --> 28:29.340
you kind of talk about agents, even if they're not living,

28:29.380 --> 28:31.140
you kind of use this purposeful language

28:31.140 --> 28:33.780
so you can't really get rid of this language

28:33.780 --> 28:35.220
when you're talking about the universe

28:35.220 --> 28:38.700
because we do see these things and it's just natural

28:38.700 --> 28:42.100
but also it seems to be the way reality is

28:42.100 --> 28:43.780
at least this emergent phenomenon

28:43.780 --> 28:46.260
does have goals and purposes purposes.

28:47.700 --> 28:52.700
But yeah, so that backlash created this kind of

28:53.660 --> 28:56.700
whole worldview of meaninglessness

28:56.700 --> 28:59.020
and it was perfect for science.

28:59.020 --> 29:01.100
Science was already going in that kind of direction

29:01.100 --> 29:03.980
because it was at this war with religion a lot of times

29:03.980 --> 29:06.340
and so reductionism is just the idea that

29:08.540 --> 29:10.460
there's just a bunch of particles in the universe.

29:10.460 --> 29:12.900
It's a system of particles that are bouncing off each other

29:12.900 --> 29:14.620
and then you can use laws of motion

29:14.620 --> 29:16.660
to understand those interactions

29:16.660 --> 29:18.660
and then if you have those laws of motion,

29:18.660 --> 29:20.260
there's no room for human agency

29:20.260 --> 29:21.660
because everything would be determined

29:21.660 --> 29:23.980
by these fundamental equations

29:23.980 --> 29:26.500
that are specifying these trajectories in advance.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.980
But what my book argues is that that's not right.

29:28.980 --> 29:32.340
It's a simplified version of causality

29:32.340 --> 29:34.540
and dynamics in nature.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.980
And basically when agents emerge,

29:36.980 --> 29:40.180
they're these information processing systems

29:40.180 --> 29:43.620
that exists in a universe that's not completely deterministic.

29:43.620 --> 29:45.420
There's a lot of deterministic processes

29:45.420 --> 29:50.220
but at the very bottom level, there's random,

29:50.220 --> 29:53.060
there's an element of probability and randomness

29:53.060 --> 29:58.060
or stochasticity and so there is room for freedom

29:58.260 --> 29:59.780
and when agents emerge,

29:59.780 --> 30:04.780
they basically, when you're making a conscious decision,

30:07.220 --> 30:09.380
the results of your decision weren't determined

30:09.380 --> 30:12.900
by particle physics at that lower level.

30:12.900 --> 30:16.620
You can basically, you as a physical system,

30:18.220 --> 30:19.700
when you initiate a movement,

30:19.700 --> 30:21.980
it's not something that's violating the laws of physics.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.180
You're metabolizing energy that you ate before

30:24.180 --> 30:26.740
but you're not in an animate system that can't move.

30:26.780 --> 30:28.300
You can make these decisions

30:28.300 --> 30:31.180
and you're truly making these decisions in real time.

30:31.180 --> 30:35.900
So determinism in the classical sense,

30:35.900 --> 30:40.900
that kind of Laplace kind of made applied Newton's paradigm

30:41.220 --> 30:44.020
to the whole world and you have this strict determinism

30:44.020 --> 30:46.180
that's really determinism at the level of particles

30:46.180 --> 30:48.900
as opposed to other people talk about determinism

30:48.900 --> 30:52.660
saying that your actions are a result of your life preferences.

30:52.660 --> 30:56.140
I mean, your experiences and your beliefs and your genetics

30:56.180 --> 30:57.380
and that's a different discussion

30:57.380 --> 31:00.500
and people conflate those two types of determinism,

31:00.500 --> 31:02.420
biological versus physical determinism

31:02.420 --> 31:05.020
and physical determinism is a much stricter thing.

31:05.020 --> 31:07.500
That's saying there's no room for biological anything,

31:07.500 --> 31:09.780
even genes in that view aren't doing anything.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.940
You could reduce genes to particles.

31:11.940 --> 31:13.260
So it got really weird

31:13.260 --> 31:14.820
because you would see evolutionary theorists

31:14.820 --> 31:16.340
being reductionists and I would be like,

31:16.340 --> 31:17.820
if you wanna be a real reductionist,

31:17.820 --> 31:21.500
then like Jerry Coyne, genes don't even matter.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.900
Your whole field would be completely irrelevant.

31:23.900 --> 31:25.500
If you really knew what you were talking about,

31:25.500 --> 31:30.180
like the ideology that you're advocating for,

31:30.180 --> 31:32.700
we could just say genes are epiphenomenal too

31:32.700 --> 31:36.020
and just talk about particles.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.060
Sure.

31:37.060 --> 31:41.620
The book is a pushback on postmodernism and reductionism

31:41.620 --> 31:45.140
and kind of wanting to return to this narrative of science

31:46.340 --> 31:50.220
and not just science, but logic and I mean, arts,

31:50.220 --> 31:52.380
in this view, we see science as something,

31:53.060 --> 31:57.260
we see science as part of the evolutionary process

31:57.260 --> 31:59.860
because testing theories is just like how nature

31:59.860 --> 32:01.380
has been testing organisms.

32:01.380 --> 32:05.940
And in this book, organisms are basically embodied models

32:05.940 --> 32:08.900
or embodied theories about how to survive in the world.

32:08.900 --> 32:13.500
Your genome and your brain has encoded information

32:13.500 --> 32:15.940
that makes predictions about how to survive in the world.

32:15.940 --> 32:19.300
So basically scientific theories are just kind of

32:19.300 --> 32:24.300
extensions of organisms and they're kind of,

32:25.100 --> 32:29.900
it's kind of just an elaboration of this process of life,

32:29.900 --> 32:33.140
creating models that will allow it to survive

32:34.460 --> 32:38.300
in a world that has this tendency to break down.

32:38.300 --> 32:40.100
Otherwise, aside from life,

32:40.100 --> 32:42.100
because that's not the full story when people say,

32:42.100 --> 32:44.060
the world's going towards more disorder.

32:44.060 --> 32:45.740
What I discovered in the book

32:45.740 --> 32:48.780
is that there's this dialectical dynamic

32:48.780 --> 32:51.300
where you have order and disorder

32:51.300 --> 32:54.380
and kind of this tension

32:54.380 --> 32:59.380
and it's because life has to always evade this tendency

33:02.140 --> 33:05.620
towards disorder that life spreads through the universe

33:05.620 --> 33:07.140
and the universe becomes more complex

33:07.140 --> 33:08.740
because you have life spreading.

33:09.900 --> 33:13.260
So if you didn't have that tendency towards disorder,

33:13.260 --> 33:15.980
there would be no evolutionary pressure

33:15.980 --> 33:18.660
towards designs that are more functional

33:18.660 --> 33:20.340
that can survive better in the world.

33:20.340 --> 33:22.260
So you need the tendency towards disorder

33:22.260 --> 33:24.100
described by the second law of thermodynamics

33:24.100 --> 33:27.500
to have this whole complexification process work.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.060
But that's one big insight of the book

33:29.060 --> 33:31.300
that almost no people talk about.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.140
I mean, this dialectical dynamics.

33:33.140 --> 33:35.900
You need the constraint on the system.

33:35.900 --> 33:36.820
Problems create progress.

33:36.820 --> 33:37.780
That's Popper's principle.

33:37.780 --> 33:39.260
It's a big, yeah.

33:39.260 --> 33:41.060
Yeah, so, yep.

33:41.060 --> 33:43.780
And so this whole idea,

33:43.780 --> 33:46.100
everybody was against this idea of teleology,

33:46.100 --> 33:49.700
which was just a word for continual inevitable progress

33:49.700 --> 33:51.980
and complexification towards some higher people.

33:51.980 --> 33:53.140
And I understand why it's

33:53.140 --> 33:54.660
because they thought it was a supernatural idea,

33:54.660 --> 33:57.060
but now I'm saying it's not supernatural.

33:58.140 --> 34:00.220
And people are saying like evolution is blind.

34:00.220 --> 34:01.140
That was wrong too.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.820
So it's just more complicated.

34:02.820 --> 34:05.700
There is this tendency towards progress

34:05.700 --> 34:09.340
and the whole system isn't conscious at this point.

34:09.340 --> 34:10.180
I don't believe it is,

34:10.180 --> 34:12.340
but there is an intelligence distributed

34:12.340 --> 34:14.900
throughout this network that we call the biosphere.

34:14.900 --> 34:17.220
And so you do see this tendency towards that,

34:17.220 --> 34:19.780
but it happens through mistakes

34:19.780 --> 34:22.300
that basically get corrected

34:22.300 --> 34:24.780
if you look at the whole biosphere as a system

34:24.780 --> 34:27.620
and you look at organisms dying

34:27.620 --> 34:28.980
and some living and reproducing.

34:28.980 --> 34:30.100
If you look at natural selection

34:30.100 --> 34:34.220
as basically the biosphere doing its own scientific testing,

34:34.220 --> 34:36.140
you have this new story of life.

34:36.140 --> 34:40.500
And you see that evolution actually does have this tendency

34:40.500 --> 34:41.860
towards more complexity.

34:41.860 --> 34:46.860
Why? Because as that natural selection process proceeds,

34:47.860 --> 34:50.420
knowledge from the successful,

34:50.420 --> 34:51.340
when I say knowledge,

34:51.340 --> 34:53.020
I'm not just talking about human knowledge,

34:53.020 --> 34:54.620
although that's part of it.

34:54.620 --> 34:59.420
But when animals that are less adapted,

34:59.420 --> 35:01.660
more dysfunctional designs die out

35:01.660 --> 35:03.940
and the better designs stay,

35:03.940 --> 35:07.300
the genome, the genomes in the biosphere

35:07.300 --> 35:09.940
are also accumulating knowledge about how to survive.

35:09.980 --> 35:13.300
So when I say the evolutionary process creates knowledge,

35:13.300 --> 35:16.500
I'm talking about the evolutionary process creates knowledge

35:16.500 --> 35:20.300
in genes, in brains, in cultural memory,

35:20.300 --> 35:25.420
and then now digital memory, like the internet.

35:25.420 --> 35:27.460
In cultural memory, I mean like books and stuff.

35:27.460 --> 35:29.220
So when you look at the trajectory of evolution,

35:29.220 --> 35:31.140
it's really this emergence of these

35:31.140 --> 35:33.660
information processing systems and memory systems.

35:33.660 --> 35:35.100
So you have the emergence of life,

35:35.100 --> 35:37.460
you have genes, then you have the emergence of brains,

35:37.460 --> 35:38.580
you have neural memory,

35:38.580 --> 35:40.180
then you have the emergence of societies,

35:40.180 --> 35:41.380
you have cultural memory.

35:41.380 --> 35:43.300
So you get like language

35:43.300 --> 35:45.540
and you get these ideas spreading from brain to brain

35:45.540 --> 35:46.980
through memes basically.

35:46.980 --> 35:49.140
We start telling stories

35:49.140 --> 35:50.980
and then you get the invention of books

35:50.980 --> 35:52.940
and written language and art.

35:52.940 --> 35:54.860
And it's all part of the same process

35:54.860 --> 35:57.940
of basically life exploring the design space

35:57.940 --> 36:01.180
because it's looking for solutions

36:01.180 --> 36:02.620
to this problem of survival.

36:02.620 --> 36:05.100
And at first it's doing it unconscious.

36:05.100 --> 36:06.460
And then when brains emerge,

36:06.460 --> 36:07.900
you have the emergence of consciousness

36:07.900 --> 36:09.820
and then we start to become aware

36:09.820 --> 36:11.420
of our need to survive.

36:11.420 --> 36:16.420
And we start, it's just another layer of our motivation

36:17.580 --> 36:20.020
to do what nature has already programmed us to do.

36:20.020 --> 36:21.780
And what the book argues is,

36:21.780 --> 36:23.260
because I always talk about these details,

36:23.260 --> 36:25.100
but I don't always give the bigger picture.

36:25.100 --> 36:28.060
A lot of it is because when you say this,

36:28.060 --> 36:29.500
the bigger things behind it,

36:29.500 --> 36:30.780
sometimes it turns people off.

36:30.780 --> 36:32.580
So I would save that stuff to the end

36:32.580 --> 36:33.940
or maybe not even talk about it all

36:33.940 --> 36:35.860
if it's a technical talk.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.420
But the main point of the book is that this process

36:38.420 --> 36:42.660
implies that there's some sort of design or logic.

36:42.660 --> 36:43.900
There's some sort of,

36:43.900 --> 36:46.820
the universe isn't an arbitrary system.

36:46.820 --> 36:50.020
You can imagine the universe being full of marbles

36:50.020 --> 36:51.180
like that, the particle story.

36:51.180 --> 36:53.180
If the particle story was true

36:53.180 --> 36:58.180
and they were just little spherical objects bouncing around

36:58.980 --> 37:00.300
because when Boltzmann,

37:00.300 --> 37:03.140
when the second law of thermodynamics was,

37:03.140 --> 37:07.420
and this idea that Laplace had of everything is just particles

37:07.420 --> 37:08.620
at the lowest level.

37:08.620 --> 37:09.740
If you could zoom in on this,

37:09.740 --> 37:12.020
you would see these particles bouncing around.

37:12.020 --> 37:15.940
The periodic table wasn't even invented until like 1920.

37:15.940 --> 37:19.260
So people were, the model of particles were that,

37:19.260 --> 37:21.220
they were these perfect spherical balls

37:21.220 --> 37:23.380
that bounce off each other elastically,

37:23.380 --> 37:26.700
just like real pool balls or marbles would.

37:26.700 --> 37:27.740
And if we had that,

37:27.740 --> 37:31.620
you can have a bag of marbles bouncing around for eternity

37:31.620 --> 37:34.300
and it's not going to form the complexity of life.

37:34.300 --> 37:38.180
You need specific elements with specific properties,

37:38.180 --> 37:40.580
bonding properties like carbon and specific forces.

37:40.580 --> 37:45.380
You need all of these things to be very specific

37:46.380 --> 37:47.740
for all of this to work.

37:47.740 --> 37:49.940
And that's known as the fine tuning problem.

37:49.940 --> 37:52.380
And the fine tuning problem basically says that

37:52.380 --> 37:54.020
if you change any of these parameters,

37:54.020 --> 37:55.060
like the force of gravity,

37:55.060 --> 37:58.100
the force of the stronger weak nuclear force,

37:58.100 --> 38:00.660
even by hair, you wouldn't have life,

38:00.660 --> 38:02.700
but you probably wouldn't have any structure in the universe.

38:02.700 --> 38:04.700
You just would have just like my universe

38:04.700 --> 38:08.380
that expanded forever or contracted into, you know,

38:08.380 --> 38:10.220
singularity again, you wouldn't even have,

38:10.220 --> 38:11.220
it's not that you wouldn't have life,

38:11.220 --> 38:12.460
you wouldn't have structure.

38:13.820 --> 38:16.380
So then the, so, so the book makes the argument though,

38:16.380 --> 38:19.460
first it makes the argument that there is this new cosmic

38:19.460 --> 38:22.340
narrative where the universe is becoming more complex.

38:22.340 --> 38:23.700
And that involves, you know,

38:23.700 --> 38:25.780
the emergence of planets and stars,

38:25.780 --> 38:28.180
because planets, you need planets to have life.

38:28.180 --> 38:30.220
You need stars to provide the energy for life.

38:30.220 --> 38:33.140
You need stars to fuse the simple elements together

38:33.140 --> 38:37.260
to get the elements that are in living organisms and biology.

38:37.260 --> 38:41.660
And so, but then you get the emergence of life

38:41.660 --> 38:44.500
and then you get information processing systems in the world.

38:44.500 --> 38:48.780
And then life begins to slowly spread.

38:48.780 --> 38:50.700
And because of this evolutionary process

38:50.700 --> 38:53.140
being this knowledge accumulation process,

38:53.140 --> 38:55.100
it just keeps learning and modeling the world.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.660
And as it's extracting information

38:56.660 --> 38:59.460
about the world around it, it just keeps expanding.

38:59.460 --> 39:02.100
And that's what we're seeing now with like us

39:02.100 --> 39:03.940
leaving the planet to go into space.

39:03.940 --> 39:06.140
It's something that was part of the trajectory.

39:06.140 --> 39:10.500
It's not the smart idea of a billionaire or something.

39:10.500 --> 39:14.660
It's what would happen on any biosphere

39:14.660 --> 39:19.660
with intelligent creatures who have discovered science

39:20.380 --> 39:23.300
and discovered thermodynamics, for example,

39:23.300 --> 39:28.020
because any advanced intelligence will learn

39:28.020 --> 39:32.300
that their days are numbered unless they get off the planet.

39:32.300 --> 39:33.780
So what I'm saying is that we have to have

39:33.780 --> 39:35.140
a new picture of the universe.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.700
There is some sort of design.

39:36.700 --> 39:39.140
It's almost like life is like AI.

39:39.140 --> 39:42.380
It's almost like life is like the system being trained

39:42.380 --> 39:45.060
and life shouldn't be seen as separate from the universe.

39:45.060 --> 39:46.060
It's part of the universe.

39:46.060 --> 39:47.900
It's actually the universe.

39:47.900 --> 39:51.220
Universe is simplest components organizing themselves

39:51.220 --> 39:54.900
into a functional form that can experience itself.

39:54.940 --> 39:58.140
So life is the universe's conduit or vehicle

39:58.140 --> 40:00.340
for experiencing itself.

40:00.340 --> 40:03.180
And that's a very different story

40:03.180 --> 40:05.060
and it raises all kinds of implications.

40:05.060 --> 40:06.700
And some people would reject it flat out

40:06.700 --> 40:07.820
and be like, yeah, you're talking about God.

40:07.820 --> 40:09.020
You're saying that it has a design

40:09.020 --> 40:10.260
and that implies a designer.

40:10.260 --> 40:12.140
I'm done with your theory.

40:12.140 --> 40:14.540
But what I would say to that is when you look

40:14.540 --> 40:16.180
at this argument and you look at the trends,

40:16.180 --> 40:18.900
it does seem like this story is the true story.

40:18.900 --> 40:21.220
Like we have to accept that or we have,

40:21.220 --> 40:24.460
it has to at least, I think if you do a Bayesian analysis,

40:24.500 --> 40:27.220
which just is analysis of the evidence for each theory

40:27.220 --> 40:30.060
that this theory would come out on top.

40:30.060 --> 40:32.700
And the funny thing is though,

40:32.700 --> 40:33.860
where people were rejecting it,

40:33.860 --> 40:36.620
if you say, oh, but we don't necessarily need a designer.

40:36.620 --> 40:39.180
There are theories of cosmological natural selection

40:39.180 --> 40:42.180
where there is more that you need to explain

40:42.180 --> 40:43.380
about the fine-tuning problem,

40:43.380 --> 40:46.420
but you don't need to introduce a God,

40:46.420 --> 40:48.820
at least not a God from like an organized religion.

40:48.820 --> 40:51.020
I mean, and I say that in that way

40:51.020 --> 40:52.580
because you have the simulation theory,

40:52.580 --> 40:55.820
which argues that we're a creation of an intelligent agent.

40:55.820 --> 40:58.420
So what I realized right in the book

40:58.420 --> 40:59.860
is that the simulation theory

40:59.860 --> 41:03.660
and intelligent creator theory are effectively the same theory.

41:03.660 --> 41:04.860
And that now that we understand

41:04.860 --> 41:07.180
that we can create simulations with agents,

41:07.180 --> 41:09.660
possibly conscious agents we don't know,

41:09.660 --> 41:10.940
then scientifically,

41:10.940 --> 41:13.060
since we've demonstrated that it has happened,

41:13.060 --> 41:16.060
we have to take the possibility,

41:16.060 --> 41:18.420
we have to consider a new scientific theory

41:18.420 --> 41:19.780
that we're such a creation.

41:20.260 --> 41:23.860
And there's epistemological justification for that

41:23.860 --> 41:24.740
because we did it.

41:24.740 --> 41:25.620
But here's the funny thing.

41:25.620 --> 41:26.540
Before we did it,

41:26.540 --> 41:28.980
there wasn't as much justification to say

41:28.980 --> 41:31.660
that we needed to take the creator theory seriously.

41:31.660 --> 41:34.420
But once we have created simulations

41:34.420 --> 41:37.060
and we know that that's possible in this physical world,

41:37.060 --> 41:40.020
we immediately have to write down a new theory

41:40.020 --> 41:41.780
that we are such a thing.

41:41.780 --> 41:46.420
And so basically this says the atheists,

41:46.420 --> 41:48.780
the theory that there's no designer fine-tuning,

41:50.780 --> 41:53.420
there's the appearance of a design.

41:53.420 --> 41:55.620
First of all, there's something that needs to be explained.

41:55.620 --> 41:56.460
And to do that,

41:56.460 --> 41:58.900
we have to understand why these laws and not others.

41:58.900 --> 42:01.340
So we have to think bigger than the universe.

42:01.340 --> 42:03.620
And then so we have these different options.

42:03.620 --> 42:05.060
Is it a creator?

42:05.060 --> 42:08.700
Is it a multiverse explanation

42:08.700 --> 42:12.340
where maybe there's this large ensemble of universes

42:12.340 --> 42:17.340
and we're just in one out of a multiverse

42:17.740 --> 42:18.820
that's mostly lifeless,

42:18.820 --> 42:21.220
which is in the atheist position,

42:21.220 --> 42:23.620
or cosmological natural section,

42:23.620 --> 42:25.300
which we'll talk about later,

42:25.300 --> 42:28.660
or the simulation theory that we're made by an agent,

42:28.660 --> 42:29.740
intelligent agent.

42:31.220 --> 42:33.580
And then maybe there's even another theory from that.

42:33.580 --> 42:38.020
But my point is you can't say that there's no design

42:38.020 --> 42:41.500
and given what we know about the universe,

42:41.500 --> 42:43.260
you can't say this is the only universe

42:43.260 --> 42:44.420
and there's no design.

42:44.420 --> 42:47.340
Because that would be the most improbable thing

42:47.340 --> 42:49.460
that there's one universe.

42:49.460 --> 42:50.620
It's random.

42:50.620 --> 42:53.220
And then it just happens to have the parameters

42:53.220 --> 42:54.300
that would allow for life

42:54.300 --> 42:55.860
when it could have been everything else.

42:55.860 --> 42:57.140
And that's why no one says that.

42:57.140 --> 42:59.180
That's why the multiverse theory

42:59.180 --> 43:00.980
is the rebuttal against this now,

43:00.980 --> 43:04.060
because to destroy the God theory,

43:04.060 --> 43:08.060
you need a multiverse with all of these other options.

43:08.060 --> 43:09.140
Here's the bad thing about it.

43:09.140 --> 43:10.340
Soon as you introduce that,

43:10.340 --> 43:13.260
you get wilder ideas than a creator.

43:13.260 --> 43:15.780
The ideas of every universe existing,

43:15.860 --> 43:17.340
if you're doing every possible thing,

43:17.340 --> 43:20.020
here's the tricky, here's the funny thing too.

43:20.020 --> 43:21.580
If you believe the multiverse,

43:21.580 --> 43:22.820
and we've also demonstrated

43:22.820 --> 43:25.380
that we can create new virtual worlds

43:25.380 --> 43:26.500
that might have a conscious agent,

43:26.500 --> 43:28.700
we can create our own universes.

43:28.700 --> 43:31.820
The multiverse theory then starts to include gods too,

43:31.820 --> 43:34.220
because it includes people who create universes,

43:34.220 --> 43:36.900
just like where we could or we have,

43:36.900 --> 43:38.620
but we haven't created conscious agents.

43:38.620 --> 43:40.300
Let's say we could,

43:40.300 --> 43:45.140
then you, in the infinitude of all possible universes,

43:45.140 --> 43:46.660
you have universes with creators

43:46.660 --> 43:50.100
creating new universes nested in those universes.

43:50.100 --> 43:51.500
If you follow Occam's razor,

43:51.500 --> 43:53.540
the multiverse theory gives you God,

43:53.540 --> 43:54.740
created the universes,

43:54.740 --> 43:58.660
it gives you every universe you could conceive of and more.

43:58.660 --> 44:02.340
So it seems to be worse on Occam's razor grounds.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.620
It introduces all of these things.

44:04.620 --> 44:05.740
It gives us the same thing

44:05.740 --> 44:06.900
that the God creator thing was.

44:06.900 --> 44:10.140
So what I argue in the book is that

44:11.060 --> 44:12.420
we have to explain the design.

44:12.420 --> 44:14.380
You can explain it playing with infinities

44:14.380 --> 44:15.980
with your multiverse theory,

44:15.980 --> 44:19.500
but I don't think that's the best explanation.

44:19.500 --> 44:23.100
I think, and we can get into that more later,

44:23.100 --> 44:24.660
but I just, so yeah,

44:24.660 --> 44:27.220
maybe we should just talk more about the meat,

44:27.220 --> 44:29.220
you know, I know, or the practical stuff.

44:29.220 --> 44:32.140
I actually talked a lot about the tech.

44:32.140 --> 44:32.980
Yeah, you did.

44:32.980 --> 44:34.180
I didn't talk about the technical details,

44:34.180 --> 44:35.940
but I kind of summed it all up, I guess.

44:35.940 --> 44:38.460
Yeah, you like touched and brought in,

44:38.460 --> 44:40.740
I mean, I could talk to you for a long time

44:40.740 --> 44:42.660
about any one of those things you brought up.

44:42.700 --> 44:43.980
Well, before we get into the,

44:43.980 --> 44:46.540
because I do want to segue into the practical in a moment,

44:46.540 --> 44:50.660
but before we do, just perhaps to put a button on it.

44:50.660 --> 44:54.420
And you just mentioned a few minutes ago, Bayesianism.

44:54.420 --> 44:56.220
I spoke with Carl Friston last week.

44:56.220 --> 44:57.260
I interviewed him.

44:57.260 --> 44:58.100
Yeah, that's not out.

44:58.100 --> 45:00.860
Yeah, it will be out in the next couple of days.

45:00.860 --> 45:04.580
So for viewers watching this, that one will be out already.

45:04.580 --> 45:07.620
So if you want to deep dive into,

45:07.620 --> 45:10.220
and Friston is one of the most cited people in the book,

45:10.220 --> 45:12.460
you know, you bring him in quite often.

45:12.460 --> 45:13.780
And actually, I think,

45:13.780 --> 45:17.380
because I first read romance or reality around the holidays,

45:17.380 --> 45:18.620
and I had heard of Friston before,

45:18.620 --> 45:21.820
but how much he's in the book, really.

45:21.820 --> 45:23.020
Really put him on your radar.

45:23.020 --> 45:25.220
Put him up to the top of the list.

45:25.220 --> 45:26.060
Yeah.

45:26.060 --> 45:28.780
So you inspired me to speak with Carl Friston,

45:28.780 --> 45:29.620
you know, so thank you.

45:29.620 --> 45:30.620
That's awesome.

45:30.620 --> 45:33.300
And it was a great conversation, very high level.

45:33.300 --> 45:34.140
Oh my God.

45:34.140 --> 45:36.980
I did not know the term high research load

45:36.980 --> 45:38.700
before talking to Friston.

45:38.700 --> 45:43.060
That means you need all these different pieces of information

45:43.060 --> 45:45.020
from different disciplines coming together

45:45.020 --> 45:46.460
in order to understand what he's talking about.

45:46.460 --> 45:48.420
Because he's a neuroscientist,

45:48.420 --> 45:49.980
he's bringing neuroscience,

45:49.980 --> 45:51.140
he's bringing information theory,

45:51.140 --> 45:53.820
he's bringing stuff from physics.

45:53.820 --> 45:56.660
But one thing that I thought was quite interesting

45:56.660 --> 45:59.900
is that, and he wrote a blurb for your book also,

45:59.900 --> 46:02.500
he said it was, I think a synthesis of his favorite thing,

46:02.500 --> 46:05.140
something that degree, which is amazing.

46:05.140 --> 46:08.500
And I think I was also surprised,

46:08.500 --> 46:13.020
he said that it doesn't get any more fundamental or simpler

46:13.020 --> 46:15.620
than the free energy principle.

46:15.620 --> 46:16.980
Which I thought was really interesting,

46:16.980 --> 46:19.260
because I asked him, that was sort of in response to

46:19.260 --> 46:24.060
when I brought up Jeremy England's dissipative adaptation.

46:24.060 --> 46:24.900
Yeah.

46:26.340 --> 46:28.460
Which he said, I think to a degree,

46:28.460 --> 46:29.580
I hope this is correct,

46:30.700 --> 46:34.220
that that's one subset of the free energy principle.

46:34.220 --> 46:37.660
That would be like something the free energy principle describes,

46:37.700 --> 46:39.620
but that's one of many things

46:39.620 --> 46:44.140
that the free energy principle would have a descriptor for.

46:44.140 --> 46:45.820
Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up.

46:45.820 --> 46:46.940
I'm glad you said that too,

46:46.940 --> 46:49.860
because that's what I argued in the book.

46:49.860 --> 46:53.180
I don't know how much he thought about that before he read my book.

46:53.180 --> 46:55.380
That would be cool if that kind of...

46:55.380 --> 46:57.380
Because, you know,

46:57.380 --> 47:00.260
I mean, he probably knew of Jeremy England's work.

47:01.500 --> 47:02.420
But as far...

47:02.420 --> 47:04.340
Yeah, that's one thing I tried to do in chapter six,

47:04.340 --> 47:06.980
was to show that this dissipative adaptation process

47:06.980 --> 47:09.140
that's been used to explain the origin of life

47:09.140 --> 47:11.340
is a process of Bayesian inference.

47:11.340 --> 47:15.220
That was like the one big novel thing that I put in the book that...

47:17.940 --> 47:19.540
I don't always talk about it.

47:19.540 --> 47:20.940
You know, it's pretty technical,

47:20.940 --> 47:24.060
so it's not something that has been highlighted.

47:24.060 --> 47:27.980
But that it is a process of Bayesian inference,

47:27.980 --> 47:30.340
and we can look at all self-organization processes,

47:30.340 --> 47:32.660
as processes of inference.

47:32.660 --> 47:33.900
Please go on, Zach, if you need me.

47:33.900 --> 47:37.540
Yeah, so, well, and that was very useful for him to clear that up for me,

47:37.540 --> 47:41.700
because, you know, if you'll forgive my ignorance,

47:41.700 --> 47:46.100
I had thought that dissipative adaptation was something that was a sub...

47:46.100 --> 47:47.660
Free engineering principle was something that...

47:47.660 --> 47:49.100
You can look at it that way too.

47:49.100 --> 47:51.420
Yeah, so it's like, which way is this going?

47:51.420 --> 47:52.900
Yeah, it's all...

47:52.900 --> 47:55.740
And he actually, I think, specifically said

47:55.740 --> 48:00.700
that he was a little bit dismissive of the thermodynamic interpretation

48:00.700 --> 48:02.460
as that being the underlying idea.

48:02.460 --> 48:03.460
Yeah.

48:03.540 --> 48:07.500
And that the free engineering principle, I think, has far more applications

48:07.500 --> 48:08.860
than just that.

48:08.860 --> 48:11.620
So, do you have any thoughts about that?

48:11.620 --> 48:14.500
Yeah, yeah, so a colleague also mentioned this about him,

48:14.500 --> 48:20.820
which I think I knew, but it was interesting to hear this kind of emphasized,

48:20.820 --> 48:24.660
but that Carl likes to put, say, you know,

48:24.660 --> 48:26.700
everything in terms of inference,

48:26.700 --> 48:30.300
but doesn't like to reduce everything to evolution, for example.

48:30.300 --> 48:32.940
But you could say the same thing about thermodynamics.

48:33.140 --> 48:36.260
You know, that he doesn't want to reduce everything to thermodynamics.

48:36.260 --> 48:38.820
What my book tried to show is that the thermodynamic story

48:38.820 --> 48:42.580
and the evolutionary story and the inference story are the same story.

48:42.580 --> 48:45.020
And that inference processes are...

48:45.020 --> 48:46.860
And we'll talk about in detail what I mean by that,

48:46.860 --> 48:52.580
but that they are evolutionary processes and they are self-organization processes.

48:52.580 --> 48:54.700
So they're kind of dissipative processes.

48:54.700 --> 49:00.260
So it's pointless to be like, this is a subset of that.

49:00.260 --> 49:01.260
So...

49:01.260 --> 49:03.420
Well, in a way, he's right,

49:03.420 --> 49:13.500
because the origin of life mechanism is one instance of the free energy principle.

49:13.500 --> 49:16.060
But you could...

49:16.060 --> 49:21.980
So if he's talking about dissipative adaptation as an origin of life theory,

49:21.980 --> 49:23.700
it's a subset of a larger inference

49:23.700 --> 49:25.860
because dissipative adaptation is an inference process

49:25.860 --> 49:27.460
and this is one instantiation of that.

49:27.460 --> 49:29.460
It's just the origin of life.

49:29.460 --> 49:34.300
But you could also look at all inference processes

49:34.300 --> 49:37.140
as being dissipative adaptation processes at higher levels.

49:37.140 --> 49:41.700
So you could say the whole biosphere is evolving through dissipative adaptation

49:41.700 --> 49:45.180
because they're just adapting and as they adapt, they extract more energy.

49:45.180 --> 49:47.420
And if they use more energy, they're dissipating more energy.

49:47.420 --> 49:50.260
So you could look at the biosphere as a dissipative process.

49:50.260 --> 49:54.500
And before dissipative adaptation was a theory put forth by England,

49:54.500 --> 49:55.580
tons of people were saying this.

49:55.620 --> 49:59.820
Eric Cheyesson, Eric Smith, and here more with Santa Fe Institute,

49:59.820 --> 50:01.620
this whole thermodynamic narrative,

50:01.620 --> 50:05.420
it had been told much in detail way before Jeremy England.

50:05.420 --> 50:08.380
Jeremy England just came up with this specific equation

50:08.380 --> 50:10.660
about self-organizing molecules

50:10.660 --> 50:13.180
and demonstrated that you could simulate this

50:13.180 --> 50:14.860
and show that this is the case,

50:14.860 --> 50:21.300
that basically if you have a lump of particles driven by a force of energy

50:21.300 --> 50:26.140
and those particles have the right profile such that they interact

50:26.140 --> 50:28.900
like with life, you need carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrene.

50:28.900 --> 50:30.020
You need those molecules.

50:30.020 --> 50:35.460
For example, carbon makes bonds to four other elements or molecules.

50:35.460 --> 50:39.020
And if you don't have something that can bond to a lot of things,

50:39.020 --> 50:41.420
you can't get complex structures.

50:41.420 --> 50:44.220
So if you simulate the properties of those molecules,

50:44.220 --> 50:48.540
you can show that just a system being pushed by a flow of energy

50:48.580 --> 50:51.500
with the right properties will begin to organize.

50:51.500 --> 50:54.820
And as they organize, so that's really what we need to focus on

50:54.820 --> 50:58.660
is that that's the mechanism of self-organization.

50:58.660 --> 51:02.340
As a result of this process, because it takes physical work,

51:02.340 --> 51:04.820
I mean, stuff is happening when it's organizing itself,

51:04.820 --> 51:07.340
it has an energetic cost.

51:07.340 --> 51:13.300
So for that process to happen, to go against this tendency toward disorder,

51:13.300 --> 51:17.460
an organism or the system, maybe it's something that hasn't emerged,

51:17.460 --> 51:20.260
life hasn't emerged yet, but it's you're seeing like a proto organism,

51:20.260 --> 51:23.460
some sort of chemical, you know, autocatalytic network,

51:23.460 --> 51:26.340
some sort of chemical system that is self-sustaining.

51:26.340 --> 51:29.220
It has to get energy from the environment.

51:29.220 --> 51:33.460
So living systems have to extract energy from the environment to survive.

51:33.460 --> 51:38.060
And when they are extracting it to build that order to organize themselves,

51:38.060 --> 51:40.620
so that cost energy, that's the thing to understand.

51:40.620 --> 51:44.340
And when you're using that energy, it's always getting dissipated.

51:44.340 --> 51:48.300
It's always getting used up in the system's releasing heat.

51:48.300 --> 51:50.660
And that heat is entropy.

51:50.660 --> 51:54.060
So there's, I didn't get into it here, I'm kind of on purpose,

51:54.060 --> 51:55.900
but there's multiple definitions of entropy.

51:55.900 --> 51:58.060
There's entropy, which is dissipated energy.

51:58.060 --> 51:59.460
It's like heat entropy.

51:59.460 --> 52:02.100
And then there's entropy with the statistical definition,

52:02.100 --> 52:05.500
which just talks about disorder things and their different concepts.

52:05.500 --> 52:08.660
They really shouldn't even have the same name.

52:08.660 --> 52:14.340
Well, but, but, but the energy concept is kind of a subset of this disorder thing,

52:14.340 --> 52:20.580
but it just, it order form and that system release heat.

52:20.580 --> 52:23.140
So you can have the whole universe, if life's spreading,

52:23.140 --> 52:27.580
becoming more and more organized at the, at the whole global scale.

52:27.580 --> 52:29.980
While more heat is being generated.

52:29.980 --> 52:34.220
So whether entropy goes up or down, it depends on your definition of entropy.

52:34.220 --> 52:37.420
Heat entropy goes up because energy is always being used and spread out

52:37.420 --> 52:39.100
and you can't use that energy again.

52:39.100 --> 52:42.060
So if entropy is defined as the energy unavailable for work,

52:42.060 --> 52:46.700
that entropy is going up, entropy defined as organization, as disorder,

52:46.700 --> 52:47.820
that entropy is going down.

52:47.820 --> 52:50.940
So you have Boltzmann entropy going down as the world gets more complex

52:50.940 --> 52:53.860
and you have energy just being used up.

52:53.860 --> 52:55.820
And then that is called entropy.

52:55.820 --> 52:58.020
That's, that's a classical version of entropy.

52:58.020 --> 53:03.060
So my point is, and Jeremy England makes his point in his book,

53:03.060 --> 53:05.980
all of the evolutionary processes that happen in the biosphere

53:06.020 --> 53:09.020
are also using up energy from the sun.

53:09.020 --> 53:12.980
And as the biosphere becomes more complex, it uses more, it needs more energy.

53:12.980 --> 53:15.100
So it uses it.

53:15.100 --> 53:18.020
I think when you talk about dissipation too much, it gets the focus off.

53:18.020 --> 53:21.500
It makes it sound like life is trying to create entropy when it's not.

53:21.500 --> 53:24.500
It's trying to survive and it needs energy to survive.

53:24.500 --> 53:26.540
And entropy is the byproduct.

53:26.540 --> 53:28.420
So it's just like, art needs gas.

53:28.420 --> 53:29.860
It's not the goal to buy product.

53:29.860 --> 53:31.100
It's just exhaust.

53:31.140 --> 53:37.420
Yeah. So if you want to say the origin of life is an example of inference,

53:37.420 --> 53:40.340
that's right, and you have this dissipated adaptation mechanism,

53:40.540 --> 53:43.740
but you could also turn it around and be like, well,

53:45.620 --> 53:48.300
the inference process that Carl's describing in brains,

53:48.620 --> 53:51.420
which we'll quickly sum up in a second,

53:52.700 --> 53:55.300
is something that allows brains to better model the world

53:55.300 --> 53:56.540
so it can extract more energy.

53:56.540 --> 53:59.980
And then it is always extracting that energy and it's using that energy.

54:00.020 --> 54:04.460
So really, you have dissipated adaptation,

54:04.460 --> 54:08.220
which I believe is just another word for self-organization.

54:08.220 --> 54:10.180
It's thermodynamic self-organization.

54:10.180 --> 54:14.020
You have that on every level and that inference is also self-organization.

54:14.020 --> 54:19.100
So I think that there's things that are equivalent,

54:19.740 --> 54:22.060
learning and evolution

54:24.180 --> 54:26.940
and self-organization.

54:27.420 --> 54:29.620
Yeah. And so I think it's Bayesian inference.

54:29.620 --> 54:31.980
Evolution is, you know, variation and selection.

54:31.980 --> 54:37.020
And then self-organization is this dissipated adaptation.

54:37.020 --> 54:39.740
They're all the same things.

54:39.740 --> 54:42.980
So it doesn't really you don't you don't need to like put one

54:44.700 --> 54:45.900
having priority over the other.

54:45.900 --> 54:47.180
And that was a mistake a lot of people made

54:47.180 --> 54:48.940
because when Jeremy England's working that stuff,

54:48.940 --> 54:50.580
they're like, oh, it's well, it's all thermodynamics.

54:50.580 --> 54:52.180
The world just wants to create instruments.

54:52.180 --> 54:54.460
No, the world is organizing itself

54:54.820 --> 54:58.820
and it does it through this process and this mechanism.

54:59.100 --> 55:01.580
You can look at one aspect where you go to the systems learning.

55:01.580 --> 55:04.220
You can look at another aspect or say the system's using energy

55:04.220 --> 55:08.100
and creating entry and you can use another aspect and say it's adapting.

55:08.100 --> 55:10.740
It's evolving. Yeah. All. Yeah.

55:10.740 --> 55:12.580
You have a great time.

55:12.580 --> 55:13.540
It's not even an equation.

55:13.540 --> 55:14.940
It's just much equivalences in the book.

55:14.940 --> 55:17.180
It's adaptation equals statistical correlation,

55:17.180 --> 55:21.340
equals mutual information, equals model optimization, equals creation.

55:21.500 --> 55:25.180
I mean, that's I mean, but you're that gets to the crux

55:25.180 --> 55:28.220
of what we're talking about here is that.

55:28.220 --> 55:30.620
And I actually find this

55:30.620 --> 55:33.420
not specifically with with the gentleman we're talking about now,

55:33.420 --> 55:36.460
but if you may like zoom out a little bit,

55:36.460 --> 55:38.740
the word games that get played a lot.

55:38.740 --> 55:41.180
And I mean, it's just because that you need different

55:41.180 --> 55:44.340
terminal, different terms for different concepts, right?

55:44.340 --> 55:46.220
But a lot of times you start

55:46.220 --> 55:48.300
when you think about it a little bit more deeply,

55:48.300 --> 55:50.500
you realize, oh, that's pretty much the same thing.

55:50.500 --> 55:54.100
You know, we're just we're using languages is fungible

55:54.100 --> 55:55.260
and we're kind of getting around it.

55:55.260 --> 55:57.740
But I do and I mean, we could talk so much more about this stuff.

55:57.740 --> 56:00.340
I have a lot of questions in this area that I'm going to have to speak

56:00.340 --> 56:03.540
because I do want to focus while we have some remaining time.

56:03.540 --> 56:05.340
It looks like part three might not happen today.

56:05.340 --> 56:08.140
But what should we do with this information?

56:08.140 --> 56:10.820
If we might go from crawling, you know, we have

56:11.540 --> 56:14.820
organized some information and people should get the book to get all these details

56:14.820 --> 56:19.220
for themselves and also read your read your blog posts on Road to Omega,

56:19.220 --> 56:22.100
the Substack and Psychology Today as well.

56:23.220 --> 56:24.140
What do we do?

56:24.140 --> 56:26.460
Like, how do we make this practical?

56:26.460 --> 56:28.980
How do we bring this information into our day to day lives?

56:29.540 --> 56:32.700
Yes, so you can talk about that while I explain

56:33.380 --> 56:36.380
first sense theory in the context of that, because it's really.

56:38.940 --> 56:42.380
Yeah, first sense work and so he has the Bayesian brain

56:42.380 --> 56:45.700
hypothesis and the free energy principle, which is just the same

56:45.980 --> 56:48.900
Bayesian brain hypothesis, but apply the things without brains.

56:49.460 --> 56:52.940
And I realized there's so much here combined with the other work that I was,

56:53.060 --> 56:56.260
you know, looking at, you know, self organization and thermodynamics.

56:56.540 --> 56:58.940
There's so much here to inform practical living.

56:58.940 --> 57:03.180
And it's just crazy that, you know, no one has kind of

57:03.860 --> 57:06.940
used that information to not many people.

57:06.940 --> 57:09.500
I won't say no one, but not many people have used that information

57:09.500 --> 57:11.300
to inform people on how to live life.

57:11.300 --> 57:13.060
And the reason is because of the free energy principle.

57:13.060 --> 57:15.060
It's funny, Carl says it's simple and I agree with him.

57:15.060 --> 57:16.300
It is the simplest thing.

57:16.300 --> 57:19.180
But if you read the papers, it's the most complicated.

57:19.180 --> 57:20.980
thing in the world. Yeah, I disagree.

57:20.980 --> 57:24.540
I mean, it might be the most fundamental, but I explain why.

57:24.540 --> 57:27.700
So it's like both things are true at the same time.

57:27.700 --> 57:31.420
And it's like it is insanely complicated if you want to make it.

57:31.420 --> 57:34.260
But the general principle can is super simple.

57:34.740 --> 57:38.820
But I don't think people have applied it because they don't understand it.

57:38.820 --> 57:39.860
And I didn't understand it.

57:39.860 --> 57:43.540
I wasn't even sure if it was like legitimate science.

57:43.540 --> 57:45.580
That when I first looked at it, because it kept using these

57:45.580 --> 57:50.620
thermodynamic terms like free energy, which were defined not thermodynamically.

57:50.620 --> 57:53.620
It's like information theoretic free energy and comes from machine learning.

57:53.620 --> 57:55.860
It's based on thermodynamic free energy.

57:55.860 --> 57:57.580
But so I was like, what's this guy talking about?

57:57.580 --> 58:01.060
Like minimizing free energy in this way, but that's not free energy.

58:01.060 --> 58:05.260
So yeah, you just have to accept that new language will emerge

58:05.260 --> 58:08.260
because you need new words to explain new ideas.

58:08.580 --> 58:09.980
And it often comes from other fields.

58:09.980 --> 58:12.260
So there's going to be that confusion.

58:12.300 --> 58:16.260
And you just have to embrace all that and read the read the literature.

58:16.660 --> 58:19.060
And once you read it, you start understanding there's a lot of value.

58:19.060 --> 58:20.780
But basically, here's the story.

58:20.780 --> 58:22.820
You have this tendency towards disorder in the world.

58:22.820 --> 58:25.980
And it was great because I was already, you know, finished with part one

58:25.980 --> 58:26.780
all the thermodynamics.

58:26.780 --> 58:29.900
If I had already said all this stuff and talked about cybernetics

58:29.900 --> 58:31.740
and systems have them having to model the world.

58:31.740 --> 58:33.180
And then I found the free energy principle.

58:33.180 --> 58:36.780
And it was like everything that I was like the path I was down.

58:36.940 --> 58:39.060
It was like completed by that.

58:39.060 --> 58:41.620
So I'd already saw this picture before that.

58:41.620 --> 58:45.180
But basically, but it's cool because that's how Friston frames it.

58:45.860 --> 58:48.380
And for people who don't know, he's the most cited neuroscientist in the world.

58:48.380 --> 58:51.220
He developed these statistical techniques for analyzing FMI data

58:51.220 --> 58:53.500
that all FMI studies use pretty much.

58:54.100 --> 58:58.540
And so you have this tendency towards decay.

58:58.540 --> 58:59.820
So how do you explain life?

58:59.820 --> 59:01.660
He wants to explain the organization in the world.

59:01.660 --> 59:05.700
He says, OK, specifically organisms, which are the most interesting to us.

59:05.980 --> 59:09.980
They evade this tendency towards decay because they model the world

59:10.260 --> 59:12.420
and they because they have to survive.

59:12.420 --> 59:15.020
And if they don't have a map of the world, you can't survive in the world.

59:15.020 --> 59:17.620
So the the the brain has to create a map.

59:18.140 --> 59:20.260
And the free energy principle basically extend that and said,

59:20.260 --> 59:23.900
even organisms without brains, how encode some sort of map of the environment

59:24.300 --> 59:29.220
in their dynamics, in their genome, maybe in their metabolic processes

59:29.220 --> 59:32.260
and general functional dynamics at the system level.

59:33.340 --> 59:36.460
But so basically, it's the story of how do we, you know,

59:36.460 --> 59:38.780
how does life emerge and survive?

59:39.180 --> 59:40.180
It emerges.

59:41.380 --> 59:44.540
Well, OK, so yeah, how does life survive?

59:44.540 --> 59:45.860
Let's start there.

59:45.860 --> 59:47.780
Life survived because that's the model of the world.

59:47.940 --> 59:50.900
And if its model isn't accurate, if its map of the world isn't accurate,

59:50.900 --> 59:52.300
the thing is probably going to die.

59:52.300 --> 59:54.660
If you you have a wrong map of the world and something comes out

59:54.660 --> 59:58.180
and kills you because you didn't know about that variable, you're dead.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:03.260
And then that design of you is gone unless you've made copies of yourself.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.380
But that's a bit of a different design.

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:08.060
And the people who do have good maps are successful.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:11.220
So those good maps keep getting encoded into the biosphere

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:12.380
and to the network of organisms.

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:15.180
And we keep updating our maps through natural selection.

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:16.340
People die out.

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.180
But when you have brains, you don't.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.060
Things don't have to die to get better maps in the biosphere.

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.660
You can learn during your life.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:23.980
Things without brains, they can't learn.

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:27.740
So if they're born in a certain way, they just have those characteristics.

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.860
But so we can learn.

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:35.700
But so what is simple about it is Carl Friston is basically saying this.

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:39.620
All organisms minimize what's called free energy.

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.660
Don't get hung up on you for the audience.

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:44.060
Don't get hung up on the word free energy.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:51.300
He's saying in this context, free energy is defined as the model's prediction error.

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:55.460
So the amount of mismatch between your model and reality is getting minimized.

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.700
So forget free energy minimization.

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:03.300
Just let's say that Carl Friston, Sirius says your model error needs to be minimized

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:04.820
or else you'll die.

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.620
And that we're always trying to do that.

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:12.340
And if we don't pay attention to the evidence, like if we don't.

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:20.580
OK, so for example, someone who has a belief that is contradicted by tons of evidence

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:24.420
and tons of stuff they're seeing in the real world where it's just completely like,

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:29.300
let's say you believe in purple fairy god and that's just your belief.

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.460
Oh, that's hard one to disprove.

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:34.020
Let's say you let's just do something a little more grounded.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:40.020
Let's say you think that gravity doesn't exist in Antarctica or something.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:45.500
You go to Antarctica and you you throw a ball from like a roof and it exists.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:48.420
If you if you don't update your model, if you don't go, oh, yeah,

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:50.380
gravities exist because I came here and I did that test.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:54.820
And if you're denying the evidence that reality is giving you,

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:58.660
then you're not minimizing your model's prediction error.

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:03.420
You're you're you're choosing to stick with a model

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.340
that has uncertainty or air or ignorance.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:11.300
And if you're living that way, you don't have an optimal map of the world.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.180
And if you don't have an optimal map of the world, you're not living optimally.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:19.620
So the book, you know, this is really what the second book's about

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.460
and what I write about on Substack.

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:24.060
But because I didn't have enough time with the deadline

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.580
to really incorporate all this, you know, practical living stuff.

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:31.620
But basically what this whole story tells you is that for or, you know,

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:36.460
ordered things for for sentient, any sentient system to exist in the world,

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:42.100
to continue existing, it has to be updating its map of the world to be more accurate.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.100
And that's just called minimizing free energy.

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:47.420
Free energy is an information theoretic term between the difference

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.580
between your model and reality.

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:54.540
So we always want to be being our ignorance and we don't live that way a lot.

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.780
We're not always updating based on our knowledge.

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:57.980
We sometimes ignore it.

01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:59.340
We have confirmation bias.

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.580
We want to keep that out.

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.500
And if we do that, we're living suboptimally.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:06.420
So basically, there's different principles that you can follow.

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.340
Be curious. That's one thing.

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:10.380
There's a great paper by a friend of mine

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:18.460
who wrote a paper with Carl Friston on active inferencing curiosity.

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:23.660
So you got to be curious because your model is always going to be limited.

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:28.060
None of us have infinite computational storage space.

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.380
So we can't know everything about the world.

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:30.500
The world's super complex.

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.820
There's no way to know everything.

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:33.220
So we're all living in ignorance.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:39.020
The best we can do is try to make our model as accurate as possible while living life.

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.020
You know, you can't spend all of your time learning everything.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:45.700
So you have to decide how much information you want to acquire.

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:48.420
But we should always be living in that way.

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.820
We shouldn't get too stuck to our beliefs.

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:56.940
We should always be open to new ideas because our model is limited.

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:58.540
It's going to have ignorance.

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.940
And once you accept that, then, for example,

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:07.500
let's say people are asking questions about the origin of the coronavirus.

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:11.980
It became un-PC to talk about a lab leak theory.

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:15.140
That's very bad, according to this approach,

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.820
because it could possibly be the theory.

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:21.260
And maybe it's not, but you got to look into it.

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:24.260
And if you notice, oh, there's no chance that it was a lab leak thing,

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:30.540
then you can go, OK, you know, based on this stuff, there's very little reason,

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.980
almost no reason to think that was the case.

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:35.900
But that wasn't true when people analyzed it, what came out.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:37.500
And then seeing in everybody had it.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:41.220
And they didn't even like really say, oh, well, we did a terrible thing

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.540
by telling everybody, do not think this like it is wrong.

01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.260
Think to think this way.

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:48.380
And then everybody started talking about, well, it could be a lab leak.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:53.380
And there are tons of reasons why, you know, there's I'm, you know,

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:57.820
I won't get into the political stuff, but the point is.

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:03.100
A lot of people like Flat Earthers make this problem

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.740
where they're not living in reality.

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:07.380
They're not updating their model of the world.

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:09.620
They're just denying what's out there.

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:14.220
But you also have other situations where scientists

01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:16.180
maybe have this reductionist ideology.

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:19.860
They're just over certain about life is transient.

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:21.020
It's going to come and go.

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.700
There's no such thing as free will because it goes against our Newtonian

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.380
understanding of the world.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:29.900
That's a failure of being a good Bayesian to you because they are too certain.

01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:32.900
And if you look at history, every paradigm, every model,

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.460
every theory has proven to have some inaccuracies.

01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:39.380
Thanks from, you know, Newton's laws, relativity,

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:42.300
quantum mechanics hasn't been unified with relativity.

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:43.740
So there's all these things.

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.260
And in the nineties, we didn't even know.

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:46.220
We thought we were at there.

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.580
John Horgan wrote a book.

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:50.620
It's the biggest mistake that you could do writing a book called.

01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:53.900
But, you know, it was worth it to help this, but it was called the end of science.

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:57.820
And the idea was that we had we're almost done with understanding everything.

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.620
And we thought we understood everything about physics

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.860
is before we knew about dark matter, dark energy,

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:04.260
which we only understood dark energy in the late nineties.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.260
And people thought we understood everything.

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.900
And then they just try to explain to a consciousness as being an illusion.

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.300
So they can back up science understands everything.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:14.740
Nothing, no mystery, definitely no supernatural, definitely no creator.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:19.100
But then she hit the fan and we realized we barely understand anything

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:22.100
like most of the universe is stuff that we don't even know what it is.

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.700
It's incredible. So.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:30.060
Basically, yeah, if you go on the road to omega

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:33.700
subsec, I have these posts called the teleological stance.

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.540
This post called that.

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:40.060
I said first, yeah, actually, there are multiple posts on the teleological stance.

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:43.500
But basically it's saying all living systems have an intrinsic goal

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.220
and that's to survive against this tendency towards decay.

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:50.940
So life does have a goal and a goal gives us a purpose.

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:54.460
And the purpose is to see that life continues to exist

01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:58.140
because we're part of this larger system that's becoming more complex.

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:01.100
And what I didn't mention is that it seems to be going towards

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:04.140
a fully integrated self-aware state of the universe.

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:08.260
And I'm definitely not arguing for panpsychism that everything's conscious.

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:12.100
I'm saying that consciousness emerges because of some plan

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:15.820
that we don't fully understand and that.

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:22.980
And that consciousness, because it might be a scale invariant

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:26.580
or substrate independent thing, that you're conscious

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:30.060
because you have this collection of neurons that are exchanging information.

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:32.140
And somehow consciousness emerges from that.

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:34.340
In the book, I try to explain why that's probably happening.

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.460
But if consciousness can emerge from a collection of cells,

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:40.620
who's to say that consciousness can emerge from an interacting system

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:42.300
of humans exchanging information?

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:44.580
So that idea has been called the global brain.

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:47.140
Maybe you could have some people think there's already a consciousness.

01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.220
This level, I don't think there is.

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:49.540
I think there's a collective intelligence

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.260
because you don't need intelligence to have consciousness.

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:55.860
So as fear is intelligent, it's a self-regulating system.

01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:58.900
But I don't think it's conscious.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:01.500
But I think consciousness can emerge at these higher levels

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:05.900
and that if life continues to spread through the universe and to do so,

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:10.420
it has to keep extracting energy and it will keep molding the universe.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.660
It'll basically keep it will start incorporating the inanimate matter

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:18.100
of the world into its computational substrate until the entire universe gets subsumed.

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:23.220
And but it's not as if life is just taking over the universe.

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:26.140
This was the story of the universe self-organizing

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:32.740
into this completely functional, conscious, computational state mind.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.900
God, whatever you want to call it, doesn't really matter.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:38.260
It's just this unified state that will be this computational state

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:42.060
of unimaginable power that that everything is moving towards.

01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:47.580
So it was really just a self-organizing system that has this dynamic

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:50.020
and like part of it's being trained and accumulating knowledge

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:54.940
until the whole system is an integrated system, the way an organism is the integrated system.

01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:56.340
So I think that's where it's headed.

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.060
I'm about to come out with an article on Big Think

01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:02.580
analyzing new papers that have emerged from the small one in Jerellania

01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:06.100
and Microsoft Physicists saying that the universe is a learning machine.

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:11.700
That was kind of influenced by another paper from 2020 by Vitaliy Vanshurne,

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:14.860
who says the world's a neural network and these got articles, you know,

01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:18.140
popular mechanics articles, you can read these a couple of years ago.

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:22.060
And what I'm arguing is that life is basically the universe is something

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:25.580
like a neural network or an organism or a complex adaptive system.

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.580
It's all just an information processing network that's emerging.

01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:32.460
And that life is part of this process and that's where it's headed.

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:36.220
You can call it a God, you know, there's lots of crazy answers about like what that is.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.540
But that's what Ray Kurzweil believes.

01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:41.860
That's what the neural network guy that I mentioned.

01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:45.660
He also believes that that's inevitable that it's going towards that state.

01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:48.980
I talked to him a couple of days ago in person and he confirmed that.

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:54.420
So it's a radical new story saying that the universe is waking up through life.

01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.260
But that gives us a purpose.

01:09:56.260 --> 01:10:00.900
We're part of this larger grand process and we need to do what we can to continue

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:05.900
intelligence and consciousness and experience and all those things that

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.780
come from sentience.

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:11.620
We need to do what we can to ensure that spreads throughout the universe.

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:16.700
And that involves a collective mindset change where we realize to solve

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:20.580
our existential problems, we have to come together because we to solve

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:24.980
these problems are so big that the whole system needs to be using all of its

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:25.940
computational power.

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:30.180
So any civilization that emerges anywhere will have to go through

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:34.500
the same sort of trajectory where they come together.

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:36.300
And we've always been coming together.

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.020
We've been coming together into societies.

01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:41.100
But the thing is when we come together into a society, we come together

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:44.100
under a belief system and then a society emerges on this part of the world.

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:45.700
And it's a different belief system.

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:48.780
So there's those are two super organisms that are going to be in conflict

01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:50.860
because they basically have different genomes.

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:52.140
They're different belief systems.

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:53.700
So it's a genome at a higher level.

01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:55.020
It's a knowledge system.

01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:59.620
So they're going to compete until they learn that cooperation is easier

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:01.180
and that makes every task easier.

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:06.020
It makes extracting any, any, any, it makes extracting energy easier in any task.

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:06.300
Really.

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.820
So it's part of a process.

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:09.740
It's inevitable.

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:14.780
This is a trajectory that civilizations will go through on any biosphere

01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:18.340
where you have an intelligent civilization like this, but it's leading

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:22.700
to that larger story and that gives us that frames life in a way that's never

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:23.860
been framed by science before.

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:27.740
It says we have a cosmic purpose and we can carry out this cosmic

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:32.420
purpose by trying to facilitate a mindset of coming together, but it's also

01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:34.820
at the individual level where you try to live optimally.

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:37.860
You don't do what's bad for the environment because it's going to hurt you.

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:41.420
You don't live with an ignorant or an accurate model of the world because

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:42.140
it's going to hurt you.

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.020
And if it hurts you, it's not good for the collective.

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:47.580
So we need to align our interests and we need to figure out how people can

01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:53.100
act in their own selfish interest, but at the same time, do good for humanity.

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:57.500
So we just need to align the interests of the individual and the group

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:02.660
to where we're getting synergy and

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:09.460
without consciously adopting this mindset.

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:13.140
And I think for people to adopt this, because without all the science behind it,

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:17.300
it just kind of sounds like positive psychology or like self help, self

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:19.620
help guru stuff or new age stuff.

01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:24.180
But I think with the science, you know, if people go, OK, the universe

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:27.580
does seem to be self organized and there is this trend, there is a meaning.

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:28.420
We don't know what it is.

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:29.660
We don't know if there was a designer.

01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:30.140
We don't know.

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:31.180
And we'll talk about that next time.

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:34.060
But we don't know if it was a cosmological natural selection process.

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:39.260
But all we know is that reality seems our reality seems to have this trajectory

01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:40.740
and we're part of this process.

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:44.180
And that process is good because it leads to more experiences.

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.620
If life ends, that's the end of experience.

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:47.500
That's the end of love.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.660
That's the end of feeling, at least in our universe, that's the end of all that.

01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:53.180
So it's a good thing for life to exist.

01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:57.220
And out of this story, we get like a self help system.

01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:00.500
We get a way to optimize your life based on, you know, just

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:07.420
acquiring information and behaving in a way that is compatible with your future goals.

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:14.260
So is there is there like an exercise or is there prescribed activities

01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:15.780
or things, methods?

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:16.620
I mean, yeah.

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:23.140
So so this basically says it's basically an umbrella that goes, hey,

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:28.340
that meditation stuff, you're improving executive control, you know,

01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:33.700
networks in your brain, like you're you're improving your ability to not act impulsively.

01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.860
So you're optimizing your behavior.

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:43.060
It's an optimization process because if you behave,

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:46.820
let's say someone makes you mad and you punch them or you stab them,

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:48.500
you're in jail, you're done.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.700
That's like your goals are gone.

01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:56.900
So part of living optimally in like a base optimal way is making decisions

01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:01.940
and being aware of all of the possibilities and the consequences of those decisions.

01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:05.780
So the space of counterfactuals and choosing the decision that is in line

01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:09.220
with your goals and the idea is that your specific goals,

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:14.660
if everyone is working towards those optimal goals,

01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:19.500
then that kind of harmonizes society overall, moving in the right direction.

01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:22.700
So meditation,

01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:29.980
any sort of like new age practice, spiritual practice, religious practice,

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:33.660
even like praying, for example, makes you like aware, you know,

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:35.780
people get mad at people, Christians are saying,

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:40.380
pray for these people in the Middle East, like when they should really be doing

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:41.780
something, your prayers aren't going to do anything.

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:45.180
I don't think that's right because, yeah, they're not doing anything,

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.540
but they could not be praying.

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:49.180
And what praying is doing, at least they're making an exercise.

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:51.980
They're going, there's people on the other side of the world that don't have my culture.

01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:55.460
And I'm going to imagine these people suffering and I'm going to ask them for help.

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:58.700
They're building out a theory of mind when they're doing that.

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:02.980
They're caring about those people because of that praying action more than they would

01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:04.820
if they never did that act.

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:08.060
If they don't do that act, they're basically like an inanimate object.

01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:11.260
It's kind of like how we, you know, we don't really treat people from other cultures.

01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:15.340
Like the more we find in common with them, the more we start to treat them like ourselves.

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:21.060
But so what I'm saying is the act of prayer is do all kinds of good stuff.

01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:24.020
Like also, like when you pray at night, you know, like, I'm thankful for this and this,

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:28.100
that stuff that emerged through evolution because it's adaptive.

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:30.940
So for us to throw that away, and that's what atheists have been doing.

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.180
They're like, oh, we hate new age stuff.

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.380
We hate religion.

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:38.420
It's just going back to dark ages in some way, because all of those things are adaptive.

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:44.220
So we need a new paradigm that merges science with spirituality and says all those practices

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:47.580
aren't bad, believing bullshit is bad.

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:51.500
You can die because you think homeopathy is going to cure your cancer.

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:52.940
So that's not amazing.

01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:57.180
But what, but so I'm not, you know, saying everything is good about religion.

01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:00.980
But I'm saying these practices, most of them, the reason people,

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:04.220
religion's not dying is because people find value in them.

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:07.700
And for scientists and atheists to be like, we're just going to do

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:10.380
whatever's the opposite of religion, which is what has happened.

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:14.500
They're putting scientists, you know, these people had a big disadvantage

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:19.580
or giving them an eye and actually religion, organized religion is sticking around

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:22.220
because science is having that mindset.

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:24.780
They're not realizing the power of that.

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:28.820
And then the regular person is like, I don't give a shit about your multiverse theory.

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:33.900
I want a belief system that's going to help me in life and give me a community

01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.620
and make me wake up in the morning feeling good about life.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:42.100
So they're actually hurting science by being like, oh, the spiritual practices are stupid.

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.700
Oh, meditation is bullshit.

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.900
Thinking that there's something higher is bullshit.

01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:49.380
So very unproductive.

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:54.300
And I'm very passionate about this because these people are supposed to be

01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:57.420
like our thought leaders and tell us like what's right or wrong are saying things

01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:00.100
that are causing people mental harm.

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.220
I mean, really.

01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:04.020
And Sabine Hassanfelders talked about this in her book.

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:06.020
She even wrote like a disclaimer at the beginning.

01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:08.060
Like I've read an article saying free will isn't real.

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:11.540
And I'm worried because people have contacted me saying that they've been very

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:13.100
disturbed by this and people contact me too.

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:16.900
And odd people say I got out of this nihilistic trap by reading your book

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:18.620
and the free will arguments.

01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:21.820
So those people are not being good Bayseans either.

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:25.100
They're way too certain where they're like free will is ridiculous.

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.820
It's like, well, you don't understand high level causality

01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:31.860
because integrated information theory and Julio Tononi has two hour talk

01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.020
on the mechanisms of free will.

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:36.700
And he says absolutely free will is a mechanistic thing.

01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:38.540
It's not supernatural and it's real.

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:43.340
David Deutsch, one leading physicist who Sabine argues, you know, interviews

01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:47.580
in her book for a chapter on interviewed by John Horgan, the guy I mentioned earlier.

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.220
He says, I'm sure we have free will.

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:51.380
So it depends on how you define free will.

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.740
And I've defined it in a certain way.

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:55.380
But the idea is that there really is freedom.

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:58.300
And if we're not using that freedom because we don't think we have it,

01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:02.180
we're living in a way where we're we're not going to exercise our agency.

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:06.060
I think everything's determined and you're like, I want to help the world.

01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:09.740
And I have an idea like you might not put that idea out there.

01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:12.980
But if you realize I'm an agent and there it's everything is not determined

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.900
like I can actually make a difference on the world, you're much more likely

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:18.540
to to actually go through with what you're doing.

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:20.740
Oh, sure. Yeah, I've said it for a long time.

01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:23.580
I'm not sure if I came up with this or I've read it somewhere else.

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:27.620
But I believe in free will because when I don't, I make terrible decisions.

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:30.460
You know, that's great.

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:33.420
I can, yeah, I can rationalize, geez, anything.

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.540
But I know you do have to.

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:38.060
Yeah, it really does optimize your decisions believing in it,

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:40.620
which suggests that it's real because if you didn't give anything.

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:44.980
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a great that's a that's a huge conversation

01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:46.220
that can have to. Yeah.

01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:50.340
But one thing I do want to if you do have to run to wrap up a little bit

01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:54.740
and maybe give it like sort of a teaser for next time, this idea of cosmic

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:58.900
complexity, you know, this heading towards this omega point.

01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:01.380
Can you give us and feel free to speculate?

01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:05.740
Feel I know you're the book is grounded in the great science and well researched.

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:10.700
But your intuition, let's say, you know, deep inside yourself,

01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:12.460
something maybe some of you can't prove.

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:18.420
But why why do you think this is all how it's laid out?

01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:21.540
Why do you think we're here?

01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:25.180
Like the ultimate question of like, why this big story?

01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:28.460
This, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, what's the purpose?

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:30.460
Like, what's going on?

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:33.140
Yeah, so I won't be able to answer that today.

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:35.020
I'll give the short answer.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:39.100
But mechanistically, I think what's go like what explains it is basically

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:40.900
the universe is moving towards this.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:43.100
It's the system moving towards an attractor.

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:49.660
And so when you ask like, and I think this theory can inform quantum mechanics

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:51.100
because it's like, oh, there's this wave function.

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:53.220
There's all these different possibilities.

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:56.460
And that's what kind of overthrew determinism is that we understand

01:19:56.460 --> 01:20:00.340
that there's this probabilistic nature due to quantum mechanics.

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:06.980
But what I'm saying is actually the wave function collapse isn't random.

01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:10.780
If you have an isolated quantum system, it's going to look random.

01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:15.260
But when everything is interacting, everything, all those wave functions

01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:16.380
must be collapsed.

01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:20.660
And I know some people, you know, I haven't defined these terms, but yeah,

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:23.540
just for like a high level thing, we'll talk about it more next time.

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:27.380
But that that the collapse is if the universe is becoming more complex,

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:30.740
that puts constraints on how the wave function collapses such that the collapse

01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:34.540
is much in totality add up towards going towards this omega point.

01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:39.740
So I think it is a new motivates a new theory of quantum mechanics.

01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.060
I mean, there are interpretations like quantum Darwinism,

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.700
which are consistent with what I'm saying.

01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:46.100
But I think the universe is moving towards an attractor.

01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:51.860
And it's this this functional state of like the universe,

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:56.180
being the self aware computational conscious state with the power of a God,

01:20:56.180 --> 01:21:01.860
basically, and a God would be nothing more than a mind that has freeman Dyson said,

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:07.300
a God is just a mind that has achieved power beyond our comprehension.

01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:12.940
So why do I think there's this design that's leading to that?

01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:19.220
Well, one explanation is cosmological natural selection is that the universe basically.

01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:25.500
Our universe, there is a multiverse, but it's not like every possibility exists.

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:30.020
There was this evolutionary process where in Lee Smallman's model of cosmological

01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:34.660
natural selection, when you have a universe form and then a black hole forms in that universe,

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:39.020
since a big bang is like a singularity event that creates a universe.

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:41.500
The idea is that when a bit of black hole forms in the universe,

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:44.620
that's a big bang event that creates a new universe.

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:48.340
And that's how you have these ever this evolutionary process

01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:52.620
that's creating more and more universes and the universes that are good at creating black holes

01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:57.140
and black holes come from stars and stars create the chemistry that's needed for life.

01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:00.180
Then you'll get more and more universes that create more and more black holes.

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:02.300
So more and more universes that have more and more stars.

01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:05.740
And so this process will lead to more and more universes that are firmly for life

01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:08.180
because stars create the higher elements that are needed for life.

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:11.940
And then so if this evolutionary process is true,

01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:16.620
you'll have the selection pressure towards getting more life-friendly universes.

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:23.940
And then if the intelligence in that universe can engineer new universes by engineering black holes,

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:28.300
and Alan Gooth, the creative cosmic inflation theory, says we should be able.

01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:32.220
He doesn't necessarily believe this theory, even though people do consider it.

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:35.620
I mean, Leonard Susskin, string theory guy, said he's surprised at least more.

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:39.260
And this theory hasn't gotten as much attention, like more attention.

01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:44.620
But even now, in Gooth's model, he still thinks we can create a universe

01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:47.260
by creating some sort of singularity event,

01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:49.820
even if he doesn't think that black holes are always creating these universes,

01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:54.500
which cosmic inflation kind of has a similar model where universes are created.

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:57.420
But I'm not sure. I don't think it's the mechanism is to black holes.

01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:01.820
There's just these, yeah, I guess a little more complicated into inflation.

01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:06.740
But so the whole point of that and what small one isn't saying is

01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:09.940
if you look at the structure of this cosmological natural structure universe,

01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:14.420
it still inevitably leads to life and then it leads to life dominating and taking over.

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:19.940
And that would lead to universes that become more and more complex and more and more intelligent.

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:24.540
And ultimately, that would lead to an evolutionary process towards universes

01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:29.260
that lead to fully integrated omega point states,

01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:34.220
just because it's the pinnacle of this process and doesn't have to end there.

01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:37.300
Maybe our universe, once it reaches this fully integrated state,

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:43.540
maybe there's some interaction with these other universes and that these omega points

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:47.180
at this higher level will merge and form a larger super organism.

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:53.620
If this story of nature's particles coming together and forming these aggregates

01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:56.940
at these higher levels keeps going on, maybe it's larger than this universe.

01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:59.420
So maybe it continues, I don't know.

01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:02.660
But the point I'm emphasizing here, which I haven't really emphasized before,

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:08.460
is that it's still a teleological story.

01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:10.940
It's the one that we were trying to get rid of.

01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:12.340
Like, why is this universe designed?

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:14.060
Oh, cosmological natural selection.

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:17.420
But if you look at the multiverse of the cosmological natural selection world,

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:23.500
it still starts off empty, I mean, lifeless and inevitably gets dominated by life.

01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:25.620
So it's the same teleological story.

01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:29.620
So even with the cosmological natural selection theory, we cannot get away

01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:32.060
from the teleological nature of the cosmos.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:38.260
There still seems to be a life generating principle, not just where it produces life

01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:45.180
in one universe of this vastly sterile multiverse, but that life spreads

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:51.540
and the multiverse becomes fully biophilic.

01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:57.260
So whatever the answer is, there's still this life giving principle

01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:59.340
that I see as equivalent to God.

01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:04.020
And here's the thing, if you have this process, it's going to lead to intelligent

01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:08.580
beings like us who, because the laws of physics don't disallow this,

01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:12.540
create virtual worlds that then might have their own agents.

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:17.580
So if we're creating that, then the process leads to creators too.

01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:22.820
And so in my view, it's kind of arbitrary to say, was our universe

01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:27.620
created or is it cosmological natural selection?

01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:30.820
I'm like, well, we don't know it could be cosmological natural selection

01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:32.340
or maybe that's not the right answer.

01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:36.860
Maybe our universe really is nested in another reality and we're a simulated world

01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:40.420
with a physical substrate, you know, just like we create computers

01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:43.540
with a physical substrate, but then there's a simulated world of virtual agents.

01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:48.860
There's no reason to to say that that's not a possibility.

01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:53.260
But here's my point, even if we were created by a creator, you have to explain them

01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:58.220
and then you could explain them as a as a result of this evolutionary process.

01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:04.500
But it's not the atheist one that leads to mostly still it's still a biophilic one.

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:10.060
So my ultimate understanding was that nature has this life generating principle.

01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:11.780
It's really hard to determine.

01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:15.020
You know, we still have that why something from nothing problem.

01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:17.700
But we are making progress.

01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:21.460
It's not introducing unnecessary stuff by going outside this universe

01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:24.820
because we have the fine tuning mystery that is begging for a solution

01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:27.820
that we don't have unless we think about these other things.

01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:31.300
Creator cosmological selection and the multiverse theory,

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:34.620
which I don't think is a good explanation because it introduces everything

01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:38.260
just to explain away a creator when we shouldn't necessarily need to explain

01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:40.780
a creator with every possible universe exists.

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:43.020
It's just I don't think it's the right.

01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:45.220
I don't think it's superior epistemologically.

01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:47.020
Occam's are all the things we mentioned.

01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:52.260
So ultimately, I'm left with the process itself being God

01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:54.220
and that we could be created by an agent,

01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:58.340
but it wouldn't be this all powerful, fundamental thing that was there forever.

01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:03.780
It would be a product of this process, but that process seems to be eternal.

01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:07.940
So even if we have a God, a creator, I don't think if I learn about him,

01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:09.340
I don't think I'd pray to him.

01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:13.020
I think if we have a creator, it might be like us creating things.

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:15.420
And then we want to ask our AI, like, is there a God?

01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:19.180
Like, maybe if we do have a creator, they're looking for us to answer.

01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:21.460
Maybe we're the AI that's going to inform them.

01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:25.060
But so even if we had a creator, I'm not necessarily sure

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:27.180
that I don't think that would be the end of all answers.

01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:32.140
I think it's more spiritually satisfying to be like to just recognize

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:36.060
there is a process that leads to life, leads to consciousness

01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:40.420
and unending consciousness reaching higher and higher levels of experience.

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:45.180
And to me, that's kind of a Spinoza type

01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:48.780
pantheism thing. It's but it's beyond that because pantheism is

01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:52.220
oh, this world could be inanimate and sterile, but it's God.

01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:55.340
But like, this is really giving more of a reason to say

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:58.340
the universe is God because it's not this arbitrary random thing anymore.

01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:00.340
It's this life generating thing.

01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:05.300
And so to me, that has all of the same qualities of a God.

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:09.580
And I do think we could be somewhere far along in the process

01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:12.140
where we could be the product of an intelligent agent.

01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:16.100
And that agent could have created a moral moral art to this trajectory

01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:19.980
where our universe, they want to create something that improves and gets better.

01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:20.820
And that's what you're seeing.

01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:24.620
We're getting away from our original roots, kind of like

01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:27.740
kind of compatible with like this theory of original sin.

01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:30.460
But like we evolve from this animalistic thing.

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:33.220
And as this trajectory happens, we get more moral.

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:34.660
We develop a theory of mind.

01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:36.660
We start to understand that there are other conscious things.

01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:37.940
We start to treat them better.

01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:40.780
We start to understand we're part of the biosphere and the universe.

01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:42.780
We start to care more about the environment.

01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:46.100
So I think our evolutionary trajectory has a moral arc

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:50.420
that is further evidence for some sort of purpose or design.

01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:56.740
And that part of me says, OK, there is something maybe to it.

01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:58.140
And maybe we're farther along the process.

01:28:58.140 --> 01:28:59.060
Maybe there is a creator.

01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:03.420
Maybe they do care about what happens the way we create programs

01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:05.260
and we're interested in what happens.

01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:07.700
But it's a personal journey for me, too.

01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:11.740
I don't know. I mean, if is it why is there evil in the world?

01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:12.940
Why isn't it more perfect?

01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:14.940
I have questions for that. I'm like, trying.

01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:17.260
I think, you know, there can't be good without evil.

01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:17.980
It's all spectrum.

01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:20.460
There's no way to even define good unless you have something opposite.

01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:24.260
So maybe it starts off of good and evil because that's the only way it can go.

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:28.580
But it evolves towards a more moral existence

01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:30.740
towards as you get closer to the omega point.

01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:32.780
So it's a journey for me.

01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:36.780
But what I am convinced by is that you do have this trajectory.

01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:40.140
And once you start asking what that should why it's this way,

01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:42.700
you get into all the explanations that I've just said.

01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:46.060
And I think they're better than the nihilistic multiverse.

01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:48.460
We're just weak anthropic principle version.

01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:51.820
And I think that's super exciting because I really think a Bayesian analysis.

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:54.460
Anybody, I think Sean Carroll, if we have long enough talk,

01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:58.500
if you brought me and five leading physicists who are open minded,

01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:00.980
Sean Carroll, Lee Smollon, maybe have some neuroscientists,

01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:05.460
Christoph Carl Friston, I think if you lay all these things on the table,

01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:09.940
we would quickly come to the consensus that at least what I'm putting forth

01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:14.460
is a good theory. Some people might say, oh, it's not as likely.

01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:17.620
They might say the multiverse thing in there, according to all of their stuff,

01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:19.340
is a little bit more likely than this.

01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:23.700
But there's no way that you can say that this isn't a legitimate scientific theory,

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:26.100
whether it's our universe was created by an intelligent agent

01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:28.660
or cosmological natural selection.

01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:31.500
Like, and that's what I've been happy about.

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:34.380
You know, the book could have come out and people could have said crackpot.

01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:38.420
Like, and it just could have got killed by like, you know, reviews and stuff like that.

01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:41.500
And no one might have given a blog who is not like a Christian person.

01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:45.420
But all the people that gave it blurbs and stuff were were scientists,

01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:47.540
people called themselves atheists or agnostics.

01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:51.700
I mean, there's not one Christian out of like the dozen blurbs I got.

01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:54.540
There's not one religious person.

01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:58.420
So I know the argument is compelling,

01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:04.980
but the argument makes all these other wonderful spiritual weird implications.

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:08.700
And since people were willing to accept the first book, I'm like, OK,

01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:11.180
now it's time to open up the bag of worms.

01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:14.540
If you're going to put this on the table, which really, you know,

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:16.740
it's not this opening up the bag of worms.

01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:20.020
The fact that you had all these unsolved mysteries that this starts to solve.

01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:22.860
But it's exciting because I think with what's going on in AI

01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:26.660
and these papers coming out arguing that the universe is a complex adaptive system,

01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:28.500
a learning system, a neural network or stuff.

01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:33.580
It's the it's the right time that this is about to like become, you know,

01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:35.340
there's going to be a cafes transition.

01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:38.940
There's going to be a shift in perspective that changes everyone's ideology.

01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:41.620
And that ideology will lead to greater harmony around the world.

01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:44.260
So I want to be part of that happening.

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:50.220
And it's really exciting, but it just has to be done with care

01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:54.780
because it's very easy to scare people off when you talk about like the religious stuff

01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:57.700
and religious people are scared of evolution and stuff.

01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:03.140
So it would be wonderful if people go, OK, we don't know shit really.

01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:05.220
And we can.

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:08.020
But there's stuff that we don't we that we know is not true.

01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:09.060
And there's stuff that we don't know.

01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:12.580
Like we can start to come together and be like, you know, religious and,

01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:15.740
you know, scientific people can be like, there does seem to be this purpose.

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.980
And we do need to cooperate.

01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:18.100
We do need to come together.

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.580
We do like all those things.

01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:22.860
So I'm excited to see where this goes.

01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:30.980
And I'll just make a prediction that in 10 years, if we have a conversation again,

01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:35.220
that this paradigm will be considered and I may not even be mentioned.

01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:37.420
I may not even be on like the wiki page for it.

01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:41.100
But I do believe that in 10 years,

01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:44.180
the idea that the universe is a self organizing system going

01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:47.820
towards this kind of a mega point computational, fully integrated state

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:53.460
will be if not the leading theory, it will do basically

01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:57.220
with the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics that go from complete obscurity

01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:02.980
to like start being like kind of like at one of the competing main interpretations.

01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:04.740
Yeah, that's so cool.

01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.860
And I hope it doesn't take 10 years for us to talk again.

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:10.740
But one question before you go, I have to know, how did you choose

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:12.860
that is a hop vibration on the cover, right?

01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:16.660
Yeah. So I don't know.

01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:19.380
I've heard I'm pretty sure it is. Yeah. Yeah.

01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:23.980
So I there was an interview for Eric Weinstein.

01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:27.580
I know he has a geometric unity theory and there was a similar structure on his.

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.980
And I wonder if it was is that from like gauge theory?

01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:32.740
I bring it up. Well, partly it has.

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:36.940
Oh, I bring it's really speaking to me now because I was very fortunate.

01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:41.300
About a month ago, I have a video on the hop vibration on that on that object.

01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:43.940
You got to watch it. Yeah. Well, I was so fortunate.

01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:49.340
It blew up a few weeks ago, and now it's like 800,000 views and counting,

01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:51.660
which is awesome. So congrats.

01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.340
Yeah, it's great. Thank you.

01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:57.860
And I don't know why it just kind of took off on its own.

01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:00.220
Yeah, that's what people shared it, too.

01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:01.180
Yeah, maybe.

01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:04.580
And I think Eric Weinstein was on some podcasts recently,

01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:06.460
so that might have just picked it up.

01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:12.020
But people are really drawn to this this geometric object for some reason.

01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:15.900
A lot of a lot of the comments have been people seeing this while,

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:19.100
say, meditating or an altered state of consciousness.

01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:21.180
Very cool. I mean, a lot of people.

01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:23.700
And I mean, that's probably not so uncommon for.

01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:28.420
And a geometric object that's kind of interesting and has,

01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:31.060
you know, an undulate and stuff like that.

01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:34.380
But but I want to know if there was any like deeper significance behind.

01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:36.460
Yeah, so I'll cover because it's not in the story.

01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:38.460
Yeah, I could tell you the story.

01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:42.540
And I think I don't think she would mind me saying this.

01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:45.820
So the artist's name, Francesca Lorenzini,

01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:49.380
and on Instagram, she's Francesca Acacia.

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:55.260
But she had all this art that was kind of she has a background

01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:57.140
in psychology and philosophy.

01:34:57.140 --> 01:35:02.260
So it's very scientific and database.

01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:05.260
And so I'll link to I'll link to our stuff, too.

01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:07.780
Yeah, yeah, that'd be awesome.

01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:12.420
So I was looking through all of that art to like find

01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:15.700
the right thing, because I knew that had a certain stick.

01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:17.260
I have a few artist friends, too.

01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:21.100
I had in mind and the original one fell through.

01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:22.100
They just didn't have time.

01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:24.700
And it was going to be very similar to Anika Harris,

01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:28.300
this conscious cover where it's like all the sprawling organically,

01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:29.580
like kind of cosmic stuff.

01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:31.180
And that's where we were going to go with.

01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:33.940
But since she kind of stole the I mean, she didn't know about it.

01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:35.660
But I mean, I got scooped on that idea.

01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:39.460
So I was looking for this picture and I saw that and I asked her

01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:40.180
where she got it from.

01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:45.540
And she was like, I did acid like I saw that.

01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:48.260
I bring that up because you said people see that.

01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:51.380
So she had a psychedelic experience where she saw something like this.

01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:54.020
But then she went out looking for it and she found that.

01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:57.180
And it was like a MATLAB data visualization that someone had made.

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.540
Yeah. But she tweaked it.

01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:00.420
She tweaked it.

01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:03.700
And then we put the person in it and we put it on the background.

01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:04.340
It's beautiful.

01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:07.060
But I didn't I didn't know what the structure was called even.

01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:11.060
And I had heard about those structures and I knew it was something like that.

01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:14.180
But I don't know if it's exactly the same thing.

01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:16.860
Oh, it is. I'm 99 percent sure it is.

01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:19.260
It shows loops and levels.

01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:22.700
It shows like the theme of the book, sort of like this recursive nature.

01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:24.140
And that's kind of mine.

01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:25.860
I think it's an important structure.

01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:29.260
It's technically a it's a mapping from a four

01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:33.540
hypersphere onto a traditional what we would call traditional sphere.

01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:36.780
So it's the fiber bundled and you can visualize it in many different ways.

01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:38.580
You just cut away most of the fibers.

01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:42.020
And those are sort of that's the visualization that she has there.

01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:46.220
And there are perhaps I don't quite know.

01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:49.780
I can't quite tell how important it is in physics.

01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:53.220
Apparently, there are seven, seven or eight different

01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:57.300
applications of it in fundamental physics situations.

01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:00.540
I've been trying to reach out to the physicist who wrote a paper about it

01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:03.020
like 20 years ago, but I can't get in touch with him.

01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:05.980
So maybe I'll talk to Eric Weinstein about it

01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:09.820
because he thinks it's the most important object in the universe.

01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:12.500
But I can't tell, honestly, I don't want to.

01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:13.420
I can't tell either.

01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:17.140
I have an audience that I'm just not sure how important it is.

01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:18.060
It could be very important.

01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:20.940
It could be, you know, I don't know enough.

01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:23.180
I don't know enough Eric Weinstein's interesting

01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:25.980
because he's a person where I feel like I know a lot about science.

01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:29.500
I do not know enough about math that you to understand

01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:32.860
whether he's got some substantial ideas or not.

01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:35.180
So that's something I want to deep dive into

01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:39.460
because anytime anyone's like I figured it out,

01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:41.860
I think it's worth looking into.

01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:44.740
But like I have no idea if it's important as he says to.

01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:46.820
It's interesting. I definitely want to learn more about it.

01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:48.460
But I do I do think it is.

01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:51.740
I mean, some in some way, like that's why I used it.

01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:53.500
I think it captures everything.

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:56.140
And I think we're like an early stage in mathematics

01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:58.060
where we haven't started to understand.

01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:00.940
I've been talking to people about this, like recursive sets and stuff.

01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.380
There's these structures.

01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:07.820
I do think he's on to something and we need to to learn more about it.

01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:10.220
But yeah, I think if anything,

01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:14.500
it kind of supports this idea that reality is structured

01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:16.700
through loops and levels, which we didn't really talk about.

01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:18.540
But there's there's hierarchical organization

01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:20.900
and there's all these feedback loops.

01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:23.900
And so I think it probably is like

01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:28.460
some kind of key to unlocking the secrets of reality.

01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:30.060
Yes, possibly.

01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:31.740
And it's funny because we didn't talk about it.

01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:33.580
And I think you do mention in the book,

01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:35.740
but Douglas Hofstadter's girl, Esher Bach,

01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:38.260
which is all about loops and levels.

01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:42.420
And I read that like two summers ago for the first time

01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:44.260
and blew my mind. Yeah.

01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:48.500
But I will say since that book, my favorite book is yours.

01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:51.860
The romance of reality.

01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:53.820
Please go out and read it, people. It's fantastic.

01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:55.420
So thanks so much, Colin.

01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:56.820
This has been a lot of fun.

01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:58.300
Yes, I can't wait for round two.

01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:00.260
I have a bunch of questions I'll say for next time.

01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:01.740
And I just really appreciate your time.

01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:03.220
Thank you, Bobby. Let's do it.

01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:04.620
All right. Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
