0	4160	Don thank you for coming on. Thank you Carlos for inviting me. It's a pleasure to be back.
4800	10560	Yes, I'm so excited and the viewers are too to have you on for round three. For anyone who
10560	14640	hasn't yet caught the first two rounds of our conversations, those will be linked below in
14640	20320	the description. People who want to catch up. And today what we'll do is we'll type some loose ends
20320	26800	and cover some topics that we haven't had time for in previous conversations. And as an extension
26800	32560	from round two, where we primarily covered your fusions of consciousness paper, which came out
32560	39280	earlier this year. And just to give the audience a very brief summary of what that paper entails,
39280	46400	as you propose a theory of a network of conscious agents that serves as the basis of the fundamental
46400	51360	level of reality. And then emerging from that through a series of steps is everything that we
51360	57280	know. So everything is space and time, quantum dynamics, everything comes emerges from that
58240	63680	from that proposal. So I'd love to hear and get it kicked off here. What has been the reception
63680	72160	to that paper so far? Well, it pretty well, it's it's already been cited. So it's pretty early
72160	79040	for a paper to be cited. Yeah, literally same year. And in the that journal, apparently,
79840	85120	that's the highest downloaded paper in the last of papers, all their papers in the last six months
85120	90800	or something like that. So Wow. So it's gotten not a no 11 or 12,000 downloads, which for a geek
90800	95840	paper is pretty good. That's a pretty great in entropy, right? That's an entropy, right?
97840	104080	So that's awesome. Yeah, it's pretty good. But of course, the proposal itself is quite radical. So
104160	112240	I expect and enjoy pushback and feedback. That's how science works. If you put out radical proposals,
112240	118640	you need to be prepared for all sorts of counters. And that's how you learn. Absolutely. And it takes
118640	123680	time. Yeah, as you put it, it's very early, early days. But it doesn't take time for people to
123680	129120	write critiques and get back and to build off the theory itself. And one thing I'd be really
129120	136080	interested to hear about is core to your to your work is the Amplity Hedron. So the work from Neymar
136080	143760	Connie Hamed, his discovery, or maybe invention, I think it's probably more of discovery, but of this
143760	149760	geometrical object that sits outside of space time. I was wondering, do you I haven't quite seen any
149760	154320	collaborations with between you and Neymar. But have you spoken with him? Are you have any
154400	162320	dialogues with him around your ideas? Not yet. I mean, I think I would enjoy doing that at some
162320	170080	point. The Amplity Hedron, by the way, is for massless particles. And so it's not the whole story
170080	177840	as Neymar himself would say, working on other structures like the EFT Hedra that are for all
177840	183920	particles of all masses and spins. The real deep structure there is the decorated permutations.
183920	190320	So we've really connected with decorated permutations. We have a, in the fusion's paper,
191120	200320	we show how to take any Markov chain and map it canonically into decorated permutations. So we
200320	207840	give a dynamical, for the first time, a dynamical interpretation of these Amplity Hedra, well,
207840	212640	the decorated permutations behind behind the Amplity Hedra, in terms of entities that are
212640	219360	undergoing a Markovian dynamics. So yeah, we'll see where that leads. But we've been then
220640	226480	using that to figure out, okay, how do we map from the Markov chain now to specific properties,
226480	236320	like momentum and spin and energy and so forth. Because the decorated permutation link does tell
236320	240720	us what parts of the Markov chains to focus on when we're trying to think about how they map
240720	249120	to particles. So that was the real win in getting the fusion's paper result, that it showed us what
249120	255520	part of the dynamics we needed to focus on in trying to figure out the mapping between the
255520	261040	concentration dynamics and properties of particles, like position momentum and spin and energy.
262480	268800	Gotcha. And one thing I, as I was doing research prepare for this conversation, I stumbled upon
269360	274320	a presentation you gave last year at Chapman University at the mine and agency conference.
274960	281280	And I was going through that and noticed you had a slide, and maybe I'll even, with your permission,
281280	288560	I can overimpose this, just so folks can see it, showing the links from the conscious agent
288560	292560	level all the way up to the Amplity Hedron. And I was wondering, are there any differences, because
293280	300080	if I recall, it was asymptotic behavior, feeding into permutations, feeding into Birkhoff polytubes,
300080	304160	feeding into the positive grass mania, and then feeding into the Amplity Hedron. So it's a lot
304160	310240	of steps there. And is that where you landed with the fusion's subconscious paper? Because I think
310240	316320	when we discussed it, there were, maybe it's condensed the levels a little bit. But is that
316400	322880	still accurate? Is that still the same framework? Shortly after we gave, after I gave that talk,
324160	330960	we discovered this projection onto the decorated permutations. And so we actually
330960	336480	view this as a step forward from the talk that I gave at the Chapman University, that there we
336480	345200	were mapping onto the asymptotics directly, but we were trying to figure out how that mapping went.
345200	350720	We didn't understand exactly how we would project onto the asymptotics. And it was in thinking through
350720	358000	that, that we discovered this mapping onto the decorated permutations, which gave us a direct
358000	362960	link into the deepest structure that the physicists have found. So I'm actually much happier. And I
362960	369920	have a talk that I gave at Stanford, which is similar to the Chapman talk, but the Stanford talk
369920	378480	is like the Chapman talk, but it updates that slide and talks about the new results about
378480	384480	mapping markup chains into decorated permutations. And so we worked pretty quickly to get that paper
384480	390960	out by this January. The fusion's paper, will we go into that? Gotcha. Okay, I'll have to look for
390960	396160	that Stanford talk and I will link to that in the description of this video for curious viewers.
396160	402080	Because also, I think I noticed that talk, whoever uploaded it, the volume is extremely low
402080	406080	on that Chapman University. So I had to turn it up all the way and put on captions in order to
406720	412480	follow what was happening there. Yeah, sorry. Stanford talk is a little bit easier to understand
412480	418400	and get to here. And there we have the updated for the fusion stuff. But even since the Stanford
418400	422960	talk, we've been made far more of progress. Things I would have loved to talk of Stanford,
422960	428800	but we didn't discover them yet. Yeah, it's happening too fast. And one question from one
428800	436160	of the commenters on the last video was from Dennis Sovin. He asks, or she I make sure,
437200	441760	extremely interesting. Thank you. Are there any experimental evidence available? Or do you have
441760	449120	any projects planned to prove the fusions of consciousness proposal? Yes, we have. We've been
449120	460320	working on a computational experiment to do this to test this. So and the logic of our experiment,
460320	467440	we need to find something inside space time that we can explain based on this dynamics of
467440	472240	conscious agents beyond space time. So the question is where what there's lots of stuff in
472240	477280	space time to try to target to try to explain with a computational experiment. So what is the most
477280	484560	intelligent and most accessible thing that we could do? And you might say, well, neuroscience,
484560	489520	right? That seems to be the most related to consciousness. And so if you're having a theory
489520	494640	of consciousness from outside of space time, surely you want direct related directly to brain
494640	502640	activity. But that's brains are really complicated physical objects. You know, some people say
502640	506880	they're the most complicated thing that people have ever discovered in space time.
506880	511280	That may not be where we want to start. Of course, ultimately, we ought to understand it. And
511280	517280	I'm a cognitive neuroscientist. So I've actually studied the brain for for decades and done FMRI
517280	524400	and EEG and collaborative experiments and so forth. But if we're having a theory outside of
524400	532000	space time and mapping it into space time, what we want to do is test it where it's the simplest
532720	539200	and easiest to test it. And so what we're proposing is to test it
542000	548240	at what particle colliders are finding when they study the inside of protons. So they smash
548240	555680	electrons into protons, for example, a very high energy electron ion colliders. And they
556400	560720	look at what happens, you know, you destroy in many cases, you destroy the proton in the process,
560720	566160	but you see all these quarks and gluons and a sea of quarks or it depends on the energies,
566160	571520	what they call the the Q squared, the energies and also the the temporal resolution that the
573120	581360	Bjork and X and so forth. So what we're proposing to do is, and this proposal will come out in on
581360	588000	June 24, it's, you know, it'll be made public on June 24. We're proposing a series of experiments
588000	594880	to show that we can get the exact momentum distributions of the the quarks and gluons at
594880	600480	the all the various values of Bjork and X and Q squared that have been tested at at colliders,
600480	606560	in other words, to map to match the momentum distributions exactly. And so we would need
606560	613680	to find a master Markov chain, and a specific set of trace chains, so called Markovian trace chains,
614640	619040	and then temporal windows of sampling of those trace chains that give us exactly
619680	625280	the sequence of momentum distributions from high Q squared and Bjork and X, you know, all the values
625280	630080	that they that they map. So that's what we're going after. And again, that sounds, well, gee,
630080	634000	you're going after, you know, high energy particle physics, that sounds really, really
634000	640320	complicated. I want you to start with neuroscience. It's just the opposite. The particles, what are
640320	646800	particles? The elementary particles, physicists will tell you, are nothing but the irreducible
646800	653120	representations of the Poincare group of the symmetries of spacetime. In other words, they are
653120	659280	the most simple aspects of the actual geometry or symmetries of the geometry of spacetime.
659920	666080	So if we're going to make a connection, that's where we have the most data, and where it's
666080	671360	complicated, as it might seem, it's the least complicated thing that we can do. So that's
671360	676480	why we're going after that. I'm not a particle physicist. I'm learning as much as I can. But
676480	681760	fortunately, we've been joined by a world class particle physicist, Schrapo and Chatterjee,
681760	689760	who's who's collaborating with us on this, who, you know, likes our ideas. And so we have a real
689840	695600	first rate particle physicist who's been at the forefront for, I don't know, 30 or 40 years.
696160	704160	That was CERN and Fermilab, who's not collaborating with us, Chaitan and Prakash. And we have a
704160	713920	student, Ben Nepper, and then me, so four of us working on this idea. So that's where we intend
713920	719120	to go. Then we want to crawl our way up. Of course, eventually we want to get to, you know,
719120	724880	brains and neuroscience and so forth. But if you can't get quarks and gluons,
726720	732080	you're not going to get brains. You got to start where, you know, where there's really hard data
732080	737600	and where people can really push. And you can you really know the mapping from the dynamics of
737600	744080	conscious agents, precisely into space time, at the smallest scale. And then you can crawl your
744080	752240	way up. I presume we're going to have to crawl our way up through, like, we're starting with,
752240	757040	you know, sub nuclear physics, then we need to go to nuclear physics, then we need to go to chemistry.
757680	764320	And then we can crawl our way up to biology and then to brain science. We need to go systematically
764320	770080	and make sure each step up is secure. So yeah, the question is, of course, a great question.
770720	775520	And we have to start, we have to reverse the ladder of physics, we have to start at the bottom,
775520	780480	quote unquote, and climb up the ladder, the typical way that people think about physics and
780480	785360	all the way up through biology. They think of it as the basic science and then the special sciences,
785360	791840	right? We're turning it around, we're saying, no, wait a minute, physics is not the basic science,
791840	798480	consciousness is, and physics is just the simplest part of our interface. It's the most
798480	802080	elementary part of our interface. And so that's why we're connecting with the simplest part of
802080	807120	the space-time interface, and then building our way up to the more complicated parts of it. Sure.
807680	812800	Great question. Yeah, yeah, thank you, Dennis Oven. And I might have some other, yeah,
812800	817200	commentary questions sprinkled throughout here as well. So really appreciate that. If people
817200	821200	will comment below with questions, you know, that's, that's, that's, that's be really great.
821920	828640	I actually think this, this feeds into something that we've literally, I've mentioned at the end of
828640	832000	both of our interviews where I was like, I can't believe we didn't get to this one topic because
832000	839040	I really want to talk to you and dive deep into this. It's the UVIR interaction, which I learned
839040	845280	about through your interview with Jonathan Pageau. And can you explain what this is for the audience?
845280	849040	I think that there's some deep implications here, and I have a bunch of different questions to ask
849040	854960	you about that. But could you, could you set us up with, with what this is? Yeah, it's, it's
854960	866160	truly profound and important aspect of modern physics. It, the, the big success in physics has been
866160	874160	reductionism until recently, right? Statistical thermodynamics is an incredibly successful field
874160	882720	where you can explain phenomena like heat and entropy and heat and thermodynamics at a macro
882720	889680	scale by thinking about reducing to smaller scale and looking at the dynamics of little
889680	896240	particles and looking at the, their distribution of entropy and so forth. That gives you a deep
896240	904320	insight into heat and thermodynamics. So that's, that's a real win for standard reductionist
904320	908480	kinds of thinking. And the hope had been that, well, we can just continue that we can just keep
908480	914000	going. So the kind of reductionism I'm talking about is, I mean, there's many kinds of reductionism,
914000	919920	but I'll be very specific about the reductionism. As you go to smaller and smaller scales of space,
920880	927200	the hope is you'll get to more and more fundamental elements of reality and more and more fundamental
927200	932400	laws. And the hope is that, that will continue forever. We will continue to go to smaller and
932400	938400	smaller scales, find more and more fundamental constituents of reality and, and more and more
938400	945520	fundamental laws that govern those. And that, and that has worked up dramatically well. But
945840	953920	we actually know that our, our best theories of physics, namely Einstein's series of spacetime,
953920	959440	special and general relativity and quantum field theory are, which is based on spacetime. The
959440	966000	fields are defined over spacetime. So the, our modern best physical theories, which are, you
966000	972720	know, assume spacetime at their core also tell us the very mathematics of those spacetime based
972960	978960	theories tell us that spacetime itself cannot be fundamental, that it ceases to have any
978960	984960	operational meaning at the Planck scale, 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, 10 to the minus 43
984960	990720	seconds. And what you find is, as you try to go smaller and smaller, but for example, using
990720	996080	light with finer or radiation with smaller and smaller wavelengths, right? That's how you resolve
996080	1001520	finer and finer details. Well, when you do that, you know, quantum theory, in fact,
1002480	1007520	Einstein in 1905 is equals H new kind of with light tells you that you're going to get more and more
1007520	1012160	energy. The smaller the wavelength, the more and more energy. And then Einstein also told us in
1012160	1017520	1905 that energy equals mass. And as theory of gravity tells us, well, that Matt, you know,
1017520	1026240	as you increase the mass energy density of the vacuum, space is going to curve. And the problem is
1026240	1033360	when you get beyond a certain point of mass energy density, spacetime gets a singularity,
1033360	1040160	it actually falls apart, you get a black hole. And so it ceases to have any operational
1040160	1046720	meaning. And this is well known. I mean, for example, in 2005, David Gross published a paper.
1046960	1058240	He won the Nobel Prize in 2004, by the way, for his work on, I think, quantum
1058240	1064000	criminodynamics. So in 2005, you know, basically, you know, celebration of Einstein, you know,
1064000	1070560	the centenary of Einstein's special relativity theory, 1905 to 2005, he basically said, thank you,
1070560	1075360	you know, wonderful job, and now spacetime is doomed. And that's the way science works, right?
1075440	1079760	You thank people for their incredible contribution. And then you show the holes,
1081040	1085280	and the way forward. And so he pointed out spacetime is doomed and cited a bunch of people
1085280	1090160	who are saying spacetime is doomed. And the problem is this, what you mentioned, the UVIR.
1091120	1096160	Typically, so UV, physicists talk about UV when they say they're going to smaller and smaller
1096160	1102320	scales with higher and higher energies. So an IR is what they talk about when they go to, you know,
1102320	1107600	larger scales and lower energies. But it turns out as you try to push to smaller and smaller
1107600	1112960	scales, you're trying to go UV, more and more UV, what happens is you create a black hole.
1113600	1118240	And as you put more energy in, the black hole gets bigger. That's so you're starting to get bigger.
1118240	1123040	So now the scale is getting bigger. So that's sort of a UVIR kind of thing that you thought
1123040	1128560	you were going to go smaller. And instead, you're going bigger. And so you're starting to see that
1129360	1135360	basically, why the UVIR thing is so important is it means the death of reductionism,
1135360	1140400	of the kind of reductionism that I just talked about. Some people, when they hear me say this,
1140400	1146320	will say that they think I'm saying there's, it's the death of scientific explanation.
1146320	1151920	No, no, no, no. Scientific explanation is one thing. It's a broad class of theories.
1152720	1159840	Reductionism is just one kind of scientific explanation. That particular flavor of scientific
1159840	1166000	explanation, which is the, you know, the UV going to UV and getting smaller and smaller scales
1166000	1174800	and getting deeper and deeper entities and, and laws, that works up to a point and then it falls
1174800	1180080	apart. Our best theories tell us that. So that's why it's so important. I should mention another
1180080	1187360	reason why this whole thing is so important because it tells a beautiful story about how
1187360	1193040	science works. It's, I think, not really well understood. And here's the kind of misunderstanding
1193040	1204400	that can come up. I just said that Einstein and quantum theory assume that space time is fundamental
1205120	1210160	and they take that assumption and they try to build a mathematical model, right? So Einstein's
1210160	1215680	special and general relativity, quantum field theory, fields defined over space time. So they,
1215680	1220480	they take the idea that space time is fundamental. They make it mathematically precise.
1222320	1226160	But then their mathematics comes back and tells you that space time is not fundamental,
1226160	1231440	that space time is doomed. It doesn't even make sense beyond 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.
1232000	1239040	So here, so a lot of people will say, aha, well, we've caught physics in a, they've shot
1239040	1245360	themselves in the foot logically. And here's the logical problem. You assume to begin with that
1245360	1251040	space and time are fundamental or space time is fundamental. You then went ahead and took that
1251040	1260960	intuition and you put mathematics to it. Now, either your mathematics faithfully represents
1260960	1267920	that space time is fundamental or it doesn't. Suppose it does faithfully represent that space
1267920	1271840	time is fundamental. Well, then how in the world could it come back and tell you that it's not
1271840	1278720	fundamental? Surely that wouldn't happen. Okay, so forget that. So therefore, it must be that your
1278720	1283040	mathematics didn't faithfully represent your intuition. That space time is fundamental. And
1283040	1288160	if it didn't, then why could you even trust it to tell you that space time is not fundamental?
1288160	1294160	So you couldn't pot. So in other words, there's no way, according to this, this kind of logic,
1294800	1299520	without self contradiction, you couldn't use your, your physical as theories to show that
1299520	1306240	space time is not fundamental. So the, so the whole thing is, is, is just a self contradiction.
1306320	1314240	So that's the way, you know, some philosophers will argue about this kind of thing. And here's the,
1315040	1319680	the problem with that is very, first my simple, gee, how do you get out of that? I mean,
1320960	1324080	looks like you've really shot yourself in the foot. How do you get out of it? Sure.
1324080	1330960	It's quite simple. It completely misunderstands scientific theories. Scientific theories make
1331040	1336800	assumptions. And when you, when you write down a scientific theory, you know that your assumptions
1337440	1343280	are just assumptions. They're fallible. They're not the final word. And so what you do when you
1343280	1349120	write down a scientific theory is you try to get a mathematically precise statement of those
1349120	1355920	assumptions. And if you've done it right, your mathematics will itself tell you the limits
1355920	1363600	of your assumptions. And that's what you want. Because when, so the mathematics will tell you
1363600	1369040	the power of your assumptions, the area of application of your assumptions, what problems
1369040	1374400	they can solve. But the mathematics will also tell you the limits of your assumptions. And we know,
1375120	1381840	a priori, that there is no theory of everything. There isn't. There's all, there's only a theory
1381840	1387600	of everything except my assumptions. And you'll always have to get deeper and deeper assumptions.
1387600	1394160	And that's a never ending process. And so this is essential to how science moves forward.
1394800	1399520	At every step, you will take your intuitions, you'll put them to mathematics.
1401440	1405920	And then the mathematics will come back and tell you the limits of the intuitions, the assumptions
1405920	1411680	in your intuitions. If it's a good theory, if it's a bad theory, it'll just pat you on the back.
1412400	1417840	And, and, and you won't make any progress, right? You, what you want is a theory that comes back
1417840	1422880	and slaps you in the face and says, at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, precisely, your theory
1423920	1430240	ceases to make sense. It has no operational meaning. That's what you want. So, and the same thing has
1430240	1437040	come up with my theory about conscious, well, I have a theory in terms of using evolutionary game
1437040	1442800	theory to show that, that evolution shaped us not to see reality. So that, that space and time and
1442800	1450320	the notions of organisms and resources and competition for resources is not fundamental.
1450320	1456080	And the same argument has been used against that. People will say, look, okay, Darwinian evolution.
1457520	1461360	That assumes organisms in space and time competing.
1461840	1467120	Nature, red and tooth and claw for limited resources and mates and so forth. So either the
1467120	1476000	evolutionary game theory accurately modeled those intuitions, or it didn't. If it didn't
1476000	1482960	accurately model them, then you can't use it to disprove, you know, the fundamental nature of,
1482960	1487760	you know, organisms and space, time and resources and competition. And if it did
1488320	1494720	accurately model Darwin's ideas, then it couldn't possibly contradict Darwin's ideas. So you're,
1494720	1501680	so once again, you've shot yourself in the foot. And again, the answer is that completely misunderstands
1501680	1511680	the most elementary aspect of scientific theory building and progress. We want to, to get mathematical
1512640	1518080	models of our theories that show us the, the limitations of the fundamental assumptions
1518080	1523680	because they, they are necessarily going to mean that limitations. That's necessary
1524320	1528720	because there is no final theory of everything. And once you realize that, then the whole question
1528720	1532480	about this particular kind of shooting yourself in the foot goes out the window. Of course,
1532480	1535840	there are, there are ways to shoot yourself in the foot logically, but this isn't one of them.
1536400	1543200	Sure. Yeah. No, that's really great. I agree, I agree with you. The, I think one thing,
1543920	1550640	maybe we could just follow back on a little bit, because as, as you pointed out, I do think it's
1550640	1556240	a very powerful idea that the UV IR interaction, and it's not something that I think is in a,
1556240	1562560	a popular, you know, consciousness for very few people know about this, this dynamic that occurs.
1562640	1569200	But what I, what seems to happen is, so you have the, the ultraviolet, the, the smaller
1569200	1575760	higher energy scales you have infrared, the very large scales. And is it, is what happens,
1575760	1583280	is it kind of wraps around where the micro laws come back around to the macro laws, or
1583280	1587920	does it push back upward? Like, where is, if we had to think about it, if you had to
1587920	1593840	analyze it, how would you do it? Well, I would say that the physicists themselves are, are really
1595040	1599600	eagerly exploring that very kind of question, because it looks like there's a lot to it. The
1599600	1606160	mathematics suggests all sorts of UV IR interactions. So this is, I would say right now, a very hot
1606160	1615280	topic in, in, in physics, high energy physics research. So, so the one I mentioned about,
1615360	1620240	you know, as you try to go to smaller scales, you effectively are making a bigger black hole,
1620240	1624400	so you're going to larger. That, that's just one symptom. I think that there are going to be many,
1624400	1631200	many more UV IR correspondences. So, so I think that that's, that what I mentioned is just the tip
1631200	1635920	of a big iceberg. And the physicists themselves are just now beginning to really explore that,
1635920	1640080	that huge iceberg. So it's still a pretty big mystery. We don't really know, because I was
1640080	1648480	wondering if, like, I think about it in terms of, let's say you had UV at the floor, the ground
1648480	1655440	level, you have IR at the ceiling, let's say. So it's like, if you go in one direction or the other,
1655440	1660080	does it pop back around? Like, if you go through the ground, does it pop back up through the ceiling,
1660080	1666480	or instead does it, does it go through the, does it go back up? Does it bounce back? Or
1666480	1673120	does it wrap back around? If that makes sense. We don't know the right kinds of questions. And
1673120	1680320	we may, you know, our theory of consciousness outside of space-time may help, eventually,
1680320	1686800	in understanding this, because what we're saying is that the space-time itself is nothing but
1687840	1692640	a fairly trivial data structure. It's a four-dimensional, I mean, if it's string theory,
1692640	1700400	maybe 11 or 12-dimensional, whatever. But the dimensions of the dynamics of the
1700400	1708080	consciousness outside of space-time could be, you know, quadrillions of dimensions. I mean,
1708080	1712080	it's just the number of dimensions, and these are not dimensions curled up inside space-time,
1712080	1717600	like you think about in string theory, you think about these are small dimensions that are in some
1717600	1723200	sense inside space-time, curled up inside. Now, these are entirely beyond space-time,
1723200	1729360	entirely outside, and space-time itself is, you know, a relatively trivial data structure,
1729360	1733760	a user interface that, you know, systems of consciousness use to interact with each other.
1734320	1742000	And so that framework may be what we actually ultimately will need to understand this UVIR
1742800	1752480	back and forth of just space-time as merely a data structure, an interface that maybe the
1752480	1759440	framework we have to go to, that way we actually will see the limits of that data structure.
1759440	1764720	Yeah, one question I had, and also a commenter I'll have to find over the name of the commenter
1764720	1769200	and overlay it on the screen for this portion, because I can't remember who it was, but there's
1769280	1777440	a question about how the epithetodendron, which I believe it maps for particle scattering with its
1777440	1788160	volume, how does an object have volume outside of space and time? Well, so for example, think about
1789120	1799200	the volume of a square, a 5 by 5 square. Well, it's, let me say 5 inch by 5 inch,
1799200	1803040	but 5 units, whatever the units might be. Well, then it's 25, right, 5 times 5.
1803040	1812000	Okay, now go to a three-dimensional cube. So it's an object that has the same length
1812000	1816880	in three dimensions. Now, what is its volume? It's 5 times 5 times 5, which would be 125, right?
1817680	1821840	Well, now go to four dimensions. Well, that's 5 times 5. So it's 5 to the fourth.
1821840	1828080	Now go to six dimensions, 5 to the sixth and so forth. Now go to 10 dimensions, 5 to the 10th.
1828080	1832720	And so in each case, you can compute the volume, no problem. And all you're doing is you're,
1832720	1841360	you're, so the way to think about this is our ability to visualize as human beings
1841840	1850320	is pretty trivial. We can visualize in two dimensions, three dimensions, and it stops.
1851520	1858400	It's very easy for us to think that the pretty pathetic limitations of our intuitions
1859280	1867440	put a hard and fast limitation on the nature of reality. No, no, no, no, no. I would love
1867440	1874560	to be able to visualize in a thousand-dimensional space. I'm stuck with three, three piddling
1874560	1881200	dimensions. And I feel that limitation all the time. It's my limitation. It's not
1881840	1889440	a limitation on reality. It's a limitation on my paltry imagination. So where our,
1889440	1895840	our visualization abilities fall apart, at least we have enough visualization abilities to get the
1895840	1901360	picture. Oh, okay, a square five times five, five times five. Okay, four dimensions, it must be five
1901360	1907760	to the fourth. So we get the pattern and then we realize we can go up to three dimensions.
1908480	1914800	Reality goes limitless. Quadrillions of dimensions, Google dimensions,
1917280	1925200	and then infinite dimensions. So, so there, that's where mathematics is so powerful,
1925200	1931360	where we, our intuition stop at three, mathematics can go to infinity and beyond.
1932400	1936880	Right, absolutely. And staying in this, I mean, we're going to stay in the non-intuitive
1936880	1940960	kind of landscape for a little bit because I have a bunch of questions to ask you in the,
1940960	1946960	regarding the quantum, quantum space, a quantum realm, let's say, a quantum mechanics. And the
1946960	1954640	first is, so you get space time from your fuses of consciousness, your network of conscious agents,
1955280	1960400	and the quantum, everything is very not intuitive, you know, it's, it's outside our
1960400	1966320	regular comprehension. Does your theory of a network of conscious agents, does that
1967360	1972800	like lend itself towards explaining some quantum phenomena, like things like the delay choice,
1972800	1977920	quantum eraser experiment, like the really, the really strange stuff that were, we seem like
1977920	1984240	miles away from trying to understand or getting to understanding. Does, does it lend any credence
1984240	1990000	to that? Or does, does it help explain that? Are you finding any interesting early evidence there?
1990960	1997040	Right. So, so the answer is yes. And I should say that the physicists themselves, for example,
1997040	2000160	like Nima or Connie Ahmed, when they say that space time is doomed,
2002320	2007040	they're also saying that quantum theory is doomed. Yeah, both. That is not fundamental. And
2007600	2014000	that he, he says that he thinks that they will both arise, quote unquote, joined at the hip
2015040	2024320	from some deeper structure. And the idea is that, yes, I think that that's correct. And that we will
2024320	2029440	get not only space time, but quantum theory arising from as a projection of this theory of conscious
2029440	2039360	agents. Now, the weirdness of quantum theory is largely because I claim it's a projection. It's
2039360	2046560	not the full, the reason we have to use the amplitudes and, and, and do all the, the complicated
2046560	2052000	stuff in quantum theory. And we get things like entanglement and so forth is because quantum theory
2052960	2062000	is only giving you a mathematics of a projection of reality, not the full reality.
2063440	2069280	And, and so there's been some work even by quantum theorists showing that many of the properties
2069280	2074000	of quantum theory, and by the way, people who want to actually check on this, there's a paper by
2074000	2079280	Chris Fuchs, FUCHS, called Quantum Bayesianism. Oh yeah, I was going to ask you about that next.
2079840	2084960	Right. And, and he goes in and actually talks in that paper about many of the properties of
2084960	2094240	quantum theory that that are simply due to lack of information. And so it's no surprise if space
2094240	2100480	time is a projection of this deeper dynamics of conscious agents and that dynamics of conscious
2100480	2105680	agents could have countless dimensions and lots of things going on in space time has four dimensions.
2105680	2111360	And it's just a trivial projection. It's no surprise that most of the information is lost.
2111360	2116320	And so quantum theory really is the mathematics of how to deal with partial
2117200	2122400	knowledge when you've lost most of the knowledge through projection. And so that's what we're,
2122400	2129040	that's how I see this thing going. But, but yeah, of course, our, as I mentioned earlier on, we want
2129040	2133440	to first show that we can get the momentum distributions of the quarks and gluons inside
2133440	2137280	protons, but eventually mean ultimately we want to show that all of quantum theory
2137280	2139840	arises as a projection of this dynamics of conscious agents.
2140800	2144480	Yeah. Yeah, I was literally going to ask you next about Chris Fuchs, because he,
2145280	2150160	I mean, I see a lot of overlap between your theory and quantum Bayesian Bayesianism.
2150720	2156640	And especially because I was rereading your fusions of conscious paper. And as you point out a few
2156640	2164400	minutes ago, trying to make as few, that's the word, trying to make as few presumptions as possible
2164400	2170240	going into your theory, you make, you make only two, you posit that there are conscious experiences.
2170240	2174160	Seems very basic. I'm with you on that. I think most people would be anyone watching this.
2174880	2178800	I got to say you're having a conscious experience. So it's gonna be hard to debate that.
2178800	2183680	And then the second one is that there are probabilistic relations among conscious experiences.
2183680	2187280	That seems, yeah, sure, I'm with you there. And that seems to be
2188160	2194560	to overlap very highly with Cubism, which was just the shorthand for quantum Bayesianism.
2195280	2199280	And even Fuchs in a 2010 paper, he wrote this quote, I thought was great,
2199280	2202960	quantum mechanics is an addition to Bayesian probability theory,
2202960	2208000	not a generalization of it, not something orthogonal to it altogether, but in addition.
2209920	2212240	Which I thought was really interesting, because he's like layering out saying,
2212320	2217280	what's more fundamental? And it's this, this, this probability. And of course, probability
2217280	2223360	relations are, are core to your theory as well. So are there, can you, is there an overlap there?
2223360	2229520	Or can you compare contrast? Is there a difference? Yeah, I know Chris. Yeah, we were there together
2229520	2235440	at the Chapman University Conference and so forth. I've been trying to persuade him to
2235520	2244320	join our, join us and work with us on this stuff. But yeah, so there's a lot in principle that we
2244960	2252720	agree on. I don't know that he's, Chris in his paper of quantum Bayesianism
2253280	2259200	points out that, you know, the observer is really important, right, that quantum theory is basically
2259200	2265040	a story about how the observer takes track of the data and counts for their own data and,
2265040	2270640	and what they, so it's, but he says, I don't owe you a theory of the observer. I'm a physicist,
2270640	2274880	I don't owe you a theory of the observer. And of course, that's what I'm after here. I'm doing
2274880	2279520	that the theory of conscious agents is a theory of the observer. And I think ultimately,
2281840	2288320	without a theory of the observer, you'll not make progress. You really, that's what we're
2288320	2293680	saying. We're saying conscious agents, these agents are experiencers, they're, they're observers.
2293680	2300560	And it's only when you actually study the dynamics of observation that you're going to understand
2300560	2305680	how physics arises as a projection, you know, space-time physics arises as a projection of that.
2305680	2310240	It's just one of, one trivial projection out of countless other kinds of projections that you
2310240	2318880	could have. So, so, you know, Chris and I, you know, we're friends. I enjoy talking with them.
2319600	2324800	And I would love to have them collaborate. But we'll see. I mean, it's,
2327360	2336800	maybe if we get success on modeling quarks and gluons, we can rope Chris in to join us. Well,
2336800	2341840	we'll see. I like Chris. He's, he's, he's brilliant, of course. And, and, and we have enough differences
2341840	2346880	that is, that there's a good, it's a good interaction because there are differences. And
2346880	2351840	so that's what you want in a scientific collaboration, right? Sure. Absolutely. And the other,
2351840	2356480	a couple of other things on the quantum side before moving into some more non-physics territory in a
2356480	2364480	bit. The, that I wanted to ask you this one on our last conversation, the recent Nobel Prize winners.
2364480	2372160	So, Aspect, Klauser and Zellinger. If you could, did you mind just explicating for the audience
2372160	2378560	a little bit about, I mean, as a groundbreaking work over many decades, you know, they all had,
2378560	2384480	I was tracing out like, oh, this is decades apart, their, their work. And they found that this is
2384480	2390640	from Quanta, some wonderful publication for folks who are familiar with it. But they wrote, I think
2390640	2396240	the high level summary is that they found reality has no fixed and predetermined state until you
2396240	2400960	measure it. That's what they found. That's right. That's true of John Bell's. But would you, could
2400960	2405520	you give us like just a high level summary of that and, and I guess how it plays into your work?
2406320	2414880	So, so yes, the, the, the recent Nobel Prize last December was for the experimental
2416320	2424640	test of the prediction of quantum theory that local realism is false. So local realism has two
2424640	2432640	parts. One is locality, which says that particles have properties that whose influences propagate
2432640	2438800	no faster than the speed of light. So properties, the influences can't, you know, there's a speed
2438800	2446000	limit on the universe and you can't exceed that, at least for information transfer. And the, and
2446720	2458320	that's locality. Realism is the, the claim that particles have definite values of their properties
2458320	2463760	even when they're not observed, like position, momentum and spin. And Einstein was famous for his,
2464880	2471840	you know, support for realism. He said that, you know, if without disturbing a system, you can predict
2471840	2476960	with probability one, the value of a property, then that, then that value of the property
2478080	2483520	really does exist and it really did exist, right? That's, that's realism. And most people would side
2483520	2487680	with Einstein. Of course, right? You can predict with probability one before you measure without
2487680	2492800	disturbing it, what, what the value is, then the value did exist before. And it really is real. And,
2492800	2498320	and so, so, so most of our intuitions would line up with Einstein that realism is true. But
2499280	2503920	quantum theory says, no, local realism is false. And that's what the,
2505200	2509280	the Nobel Prize for over several decades, you know, starting in Clouser and
2511280	2519760	Aspect and then Zeilinger, the over decades, these guys did the test and then closed loopholes in
2519760	2525920	the previous test and then closed more loopholes because this is such a big one. I mean, our intuitions
2525920	2532640	are so much against local realism being false. We believe local realism. We believe realism.
2534560	2541200	That, that they really needed to go to all sorts of links to close any possible loopholes. And,
2541840	2551920	and so it's just plain false that particles have definite values of properties when they're not
2551920	2558080	observed. And by the way, Chris Fuchs paper, again, the quantum basing paper, gives an example.
2558720	2562560	He, if you, so people want to see, you can see an actual quantum example
2563280	2568240	that that, that, that he goes through, it's not Fuchs example of, you know, himself, he's quoting
2568240	2573120	and explaining some other work by their physicists. But, but Fuchs, Fuchs paper is a great place to
2573120	2581840	do it because he gives a good explanation. A quantum setup where you can know with probability one,
2582560	2589040	what value you will get when you make a particular measurement, but you can prove using quantum
2589040	2595040	theory and that particular experimental setup that it's impossible for the value to exist prior to
2595040	2600880	you making the measurement. So you, so Einstein was wrong. Here's a quantum system where you know
2600880	2606240	with probability one, what you're going to get without disturbing the system when you measure
2606560	2612400	without disturbing system, you know, with probability one, what the value is that you're
2612400	2617600	going to get when you do measure the system. And you can prove that that value does not exist
2618800	2627040	prior to the measurement. So, so that's the real kicker is that that the act of observation
2627680	2633600	is not an act of fact discovery. It's an act of fact creation, which is the kind of
2634320	2638240	thing that John Wheeler would like to say, the, you know, the act of observation is an act of
2638240	2644720	a fact creation. And, and that's what the, the theory of consciousness is saying as well that
2645680	2651200	the coin of the realm are conscious experiences. And that's, and that's what's happening is we're,
2651200	2656240	we're, you know, the fundamental reality are these conscious experiences that arise and disappear.
2656880	2664160	And space time itself is just a user interface. One possible out of many, many countless
2664960	2670640	other possible interfaces that we could use to interact with the other conscious agents.
2671280	2674800	You know, I'm looking forward once we kneel down in relationship with
2675360	2679600	space time to then start to explore all, all the other kinds of interfaces that are possible.
2679600	2684960	Space time is, is not the only one and it may not be a particularly interesting one. It may be
2685600	2689520	I think, probably trivial one. I think we got saddled with a cheap model.
2691520	2696080	Maybe it was the best we could afford, Don. I think that there are conscious agents out there
2696080	2701360	with interfaces where they can understand, they can, they can imagine 50,000 dimensions. And I,
2701360	2707360	I'm jealous. Yeah. At least we're not stuck in one dimension or one in the, like the second
2707360	2712400	dimension, you know, flat land. I was going to ask you like maybe E. Coli, maybe, maybe E. Coli only
2713360	2718880	Yeah, who knows what their perceptual experience is like. The, I wanted to ask you,
2718880	2723920	next was going to be about John Wheeler and has it from Bit, the participatory universe that he,
2724960	2732560	that he posited. Does that, I mean, I know that's, you know, it's, that's an idea that decades old
2732560	2737840	and it's not such a popular idea anymore. Or what, I don't know if it ever really caught on.
2738560	2744160	Um, he had some pretty out there ideas like the one electron universe and everything, but,
2744160	2751040	but it from bit in particular, the participatory nature of things that seems fairly similar to
2751040	2754640	what you're, what you're proposing here, right? Is there any tie with, with your theory?
2755760	2765280	I, I agree with you. And, uh, I think Wheeler agreed. He actually cited me. And is it from
2765280	2773760	bit paper? Oh, I didn't realize that. Wow. Yeah. 1989. Wow. I, um, with, with, uh, Bruce Bennett
2773760	2782480	and Chaitan Prakash, we published a book called Observer Mechanics in 1989. And it, it 300 pages
2782480	2788800	of math, which was our first attempt at this theory of conscious agents. And Wheeler cites it
2788800	2793280	in his it from bit paper. I think it's like reference 170, 175 or something like that.
2793280	2799840	So if you want to see it, it's Bennett, Hoffman, Prakash, and he cites. So he'd actually seen our,
2799840	2807680	our book. And, uh, we, in fact, in our book, use the notion of a participator as the technical
2807680	2814000	term. And we got that from Wheeler, right? So we, we, we chose the term participator,
2814000	2817360	which was sort of our, our, our name for conscious agents in that book.
2818320	2818960	Gotcha.
2818960	2822640	conscious agents were, we called them participators. We had a more coding dynamics of
2822640	2829680	participators. So, so yes, we were influenced in our 1989 book by Wheeler's ideas, at least
2829680	2835360	for the language that we used. Um, and then Wheeler was, had clearly looked at our book and,
2835360	2841280	and liked it enough to cite it in his it from bit paper. So, and I think a lot of physicists
2842080	2847200	like Wheeler's idea, but don't know what to do with it. Right? I mean, Wheeler,
2848400	2853760	it's the kind of thing where you go, there's, there's, he's onto something and he's, he's a genius
2853760	2858960	and he was, everybody understood. He was, you know, a physicist genius and, you know,
2860400	2866160	very famous physicists were his students. Feynman was a student of Wheeler's and so forth. So,
2867040	2871680	uh, he was nobody's fool. That's for sure. He was, he was brilliant. You can't dismiss him out of
2871680	2877120	hand. It was, I think a lot of physicists think that, you know, there may be something deep there,
2877120	2880480	but, but you know, science has to, you know, physics has to catch up. We have to get to the
2880480	2888480	point where we can, you know, put beef on the idea that, that Wheeler saw and hopefully the
2888480	2895360	theory of conscious agents may be a step in that direction. Gotcha. That's great. And then the last
2895360	2902160	physics piece before we jump into some non-physics stuff, Seth Lloyd and his ontology of qubits and
2902160	2906720	gates, which I know you've referenced in at least one of your papers before, you know, you were
2906720	2912320	pursuing a different ontology than his, but I don't know if you, if you followed his work
2912320	2918800	in that space at all, but it also seems similar in some respect to sort of like Wolfram's work
2918800	2926080	with the computational sort of digital universe concept and ideas. But do you have any comments
2926080	2930480	about Seth Lloyd's work or if that has any overlap with, with what you're working on?
2931040	2935440	Well, there, there is a way in which they're similar and a way in which they're very, very
2935440	2941440	different. So the similarity is that they're not taking space time as fundamental. They're
2941440	2949040	trying to build it up. Right. So that, but Seth Lloyd is using, trying to start with quantum
2949040	2954720	theory and build it up for quantum bits and quantum gates. And it's brilliant, brilliant work.
2955840	2962320	But on that, I, I think that Nima or Connie Hamed is right that, that, that we,
2965040	2969680	starting with quantum theory is not going deep enough. We're going to have to find a deeper
2969680	2975760	framework entirely outside of space time and quantum theory and show that space time and
2975760	2982160	quantum theory together arise joined at the hip. So I, I agree with Nima on that. And part of it is
2982160	2993680	that, that quantum theory, at least the evolution like the Schrodinger equation
2994000	3005280	has time as a parameter. So it's, it's, so space time is doomed. That version of quantum theory is
3005280	3010880	doomed too. It's not fundamental. We're going to have to get something, something deeper. So,
3011440	3018560	so, you know, of course, I think in science, we need to let a thousand flowers grow. So I, I wouldn't
3019200	3022960	try to stop their work at one bit. I would encourage their work. I should, I would say it
3022960	3028400	should be funded. And, and, and, and also the work was trying to show some kind of automata,
3028400	3032960	maybe some kind of cellular automata or something like that, at the foundations of space time. But
3032960	3042240	if, if the idea is that, that, that space time is fundamental, and these are just like the,
3042240	3048000	the building blocks of space time, then I think it's not going deep enough. I think we, we really
3048000	3059040	need to let go of our clinging to space time and view it for what I think it is, which is merely a
3059040	3067920	user interface. That is, it's, there's a deeper dynamical reality utterly beyond space time. And
3067920	3075040	that space time is, is one of countless interfaces that that dynamical reality can use to interact
3075040	3080880	with itself. Yeah. So, so that's, I think the difference. So in spirit, they're trying to
3081600	3087120	get at the foundations with, with Seth Lloyd is really trying to use quantum theory to boot up
3088320	3094320	space time. And, and in other cases, you know, might be various kinds of automata.
3096080	3103360	And I guess, you know, in some sense, there is probably some kind of mathematical map between
3103360	3111040	our probabilistic Markovian dynamics of conscious agents and automata. And for example, our, our,
3112160	3115920	it's as easy to prove that the Markovian dynamics is computationally universal.
3117280	3122720	So anything that you can do with automata, you can do, or with Turing machines, universal Turing
3122720	3128400	machines, or neural networks, you can do with Markovian dynamical systems. So they're computationally
3128400	3135120	universal. But there's another aspect to it. And that is that the Markovian dynamical systems
3135120	3142160	are not limited to computation. In particular, the measurable spaces and the measurable sets on
3142160	3146960	which the probabilities are defined need not be computable. They could not be recursively
3146960	3155200	neural. There's, as far as I can see, there's no reason to restrict the definition of probabilities
3155200	3165840	to our resets. So if that's right, then, then Markovian dynamics is not restricted to
3166480	3169600	computer computability. Of course, it gets computability trivially.
3170960	3177760	And that's one reason why we felt comfortable in our, in our basic definition of conscious agents
3177760	3182080	to have it be so trivial. I mean, there are, there are conscious experiences,
3182080	3187200	and they have dynamical interactions with them. So we, what didn't we put in? We didn't put in a
3187200	3195360	notion of a self. We didn't put in notions of learning, memory, problem solving, attention,
3195920	3202960	none of that. But we knew that since networks of conscious agents are computationally universal,
3203840	3208160	that any, anything that you could build a neural network of, so neural network of learning and
3208160	3212960	memory and intelligence, you know, like chat, GPT and so forth, anything that you can do with
3212960	3217440	those networks, you can do with conscious agent networks were computationally universal. So
3217440	3224160	that's why we didn't want to put the kitchen sink into our definition. We wanted to make our
3224160	3232560	definition is absolutely spare as possible while retaining computational universality
3232560	3236400	so that we could then build everything else and we'd be forced to build everything else.
3236400	3241440	And so, so that was why that was our choice. And that's what you want. That's, that's Occam's razor
3242080	3247600	right in the building of scientific theories is minimal set of assumptions as possible.
3248320	3255520	And that's so yeah. Yeah, that's great. And before we kept off the sort of physics related
3255520	3262000	kind of questions, truncated a comment or question from carbon 1479. They asked,
3262400	3269680	I'm truncating it a bit here, but does your model lead towards an eternal block universe
3270640	3278640	or multiverse? No. No, okay. So the like the Einstein block universe where he's space time,
3278640	3286480	there's a space time flow from and no, it doesn't lead to that kind of universe at all.
3286960	3298080	In fact, it says that that the space time itself is one trivial, fairly trivial kind
3298080	3303760	of interface that networks of consciousness can use. As I said earlier, it's the cheap model.
3303760	3308080	It's a I think it's a cheap model. So even the interface isn't a block universe, even the
3308320	3314400	even even the yeah, even our interface version is not a block universe by any means.
3316560	3321360	Here, here's one way that could be concrete about why it's not time.
3323600	3327840	Time is not fundamental in our Markovian dynamics. You might say, wait a minute,
3327840	3332720	you're talking about Markovian dynamics. Now, dynamics sounds like you have some notion of time.
3333120	3341120	And there is a notion of sequence in the Markovian dynamics. But time as physicists think about it
3341120	3348160	is intimately linked with the second law of thermodynamics, which says that entropy is
3348160	3355360	always increasing in some sense, that law gives the arrow to time, the direction to time. And
3355920	3361520	with our Markovian dynamics of conscious agents, there is a step sequence, but it's
3362240	3366240	straightforward to write down Markovian dynamics in which the entropy does not increase.
3367600	3375200	It's a constant entropy. But it's also trivial. It's a three step proof to show that if you take
3375200	3380320	such a Markovian dynamics in which there is no arrow of time, so there's no physics time at all
3380320	3388000	in it. Any projection of that dynamics, so you're taking this Markovian dynamics and you're projecting
3388000	3401040	it to another dynamics where you've lost information. So it's another Markovian dynamics
3401040	3406240	which is a projection of the deeper one. So it's a projected dynamics, but it's lost information.
3406800	3413440	The very act of losing information in the projection entails that you will have
3414000	3422400	an increasing entropy in the projected dynamics. So you will have an arrow of time in that
3422400	3430880	projected dynamics, not as an insight into the original dynamics. It's an artifact of the projection.
3431840	3440640	And so the entropic arrow of time that is the foundation of, for example, the spacetime cube
3440880	3448960	is not an insight into this deeper reality. It's a trivial artifact of the projection process.
3448960	3455040	It's something that happens, quote unquote, like a mistake of the projection. It's entailed
3455040	3462640	by the projection. It's not a deep insight into the deeper reality. So that's a good question.
3462640	3467600	But you can see that why we're definitely not just the spacetime cube and even the time part
3467600	3472880	of that cube, we're saying is an artifact of projection, that that arrow, the notion of an
3472880	3480560	arrow of time that would allow you to trace out the cube. Of course, the cube itself now is this
3480560	3487200	spacetime loaf in which in some sense you're seeing all of time at once. But there is an arrow
3487200	3492240	nevertheless in that loaf. And that arrow is an artifact of the projection process.
3493040	3502640	So in the original, not yet projected space, let's talk about space is already throwing
3502640	3511200	it off a bit. But let's say in that realm, if there is a sequence, there's no time there.
3512080	3518320	But how does the sequence play out? Or how do you get the orderedness of it? I mean,
3518320	3524160	is that is the block? That seems to me like a block universe, but that seems to me like a block
3524160	3531200	space sort of in that these sequences exist, but no time. So how does that how's that ordered?
3532400	3534960	Right. So in the theory of Markov change, you do get these
3536960	3542400	ordered spaces where you look at all possible trajectories that the dynamics could take.
3542960	3549520	And those typically denoted by a capital omega. So often that the spaces are written and then
3549520	3553520	individual trajectories are a little omega. So you have all these little omegas that are possible
3553520	3557840	trajectories and together all of them make up the big omega. And these are infinitely long
3557840	3563600	trajectories and so forth. And then once you put a probability measure on these trajectories,
3563600	3568080	you can then see whether that particular more COVID dynamics has a growing entropy or not
3569040	3573840	on that. But but it turns out you don't need to have a growing entropy and therefore you don't
3573840	3580000	need to have a physics kind of notion of time at all. So there is a notion of sequence, an order.
3580640	3587840	So you have a total. So here's the thing. You have a total ordered set of steps. So there's a
3587840	3595040	total order, but but that's time has more structure than that. It's got a growing entropy and so
3595040	3602400	forth. Time in modern physics is subject to Lorentz transformations and the whole bit.
3603280	3610400	What we want to like to show is that here we have this Markovian dynamics. There need to be no
3610400	3614320	arrow of time because there's no increasing entropy. And we can show that under certain
3614320	3620560	projections, yeah, it looks like a Lorentz transformation. So for example, the projections
3620560	3625920	might be various kinds. If I have a big Markov chain, there you can do so called trace chains.
3625920	3630720	You could do various projections onto different traces of subsets of states or maybe even
3631520	3637520	subsamples of steps. And what this is one direction I'm really interested in pursuing is to show that
3637520	3644080	under what conditions of the tracing and sampling that all the different traces and samples are
3644080	3648720	related to each other by, for example, the Lorentz group or the Poincare group, so that we can
3648720	3655840	actually show where those symmetries come from as just one way of getting a family of projections,
3655840	3662480	a group of projections of this deeper dynamics of consciousness. Interesting, cool.
3665520	3670000	When you take a sampling, and this is another comment or question I have to find their name
3670000	3676240	and overlay it, but when you take a sampling, let's say of the largest group or the total group,
3676560	3685040	is there a fractal-like quality to a smaller sampling set? I think they mentioned that you
3685040	3690080	did an interview at some point, I mean, you mentioned that there was some kind of like
3691280	3699680	self-similar, some self-similarity between say a sampling of a space and say the omega,
3699680	3704480	the totally large space. Is that ringing any bells or is this totally off?
3704480	3710880	Well, it's a pretty interesting direction to think about. The
3714720	3718960	there's the notion of self-similarity. Well, first, if we have this big
3720720	3727440	consciousness dynamics, you might get trace chains of it that are similar in various
3727440	3735600	ways to the to the original, certainly. But there's something very, very deep about,
3739680	3743360	well, I'll just put it this way. First, yeah, straightforward to get self-similarity. You
3743360	3748160	can do that with Markov Dynamics, but there's something really, there's something even deeper,
3749200	3756000	and there's something that physicists and scientists call universality. This was discovered by
3756720	3763360	Eugene Wigner working on the Manhattan Project and trying to get the energy levels of the
3764480	3770320	uranium atom, which are so complicated he couldn't get it. So what he did was he
3772160	3777520	used large random matrices, just matrices of random numbers. And he showed that the,
3778160	3785440	he found that the eigenvalues, so the eigenvalues are a way of characterizing the intrinsic properties
3785440	3790800	of a matrix. And you could have lots and lots of eigenvalues and they'd be spaced. You could have,
3792480	3797440	maybe an eigenvalue would be close to one, another eigenvalue, but the spacing,
3798240	3803360	they wouldn't get too close and they wouldn't get too far away. And you got this distribution of
3803360	3809600	the spacing between the eigenvalues. And this has shown up all, he discovered that and it seemed to
3809600	3816160	match the spacing of energy levels of the uranium atom. And then this whole thing about
3816160	3822080	universality, you mentioned the magazine, Quanta. Quanta Magazine has wonderful videos and articles
3822080	3827840	on universality. So if you just Google Quanta Magazine and universality, there's a fun world to
3827840	3835840	enter through Quanta Magazine on that. But our Markov Dynamics, we have these,
3836240	3844640	a Markov kernel is a matrix. It's an end-by-end matrix. It could be a billion-by-billion. And
3845680	3851280	many of the matrices that we're going to study are random. They're random numbers where the
3851280	3855120	numbers are between zero and one. It doesn't matter what the range of the numbers is, the random
3855120	3864080	numbers. So universality is going to pop out of this where we're dealing with just random matrices.
3864080	3872240	And so I'm right now just, and that has to do with like phase transitions. So how do you go from
3872240	3880480	one, for example, state of matter to another phase transitions all? So I'm, that question is good
3880480	3888800	because it's pointing to a huge realm of research that I'm really eager to jump into. Yeah, there's
3888800	3894160	a notion of self-similarity, but then there's this whole universality thing. And it's really
3894160	3900240	deeply tied somehow to random matrices. And matrices are the foundation of this theory of
3900240	3906720	conscious agents. And many of them are going to be random. Many of them will not be random too.
3906720	3912640	So it's going to be really interesting to explore. So yeah, we get fractal kind of behavior. We also
3912640	3920640	get behavior that's very deterministic, right? You can model both. So you don't necessarily have
3920640	3927760	to get fractal behavior in a Markov chain, but you absolutely can. And you can get universality as
3927760	3934320	well. So it's a very, very flexible framework. And I'm very eager to, to explore. I may need to have
3934320	3940960	some other experts who are more expert on the math, you know, the mathematics here is pretty intense.
3940960	3948640	Yeah, there's a lot of different areas that you jump in between. I spoke with Carl Friston
3948640	3954400	a few weeks ago and talked about his free energy principle. And I was wondering,
3954400	3960400	because one of the things he mentioned to me in our conversation was, his quote was, there's,
3961840	3965600	it doesn't know of anything that's more fundamental than the free energy principle.
3965600	3974160	So, you know, trying to, trying to minimize, I think it's a variational free energy in a system,
3974160	3980480	you know, anything, any agent in a system is trying to do that. Do you find, have you found
3980480	3986480	any of those kinds, that kind of dynamic from your conscious agent framework? Are they exhibiting
3987200	3992080	this kind of behavior? But do they abide by the free energy principle?
3993040	3998800	Right. So in, in the theory of Markov chains, what you, you're going to get very, very similar
3998800	4005120	kinds of things popping out. There's something called potential theory. In, in, in, so you're
4005120	4013520	going to have is systems in which you can model what would look like heat. So the free energy,
4013600	4021840	the Gibbs free energy, for example, is the enthalpy minus delta, so, so the, the delta G,
4021840	4028320	you know, the change in the Gibbs free energy equals delta H, which is the change in the enthalpy
4028320	4036640	minus T delta S, which is T is the temperature and degrees Kelvin, and delta S is the change
4036640	4047760	in the entropy. So, so what I see happening is that these are going to be high level descriptions
4047760	4052800	of when we actually look at Markov chains, you're going to find that they're, you have this
4053440	4059840	dynamics is happening in a, in a large dimensional space, and certain states are going to have
4059840	4063520	higher probabilities. You're going to be in some sense more, the dynamics will be more attracted
4063600	4069760	to those states. And then, and then less attracted to be put somewhere else, it'll, it'll tend to,
4069760	4074560	to converge to certain kinds of states. And so we're going to be able to model all, you know,
4075280	4082320	absolutely Gibbs free, free energy, enthalpy, entropy, the whole bit within the Markovian
4082960	4087920	dynamics. Now, one thing that I'll mention that, that may be a difference in, in our frameworks,
4088640	4094320	you know, I think that the Gibbs free energy ideas is, is important and, and should be pursued.
4095440	4099680	But typically, the work that they're doing is assuming
4102800	4107200	it was built on the work of Judea Pearl, directed acyclic graphs.
4110880	4113520	Markov chains are more general.
4114400	4123440	Directed acyclic graphs are a special kind, a special subclass of Markov. But there's no reason
4123440	4131200	not to have cycles. Why, why should it be acyclic? Lots of things in nature are, are cyclic. And so
4131200	4138320	the, the Markovian dynamics that we're, we're studying, of course, can model directed acyclic
4138320	4143520	graphs as a special case. There are special Markov chains that do that, but it is not restricted to
4143520	4150640	that. And so that's, that's going to be one difference. Another important thing is that
4153040	4160960	in, in some cases, it, in the discussions, it seems like some of the proponents of the, you know,
4161840	4171680	free energy principle are thinking that the, there's with the directed acyclic graph and the
4171680	4176320	free energy principle, you have what's called a Markov blanket, right? There's the, the states of
4176320	4182400	the system inside, then there's the external world, and then there's a blanket. And so if you have a
4182400	4189360	set of nodes that are your system, the blanket is technically defined as all the parents of the
4190080	4196320	nodes in your system, all the descendants of the nodes of your system, and all the parents
4196960	4202800	of the descendants of the nodes in your system, that those, those are, those nodes form the Markov
4202800	4210960	blanket. This is from Judea Pearl's work and for directed acyclic graphs. Now it, it's a theorem
4211840	4225360	that the state of the nodes inside the blanket and the state of the nodes of the rest of the world
4225360	4232160	outside of the blanket are conditionally independent, entirely conditionally independent, given the
4232160	4240320	state of the nodes of the Markov blanket. What that means is the only thing that the nodes inside
4240320	4248480	can know about quote, unquote, the world is captured on the blanket. And it's trivial to show that
4248480	4254560	there are, there's an infinity of different states of the external nodes that would lead to exactly
4254560	4261920	the same state of the blanket nodes, right? Given, right? So you could have tons and tons of states.
4261920	4269920	So the Markov blanket is what we call an interface in our theory, right? It's,
4270960	4279680	it's an interface. And there's no way that the, so often in many cases there, they talk in this
4279680	4286320	literature as though you are doing Bayesian inference and actually inferring the true state of the
4286320	4295520	external world. That's not possible. The state of the nodes outside the blanket and the state of
4295520	4302000	the nodes inside the blanket are conditionally independent, given the state of the blanket.
4302000	4309440	So there's no way. So all you can do, you can never get a Bayesian estimate of the true state of the
4309440	4315920	external world. You can't. All you can do is get your best interface description. So the way I think
4315920	4320240	about the free energy principle, I think is a little bit different than many of the proponents of
4320240	4325600	the, of that free energy principle. It's, you're, you're not doing Bayesian inference and getting
4325600	4331680	an estimate of the true state of the world, not by a long shot. You are simply getting a user
4331680	4338000	interface that allows you to stay alive as a system. But the staying alive as a system doesn't
4338000	4343120	mean that you've actually estimated the truth about the external world. So there may be a difference
4343200	4349680	in philosophy that would be fun to discuss. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. It's still,
4351120	4355520	I talked with him for a while and I've researched it fully. It's, it's still
4356800	4362720	aspects of it that elude me, if I'm being honest, that the, I'm not sure what's sort of intrinsic
4362720	4369760	and what's sort of a byproduct and what's, you know, what's sort of naturally happening there.
4369760	4374880	So it's something that I have to, I have to keep following back. There was a great
4376400	4381760	set of papers in behavioral and brain science a few years back that I can point you to where
4382720	4389600	they, there's a target article that argues that, that, you know, the free energy principle is
4389600	4393280	it's used and the notion of Markov blankets is this used
4394240	4402720	is different from that of Pearl, that Pearl gave a functional definition and in many cases
4402720	4411040	look like they were giving a physical definition of the boundary. I think since then a lot of
4411040	4416320	working free energy principles sort of walk back the idea of identification with a physical
4416320	4421680	principle. But, but I think there's still a very interesting dialogue going back and forth. I think
4421680	4428000	the, I think that Gibbs free energy is of course central and it's very, very important.
4430320	4435040	Exactly how it's being used is really critical. My take is,
4436480	4439680	as long as we're still thinking inside space time, we're not thinking deep enough.
4441840	4447360	We're going to find that when you analyze the potential theory of Markov chains and so forth,
4447360	4452800	you will get all, you'll get Gibbs free energy and all those concepts entirely outside of space
4452800	4458160	time. And then when we look down to space time as a user interface as a trivial projection of
4458160	4464240	that deeper thing, we will then see the physics notion of Gibbs free energy and chemistry notion
4464240	4471280	of Gibbs free energy and so forth as a projection of this much deeper notion of the
4471920	4476400	potential theory of Markov chains. So that's my take of where it's going.
4477440	4481680	I want to ask you about in a commenter. I have to find the names of these commenters. I have,
4481680	4488320	I know it's all over the place, but I know there was a commenter who posited something around how
4490240	4494320	how do you know, and I guess I would assume it's just the best we can do, but
4495200	4502320	like math and formal logic, how do we know it's not just another symbol within our interface,
4503040	4508960	i.e., how can we be sure, sure with enough confidence that outside of this interface,
4508960	4515920	say outside space and time, that they say hold true, because like one plus one equals two,
4515920	4521360	you know, we know that's true here, but how do we know it's true outside our universe or in
4521360	4525600	another universe or, you know, all the way all the way outside of that. So do you have anything?
4527040	4531440	I mean, it's just something you think about, you've thought about, but you respond to that in
4531440	4537360	any way? Well, there's several levels of, it's an important question, and there's several levels.
4538640	4543040	Maybe the simplest level would be if you just have the notion of, for example,
4543680	4549760	the kinds of basic kinds of geometries we could have of spacetime. Is it flat?
4550720	4556480	Is it hyperbolic or positive or negative curvature space?
4559040	4567360	And so we can use this mathematical notion of the geometry to ask the question, well,
4567360	4575920	what geometry does our universe have? And what we find is what using the cosmic microwave background
4575920	4584800	radiation, we've been able to say to within a certain level of certainty, our universe has is
4584800	4590720	flat, it has zero curvature, it's not positive or negative, it's zero. And we can put limits on,
4591520	4598320	if it's positive curvature, we can put limits on how big it could possibly be. So we can actually
4598320	4603920	say, okay, I mean, our data are, you know, suggested it's flat, but they don't rule out
4603920	4609440	a small curvature, because of course noise and so forth, you can't rule it out. So given what
4609440	4615600	we know about the noise, and even though it's pointed to zero, it might not be exactly zero,
4615600	4619840	we can put a limit on the positive curvature in there, and therefore the positive
4620720	4626240	diameter of our universe. And so that's been done. So that's one way, and you can see,
4626240	4633040	here we're using geometry, the mathematics, the abstract mathematics to constrain
4633920	4639280	using data, our understanding of the geometry of the universe we happen to be living in.
4639280	4644000	Okay, so that's one way of getting up. But, but there's a deeper now, there's a deeper, the, the,
4644000	4648720	I think the questioner is asking a deeper question, which is why should we trust mathematics at all?
4648720	4651440	And these are the mathematics that we're using.
4654400	4662560	It's not, it's not the final word, by any means. And I would say, yeah, I agree that
4665040	4672800	mathematics is this powerful tool, but we have to be extremely aware that what humans have
4672800	4678320	discovered of mathematics is trivial. I would say if all the mathematics that is to be known,
4678400	4684080	we know probability zero of it. We know measure zero of the mathematics to be discovered.
4686160	4694960	And, and we know that there are many different axiom systems that are that that we can use.
4696080	4703200	And so it's now one way that some people have responded to this kind of thing though, for
4703200	4710720	example, like Max Tegmark, is to say, well, that just means to him, he thinks mathematics
4710720	4715280	is fundamental reality. And that doesn't just mean the mathematics that we now understand,
4715280	4720800	that's all the mathematics. And so for any possible kind of mathematical system, there's a
4720800	4725360	universe. And so he, I think he calls it his level four multiverse, where anything that's
4725360	4730000	mathematically possible, including stuff that we haven't discovered yet, is actual, and all those
4730000	4739200	universes exist. Now, but there's another answer to this as well, which is to say,
4744000	4751120	if we're going to reason at all, if we want to argue, we want to have differences of opinions
4751120	4759360	and try to convince each other, we're using logic. Or if we don't have that, what do we have?
4760480	4768640	Force, I mean, I'll force you to agree with me. Who's interested in that? So we use logic,
4768640	4779200	we use reason, we try to use evidence. The more precise your reasoning, the more you're really
4779200	4788240	moving into mathematics, the less precise, the more your reasoning is probably not worth listening to.
4789200	4794240	So we're in this real interesting catch 22. We can't,
4796800	4800560	we know that the mathematics we know is trivial compared to what's out there to be known. We
4800560	4806480	know that there are many different axiom systems that are mutually incompatible, and all are
4806480	4819200	interesting. So there is this, and yet, we don't want to say, we shouldn't use persuasion and
4819200	4827120	reason and logic in our discussions on politics and religion or whatever, or in science, or in
4827120	4835040	social studies, or in arts and humanities. We see reason and logic and argumentation,
4836240	4846000	like intelligent argumentation going on. And that certainly is far better than just brute force
4846000	4853440	saying, believe me, you must do it my way, you must assert and state what I, we don't want to do
4853520	4861520	there. So we're in an interesting position where it's humbling. If we don't use
4861520	4869040	math and logic, we're screwed. If we do use math and logic, we can't prove that we're using the
4869040	4874080	right stuff and we don't know what's out there that we don't know. So my attitude is,
4874800	4889200	we have to go with what we have so far and always be humble. Say, my theory is just the best theory
4889200	4897840	I have so far. And of course, it's just a theory. And of course, sooner, hopefully, then later,
4897840	4903680	people will look back and laugh at our theories. We look back at the, we look back a few centuries,
4903760	4910880	and we see the confident pronunciations of people. That's embarrassing. It's completely,
4912160	4919040	earth, air, fire, and water, that's not it. You know, caloric, that's not it. And even Newtonian
4919040	4926880	theory, it's beautiful, that's not it. And the same thing will be true of quantum theory and
4926880	4935120	spacetime. That's not it. And those who, it's really, if we don't want to embarrass ourselves,
4935120	4939920	we should be the ones that are saying about our own theories. Of course, this is just the next
4939920	4945200	baby step. If we don't have that attitude, we will look very, very silly in short order,
4945200	4950720	hopefully shorter, sooner than later. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, the response I think is basically,
4951840	4955840	and I don't think this person commenting was critical. They were just curious,
4955920	4959360	but it would be like, well, what do you have that's better? What do you have that's better than
4959360	4963360	math and formal logic? It's like, if you have something that's better, let me know,
4963360	4970000	because we'll try to use it. But it's hard to, yeah, it's the best we can do is what we have
4970000	4976560	available. But I do think I want to turn to, and perhaps we could close in this kind of area, is
4977360	4984880	personal experience as a teacher. Because I do think, well, you know, each of our
4984880	4988080	individual life stories and our own personal experiences, those are
4989600	5000800	as true, as close to real as we can get, perhaps, or as the life force, the day-to-day
5000800	5005680	living that we do. And one thing that I think we mentioned this on this interview,
5006720	5014080	earlier rounds is your meditation practice. You spend upwards three hours a day, most days
5014080	5019040	meditating. And I'd love to hear more about that, because when I've heard you talk about
5019040	5026960	your practice, it's quite fascinating to me. How did you land on that practice? Did you try
5026960	5031280	out a bunch of different forms? How did you find what works for you?
5033120	5039040	Well, I should say that I got into it simply because I was having a hard time sleeping,
5039040	5044560	and so I didn't want to take pills. And so I decided to meditate. So it wasn't like some
5045600	5051840	deep... My guess is that if I hadn't had trouble sleeping, I wouldn't have ever meditated. And
5052960	5060640	I'm glad that I've meditated, because it turned out to be far more than just a sleep aid. It has
5060640	5073520	transformed me in many, many ways. I was helped because I had a friend, Joe Arpaia, who had written
5073520	5081200	a book on meditation with, I guess, a forward by the Dalai Lama as well. And I had actually...
5083040	5089840	He had asked me to read and give him comments on a draft before he published it. And I wasn't
5089840	5095440	myself interested in meditation. I didn't do it, but Joe was a friend and a good friend, and
5096240	5103040	still is a very, very good friend. And so I gave him comments. So I had some understanding,
5103040	5108160	a little bit of understanding, just from reading of the Buddhist approach to it.
5108960	5114560	And then I read a little bit of a guy named Thomas Keating, who was a
5114880	5126640	Benedictine monk. So that's from a Christian Catholic kind of perspective. But then,
5128320	5138560	he also had lots of influence from Buddhism as well. So I saw that there was these mystical
5138560	5144720	aspects of Christianity and Buddhism were not that far apart. I mean, they used different
5144720	5150400	languages. The Buddhists aren't that terribly interested in Mother Mary, whereas Father Keating
5150400	5160160	was. As far as the practice was concerned, they didn't really affect the practice. And so my practice,
5160160	5172400	and then I'd say I've been heavily influenced as well by Eckhart Tolle. I think that his
5173600	5180560	is a fairly non-religious explication. And I really like that, a very non-religious explication of
5182880	5186720	meditation and very, very practical. And then you're not trying to get anywhere.
5187280	5195280	You're either present now or you're not. And there's no issue about getting good at meditation
5195280	5202640	or anything like that. It's am I present now? If not, why not get present? Be present now.
5204320	5210960	And there's nothing about having to use decades and decades of effort to finally get enlightened
5210960	5216560	and so forth. So I've really been helped by Eckhart's thing, because the mind naturally
5216560	5224880	tries to get into this thing where I try really hard. And if I try real hard and do all these
5224880	5232080	hours, then I will get enlightened eventually. The reason I have to spend so much time is
5233440	5239200	my guess is that I just have a lot of issues, a lot of emotional issues. And so I just have to be
5239200	5245520	there and face this stuff. And what Eckhart Tolle had called the pain body, I think I was born.
5247520	5254800	I know from the stuff my parents were dealing with before I was born, they were in deep,
5254800	5259520	deep emotional pain. And I was born into that. And so we each get a deck of cards that we're
5259520	5265600	dealt with. And I came into the world kicking and screaming. I cried non-stop for my first year,
5265600	5272720	basically. I was just born that way and gave my parents tremendous difficulty.
5273600	5281200	So and I'm still facing, probably, we know that a child born to a mother who is highly stressed
5282400	5291600	gets methylated in certain ways. You have change to your genetics. And so I suspect that I was born
5291600	5299760	into this world screaming and crying because I was methylated. My mom was very anxious. My parents
5299760	5307280	were very anxious. My dad was in the military. They were only 21 years old, 22 years old. They were
5307280	5314720	little kids scared to death, well, alcohol abuse and their families and so forth. They were just
5314720	5323120	trying to get their act together. So their stress gets taken into the child, methylation.
5323120	5327120	If your parents are stressed, it makes good evolutionary sense that you would methylate
5327120	5334800	the child to be ready for stressful situations. So I came ready to deal with stress. I was stressed
5334800	5342000	out all so hyper vigilant and so forth. And so my guess is that the reason I have to spend so much
5342000	5348320	time is I'm dealing with methylation. Literally, it's a biological, you know, from that point of
5348320	5356320	view, it's a biological thing. And so the unwinding of that is I've been at it for 30,000 hours of
5356320	5365520	meditation. And other people get born to parents who are calm and never get methylated in this way.
5365520	5372960	And so it's a different, you know, I would say that, you know, I got the cards I was dealt with,
5372960	5380640	people get different cards. It's been painful, but I've learned a lot. And, you know, so I'm not
5380640	5388720	complaining about it. Those are my cards. And I've learned to, you know, more and more be with what
5388720	5396640	is. And in some sense, the bigger the challenge you face, the more you learn. And this has been a
5396640	5403360	huge challenge for me. I mean, having to spend several hours a day just facing that and almost
5403360	5408640	like looking at this little child that's that's inconsolable and just being there and consoling
5408640	5416560	them and staying with it. So I've learned a lot in the process. And I think it's fed into my work
5416560	5424400	on consciousness because I'm really facing, you know, very personal level, this, this whole thing
5424400	5437360	about consciousness. My own take is our theory of conscious agents has a theorem. It's a theorem
5437360	5444320	with a theory that there is just ultimately one conscious agent. There is one. And all
5444480	5456800	conscious agents are projections, traces of that one conscious agent. And so, and that but but
5456800	5461200	it's also a theorem of the theory that that we can never get a complete mathematical description
5461200	5466400	by a long shot of that one conversation. It trend. So our mathematics says it exists. And it says you
5466400	5473600	can't actually describe it. It's it transcends mathematics. We can't do it. You'd have to climb
5473600	5477520	up all of something called Cantor's hierarchy and there's no end to Cantor's hierarchy of
5477520	5485520	infinities. So you could never get to that that that final description. But my own personal view
5487600	5496240	is that you and I and each person that I meet and in an amoeba and my cat.
5496720	5505040	I'm actually, each of us is the one that that that in other words, that that infinite
5505040	5509440	consciousness that transcends any mathematical description, looking at itself
5510720	5516960	through a particular little interface. And so I'm the way I view it right now is that, you know,
5516960	5522240	I'm talking with Carlos, but it's really the one talking with one. It's the one using a
5522800	5529600	it's the one using a Hoffman avatar talking with the one using the Carlos avatar. And it's it's
5530480	5534400	it's doing this for very, very deep reasons. In some sense,
5536160	5542240	the one which transcends any experience plunges itself into particular experiences. And
5543200	5548640	thereby gets to know itself better. But that's that's a few words for something I think is
5548640	5554880	extremely deep. A system can never know itself completely. You can't ever know yourself completely.
5555680	5562960	But in meditation, when you sit in silence without any thought, and you literally,
5563600	5569680	when you really let go of all thoughts, and you just are you, you just be,
5571600	5577200	then you are really and fully the one looking through this particular little window.
5577200	5584480	This particular little interface, but you are the one. And you're not separate from that. That's
5584480	5590000	that's what you are. When you get caught up in your ideas, your thoughts, and get lost in them,
5590000	5595920	and criticism, and comparing with other people, and, and identifying yourself with, you know,
5595920	5600960	Oh, I got this car, I got this house, or I'm on this smart, or I'm this stupid, or whatever. All
5600960	5607360	these things, then you're still the one, but you've got to cover it up with all these thoughts that
5608480	5615280	hiding your true identity from yourself. And somehow that seems to be also a necessary part
5615280	5622640	of the whole thing of the one going to sleep, and then waking up, deciding to really plunge
5622640	5626720	yourself into this particular little interface. As I've said, I think space time is a pretty
5626720	5632480	trivial little interface, but you know, the one chooses this, it probably has thousands and
5632480	5639600	trillions, countless other interfaces that it plunges into, and learn something new about it.
5639600	5645280	It's inexhaustible. The one is inexhaustible, and the exploration is inexhaustible. And so,
5645280	5650880	in some sense, what you learn in meditation is the attitude of
5650880	5669280	Yes, to whatever comes. Yes, not resistance, not letting go of fear. And that's what life may be
5669280	5677600	about, which is being open to whatever comes, and being open to learn, no matter what happens,
5678560	5686320	and not crawling back into our shells and complaining and whining. When we look at little
5686320	5696000	children, you look at an infant, a 15-month-old, and mom says, you know, it's time for us to
5696000	5702480	leave the swimming pool now, or it's time for us to get out of the sandbox, and the child breaks down
5702480	5710960	and cries, and you realize, wow, you understand what the child is doing, but you also understand
5710960	5715120	that's a lot of pain that the child is going through. And if they just understood that mom and
5715120	5722080	dad, in the healthy cases, loves them, and there's other fun stuff that's going to happen,
5722080	5728560	and just went with it, life could be a lot better. And so, I think that anytime I find myself
5729520	5736240	saying no to this moment, complaining in any way, I'm the little child in the sandbox
5736240	5746400	that's unnecessarily causing myself grief. So what meditation really teaches you is you are the one,
5747280	5760480	everything's going to be fine, even death, and you've got to, you're here for the ride and enjoy
5760480	5766880	the ride, be open to whatever comes on the ride, and that's easier said than done. That's why I
5766880	5773360	spend three hours a day in meditation. So I'm not saying this as someone who's there, I'm saying it
5773360	5782000	as someone who needs three hours a day to open up to the ride. And I'm good with that too.
5782000	5786480	That means, as I said, that was my deck of cards. Other people, like Eckhart Tolle,
5787200	5793120	it happened overnight. And I could wish that happened to me, but that's not me. That's him.
5793680	5802000	And so the one does, it has, tries on all sorts of different avatars, and it's all part of learning
5802000	5808960	about itself. So it's a long answer to the question, but I think that it does feed in to my research.
5809760	5813920	And in fact, I would say this, that the best ideas I have in research come after,
5814880	5820000	you have to do your reading, after your homework, of course, you have to, there's no substitute for
5820000	5827200	that. But then if you want the really good ideas, go into silence. The real creativity comes when
5827200	5832640	I let go of all thinking and just go into absolute silence, interior silence. That's
5832640	5841120	where the best ideas come from. Yeah. Do you have any advice for people? Let's say there's
5841120	5844480	viewers out there, they don't have, they don't have a meditation practice, but they've been
5844480	5852000	considering it or they're thinking about starting one. Do you have any tips or advice for people,
5852000	5859280	maybe starting out? My advice, again, I'm thinking about people sort of like me,
5861680	5868800	that may not want to be heavily invested in any particular religion. We'd like to have
5868800	5873600	something that's just practical, that's helpful, but maybe you don't have to buy into a bunch of
5873600	5885360	other stuff. For that, I would say Eckhart Tolle, his book The Power of Now and
5888560	5896080	New Earth, those are fabulous books. I've read them and reread them. I've gone through them
5896080	5905040	multiple times and he has a number of audio tapes that you can use audio books or audio
5905040	5914560	lectures he's given and I find them extremely helpful to listen to. Rather than me giving
5914560	5924720	advice, I would suggest here's the dude that's really helped me a lot. I've listened to all
5924720	5936240	of stuff. I don't detect any nonsense. I detect a genuine person. Now, I know that I say this to
5936240	5940240	some people and some people say, well, no, you really need to do this more advanced
5941840	5948160	Buddhist thing or whatever and that's perfectly fine, but I think for many American, many
5948480	5960240	non-religious people, the approach that Eckhart gives is going to be the most easily understood
5960240	5969360	and used, but of course, there are Zen approaches. There are every mystical tradition, Sufism,
5970240	5989440	mystical Christianity, Hinduism and all the mystical traditions. I'm not pushing any
5989440	5994560	particular religion at all. When you look at the mystical side of each of the religions,
5994960	6005440	Judaism as well, they all are pointing in the same direction, fallibly, but genuinely pointing
6005440	6013200	in that direction of going into, ultimately, it comes down to letting go of thought.
6015520	6023360	Literally, entire silence, interior silence, no thought at all. So the thought isn't your
6023360	6027280	master. I use thought, of course, as a scientist. I'm talking with you. I'm using thought,
6028400	6035040	but there's a time where you say, okay, it's time to stop thinking all together and just be
6035840	6042720	and just to spend a few minutes or a few hours and then have it actually be the habit instead of
6042720	6047680	going through the day sort of lost in thought because most of the thoughts that we have
6048640	6052640	just going through the day, when you look at them, they're completely dysfunctional.
6054720	6062640	They're useless and many of them are painful. It's much better to understand that thought
6063760	6073360	by itself is like a wild animal. It's just running around. So tell it to stop. You learn to just let
6073360	6079120	go of the thoughts or to watch them and not believe them. If they're not going to stop,
6079760	6085520	you learn to watch them and not believe them. Eventually, they go away and then thought becomes
6085520	6095120	very useful. When I need it for science, it's far more useful, but when I need creativity,
6095120	6099520	in many cases, thought is the background I need. I need to have done my homework. I need to have read,
6100080	6106720	but then when the true creativity is often something that transcends any thought.
6108400	6116720	So learning the care and feeding of thought and to train it and to not let it run you,
6117600	6123120	but to have you use it as a tool and be able to put that tool down when you don't need it anymore
6123120	6129280	or when you don't want to use it. So the tool tends to run us. It tends to tell you who I am
6129600	6134880	no thought can tell me who I am. That's it. That's one of the key things. There is no thought.
6135600	6141280	I am such and such a scientist. I am the owner of this car. I am such and such. My name is,
6141280	6147120	I did this. I am the president of that. I have this big cap. All these thoughts
6149120	6154160	don't get anywhere close at all to telling you who you really are. They're distractions.
6155120	6162560	You can only find out who you are in utter and complete interior silence. That's the only time
6162560	6167840	when you will actually find out who you really are and no thought is ever adequate.
6170800	6177360	Yeah, that reminds me too. A few minutes ago you mentioned something about Benedictine
6178240	6184400	monks. Are you familiar with Joseph Campbell? Yes, in his work. Yeah, he was for folks who
6184400	6191120	audience who is not familiar. He was a mythological and religious historian and teacher
6191120	6196480	for like 38 years, I think at St. Lawrence College. He had this great anecdote how he went to,
6197040	6200720	I think it was in Thailand. He went to some conference that was between
6201360	6208880	Buddhists and Catholics and a meeting of the minds. He said, the theologians that met on both sides
6209760	6214400	were just talking past each other. They could not understand each other's theologies.
6214400	6219040	But the monks on both sides, the Buddhist monks and the Catholic monks, they were like,
6219040	6223680	oh yeah, we get it. We're in the same wavelength. We're doing the same thing. We're talking the
6223680	6229520	same kind of process. We're getting the same feelings. That's what I think you alluded to
6229520	6234480	before. These like different mystical traditions and the practices that they have, there's a lot
6234480	6243760	of overlap between them and the kind of interior Meister Eckhart is another one. There's so much
6243760	6249760	overlap that it seems like we're doing the same thing and it's just a different window dressing
6249760	6259440	of the different traditions that are there. I agree. When you go into silent,
6260480	6263840	then all those trappings disappear and you get in touch with the same thing.
6266640	6271360	Yeah. Unfortunately, I have to take off. Yeah. I think that's a wonderful place to end.
6271360	6276800	And I just so appreciate your time, Don. Thank you again. Thank you. It was a great pleasure.
6277440	6281520	Wonderful. And thank you also. I really like that you bring up these questions that people have
6281520	6287520	because I do like to try to address the questions and that this is very, very good. Thank you.
6287520	6292560	Yes, I appreciate it. Yeah, I'm sure there'll be even more coming. And I will overlay the,
6293520	6297520	because a few questions I had in mind, but I can't remember the commenters' names, but I'll
6297520	6303040	overlay them when those sections come along. And yeah, thank you again, Don. I wish you all the
6303040	6307920	best and appreciate it so much. Thank you, Carlos. Great pleasure. Take care.
