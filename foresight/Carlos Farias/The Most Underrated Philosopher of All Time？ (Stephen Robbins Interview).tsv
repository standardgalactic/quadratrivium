0	2000	The holographic principle is basically,
2000	5240	and a hologram at any point is the information
5240	7920	for the whole object, the whole scene,
7920	10520	the whole cup, the whole ball, the whole plate.
10520	12920	Berkson was far more famous than Einstein
12920	14840	in the first two decades of the 20th century,
14840	17480	which is kind of mind-boggling just to think of now.
17480	20360	Berkson and Einstein had a history in 1922, I believe.
20360	23800	The story is the myth perhaps is that that debate
23800	26640	prevented Einstein from winning the Nobel Prize that year.
26640	27480	Is that true?
27480	28520	Yes, right.
28520	30800	There was only one problem, and that was that
30800	34120	there was a war going on, and I had been drafted
34120	35960	as soon as I got out of the seminary
35960	39720	because my draft status was no longer 4D, which was exempt.
39720	42240	So I ended up going into the Marine Corps,
42240	46160	and I was actually in a long-range reconnaissance group
46160	47760	plowing through the jungle triumph,
47760	52280	with six guys in the middle of nowhere in the jungle
52280	54520	being dropped up in helicopters, et cetera, et cetera.
54520	57560	One of Gibson's big ideas was affordance theory, right?
57560	59200	He was that we see...
59200	61200	Affordance is a big thing, yes.
61200	64920	We see what is the usefulness of the objects,
64920	66400	and we see that kind of space.
66400	69680	It reminds me quite a bit of Donald Hoffman's theories
69680	72160	around we see the world in terms of
72160	74200	one of the most fit for us as organisms
74200	76520	rather than what's actually there.
76520	78880	But I know you've done a video on Hoffman.
78880	79720	Right.
79720	82240	We're gonna blow Hoffman away here, but let me go back.
82240	84320	Just for one...
84320	86000	Could you tell us about that mystical experience,
86000	87600	what that was like?
87600	90400	Shall we say all of a sudden just kind of
90400	93920	laying on the deck, kind of like, wow, what's going on?
93920	97320	And what one felt was that suddenly
97320	100880	that there was this other being that you actually were.
100880	103120	And this being was infinite.
103120	108120	You and this being had been the same being forever.
109440	113800	I guess I'm reminded of a statement by Thomas Merton,
113840	116440	the great contemplative monk that a Catholic contemplative
116440	120680	monk in a statement was in true contemplative state,
120680	123320	or actually he meant a mystical state.
123320	128320	All concept of sin dissolves because this being
128960	133280	that you are is obviously a divine being and cannot sin.
133280	136680	And so when you brought up in the Catholic framework,
136680	140080	sin is very much a doctrine and a dogma,
140080	142000	and you're worried about mortal sins and venial sins
142000	143600	and confessing sins and so on and so forth.
143600	147240	The whole thing just dissolved because it's felt to be ridiculous.
147240	151920	It's felt to be no longer applicable.
151920	156120	And the whole world was just one gigantic sea of love, you know?
156120	159080	I mean, the ecstasy was so intense,
159080	161640	I almost had to have it turned off.
161640	164360	And there was another interesting concept
164360	166800	that must have come from deep in my being
166800	170400	because I got this, all is just.
170400	172720	There was another was justice, everything.
172760	174840	I must have been worried about injustice.
174840	178320	I still am, but at that time it was like,
178320	179800	well, everything is just.
179800	183080	So it was very intense ecstatic experience.
183080	187440	Rather, each instant penetrates,
187440	189600	permeates the next, like the notes of a melody,
189600	192840	each note penetrates, permeates the next.
192840	196120	Some melodic transformation, organic continuity.
196120	199040	How is these bits, how are they suddenly becoming
199040	202000	concrete coffee cups with liquid in them?
202000	203440	Stirring, rotating, right?
203440	207480	Come on, when you look at the conception, it's ludicrous.
207480	211040	It is not Berkson's conception of holographic feel.
211040	214680	It's a 2D bit hologram.
214680	216920	Sorry, but not the same thing.
216920	219080	Not even worth looking.
219080	221080	See, you got me mad.
221080	222520	No, that's okay.
222520	224280	I mean, you're passionate about it, I get it.
224280	228280	How is this theory, Berkson in general,
228280	230160	how does this influence your day-to-day life
230200	232280	for your moment's moment existence, if it does at all?
232280	237280	I, for one, think that science, physics, psychology,
238800	242840	cognitive science, given Berkson's framework,
242840	247840	absolutely backs the spiritual vision of man,
248720	251720	the Zen vision, if nothing more,
251720	254800	but probably also the Hindu vision
254800	258040	of what our actual capabilities are.
258080	260360	I think that there's no conflict between science
260360	265040	and this whole notion that's permeating people's minds
265040	270040	right now that neuroscience says we're just human robot forms
272280	274840	with no spiritual component whatsoever
274840	277480	is utterly destroyed by Berkson
277480	282320	and gives us a very solid grounding in science
283440	287360	and our own mystical experience that supports it.
287400	291800	So I guess bottom line from that perspective,
291800	293920	Berkson is a great comfort.
294720	299720	And if people wanna shed the transhumanist vision
299880	303600	of the idea where we're gonna all get a nice bunch of chips
303600	305600	because it's just all we really are anyhow
305600	307720	and just become enhanced robots.
307720	311800	And also there is no God, there's no karmic laws
311800	314120	and et cetera, et cetera that they'll get into Berkson
314200	319200	and you'll see quickly how just shallow and superficial
320240	322040	and understanding they actually are.
322040	324640	I don't include people like Sam Harris or Daniel Dennett,
324640	326440	et cetera, these people are in my mind
326440	328480	are extremely badly misled
328480	331880	because they extremely do not understand
331880	334880	the problem of consciousness and time.
334880	339000	So that's one thing, after that, it's been a giant pain
339000	344000	because I never thought that after 50,
346760	350920	what are we, 50 years that this particular conception
350920	353080	would be so buried yet.
353080	355200	It's buried in cognitive science
355200	357520	that no one wants to look at.
357520	359800	It's buried in memory theory,
359800	361080	it's buried in perception theory.
361080	363680	It's buried by the Getzonians for great sake.
363680	365040	They won't even look at it.
365040	367720	It's buried by the Berksonians for that matter.
367720	371240	Even Berksonian philosophers can't deal with it.
371240	373200	I can just feel it, they don't want to deal with it.
373200	376280	Oh, it's too much, can't deal with that.
376280	379960	So it's become a frustrating pain
379960	383280	and I feel like my life's mission has been a bust.
383280	386240	So I feel right now, let me tell you the truth,
386240	387800	it's been a good, it was a good try.
387800	389480	Maybe someone later will come along
389480	393000	and take it up because right now, to me,
393000	395280	it's completely being ignored.
395280	398440	Steve Robbins has a PhD in educational psych and psychology
398440	399760	from the University of Minnesota
399760	401600	with a focus on cognitive science.
401600	403520	His thesis covered turn of the 20th century
403520	405480	French philosopher Henri Berkson
405480	407080	and his alternative model of mind.
407080	407920	In the decades since,
407920	409880	he's published academic journal articles
409880	412320	and three books on Berkson slash consciousness.
412320	413320	Before his doctoral work,
413320	415800	he served as a Marine Infantry Officer in Vietnam.
415800	417600	After 33 years in the software industry,
417600	420080	he's now retired on a mini farm in Wisconsin
420080	422280	and runs a YouTube channel with over 80 videos
422280	424880	dedicated to Berkson and his holographic theory.
424880	426160	Steve, thanks for coming on.
426160	427440	Oh, thank you.
427440	428720	It's a pleasure.
428720	433480	Yeah, it's so great to see you and get to chat with you.
433480	436120	I've discovered your channel many weeks ago
436120	441000	and have been digesting each video, they're dense,
441000	442800	but I highly recommend people check them out.
442800	445640	After this conversation, I'll link all of your,
445640	447080	link to your YouTube channel and your website
447080	448240	in the description of my video.
448240	449440	Right, right.
449440	451640	It's a tiny point, either in space,
451640	453600	somewhere in the channel.
455480	456320	Yes, yes.
456320	459640	Which takes a voyage to discover it currently.
459640	460800	Yeah, absolutely.
460800	463440	A lot of competition, you have to,
463440	465160	it's a tough market.
465160	468720	I know, I'm a similar size channel, so I get it.
469800	472080	So Steve, it'd be great if we could kick us off.
472080	474960	I know you have some prepared slides.
474960	477000	If you want, you can pull those up.
477000	479120	I'd love to, I know you have some at the beginning
479120	481120	that goes through your background a little bit
481120	483240	in even more detail, because I love to learn.
483240	486160	I know our audience will have some context on you
486160	490760	to get your story and to figure out what's intrigued you
490760	492440	so much about Berkson.
492440	495320	I consider you one of the world's experts on Berkson.
495320	498000	So if you wouldn't mind, yeah, pulling that up,
498000	501680	we can get into individuals of your story are great too.
501680	505240	I think seeing the trajectory of your career.
505240	507840	We're gonna have to go visual as you noted,
507840	510120	because there's a lot here to comprehend
510120	514400	that two talking heads make it very slow to get across.
514400	517760	So some pictures work well.
517760	520320	Yes, for the viewers, if you like visuals,
520320	525320	Steve provides a lot of visuals on his YouTube channel
525440	527800	and extensive quotes that help elucidate
527800	529720	the concepts you're trying to get across.
529720	532040	We were thinking about beginning where,
532040	536000	how it began with, well, where I come from, I guess is the...
536000	537160	Yeah, let's get your background.
537280	539400	Where'd you grow up?
541400	543400	So I'm basically a Minnesota native.
544320	545760	I'm sitting in Wisconsin right now,
545760	547560	a little bit north of Milwaukee.
548720	553520	I spent a good chunk of my life, like seven years
553520	556400	as a Franciscan seminarian,
556400	558680	down in Chicago and ultimately in Illinois.
558680	561800	In fact, there was a good picture of,
561800	563760	there's my seminary in Illinois and West by Illinois.
563760	566280	And that's not me, but that's some Franciscan.
567120	570560	Just to give a context of what I'm talking about.
570560	575560	Because I spent the last year in 1966 in the vichit
575560	577360	where you're actually dressed up in a habit
577360	579600	and walking around with your cord and your rosary
579600	581200	and et cetera, et cetera.
581200	583760	But I decided to...
583760	586680	Can you tell us what you're up against?
586680	589360	Do you mind giving us some context as to why you
589360	592680	were temporarily, you joined the Franciscan order?
593520	595160	Yeah, I would say this.
595160	600160	My folks were very Catholic, very dedicated, very devout.
600280	605280	And I had some sort of, shall I say, affinity toward this.
607080	609520	I remember reading The Life of St. Francis,
609520	612520	Perfect Joy St. Francis when I was seven years old.
612520	616320	And that already started me off right there.
616320	618160	I was going to be a Franciscan.
618160	619720	Wow, at seven.
619720	624080	Yeah, that division experience was quite the deal.
624080	626240	I was, you know, you got up at midnight
626240	629320	and chanted office, the divine office for an hour
629320	631200	and then meditated and then went back to bed
631200	635680	and got back up at six and did more chanting
635680	639400	of the divine office, you know, tourism logs
639400	642920	or whatever in Latin and then go through the whole day.
642920	645760	There was no talking, et cetera.
645760	649400	But I left in the spring of 1966
649400	653200	because I decided ultimately after seven years
653200	655720	and lots of Latin and Greek and German
657720	660840	the interesting education that was available at the time
660840	665840	in that environment that it wasn't quite the fit for me.
666520	671520	And so I ended up going to the University of Minnesota.
672960	674640	I had to finish off my undergrad.
675640	679600	I crammed two years into one year at Minnesota
679600	682440	and I was in psychology and political science.
682440	685240	I was actually political science was my thing.
685240	688280	But I liked psychology in the mind.
688280	693280	And, but that, that little place there was the absolute
693280	697920	haunt of skin air and behaviorism and his rats.
697920	702920	And the very last course I had in the spring of 66
704800	707240	was by a professor from Michigan
708120	711320	who was teaching Piaget and cognitive development
711320	713800	and the whole theory that actually there's something
713800	717160	in the brain that skinner denied.
717160	719440	For skinner you weren't even supposed to,
719440	720680	the brain was off limits.
720680	724840	You didn't look in the brain, but here you have Piaget
724840	726440	talking about cognitive development.
726440	731440	And that somehow turned me back on to psychology
731440	736440	and there was only one problem and that was this,
737880	740840	that there was a war going on.
740840	745840	And I had been drafted as soon as I got out of the seminary
745840	749280	because my draft status was no longer 4D,
749280	750800	which was exempt.
750800	754240	And so I ended up going into the Marine Corps
754240	757240	for reasons I won't go into.
757520	762440	And I was actually in a long range reconnaissance group
762440	764520	plowing through the jungle, trying,
764520	769080	with six guys in the middle of nowhere in the jungle
769080	771320	being dropped up in helicopters, et cetera, et cetera.
771320	775720	So I spent 68, 69 doing that.
775720	776800	And-
776800	777640	Wow.
777640	778480	Steve, thank you for your service.
778480	781040	These are always interesting experiences.
781040	786040	And I came back to the States and I guess that's a piece
786880	790120	I didn't, it's hard to picture here, but I was very,
790120	793040	I call it, involuted because I was,
793040	795000	when you go through an experience like that,
795000	799000	you're wanting to find what's the meaning of life
799000	802240	and what the heck is this all about?
802240	805880	And so you sort of go into an intense inward state
805880	809680	and in that state, toward the end,
809680	814200	I was in North Carolina on the sea coast,
814200	815640	in the inland waterway.
815640	819440	I was living with three other ex-officers
819440	821240	and they were still officers in the Marines,
821240	826240	but on top of a yacht basin, yacht club,
827440	832440	but I had what one would call a mystical experience
832880	836800	and which again had an impact on me
836800	840680	because I'm used from the seminary from a course
840680	843240	I took an epistemology, which I didn't have a clue
843240	846480	what was going on, but there's something problematic
846480	848760	with the relationship of subject to an object.
848760	851000	And we'll come back to that in this discussion,
851000	855240	but that mystical experience sort of enhanced
855240	859400	that whole perception that, oh, this is quite interesting.
859400	862880	And you see Piaget, back to him,
862880	866200	he was sort of describing how the child starts out
866200	867800	and actually kind of a mystical state
867800	869240	where he's one with the world
869240	872400	and only gradually does he learn
872400	875560	that he's a self among other selves,
875560	877720	an object among other objects,
877720	880240	a force among other forces
880240	882840	and that he has an identity himself
882840	886080	with respect to this other matrix of beings,
886080	887880	forces and objects.
887880	891040	And so in essence, it's the description
891040	894640	of how one goes from a, should we say,
894640	898120	infatmistic to, excuse me,
898120	902480	needing to zen koan to break through
902480	903920	back to this original state
903920	906160	or where you are one with the universe, shall we say.
906160	908960	So that all struck me.
908960	913960	In fact, that kind of became my thought in that,
913960	916600	well, this is what I really should maybe look at
916600	919000	if I go back to the University of Minnesota,
919000	924000	which my next arrow says back to Minnesota in 1971.
925280	928080	Steve, do you mind, Steve?
928080	929560	Sorry, I hate to interrupt you
929560	931360	because you're in a great flow here,
931360	932840	but if you care to share,
932840	935080	and I know it might be a very personal experience,
935080	938280	so please, if you don't want it, if you don't care to you,
938280	940720	but could you tell us about that mystical experience,
940720	941640	what that was like?
946600	948320	It's a little hard to describe,
948320	953040	but it was, I kind of found myself,
954040	955600	shall we say, all of a sudden,
955600	959920	just kind of laying on the deck,
959920	962600	kind of like, wow, what's going on?
962600	967600	And this, what one felt was that suddenly
968680	972240	that there was this other being that you actually were.
972240	974640	And this being was infinite.
974640	979640	You and this being had been the same being forever.
980560	985560	And I guess I'm reminded of a statement by Thomas Merton,
988800	990280	the great contemplative monk,
990280	992160	the Catholic contemplative monk,
994040	999040	in his statement was in a true contemplative state,
999240	1001920	or actually he meant a mystical state.
1001920	1006200	All concept of sin dissolves
1006200	1010840	because this being that you are is obviously a divine being
1010840	1012720	and cannot sin.
1012720	1017280	And so when you're brought up in the Catholic framework,
1019080	1022480	sin is very much a doctrine and a dogma,
1022480	1024440	and you're worried about mortal sins and venial sins
1024440	1025760	and confessing sins, et cetera, et cetera.
1025760	1027040	And this whole thing just dissolved
1027040	1030400	because it's felt to be ridiculous.
1030400	1032320	It's felt to be, no longer can be,
1032320	1034960	it's no longer applicable.
1035000	1040000	And the whole world was just one gigantic sea of love.
1041320	1044280	I mean, the ecstasy was so intense,
1044280	1046800	I almost had to have it turned off.
1046800	1050400	And there was another interesting concept
1050400	1052840	that must have come from deep in my being
1052840	1056560	because I got this all as just.
1056560	1058880	There was another was justice, everything.
1058880	1060920	I must have been worried about injustice.
1060920	1064480	In fact, I still am, but at that time it was like,
1064480	1065760	well, everything is just.
1065760	1070360	And so it was very intense ecstatic experience.
1070360	1073760	And with the awareness that there really wasn't no death,
1073760	1078200	you had been this being, this whole notion of sin fell away
1078200	1081680	because, well, there's lots of implications in that.
1081680	1086680	So, yeah, that's pretty much the content thereof.
1088000	1090480	Okay, and it wasn't long thereafter.
1090480	1092440	I mean, that, well, it's kind of funny
1092440	1096360	because I lived with another one of the tenants
1096360	1099280	that lived with us, his nickname was Duke.
1099280	1103240	He had been over in Vietnam for, well, 18 months.
1104240	1107120	The normal 12 month tour and then his troops,
1107120	1110120	his platoon turned them on to marijuana
1110120	1111440	because they thought he was a cool guy.
1111440	1115800	And he re-extended for six months just to do the marijuana.
1115800	1116640	Wow.
1116640	1118960	And then he'd be walking around.
1119560	1124440	He was in LSD and he could be on an LSD trip.
1124440	1126520	You never knew it, you know?
1126520	1128040	Wow, interesting guy.
1130320	1132600	And because I had gotten out of the ring
1132600	1136960	or about a week after that mystical experience,
1138400	1141760	he took me on an LSD trip, which was quite interesting,
1142920	1147920	which also helped in the ultimate breakthrough
1148200	1150520	one needs to understand Berkson.
1150520	1153240	Because Berkson, as we're going to point out,
1153240	1155760	is very zen, very mystical.
1155760	1158280	And people that are not zen and not mystical
1158280	1159560	and don't have this intuition,
1159560	1163000	I think have a very hard time understanding Berkson.
1164800	1168280	So, yeah, so like I said,
1168280	1170880	the arrow, I ended up back at the University of Minnesota
1170880	1175880	end of fall of 1970, starting 71.
1176360	1179640	I'm back in graduate school in educational psychology.
1179640	1182160	It was really called the Cognitive Foundations of Education.
1182160	1185640	It's really a cognitive psychology thing.
1185640	1189320	Philosophy was, and ultimately,
1189320	1191200	computer science is going to come along.
1191200	1192040	Right, yeah.
1192040	1195160	Because that was the, 72 was the big year
1195160	1197160	that computer science swept into academics
1197160	1198520	into cognitive psychology.
1199440	1203080	And the interesting thing you and I talked about before
1203080	1205280	was how I hit Berkson.
1205280	1209360	And the reason was I found a course right away
1209360	1214240	with a Dr. Bart, who was into Berkson, was into Piaget.
1214240	1216880	And it was a discussion about,
1216880	1221160	or devoted to Piaget's group theory,
1221160	1223560	the use of mathematical groups,
1223560	1226560	which I think he got from Ernst Kassier,
1228200	1231800	and initially, the great French phenomenon,
1231800	1234360	or German phenomenologist philosopher.
1235280	1239160	And my thing was, I was going to write something
1239160	1242440	about the epistemology of gene Piaget.
1242440	1245480	This came from my one course in the seminary
1245480	1249120	on epistemology and my association
1249120	1250680	with discovery of Piaget at the end.
1250680	1253200	And I had no idea what I was going to do,
1253200	1254640	but I thought it was cool.
1254640	1256840	And Dr. Bart says, well, why don't you write
1256840	1259720	a comparison of Berkson to Piaget?
1260720	1263080	And I thought, oh, okay.
1263080	1264280	I'm thinking, who's Berkson?
1264280	1268520	I have no clue who Berkson, but I can do that.
1268520	1269560	Sure, I can do that.
1269560	1270560	Oh my God, do that.
1272840	1275720	So I discovered, you know, you go to the library
1275720	1277960	and you find books on Berkson,
1277960	1279320	because you're never going to,
1279320	1282040	or you wouldn't want to read Berkson right off the bat.
1282040	1286520	But you find it's going to distill it for you, hope.
1286520	1289520	And by will and car, I found a book on Berkson.
1289520	1294360	And this is what I ran across right off the bat
1294360	1296360	in about three or four pages in the car.
1296360	1298480	This statement by Berkson,
1298480	1300600	questions related to subject to an object,
1300600	1302120	do the distinction in the union,
1302120	1305400	what's it put in terms of time rather than a space?
1306440	1309920	And I thought, whoa, that's cool, subject to an object.
1309920	1311280	I have no clue what that thing meant.
1311280	1312640	I mean, what is that?
1312640	1314240	That's why I have the Zen picture there.
1314240	1315320	It's a column.
1315320	1316360	Yeah.
1316360	1319160	It's like, what is the sound of one hand flapping?
1319440	1321280	Who is it that sees?
1321280	1322120	Okay.
1322120	1324800	It's a coin that you have to contemplate.
1324800	1326120	Well, I didn't know what that meant,
1326120	1328280	but that was enough to tell me
1328280	1330200	that something cool is going on.
1332320	1333560	Do you mind, Steve,
1333560	1336800	if we quickly just give folks a context
1336800	1340080	as to when Berkson lived, what is-
1340080	1341080	Oh, yeah.
1341080	1344200	I mean, I know, but you're the expert, so.
1344320	1349320	Well, of course, I forgot when he was born right after that.
1350560	1351400	Yeah.
1351400	1354000	I mean, yeah, mid-1800s, late-1800s.
1354000	1354840	Yeah.
1354840	1358840	Well, he's writing his thesis in 1889, okay?
1360560	1365360	His thesis was time and free will.
1365360	1368160	That was the title of it, 1889.
1368160	1370000	So he's probably about 20,
1370000	1371920	we can probably go back to about 1879
1372000	1374320	or something like that when he was roughly born.
1375680	1378120	So all seems so much for my Berkson expertise
1378120	1379960	right off the bat, down the drain.
1381000	1386000	But he was obviously French.
1386680	1389040	He was quite brilliant.
1389040	1393200	I mean, he was extremely diplomatic.
1393200	1398200	His classmates said he could destroy your theory
1398200	1400200	in a matter of a few sentences,
1400200	1405200	but he did it very diplomatic and nicely.
1406120	1411120	He won at 18 a very prestigious French prize in mathematics.
1414200	1419200	And he greatly then disappointed his mathematics professor
1420200	1423200	because he decided he was gonna go into philosophy.
1424200	1429200	And that professor said, well, you could have been a politician.
1430200	1432200	I just can be a philosopher.
1432200	1436200	And I'm pointing this out because there's a great mythology
1436200	1437200	about Berkson ultimate
1437200	1439200	because he ultimately gets in a big argument
1439200	1441200	with Einstein over relativity.
1441200	1443200	And I think he beat the heck out of Einstein
1443200	1447200	in terms of proper interpretation of relativity.
1447200	1450200	That's another story we may not even get into.
1450200	1454200	But the myth is that he did really understand mathematics.
1454200	1456200	And even Einstein ultimately admitted,
1456200	1459200	well, yes, Berkson totally understands the theory of relativity,
1459200	1463200	but believe me, when you look at Berkson's book on relativity,
1463200	1466200	he just dismantles, disdisex,
1466200	1469200	and reconstructs the whole theory mathematically.
1469200	1472200	And obviously, effortlessly.
1472200	1475200	Their famous debate, Berkson and Einstein
1475200	1478200	had a famous debate in 1922, I believe.
1478200	1482200	And as a true, I mean, the story is the myth, perhaps,
1482200	1484200	is that that debate prevented Einstein
1484200	1486200	from winning the Nobel Prize that year.
1486200	1487200	Is that true?
1487200	1489200	Yes, right.
1489200	1490200	And there's a whole book on it,
1490200	1492200	and I'm gonna join a canalist
1492200	1494200	called The Philosopher and the Physicist,
1494200	1496200	which is the great title,
1496200	1498200	going through the debate.
1498200	1502200	Unfortunately, she completely misses the actual essence
1502200	1505200	of the debate, which is a problem.
1505200	1509200	And Berkson, one of my pieces of research,
1509200	1511200	this person claimed that Berkson
1511200	1513200	was far more famous than Einstein
1513200	1515200	in the first two decades of the 20th century,
1515200	1518200	which is kind of mind-boggling to think of now.
1518200	1520200	Right, because what happened is,
1520200	1523200	he published his time in free will,
1523200	1527200	which was taking the problem of free will
1527200	1529200	in the context of the nature of time,
1529200	1532200	which still is ignored today completely.
1532200	1535200	You can read Dennett, and A, you don't see Berkson mentioned,
1535200	1537200	B, you don't see time mentioned,
1537200	1539200	you know, Dennett on free will, then Dennett.
1539200	1542200	And in fact, almost all of the current discussions
1542200	1545200	on free will, he follows it up.
1545200	1553200	He spends five years studying memory difficulties,
1553200	1557200	aphasias, amnesias, and lesions to the brain,
1557200	1559200	and comes out with this book,
1559200	1562200	I got a picture of their matter in memory of 1896,
1562200	1564200	because his whole problem was,
1564200	1568200	does the brain actually store experience?
1568200	1572200	Does it store that coffee cup out there in front of my guy there
1572200	1575200	with the stirring spoon, that experience of the coffee stir?
1575200	1577200	Is that stored in the brain?
1577200	1582200	And his point was, the whole theory of consciousness
1582200	1584200	rests on this question,
1584200	1586200	is experience stored in the brain?
1586200	1592200	And again, you won't find that question ever mentioned anywhere,
1592200	1595200	not by charmers, not by straws,
1595200	1601200	and not by any of the people that are the supposed great theorists
1601200	1603200	of consciousness nowadays,
1603200	1605200	just simply not understood.
1605200	1611200	The bottom line, his analysis of the subject of all the phenomena
1611200	1613200	of memory research at the time,
1613200	1615200	was that it couldn't be stored in the brain,
1615200	1620200	that you did not have to have that hypothesis,
1620200	1623200	which is now a dogma, that memory is stored in the brain.
1623200	1627200	In fact, all that could be happening is that the brain,
1627200	1631200	when it's damaged, simply doesn't,
1631200	1635200	let's say, form the proper neural patterns
1635200	1639200	or modulating wave patterns, I'll call it,
1639200	1643200	that allow the memory to be re-instantiated,
1643200	1650200	the original experience, but not from within the brain itself.
1650200	1653200	So that's another whole question we ultimately,
1653200	1655200	probably actually quite won't get into,
1655200	1657200	but we'll see part of it.
1657200	1660200	And then, in 1907,
1660200	1663200	he followed up with a book called Creative Evolution,
1663200	1668200	which was a tour de force on the problem of evolution,
1668200	1670200	the problem of Darwinian evolution.
1670200	1673200	He was not a fan of Darwinian evolution.
1673200	1678200	And really, the whole nature of the evolution of the universe.
1678200	1681200	I mean, Tegard Deschardin,
1681200	1683200	who actually, I was reading at the time,
1683200	1685200	my mystical experience, I should say,
1685200	1691200	was the great Catholic Jesuit,
1691200	1694200	kind of a mystic theorist,
1694200	1699200	was inspired by Berks' work, Creative Evolution.
1699200	1705200	And he was launched it by that point into quite a bit of fame,
1705200	1711200	and famed them, to the point where the ladies of Paris
1711200	1715200	wanted to attend his lectures,
1715200	1718200	and there was discussions of whether you'd hold the lectures
1718200	1720200	in the Paris Opera Hall,
1720200	1723200	because the attendance was so great.
1723200	1726200	Yeah, he was a local celebrity in Paris, right?
1726200	1732200	This, of course, also generated its own self-resistance,
1732200	1738200	because now you had other academics that were like Bruch and Russell
1738200	1741200	that were extremely upset.
1741200	1744200	Should we say, we won't use the word jealous,
1744200	1747200	but they didn't like this, too much popularity.
1747200	1749200	And Bruchton took a lot of shots.
1750200	1755200	The bottom line to not make us too long is that his popularity,
1755200	1761200	well, again, he really emerged back in 1922, like you noted,
1761200	1767200	because he had, being a great theorist of time that he was,
1767200	1771200	his ears pricked up when he discovered that Paul Langevan
1771200	1774200	had announced what's called a twin paradox,
1774200	1777200	do you remember where the twin leaves the earth and the rocket
1777200	1780200	comes back and he's ageless in his brother?
1780200	1784200	And Bruchton thought that was a complete misuse of relativity.
1784200	1787200	It destroyed the logical consistency of relativity.
1787200	1791200	Hence, he began his arguments and got, ultimately,
1791200	1796200	Scott Einstein wrote the book Duration and Simultaneity.
1796200	1802200	And that sort of began this period.
1802200	1804200	He was actually working with Einstein,
1804200	1809200	the League of Nations at the time, too.
1809200	1813200	So he was somewhat prominent in politics at the time,
1813200	1819200	but that was beginning of his gradual descent into obscurity
1819200	1823200	and wading into wings, as I like to know,
1823200	1826200	was behaviorism, skin area and behaviorism,
1826200	1828200	the analytical philosophy,
1828200	1832200	which is very antithetical to Bruchton's continental philosophy.
1832200	1837200	And he ended up dying of pneumonia after standing in the line
1837200	1840200	for a long time in Paris, 1941,
1840200	1843200	occupied by the Germans, by the Nazis.
1843200	1845200	He had caught pneumonia.
1845200	1852200	He was going to declare himself a Jew publicly as the Nazis were demanding.
1852200	1858200	So he died of pneumonia and that was the end of Mr. Bruchton.
1859200	1864200	And as I said, he sort of then went into obscurity.
1864200	1868200	And so that's him.
1868200	1873200	So meanwhile, someone like me comes along and discovers this quote.
1873200	1874200	We were sitting right here.
1874200	1876200	Yeah, this quote, back to the quote.
1876200	1877200	Yeah, thank you for the context.
1877200	1878200	It's helpful.
1878200	1879200	Okay.
1879200	1883200	So that began my reading of that book Matter of Memory.
1883200	1887200	I mean, I must have read it a dozen times.
1888200	1893200	In backwards, forwards, from the middle, outwards, every direction,
1893200	1896200	because when you hit Matter of Memory,
1896200	1898200	you really don't know what's going on.
1898200	1902200	And the book was considered, especially its first chapter,
1902200	1906200	obscure even by his adherents,
1906200	1912200	by Bruchton's adherents, and we'll see why.
1912200	1916200	So I'm in Minnesota.
1916200	1920200	And what's about to happen in Minnesota is the computer model of
1920200	1924200	mine is going to sweep in in 1972.
1924200	1927200	The whole whole notion of the brain is a computer.
1927200	1933200	This, my advisor in the education psychology side was very enamored
1933200	1937200	of a book by Newell and Simon called General Problem Solving,
1937200	1941200	Human Problem Solving, which went through their book with their model
1941200	1944200	of a computer model, the general problem solver,
1944200	1948200	which tried to simulate solving problems the way humans do,
1948200	1952200	like cryptorhythmic problems, like Donald plus Gerald equal Robert,
1952200	1955200	you know, which we have to sign numbers to each letter,
1955200	1960200	like Donald and Gerald, Robert, or chess.
1960200	1964200	There's another one of the things in their books.
1964200	1967200	And so that swept in.
1967200	1973200	And the other side of the story I was in related to was
1973200	1978200	on a pure psychology side was
1978200	1983200	what eventually became my thesis advisor, Dr. Bob Shaw.
1983200	1987200	And let me, I think that's where we're having subject to an object here.
1987200	1991200	I forgot to put that.
1991200	1995200	Oh, I have to remember my source of my thing.
1995200	2002200	So let's, let's, before I go to Shaw, let's go to this point in Berkson.
2002200	2004200	Here's another of the colons.
2004200	2006200	This is in chapter one of that book.
2006200	2008200	So, but isn't that up?
2008200	2012200	Berkson is talking about how do we see the coffee cup out there?
2012200	2020200	And in space extended out there on the table.
2020200	2022200	How do we see that coffee cup?
2022200	2025200	Is there a photograph of the coffee cup in the brain?
2025200	2030200	And he says, well, obviously, is it obvious the photograph?
2030200	2034200	He said, I got to keep my things in order here.
2034200	2040200	But neuroscience at the time was developed enough to know that there was no coffee image in the brain.
2040200	2043200	You couldn't, you weren't going to find an image of the coffee cup in the brain,
2043200	2048200	which is why I have the little red circle there with the line through it.
2048200	2052200	So he says, excuse me, but isn't that obvious?
2052200	2058200	The photograph, if the photograph there be is already taken already developed in the very heart of things.
2058200	2060200	And at all points in space.
2060200	2063200	No metaphysics, no physics can escape this conclusion.
2063200	2065200	Build up the universe with atoms.
2065200	2069200	Each is subject to the action, variable and quantity and quality according to the distance.
2069200	2071200	Exerted and done by all material atoms.
2071200	2073200	Exerted on it by all material atoms.
2073200	2075200	Bring in Faraday, centers of force.
2075200	2078200	The lines of force submitted in every direction from every center.
2078200	2082200	Bring to bear upon each the influence of the whole material world.
2082200	2084200	Call up the Laditsian monads.
2084200	2086200	Each is the mirror of the universe.
2087200	2092200	So that is key to his answer to how we see the coffee cup.
2092200	2094200	But you can see it's yet another koan.
2094200	2099200	It's koan number two along with subject to an object in terms of time.
2099200	2102200	So I have no idea what that meant when I read it.
2105200	2111200	He went on, he was actually before this, he was talking about the nature of the universe.
2111200	2114200	Take any object, for example, like the coffee cup there.
2114200	2118200	Any object is obliged to transmit the whole of what it receives,
2118200	2122200	to oppose every action with an equal and contrary reaction.
2122200	2126200	To be in short, really the road by which pass in every direction and modifications
2126200	2129200	or what can be termed real actions.
2129200	2132200	It's visualized waves,
2132200	2135200	propagated throughout the immensity of the entire universe.
2135200	2137200	Okay.
2137200	2142200	So he says, so only if we consider any other place in the universe,
2142200	2147200	we can regard the action of all matter is passing through it without resistance and without loss.
2147200	2151200	And the photograph of the whole is translucent.
2151200	2157200	Here is wanting behind the plate the black screen on which the image could be shown.
2157200	2161200	Our zones of indetermination, there is talk about organisms,
2161200	2164200	centers of free action that can act upon the world,
2164200	2166200	play in some sort the part of that screen.
2166200	2169200	They add nothing to what is there, the effect merely this.
2169200	2174200	The real action, those waves passing through the coffee cup that
2174200	2180200	the coffee cup is reflecting and sending back to all the other points in the universe.
2180200	2184200	They affect merely this, the real action passes through those waves,
2184200	2187200	and the virtual action remains.
2187200	2189200	Okay.
2189200	2195200	So if anyone here listening knows what this means already, let me know.
2195200	2201200	Unless you've picked up what I've said, but you can see that this is pretty much co-on like,
2201200	2203200	very difficult to understand what's going on.
2203200	2208200	And he's talking about the problem of receiving the coffee cup,
2208200	2210200	seeing that coffee cup out there on the kitchen table,
2210200	2213200	which is really the hard problem.
2213200	2215200	And we'll go back to that.
2215200	2217200	That's the hard problem.
2217200	2222200	Always see the coffee cup out there with this qualia.
2222200	2224200	Okay.
2224200	2227200	Well, this is where I was going.
2227200	2232200	My other advisor, who eventually my thesis advisor was Bob Shaw, the bottom there,
2232200	2235200	Robert E. Shaw.
2235200	2241200	Now, he was a student of Gibson at Cornell for a couple of years.
2241200	2245200	Gibson topped the picture, J.J. Gibson.
2245200	2249200	There we have his dates, 1940, 1974, 1979.
2249200	2255200	To me, he was the greatest theorist of perception that walked the planet.
2255200	2260200	Maybe next to Bergson, but actually pure theorist of perception on philosopher.
2260200	2262200	But he was very philosophical too.
2262200	2270200	He founded the subject of, what we call the subject of ecological psychology,
2270200	2275200	which is, there's now a journal today, the Journal of Ecological Psychology.
2275200	2280200	It's a whole field or subfield in the study of perception.
2280200	2289200	And Shaw, my advisor there, was the founder of that journal, the Journal of Ecological Psychology.
2289200	2291200	He obviously knew Gibson.
2291200	2293200	He studied with Gibson at Cornell for a couple of years.
2293200	2299200	Why he was studying abstract automata theory at Cornell.
2299200	2307200	Abstract automata theory is, shall we say, another level of abstraction above computer science.
2307200	2312200	It's the abstract logical description of finite state machines.
2312200	2318200	And Bob was a brilliant guy, as we'll see.
2318200	2320200	I think it'll become through really evident.
2320200	2327200	Gibson, if I may, had just such quick, one of Gibson's big ideas was Affordance theory, right?
2327200	2330200	Affordance is a big thing, yes.
2330200	2334200	We see what is the usefulness of the objects.
2334200	2336200	We see that kind of space.
2336200	2340200	It reminds me quite a bit of, seems analogous to, although I'm sure there's differences,
2340200	2347200	between Donald Hoffman's theories around sort of our fitness.
2347200	2354200	We see the world in terms of one of the most fit for us as organisms, rather than what's actually there.
2354200	2357200	But I know you've done a video on Hoffman.
2357200	2365200	We're going to blow Hoffman away here, but let me go back just for one thick thing here.
2365200	2366200	Sure, sure.
2366200	2368200	But we won't do it here.
2368200	2370200	No, I just thought it looked quick to answer.
2370200	2375200	Just say, let's go back to, look at the very bottom line, okay?
2375200	2378200	Virtual action.
2378200	2382200	That's affordances, as we'll see.
2382200	2385200	Just a little preview.
2385200	2390200	Yeah, I was going to ask you, I know virtual action, there's a few terms that you use that,
2390200	2396200	when we get to them, I am going to stop and say, let's really define this and get this down.
2396200	2399200	So virtual action is essentially affordances.
2399200	2400200	Okay.
2400200	2404200	Well, yes, but it's worse than that, so we're going to see.
2404200	2408200	We have to take it in a holographic context, so back to where I was.
2408200	2412200	Okay, so, let's see what my next slide is.
2412200	2414200	Okay, so we're going to get there.
2414200	2424200	So, in 1972, like I said, this computer model swept in.
2424200	2433200	I attended a seminar with Shaw, and he went through Feigenbaum's book on computers and thought.
2433200	2448200	And Shaw simply destroyed the whole notion that the computer model of mine had anything to do with reality back then, already in 1972.
2448200	2456200	Around that time, also, Prebum, Carl Prebum, I don't have a picture of here,
2456200	2463200	published his book called Languages in the Brain, where he argued that the brain was a hologram.
2463200	2468200	And that accounted for how the brain stored memory.
2468200	2484200	I was trying to buttress the findings of Carl Lashley, where Lashley had tried to destroy memories in the brain and couldn't do it, and decided that, which basically,
2484200	2492200	what Lashley was doing, he was also destroying anything that would be considered neural nets today, but that's another question.
2492200	2500200	And Lashley decided that memories won't be somehow very distributed, and holography, as we'll see, is the essence of distribution.
2500200	2510200	And Carl was trying to argue that, and he had a very minor theory of perception at the time, in Languages in the Brain, how we see that coffee cup out there,
2510200	2517200	that maybe the whole holography had something to do with that, but it was a real coherent theory.
2517200	2532200	But Shaw had invited Prebum to come to a conference, and talk at a conference at the University of Minnesota, and pretty obviously the two had discussions.
2532200	2546200	And that, shall we say the next day that Prebum was there, Shaw was giving his seminar, and he started talking about holography.
2546200	2554200	And so we're going to quickly talk about holography, the construction of a hologram.
2554200	2565200	And so in the construction of a hologram, we've got the hologram plate there, and we've got a form of laser light to the left.
2565200	2568200	That would be a laser, a coherent frequency laser.
2568200	2582200	And so the waves from that laser are hitting the hologram plate, and then, I don't have a picture there, but normally some of those waves are bounced off of half-mirror to the object or the scene,
2582200	2584200	the pyramid or the ball there.
2584200	2592200	So you would have some waves bouncing off the ball in the pyramid and bouncing back toward the plate.
2592200	2596200	So that's called the object wave, as I've got labeled there.
2596200	2605200	So the hologram is the interference pattern of these two waves, the reference wave and the object wave.
2605200	2619200	And I was going to put a nice picture of an interference pattern there, and I forgot, but it looks, it's just a jumble of lines that look nothing like the pyramid and the ball.
2619200	2621200	But that's our hologram.
2621200	2629200	It's a jumble of lines, the interference, the recording of the interference pattern of those two waves.
2629200	2635200	And now, the reconstruction process is interesting.
2635200	2650200	If I beam a wave of light, a coherent wave of the same frequency as the original wave, of the original reference wave, that's now called the reconstructive wave, the reconstructing waves that are just labeled at frequency one.
2650200	2654200	We're beaming that back through the hologram plate.
2654200	2667200	And what is specified is the source of this original object wave front, namely the pyramid and the ball.
2667200	2676200	So notice, that's called the virtual image, virtual action, but now virtual image.
2677200	2681200	That's the virtual image, and you can move your head around.
2681200	2683200	Notice the viewer up there.
2683200	2697200	He can sort of, he's seeing the behind the plate as it were out in space, the image of the pyramid and ball, and he can move his head around and sort of see the side of the pyramid and the side of the balls.
2697200	2701200	It's a 3D image, so to speak.
2701200	2707200	So that's the reconstruction process.
2707200	2709200	Let me see what my next slide is.
2709200	2715200	Now, one can store multiple wave fronts on a hologram.
2715200	2728200	So on the left there, I've got the frequency one case, a reference wave of frequency one being used to store the pyramid and the ball interference pattern.
2728200	2738200	And I can change my reference wave frequency, and therefore my reconstructive wave frequency, frequency two, store an image of the of a cop.
2738200	2745200	And, and that that way from also interference wave interference patterns also on a plate.
2745200	2757200	And so if I modulate the reconstructive way from frequency frequency one, where I'm specifying the pyramid ball to frequency two, I'm specifying now the cop.
2757200	2759200	I can modulate it back to frequency one and see the ball again.
2759200	2762200	So I can modulate the reconstructive wave.
2762200	2765200	Okay, so far so good.
2765200	2769200	I'm in the footsteps of Shaw here.
2769200	2786200	So then what Shaw says is, well, rather than looking at the brain as being the hologram, what if we look at the universe as being the hologram, the universe is the holographic field.
2786200	2794200	In other words, as he said, the hologram is not in the head, the head is in the hologram.
2794200	2810200	And the brain is acting or is creating the reconstructive wave, passing through the holographic field and specifying a source within the field, the coffee cup stirring spoon the table.
2810200	2812200	Okay.
2812200	2821200	So he's flipping pre Brahms thesis around completely.
2821200	2828200	And that's when I realized what Berkson's talking about.
2828200	2833200	But isn't that obvious that the photograph, I got to move your picture.
2833200	2835200	That's okay.
2835200	2843200	This is that obvious that the photograph of the photograph there be is already taken already developed in the very heart of things.
2843200	2846200	And at all points in space.
2846200	2859200	What Berkson was describing in that obscure chapter one was that the universal field of matter field of matter is a holographic field.
2859200	2866200	Each point and that that's a little slide I forgot to do.
2866200	2876200	Because each point in that field is is the reflection of has the information for all other points in the field.
2876200	2888200	If I go back to a slide here, for example, if you look at the cup.
2888200	2890200	Okay.
2890200	2893200	Visualize it as a set of points.
2893200	2894200	Okay.
2894200	2899200	Where each point is giving rise to a a spherical wave.
2899200	2900200	Okay.
2900200	2901200	This is in the.
2901200	2903200	Let me go back one more.
2903200	2906200	I mean, it's related to what you say.
2906200	2913200	There's clearly a relation to quantum mechanics here where, you know, waves and particles, etc.
2913200	2915200	I'm sure.
2915200	2916200	I wouldn't.
2916200	2920200	I wouldn't go into the quantum mechanics of black hole and that's it.
2920200	2921200	Okay.
2921200	2922200	Okay.
2922200	2924200	But here.
2924200	2926200	So the cup go back to the ball each.
2926200	2928200	This is we're constructing a hologram.
2928200	2929200	Okay.
2929200	2936200	Each point on the ball can be considered as giving rise to a little spherical wave that goes out toward that plate.
2936200	2937200	All right.
2937200	2940200	And covers the entire plate.
2940200	2941200	Okay.
2941200	2948200	So, so the information for any one point in that ball covers the entire plate plate.
2948200	2964200	But conversely, then at when you realize a whole set of points of that ball covering that plate, then that at any point in the plate is the information for the entire ball.
2964200	2965200	Okay.
2965200	2971200	So one one point, the spherical wave from one point covers the entire plate.
2971200	2982200	But now when you see there's a whole set of spherical waves covering the entire plate realize that any point the plate is the information for the whole ball and the pyramid.
2982200	2994200	So, so the whole of graphic principles basically that in a hologram at any point is the information for the whole object.
2994200	2999200	The whole, the whole scene, the whole cup, the whole ball, the whole plate.
2999200	3005200	So that's back to this.
3005200	3017200	We were the photograph is already taken already developed a very hard of things in all points and all points in space at every point in space is the information for the whole.
3017200	3023200	So we don't need a photograph and then you've got this next quote.
3023200	3030200	Our zones of indetermination in organisms play in some sort the part of that screen they had nothing that what is there.
3030200	3036200	The effect merely this the real action passes through the virtual action remains.
3036200	3049200	So, remember in the previous picture, you know, you're seeing the virtual image, the virtual image of the cup, or the.
3049200	3052200	So that's the virtual action remaining.
3052200	3055200	So, what would be the real action?
3055200	3062200	Well, the real actions going back to the other quote is every all those.
3063200	3083200	The remember Berks and talk about the whole this is massive set of real actions were that if you look at the my little picture there of all the all of the lines and waves in my my little symbol symbol of the universe as a holographic field.
3083200	3087200	We're only picking out that set of real actions.
3087200	3094200	Those waves that are interesting to us that is that actually relate to the body's capability for action.
3094200	3102200	Okay, so hence why why it's virtual action you're seeing how you can act.
3102200	3104200	You're seeing the possibility of action.
3104200	3109200	I can act on that cup I can act on that on that table.
3109200	3112200	I see this one again, or it's enough.
3112200	3115200	In other words, the cup presents affordances.
3115200	3120200	Sure, the virtual action and the real action would be everything else that we don't perceive.
3120200	3121200	Yes.
3121200	3125200	Yes, we're embedded in the field of real actions.
3125200	3131200	What we're seeing is the virtual is the virtual action that subset of the real actions.
3131200	3138200	That the brain is in the body of picking out is interesting to it that relate to its capability of action.
3138200	3144200	When you upgrade Berks into remember the holographic model.
3144200	3152200	The notion of a hologram wasn't discovered until 1947 by Gabor.
3152200	3154200	Matter of memory is 1896.
3154200	3156200	That's why no one understood it.
3156200	3160200	It didn't have this physical model there to get it.
3160200	3162200	Even when I tell people about it now they still get it.
3162200	3164200	That's another question.
3164200	3172200	But when you upgrade Berks and then into the holographic language, you'd be taking these quotes.
3172200	3185200	You'd be saying, well, the universe is a holographic field and the brain is a reconstructive way specific to a virtual image within that field, the coffee cup and stirring spoon.
3186200	3193200	As we'll see, it's a modulated reconstructive way because coffee stirring itself is very dynamic.
3193200	3195200	All these events are dynamic.
3195200	3201200	The brain is constantly being modulated, dynamically transforming as we'll see.
3201200	3204200	Can you define what modulation is?
3204200	3211200	Well, that was back to the picture where we simply were changing from frequency 1 to frequency 2 to frequency 3.
3211200	3218200	We're modulating a wave to a different frequency.
3218200	3220200	But as I understand...
3220200	3222200	Like frequency modulation.
3222200	3231200	Sure, so forgive my ignorance, but I think when I think of modulation and let's try to be on the same page,
3231200	3243200	I understand it as a signal that's sent to help the transmission of information or help...
3243200	3249200	See, this is where the limits of my understanding kind of go, but does that make sense?
3249200	3254200	It's like sending another signal through a signal.
3254200	3256200	Right, but you simply...
3256200	3265200	Even on that framework, I think you're trying to get to, you're basically modulating the wave into a certain pattern or form.
3265200	3267200	So that it carries my...
3267200	3272200	You modulate that wave, so it carries my voice pattern, my voice frequency.
3272200	3277200	So that it's reflective of my voice up and down.
3277200	3279200	It's a more complex modulation.
3279200	3285200	In fact, this is going to be, and ultimately this is going to be a very complex form of modulation that we're talking about here.
3285200	3294200	But the simplest form is you're simply changing from frequency 1 to frequency 2 to frequency 3 and back to frequency 2.
3294200	3298200	Simply modulating that wave to the different frequencies.
3298200	3303200	That's the simplest form of it.
3303200	3310200	So, well, I got to see where I'm going here.
3310200	3319200	So, as I was saying, so the brain is in this framework is a modulated reconstructive wave.
3319200	3324200	Put the brain here, and it's specific to specifying the cup.
3324200	3327200	Now that cup is right where it says it is.
3327200	3334200	Now here's another, I have in the picture, modulation here, modulated reconstructive wave.
3334200	3342200	Let me move from frequency 2 to the cup, frequency 3, the wine glass, frequency 1.
3342200	3344200	Again, changing that.
3344200	3348200	What would be the purpose of changing the frequencies?
3348200	3356200	Well, if you remember, each of those objects was stored with a specific reference wave of the same frequency.
3356200	3362200	That cup, that cube was stored with a reference wave of frequency 1.
3362200	3366200	So the interference pattern is kind of related to frequency 1.
3366200	3369200	It's a function of frequency 1.
3369200	3372200	The cup was frequency 2.
3372200	3382200	And the interference pattern, the way the waves all meshes a function of that frequency 2 and the object wave from...
3382200	3383200	Sure.
3383200	3393200	So, if you could, in our moment to moment existence, how many frequency waves are we talking about in terms of what we can perceive?
3393200	3400200	Are we talking like an astronomically large number?
3400200	3408200	Well, what we're going to see here is that this is a...
3408200	3418200	Talking in terms of a simple frequency like this is a way to get the mind going into how this process works, how the holographic specification process works.
3418200	3425200	But when you're talking the brain and the event that's driving the brain, the name of this coffee stirring,
3425200	3433200	you're going to have an extremely complex pattern, modulation pattern, we'll call it,
3433200	3441200	where the notion that it's a simple frequency kind of fades into...
3441200	3444200	And you're looking at something far more complex.
3444200	3445200	Sure.
3445200	3454200	So, hang on, you'll see that in a second when we get there with a little more in Gibson, what has to be brought in.
3454200	3460200	So, as I'm saying, it's specific to a specifying this wave.
3460200	3465200	The brain is now specifying the cup right where it says it is in the external field.
3465200	3468200	It's not right where it says it is.
3468200	3474200	Common sense says to us when I'm looking at my coffee cup out here in the desk, that's where it is.
3474200	3477200	It's not constructing an image.
3477200	3485200	No, it's not an image inside the brain or in some mental space or perceptual space somewhere.
3485200	3489200	Like you'll get theorists talking about like Yoshabak will say, well, it's in a perceptual space.
3489200	3494200	Well, what's the perceptual space?
3494200	3498200	So, this is what's called direct perception.
3498200	3507200	That is, indirect perception would be the picture up there where the image of the cup is in the cloud.
3507200	3511200	Shall we say in the mental space or in the brain somehow.
3511200	3520200	And somehow that corresponds to the world out there in some magical way.
3520200	3523200	Direct perception says, no, you're directly perceived.
3523200	3528200	Seeing the cup right where it says it is external in the field.
3528200	3532200	We're not constructing an image in the brain.
3532200	3536200	Now, I'm saying, you know, when driving, here we're going to do your question.
3536200	3538200	What's really driving the modulations?
3538200	3541200	What I termed the invariant structure of the event.
3541200	3546200	We'll talk about that where this event is extremely complex.
3546200	3556200	It's got the velocity flow fields and the swirling of the liquid, the abodic ratios, which are when you're stirring it,
3556200	3561200	energy of oscillation, the frequency of oscillation ratio to that,
3561200	3569200	inertial tensors, which have the momentum of the spoon, the various forced momentum of the spoon,
3569200	3575200	acoustical invariance, like the clinking of the spoon, which is always coordinate with the motion of the spoon, et cetera.
3575200	3579200	So we're going to go into that because that's going to take us into Gibson.
3579200	3586200	But every such event has such a structure and that's driving the brain.
3586200	3588200	We'll get into that.
3588200	3598200	And it's all being specified at a scale of time because that brain has chemical velocities.
3598200	3604200	And this is a neural dynamics there, underlying which are chemical velocities,
3604200	3608200	which can be expressed in the Arrhenius eclage, and it can be modulated too.
3608200	3609200	It can be changed.
3609200	3616200	You can drop a catalyst, which lets the reactions occur more quickly with not as much energy,
3616200	3618200	raise the whole chemical velocities.
3618200	3622200	So the brain is, we're seeing the world specified at a normal scale.
3622200	3627200	Normally the buzzing fly, 200 wing beats per second.
3627200	3634200	If you raise the energy state of the brain, increase the chemical velocities,
3634200	3638200	it could be specified as a heroin-like fly, barely flapping its wings,
3638200	3645200	or even raising it still higher, just a cloud of electrons.
3645200	3653200	So we have to break what I like to call the scale policy, that the world just exists at this scale.
3653200	3654200	It does not.
3654200	3659200	There's multiple scales, and the brain is specifying a specific scale.
3659200	3669200	So this wave is supporting, it's a reconstructive wave, and specific to a scale of time.
3669200	3675200	So with a fair way to, I'm just trying to perhaps simplify it for the audience,
3675200	3683200	there's waves, there's a holographic field made up of waves out in the world.
3683200	3690200	There's waves in my brain, and the waves in my brain are connecting with the waves out in the world.
3690200	3692200	One could look at it that way.
3692200	3693200	Okay, simplify.
3693200	3695200	I mean, that's a really...
3695200	3699200	But, you know, because there's levels of description, you can see it as waves,
3699200	3703200	but now, notice I just described, okay, the copycups is set of waves,
3703200	3710200	but also at another level, and it shows you a scale, it's all these invariance logs.
3710200	3718200	Okay, the swirling flow field, the adiabatic ratio of energy or oscillation of frequency as I stir.
3718200	3721200	So, what I had pictured there...
3721200	3726200	Do you mind just defining invariance for the audience?
3726200	3727200	We're going to see it in a second.
3727200	3728200	Oh, great.
3728200	3729200	Awesome.
3729200	3730200	Thank you.
3730200	3735200	We're going there, because this is why I have the picture of Gibson there,
3735200	3738200	and the fact that Shaw was a student of Gibson.
3738200	3751200	Because Gibson was the pioneer in describing the importance of invariance laws in the world.
3751200	3761200	And he saw this information as being part and parcel of the direct specification of the coffee cup out there.
3761200	3763200	So, here's an example.
3763200	3764200	Here's an example.
3764200	3766200	You have what's called a texture gradient.
3766200	3773200	And the texture gradient is a whole pile of texture units,
3773200	3778200	my little circles of the texture units, and they recede in the distance.
3778200	3782200	The horizontal, there's a little mathematical law.
3782200	3789200	The horizontal distance between each little unit is inversely proportional to the distance from the observer.
3789200	3791200	S is proportional to 1 over D.
3791200	3798200	And then the vertical separation going back, notice they get completely, completely compressed.
3798200	3804200	That separation is special about the law, 1 over D squared.
3804200	3811200	S, the separation is proportional to 1 over the distance squared from the observer.
3811200	3813200	So, that's an interesting little thing.
3813200	3818200	Does that have to do with our field of vision?
3818200	3821200	Or is this just how...
3821200	3826200	Sorry, if you could go back a step.
3826200	3830200	Yeah, because I find this very interesting that there's different laws for horizontal versus vertical.
3830200	3835200	The point I forgot to mention, these fields are ubiquitous.
3835200	3845200	These are gravel, this is your gravel driveway, your field of grass, your beach sands, etc.
3845200	3853200	If I turn it upside down, it becomes the cloud ceiling stretching off in the distance to the back.
3853200	3859200	If I turn it on angles like this, it becomes the walls receding.
3859200	3873200	What's being said here is this is an inherent intrinsic mathematical law within these fields, these texture gradients.
3873200	3889200	And it becomes useful because if I move across this gradient, there's an invariance law relative to those texture rows that specify that the cup stays the constant size.
3889200	3893200	Notice there's including roughly four texture rows.
3893200	3901200	If I move it forward, it's now including two texture rows, but its height is doubling.
3901200	3907200	So as the height doubles, the number of texture rows is halved.
3907200	3917200	And again, you've got this invariance law where n is the number of rows, s is the height of the cup, or s times n equal k is always a constant.
3917200	3932200	And so this would be an example of an invariance law where there's this invariant ratio of size to the number of texture rows included as I move the cup back and forth across this gradient,
3932200	3939200	which is helping specify the role as stable when I move my cup back and forth.
3939200	3951200	The size of the cup does not change, even though the size is growing under wet retina as I move the cup back and forth toward me.
3951200	3957200	This ratio is constant, and so I don't perceive the cup as changing size.
3957200	3963200	I forgot to say two texture rows included with height is doubling.
3963200	3965200	Here's another one.
3965200	3971200	This is an optical flow field. So we're putting this whole gradient in motion.
3971200	3982200	Now it's a gradient of velocity vectors where, again, the value of each vector is proportional to one over the distance squared, again, the distance from the observer.
3982200	3992200	So the fastest moving vectors are closest to you if I'm standing far away at the border versus optical flow field.
3993200	3997200	The slowest moving vectors are furthest away near the mountains.
3997200	4002200	There's a good example as I'm driving along, velocity flow fields.
4002200	4011200	There's all kinds of interesting little things defined over these flow fields, like the tau ratio, which I've got specified there.
4011200	4014200	Don't ask me to translate what it means.
4014200	4018200	You can see it involves the velocity over time.
4018200	4030200	But this ratio has been shown to be useful for things like coming in for landing because it specifies the severity of impact.
4030200	4038200	If the tau value is too great that I'm coming up too fast on that flow field is too fast, I'm going to crash.
4039200	4047200	As a bird coming into land, I'm using this tau value to modulate my wings so that I land nice and softly.
4047200	4053200	Or as a pilot, I land nice and softly on the runway.
4053200	4064200	So here we're starting to get a picture of the information in the light and dynamically transforming optical field that the brain is modulating.
4064200	4068200	The brain is getting into the action systems.
4068200	4077200	Those ratios are being used to specify virtual action, how I can act on the world.
4077200	4085200	Here's an example of what's called grasping tau.
4085200	4092200	As I'm moving the cup back and forth for modulating how I grasp the cup.
4092200	4101200	Again, optical information is getting into the action systems to modulate and specify how I can act.
4101200	4105200	Or affordances.
4105200	4113200	If we get more dynamic, I like to do what I call the Gibsonian cube.
4113200	4120200	If you were rotating a cube, you'd have a partition set of these flow fields.
4120200	4123200	The top would be a radial flow field.
4123200	4133200	As the right side moves toward you, the cube is rotating the opposite direction up there in the corner.
4133200	4138200	If the side is rotating toward you, it's an expanding flow field.
4138200	4143200	Directly presented to you, it's just a non-expanding or contracting flow field.
4143200	4151200	As it rotates away from you, it's a contracting flow field.
4151200	4162200	The edges and the static features of the cube are really simply sharp discontinuities at the junctures of these flows.
4162200	4173200	If you think they're not, well, here's an interesting little experiment or demonstration that Shaw discussed.
4173200	4181200	I've got a rotating cube, a wire edged, and it's got a symmetry period of four.
4181200	4185200	It carries itself into a symmetry period.
4185200	4188200	It carries itself onto itself every 90 degrees.
4188200	4192200	The cube maps right back onto itself every 90 degree turn.
4192200	4194200	It looks like the same thing again.
4194200	4196200	It's got a symmetry period of four.
4196200	4198200	You'll do that four times.
4198200	4205200	If I strobe the cube at an interval multiple of that symmetry period, four, eight, twelve times per revolution,
4205200	4209200	I'll get a rigid cube rotating.
4209200	4211200	I've got a strobe there.
4211200	4214200	It'll still look like a rigid cube.
4214200	4216200	Here's my little picture here.
4216200	4223200	I've got a symmetry period of four, sort of saying the same thing.
4223200	4225200	In phase, four, eight, twelve.
4225200	4229200	Out of phase, this would be out of phase strobe, five, nine, thirteen.
4229200	4231200	It's no longer an integral multiple.
4231200	4237200	Well, if I do the non-intergal multiple, out of phase strobe,
4237200	4243200	it becomes a wobbly, non-rigid, plastically deforming, not a cube.
4244200	4246200	Okay.
4246200	4251200	Now, one could argue there's a constraint being violated
4251200	4259200	that normally spatial symmetry that our nice cube carries itself into itself four times per revolution
4259200	4262200	is no longer being specified.
4262200	4266200	You expect spatial symmetry should equal a temple symmetry,
4266200	4269200	but it's not when you add that out of phase cube.
4270200	4276200	I didn't put another picture here of a rotating ellipse
4276200	4283200	that if, again, you can decompose the edge of the ellipse
4283200	4287200	into a whole pile of velocity vectors going around the ellipse,
4287200	4289200	and if the ellipse rotates too quickly,
4289200	4294200	it becomes a rigid, a non-rigid, wobbly object again.
4294200	4301200	So the point being that these forms in the image,
4301200	4310200	the coffee cup, the table, are very dynamic.
4310200	4312200	They're dynamic forms.
4312200	4315200	They're actually qualia themselves.
4315200	4322200	That's why I said that the whole image is the problem.
4322200	4325200	I think I mentioned where Chalmers kind of misled us,
4325200	4327200	that the whole image is qualia.
4327200	4330200	We're trying to explain the image of the external world.
4330200	4332200	It's all qualia.
4332200	4336200	Hence why we need the brain as a reconstructive wave
4336200	4341200	specifying a portion of the holographic field.
4341200	4345200	As we'll see, that holographic field is qualitative of itself.
4346200	4352200	The cube, the coffee cup, is a qualitative portion
4352200	4354200	of a qualitative field.
4354200	4360200	So all of these are examples now, I think, of invariance laws.
4360200	4365200	I think the velocity vectors in the distance,
4365200	4370200	the height of the cup, the rows occluded, the total ratio,
4370200	4374200	it's all information that is specifying or useful
4374200	4377200	part of the specification of the environment,
4377200	4380200	the external world.
4380200	4384200	It's not Shannon's definition of information,
4384200	4388200	nor can it be brought under Shannon's umbrella.
4388200	4391200	This is Gibson's information.
4391200	4395200	It's resolutely and adamantly ignored
4395200	4399200	in the neural net and computer model mind.
4399200	4403200	As you can see, it can't be.
4403200	4406200	Why can't it be?
4406200	4409200	It's obviously important.
4409200	4412200	It's too important to ignore.
4412200	4419200	So get put in all together, back to my coffee.
4419200	4422200	It's got all these invariance laws
4422200	4425200	defined over that coffee cup.
4425200	4428200	The radial flow field, an adiabatic invariance,
4428200	4430200	there's the ratio of energy of oscillation,
4430200	4432200	the frequency of oscillation.
4432200	4434200	I moved that spoon.
4434200	4436200	And inertial tens are defined in various momentum.
4436200	4438200	These are all defined over time.
4438200	4444200	You don't find the value of the energy of oscillation
4444200	4448200	and frequency oscillation as a static, instant, static point.
4448200	4450200	We'll come back to that.
4450200	4452200	Acoustical invariance, you've got the spoon
4452200	4456200	clinking against the cup as the spoon moves and sound.
4456200	4460200	You've got ratios relative to the extra gradients and flows.
4460200	4463200	I can move that cup back and forth on the extra gradient,
4463200	4464200	remember.
4464200	4466200	Constancy remains the same.
4466200	4469200	If I had a cubocal cup, I could be rotating my cup.
4469200	4472200	And now I have that Gibsonian cube with all the flow fields
4472200	4475200	defining the quote edges and vertices of the cup, et cetera.
4475200	4484200	Grasping tau, as we noted, for grasping the cup, et cetera.
4484200	4488200	So back to my picture.
4489200	4492200	Our little coffee cup, our innocent little coffee cup,
4492200	4494200	is this invariant structure.
4494200	4497200	And the invariant structure is, that's what I say,
4497200	4503200	is driving the modulation of the brain as a reconstructive way.
4503200	4505200	But I think now, back to your question,
4505200	4508200	well, can we really talk about quote frequency one
4508200	4510200	or frequency two, really?
4510200	4513200	Only in a metaphoric sense that it helps us
4513200	4517200	understand the holographic reconstructive process.
4517200	4522200	This is obviously very complex wave form at this point.
4522200	4528200	If you visualize the brain dynamically changing over time,
4528200	4533200	being driven by this structure, it's obviously
4533200	4537200	a very complex structure that's being unfolded into the brain.
4537200	4540200	And yet, ultimately, the vision is
4540200	4545200	that it's all comprising this reconstructive way.
4546200	4552200	And as I noted before, all models of the brain
4552200	4556200	have to address this dynamic structure.
4556200	4561200	Because it's obvious to the information that's specifying,
4561200	4564200	it's obvious to the information that's defining the event,
4564200	4566200	defining coffee stir.
4566200	4573200	But neural nets do not and cannot, partly
4573200	4576200	because they're in this completely different model
4576200	4579200	in a different model of time.
4579200	4587200	The neural net is simply an instantiation of a Turing machine.
4587200	4592200	And the Turing machine is a discrete state model of time,
4592200	4597200	or removing state 0 to state 1, et cetera, et cetera,
4597200	4601200	removing state to state as we move that tape.
4601200	4606200	So you've got an intrinsically different model of time
4606200	4609200	in the computer model as opposed to what we're going to need
4609200	4614200	to support this holographic field, reconstructive wave,
4614200	4616200	invariant structure model.
4616200	4618200	And we're going to get to that.
4618200	4621200	We're going to break it out in terms of the computer model
4621200	4624200	being a discrete view of time.
4624200	4625200	Yes.
4625200	4628200	And we're going to, we're about to launch right into that
4628200	4629200	because that's another piece.
4629200	4630200	Continuous, OK.
4630200	4631200	Yeah.
4631200	4633200	I had one more thing to say about invariance laws.
4633200	4636200	It's kind of interesting.
4636200	4638200	Over here, another invariance law.
4638200	4642200	Here we have the aging of the facial profile.
4642200	4646200	And the law specifying that aging is such.
4646200	4649200	If we take a cardioid, which is like a heart shape figure there,
4649200	4652200	and place it over a skull, and place the skull
4652200	4655200	on a nice coordinate system or matrix there,
4655200	4659200	then if we apply what's called a strain transformation, which
4659200	4662200	expands that coordinate grid in all directions simultaneously,
4662200	4666200	like stretching a rubber sheet, what you do
4666200	4672200	is start generating an aging of that profile.
4672200	4674200	I have a picture there.
4674200	4678200	If you start with a child, as you do the strain transformation,
4678200	4680200	you'll get the second picture there,
4680200	4681200	and then the third.
4681200	4683200	There's a whole series, obviously.
4683200	4684200	I just picked out three.
4684200	4688200	And you can see that we're getting an aging of that profile.
4688200	4695200	So interesting, because this aging is normally a very slow event.
4695200	4702200	It takes us, we perceive, we recognize that Joe aged after we,
4702200	4707200	when we meet him 30 years later, or watch him as he grows.
4707200	4712200	But the interesting thing is here is that the same law is going to hold
4712200	4718200	in different space-time partitions of our relativity.
4718200	4722200	For example, the burden, the essence of relativity,
4722200	4727200	the real point of it, in Einstein's relativity,
4727200	4734200	was that the same law holds in either space-time partition,
4734200	4738200	in the moving, in the stationary system on the bottom right there,
4738200	4740200	the law is D equal VT.
4740200	4745200	In the moving system, it's D prime equal VT prime.
4745200	4746200	It's the same form of law.
4746200	4749200	It's just I've changed the distance units and the time units
4749200	4754200	in that moving system, or what I call the moving system.
4754200	4758200	So the same law holds in each partition D equal VT
4758200	4760200	or D prime equal to VT prime.
4760200	4763200	Invariance laws are critical in special relativity.
4763200	4767200	That's probably the most important piece of special relativity.
4767200	4772200	It's the importance of invariance laws.
4772200	4775200	And I got to see what I say here.
4775200	4779200	Now, if I go back and notice, I said you could raise the energy state
4779200	4782200	of the body, increase the chemical velocity.
4782200	4787200	So I could take that buzzing.
4787200	4793200	And if I raise the chemical velocities, I drop in frankly LSD
4793200	4796200	at the right proportion.
4796200	4799200	There's a little paper on that.
4799200	4801200	You're going to increase the chemical velocities,
4801200	4805200	but you're going to slow down the specification of the event.
4805200	4808200	That fly is going to go from 200 wing beats per second
4808200	4812200	to looking like it's barely flapping its wing.
4812200	4816200	And I got to keep moving you around.
4816200	4820200	The slow moving wing of that heron-like fly,
4820200	4823200	maybe it's a seagull, but we won't argue here.
4823200	4824200	What does that mean?
4824200	4828200	Well, it means it's got a relationship to action,
4828200	4829200	the possibility of action.
4829200	4833200	I can reach out slowly and grab the wing.
4833200	4838200	I mean, more startlingly, let's say I raise the energy state enough
4838200	4841200	so that the fly was stuck still.
4841200	4843200	I mean, the wing stopped.
4843200	4846200	Now clearly, I could reach out slowly and grab it.
4846200	4851200	But this is the exemplar of perception being virtual action.
4851200	4857200	We're seeing the possibility of action, of how we can act.
4857200	4862200	This must be so for perception to be ecologically valid
4862200	4864200	in all partitions.
4864200	4867200	Because I can change the velocity of processes just by changing
4867200	4868200	the temperature.
4868200	4870200	I can get a fever and I can slow down time.
4870200	4873200	Nature has to have allowed for this.
4873200	4882200	That is, you have to have invariance laws specifying these events.
4882200	4885200	That is, the information has to be invariance laws
4885200	4888200	as invariant to the spacetime partition,
4888200	4890200	or the energy state of the body.
4890200	4893200	And the energy state is a range of energy states,
4893200	4895200	and the time scale that can be specified
4895200	4898200	is a massive range of time scales.
4898200	4901200	Again, this is affordances.
4902200	4905200	It's just an aspect of affordances that the Gibsonians
4905200	4907200	never seen.
4907200	4910200	Well, you can see it's too much of a stretch for them.
4910200	4912200	And I'm going to see why ultimately.
4912200	4917200	But obviously, if the fly is affording a certain action,
4917200	4919200	so is the gall affording a certain action.
4919200	4921200	But it's at a different scale of time.
4921200	4925200	Change the scale of time, I'm going to change the form of affordance.
4926200	4933200	So, as I noted, back to where we started,
4933200	4935200	aging is a rapid event.
4935200	4937200	If I take it as a rapid event,
4937200	4942200	let's say that little Joe there is growing right in front of my eyes.
4942200	4947200	So the same law is employed to guide the modulation of the hand
4947200	4949200	if I wanted to grasp a transforming head,
4949200	4951200	the strain on the cardioid.
4951200	4954200	That's the information that would be getting into the action systems
4954200	4959200	to guide my grabbing that head as it transforms
4959200	4961200	at a very rapid rate.
4961200	4964200	Just a little aspect of the nature,
4964200	4967200	just the criticality of invariance laws.
4969200	4973200	So, I noted Gibson was for direct perception.
4973200	4975200	To him, the environment is directly specified
4975200	4977200	via all this information.
4977200	4981200	The brain is resonating to this time extended information.
4981200	4983200	Another way to put it here in my little box,
4983200	4987200	the brain is resonating to the invariance in the external event.
4987200	4990200	And it's directly specifying the image out there.
4990200	4993200	There's no image in the brain.
4993200	4995200	That's Gibson.
4995200	4997200	No one can understand it.
4997200	5001200	Purvis and Lotto, great perception theorist recently.
5001200	5003200	There's our little book.
5003200	5007200	Well, Gibson is now perceived as mystical.
5007200	5011200	Stephen Leihar, who's the only perception theorist, goes through Gibson.
5011200	5013200	I've looked at Gibson.
5013200	5017200	I have no clue how direct perception can possibly be true.
5017200	5021200	Because for all these people, somehow the image is in the brain
5021200	5026200	or in that perceptual space, that cloud I had up there.
5026200	5029200	Again, to make sense, Gibson's direct perception
5029200	5031200	must be placed within Berkson's holographic
5031200	5034200	brain as a reconstructive wave framework.
5034200	5042200	And as we're going to see, it's a notion of time.
5042200	5045200	And into this, because notion of time.
5045200	5050200	Another aspect of what implicit aspect, we're specifying the past.
5050200	5052200	Okay?
5052200	5055200	The specification is to the past,
5055200	5059200	to the past extent of the transformation of the holographic field.
5059200	5062200	The wing beats of that fly.
5062200	5067200	By the time they get into the brain, they're processed a long gone.
5067200	5070200	Just 200 wing beats per second.
5070200	5071200	They're long gone.
5071200	5073200	So how are we seeing the past?
5073200	5082200	How is this past specification possible?
5082200	5084200	Well, what's the barrier to that?
5084200	5088200	The barrier is this conception of space and time that we have.
5088200	5093200	I call it the classic metaphysical space and time.
5093200	5097200	And we're going to compare that to ultimately the temporal metaphysics
5097200	5103200	of Berkson, which allows the specification of the past.
5103200	5107200	So the classic metaphysics, in essence, is an abstract space.
5107200	5111200	It's a three-dimensional continuum of points positions.
5111200	5114200	I'm showing a two-dimensional continuum of points and positions there.
5114200	5116200	My little points and positions.
5116200	5118200	Ultimately, it's a three-dimensional.
5118200	5122200	We're moving the cup through a three-dimensional continuum of points and positions.
5122200	5125200	Because it's a space, it's instantly divisible.
5125200	5131200	In fact, as Berkson calls it, it's a principle of infinite divisibility.
5131200	5138200	He called it, in essence, a mental diagram, the meshes of which we can contract at will,
5138200	5144200	that we place beneath the extensity, the true concrete extensity of the concrete world.
5144200	5146200	We'll talk about extensity a little bit later.
5146200	5152200	But just imagine it's the concrete world and we place this abstract mental diagram of meshes
5152200	5155200	that we can make smaller and smaller.
5155200	5162200	So when we look at motion in this framework, it's taken, as I move that cup from nearer to far
5162200	5168200	across the continuum, it's taken as a series of, that motion is taken as a series of points
5168200	5171200	on a line, which, again, is a space.
5171200	5174200	In that line, the inner space is infinitely divisible.
5174200	5177200	I can divide it into this little point after point after point.
5177200	5184200	But between each pair of points, I can imagine there's another line of points.
5184200	5187200	Again, infinitely divisible.
5187200	5191200	And so what we end up with is this is an infinite regress.
5191200	5192200	I can keep dividing.
5192200	5195200	Between each pair of points, I can do another line.
5195200	5200200	It's an absurdity because motion is now being reduced to a series of immobilities.
5200200	5203200	How do you get motion out of a series of immobile points?
5203200	5211200	And I should add, it's precisely the source of Zeno's paradoxes where I'm taking that line
5211200	5215200	and I'm having it successively into smaller and smaller hands.
5215200	5221200	But Achilles never reaches the tortoise because it's infinitely divisible.
5221200	5224200	I can never quit the process of infinite division.
5225200	5231200	I can do it with a mathematical convention, but that's a magical mathematical convention
5231200	5232200	like taking a limit.
5232200	5240200	But that's a mythology that mathematical convention has actually solved the problem.
5240200	5248200	Whitehead tried that solution, but it's just a mythology because infinity is infinity.
5248200	5256200	And the mathematical convention is simply conveniently stopping the infinite division.
5256200	5261200	Now time is interesting because now it's simply the fourth dimension of this abstract space.
5261200	5264200	So we really have a four-dimensional abstract space.
5264200	5266200	It's this series of instants.
5266200	5271200	So each point along that moving cup is taken as an instant, shall we say.
5271200	5277200	And so each instant corresponds to a position of the moving cup.
5277200	5284200	And each instant can be taken as across the whole universe, as though the whole universe
5284200	5288200	at that point, at instant in time, is a cube of space.
5288200	5297200	For each cube, the time extent of each cube is a mathematical point equivalent to the mathematical
5297200	5299200	point on the line.
5299200	5304200	But as such, each of those blocks is frozen, is static.
5304200	5310200	You can't move from one block to another.
5310200	5312200	I jumped ahead of myself here.
5312200	5315200	But each block, then, is completely homogeneous.
5315200	5322200	There's zero qualities, especially emotion, because you can't get a block or a series of such blocks
5322200	5326200	because remember, each block disappears as the next one arrives.
5326200	5329200	So all you ever have is one block, then the next, and the next, and the next.
5329200	5336200	So you're not going to get the quality of motion like Valerie Hardcastle's list in the context of a symphony.
5336200	5338200	The patrons shift in their seats.
5338200	5340200	The musicians concentrate.
5340200	5343200	The curtains ever so gently waving.
5343200	5349200	Those are qualities of motion, which I've never talked about, by the way, the problem of quality.
5349200	5352200	But these qualities of motion.
5352200	5363200	So the car, looking at this, in order to reintroduce motion in this metaphysics, actually thought that you had to have,
5363200	5370200	this is where you needed God because God would have to create each block, then the next block, then the next block,
5370200	5371200	and the next block.
5371200	5374200	That's the only way you could get the universe to evolve.
5374200	5377200	So once you've frozen it, it's a static block.
5377200	5381200	You're not going to get the next block.
5382200	5391200	Again, this is precisely the metaphysics underlying the turbine machine and all of computation.
5391200	5403200	It's why intrinsically, inherently intrinsically, the computer metaphor is not going to be able to deal with what we need for Berkson's framework,
5403200	5406200	shall we say, and mind.
5406200	5408200	So let's go to that.
5408200	5412200	The temporal metaphysics of Berkson.
5412200	5420200	Berkson, that transformation of the universal field, or motion itself, is indivisible.
5420200	5423200	It is not a series of discrete states.
5423200	5430200	Rather, each instant penetrates, permeates the next, like the notes of a melody.
5430200	5433200	Each note penetrates, permeates the next.
5433200	5437200	It's a melodic transformation, an organic continuity.
5444200	5451200	Also, the matter field, and this is characterized by extensity, as I noted.
5452200	5456200	There's a nice lake there.
5456200	5460200	That's the concrete material field.
5460200	5467200	The abstract space placed over it at continual points in positions is not the same thing.
5467200	5473200	It's the ideal limit of this extensity, but it has never reached it.
5473200	5475200	It cannot be reached.
5475200	5480200	It's simply an ideal mathematical limit.
5481200	5489200	This is why you can't exalt the abstract space into a reality
5489200	5494200	and make it your starting point for building a model of mind, as does AI.
5494200	5499200	The brain simply does not dwell in the world of the classic metaphysics.
5499200	5503200	It deals with the classic metaphysics, that abstract space.
5503200	5508200	It's created or derived by the brain in its development.
5509200	5516200	Piaget spends a great deal of time explaining, all the way from 8.0 to 8.7,
5516200	5521200	it takes to truly construct that abstract space.
5521200	5523200	Okay.
5523200	5524200	How's that all?
5524200	5525200	One point, Steve.
5525200	5530200	The top two points here.
5531200	5539200	I'm sure people disagree, but the current consensus in modern physics
5539200	5543200	is that space and time is discreet.
5543200	5544200	Yes.
5544200	5547200	They would break it down in terms of the plank.
5547200	5551200	Of course, we don't experience it this way because it's so miniscule,
5551200	5557200	but you have the plank length, plank time.
5558200	5564200	If you had to discreetize space and time, you could possibly do it that way,
5564200	5566200	but this model is different.
5566200	5568200	Is that accurate?
5568200	5571200	Yes.
5571200	5576200	The problem is all of mathematics is based in the classic metaphysics.
5576200	5587200	And even the wave equation is based in this classic metaphysics
5587200	5595200	and ultimately involves this process of taking limits,
5595200	5600200	such that I can arbitrarily stop in infinity.
5600200	5601200	Okay.
5601200	5606200	The basis of the wave equation is Euler's identity.
5606200	5614200	Or Euler's identity is Euler's description of the wave,
5614200	5617200	but in order to make that identity work,
5617200	5624200	eventually you take a limit to stop the basically Euler's identity.
5624200	5629200	You've got sort of a rotating cosine wave,
5629200	5631200	but it always comes back to zero.
5631200	5634200	In order to make it come back to zero, that's Euler's identity,
5634200	5636200	E to the i pi equals zero,
5636200	5641200	you have to take a limit of that relation, E to the i pi,
5641200	5643200	our arbitrary mathematical limit,
5643200	5645200	but that sits at the heart of the wave equation.
5645200	5652200	And you're exalting that abstraction into the reality from which you're trying to start all theory.
5652200	5657200	Everything's inverted in our current theoretical world.
5657200	5659200	That's the problem.
5659200	5672200	So, yeah, I did a, speaking of quantum, I mean, I did a YouTube on Schroediger.
5672200	5677200	I think it's number 60 on quantum jumps.
5677200	5684200	Schroediger did a paper in 1952 where he utterly destroyed the whole notion of quantum jumps.
5684200	5686200	He destroyed it, logically destroyed it.
5686200	5689200	People don't realize this.
5689200	5699200	And so, you know, that's, but again, that comes back to the fundamental nature of the mathematics underneath it.
5699200	5704200	So, let's see.
5704200	5706200	As I said, this is important.
5706200	5711200	The brain dwells or is embedded in dynamically transforming,
5711200	5716200	indivisibly transforming a holographic field or the world of temporal metaphysics.
5716200	5722200	It derives the spatial metaphysics, the classic metaphysics, the abstract space.
5722200	5727200	This is just completely foundational if you're going to follow Bergson.
5727200	5729200	Okay.
5729200	5733200	So, let's find the past to bring it back.
5733200	5737200	The indivisible transformation of the field where there are no incidents falling into the past.
5737200	5744200	You don't have this model of instant after instant falling into the past,
5744200	5747200	which is the symbol of non-existence.
5747200	5755200	Rather, you've got this indivisible flow, each instant permeating the next organic continuity.
5755200	5762200	Well, that in effect forms a primary memory, still in the term from William James.
5762200	5766200	The field is already, in essence, got its own memory.
5766200	5771200	It's not falling into the past, into non-existence.
5771200	5778200	So, then when you're specifying the holographic field,
5778200	5783200	the specifications to a past extent of this holographic field.
5783200	5787200	Now, this is interesting aspects of things that I haven't totally worked out,
5787200	5792200	because you're going to have to have the resonance field represented by that brain,
5792200	5797200	the wave there is only lasting for a certain period of time,
5797200	5803200	relative to an extent of the past of the field, of the buzzing fly.
5803200	5806200	Again, as in, the wing beats are long gone.
5806200	5812200	So, this allows a past extent of the transformation to be specified.
5812200	5816200	You don't need short-term storage areas in the brain,
5816200	5819200	which is a concept filled with logical problems.
5819200	5823200	Because right now, if you think about when I said, for Berkson,
5823200	5827200	the essence of the problem of consciousness was his memory stored in the brain.
5827200	5832200	Well, when your perception is already the problem,
5832200	5836200	you're looking at that spoon stirring and the fly buzzing.
5836200	5840200	Well, are you storing each instant of that in the brain,
5840200	5844200	sliced by, like, snapshot by snapshot by snapshot,
5844200	5848200	then trying to reconstruct the motion?
5848200	5850200	How are you doing that?
5850200	5854200	Who reconstructs the motion, some internal scanner?
5854200	5856200	We'll talk about that in a second,
5856200	5863200	but you can see that the very fundamentals of perception itself,
5863200	5866200	of seeing that coffee cup already involves the problem is,
5866200	5868200	well, his memory actually being stored in the brain,
5868200	5871200	his experience being stored in the brain.
5871200	5877200	And the answer is, no, it can't be.
5878200	5880200	And something else we can see there, but I lost it.
5880200	5883200	So, but if I go back to Gibson for a second,
5883200	5886200	you'll see what he's saying the same thing.
5886200	5888200	Notice this.
5888200	5890200	This is back to the classic metaphysics.
5890200	5893200	He says, the idea that space is perceived,
5893200	5896200	and time, as you remember, looks at the back of our thinking.
5896200	5901200	But these abstractions, space and time, the classic metaphysics,
5901200	5906200	borrowed from physics are not appropriate to psychology.
5906200	5909200	And this is adjacent to order and successive order,
5909200	5911200	but are abstractions, and these are not found separate.
5911200	5914200	Oops, I can spell our other.
5914200	5918200	This is physical events that conform with relation before and after,
5918200	5920200	and not to the contrast of past and future.
5920200	5923200	Well, again, you've got to visualize that line of points,
5923200	5925200	where one point is the present,
5925200	5927200	points before that are all past,
5927200	5928200	which have fallen away,
5928200	5932200	and the points coming later are future.
5932200	5935200	That's what he's saying is that's the classic metaphysics.
5935200	5941200	When you take the classic metaphysics down to its logical conclusion,
5941200	5947200	and the brain itself only exists for one of those infinitely small points,
5947200	5951200	a point of mathematical extent and time.
5951200	5954200	That's just not applicable.
5954200	5958200	Unfortunately, the Gibsonians are not paying attention to that quote.
5958200	5962200	I mean, even my brilliant advisor, Bob Schaage,
5963200	5968200	the paper's trying to model the whole of the Gibsonian ecological theory
5968200	5973200	on the wave equation with its inherent problem.
5973200	5976200	So, just an aside.
5976200	5981200	Here's another thing that Gibson notes,
5981200	5983200	the traveling moment of present time,
5983200	5989200	that infinitely tiny point that's called the present
5989200	5992200	between the past and the future,
5992200	5994200	the dispacious present,
5994200	5997200	that mathematical point that would be the dispacious present.
5997200	5999200	Again, Berks and Gibson notes,
5999200	6002200	well, no one can say where perception leaves off when memory begins.
6002200	6005200	In fact, I failed to put the quote there,
6005200	6007200	but when we're looking at the past,
6007200	6009200	the specification of the past,
6009200	6014200	it's really an essence of Berkson said is the case.
6014200	6018200	Perception is already a memory.
6018200	6021200	All of perception is memory already.
6024200	6026200	So, no one can say where perception leaves off,
6026200	6029200	memory begins, it's difficult, it's an old one,
6029200	6032200	and notice he says in the blue,
6032200	6034200	there are animals of man perceived motions,
6034200	6036200	events, episodes, and whole sequences.
6036200	6039200	They don't see point after point,
6039200	6042200	it's an after incident on a line
6042200	6044200	for the classic metaphysics.
6044200	6047200	And he says the doctrine of sensation-based perception
6047200	6050200	requires the assumption that the succession of items can be grasped,
6050200	6053200	only if the earlier ones are held over,
6053200	6057200	so as to be combined with later ones in a single composite.
6057200	6060200	He says this can be pushed into absurdity.
6060200	6063200	Well, notice I've got up there,
6063200	6067200	Barcelona's theory of how you would store a biting transformation.
6067200	6070200	I'd store it there, I'm inviting a carrot,
6070200	6073200	there's three schematic states,
6073200	6076200	mouth closed, mouth open, mouth closed back on the carrot.
6076200	6079200	And so we store that in the brain, three schematic states.
6079200	6082200	Equivalent to storing, putting three snapshots
6082200	6085200	on photographs on a table.
6085200	6088200	Okay, the question is, well, how do I restore the motion?
6088200	6093200	How do I reconstruct the motion by some sort of internal scanner?
6093200	6096200	Okay, but then I've got an infinite regress,
6096200	6099200	I've now got to explain how the scanner, internal scanner,
6099200	6101200	registers the motion.
6101200	6105200	See, I'm doing there exactly in that picture what Gibson's saying,
6105200	6107200	a succession of items can be grasped,
6107200	6109200	only if the earlier ones are held over,
6109200	6112200	like on the table, successively one after the other,
6112200	6115200	to be combined with later ones into a single composite.
6115200	6117200	It can be pushed into absurdity.
6117200	6119200	Yes, it can.
6119200	6124200	Biting is actually a facial flow field.
6124200	6127200	There's Homer there, biting, or, you know,
6127200	6130200	look at the facial flow fields on these biting.
6130200	6131200	There we go.
6131200	6133200	Here's an actual, you know, biting a carrot.
6133200	6135200	Okay.
6135200	6138200	It's hard to store.
6138200	6140200	Well, I screwed up.
6140200	6142200	We got to go back.
6142200	6144200	Sorry about that.
6144200	6149200	It's hard to store as the coffee stirrer into the rotating queue.
6149200	6152200	See, again, notice.
6152200	6155200	Do you see anyone in memory theory,
6155200	6157200	I'm just rhetorical questions as far as your concern,
6157200	6161200	addressing how you would store that coffee stirrer
6161200	6163200	with all those invariance laws that define it,
6163200	6165200	which define only over time.
6165200	6168200	The invariant radio flow field, the inertial tensors,
6168200	6170200	how do you store that?
6170200	6173200	And, you know, as a series of three-dimensional snapshots
6173200	6176200	in the brain, good luck.
6176200	6182200	And then how do you restore it as reconstructed as motion?
6182200	6186200	Hence, you know, again, Gibson is relying on Berks.
6187200	6191200	Which brings us to the last thing I got here.
6191200	6195200	That good old original question, the problem of subject and object.
6195200	6198200	What is going on there?
6198200	6202200	Because we need to remove the viewer.
6202200	6206200	Somebody looking, see, remember the hologram plate is the brain.
6206200	6212200	And we have to review who's looking at that image out there.
6213200	6216200	Or, equivalently, we need to remove the homunculus,
6216200	6221200	looking at the image, whether it's in the perceptual space
6221200	6227200	or out there, or somehow.
6227200	6230200	So we're back to our coin.
6230200	6232200	Questions related to subject and object.
6232200	6234200	The distinction in the union is you put in terms of time
6234200	6236200	rather than space.
6236200	6238200	My original coin.
6239200	6244200	So, here's the deal.
6244200	6248200	Defined over the dynamically transforming holographic field,
6248200	6252200	we've got an elementary awareness at the null scale of time.
6252200	6256200	When I say null scale, I mean the most infinitely small scale
6256200	6258200	of time you can imagine.
6258200	6260200	Things are still always changing,
6260200	6264200	but think of that change in the tiniest interval you can imagine.
6264200	6268200	Again, each point or event in that field reflects
6268200	6272200	the state of all of the points.
6272200	6276200	So, in essence, you've got elementary awareness there.
6276200	6280200	At every point, every point is sort of elementary for,
6280200	6283200	not truly elementary, of all the other points,
6283200	6287200	taken at this infinitely small scale of time.
6287200	6290200	And you've got elementary memory
6290200	6294200	because of the indivisible transformation,
6294200	6296200	where there are no instants falling into the past,
6296200	6299200	that primary memory.
6299200	6304200	So, as I've noted, if you take our fly
6304200	6308200	and take it at that null scale,
6308200	6310200	at a very tiny scale of time,
6310200	6314200	where it's almost a cloud of electrons,
6314200	6317200	it's not going to have the distinct outlines
6317200	6320200	of the rest of the field, the rest of the whole erratic field,
6320200	6323200	to include any distinct outlines from our body.
6323200	6325200	Our body is going to be the same thing.
6325200	6328200	In other words, the objects that we think are nice and separate,
6328200	6330200	like the cup and the spoon and the body,
6330200	6333200	don't actually have the distinct outlines.
6333200	6336200	They're all meshed into the field, ultimately.
6336200	6339200	It's a big spatial unity.
6339200	6345200	So, if I start lowering the energy state of that brain,
6346200	6348200	I'm going to lower it now,
6348200	6353200	because I'm going to go from this very small scale to a bigger scale.
6353200	6356200	I'll get my hair in like fly.
6356200	6359200	And if I lower it still more,
6359200	6362200	I'll get my normal scale, a buzzing like fly.
6362200	6366200	So, we're starting to have subject differentiating from object,
6366200	6370200	not in terms of space, but of time.
6370200	6375200	The unity of the two,
6375200	6378200	the body and the fly there, is not broken.
6378200	6380200	Spatial unity.
6380200	6383200	Remember, there's no distinct outlines
6383200	6386200	or borders between these objects.
6386200	6391200	But as I impose the scale of time,
6391200	6394200	I start getting this nice separate object,
6394200	6397200	the buzzing fly and the coffee cup from my body.
6397200	6402200	And, you know, in terms of time,
6402200	6407200	and then I think we have to add a bit more with the Piagetian development,
6407200	6415200	where ultimately, he describes this whole evolution
6415200	6418200	of the child's conception of object,
6418200	6421200	where he starts to realize that he's a separate object
6421200	6423200	from the coffee cup and the fly.
6423200	6427200	Can I tell you a quick anecdote that this reminds me of?
6427200	6429200	Do you mind?
6429200	6430200	Say what?
6430200	6432200	I just have a quick anecdote on that.
6432200	6433200	You just mentioned child.
6433200	6435200	And this is reminding me.
6435200	6438200	I have a niece and two nephews.
6438200	6441200	And this is just recalling something my nephew said to me years ago
6441200	6443200	when he was a little younger.
6443200	6445200	I think he was five or six years old.
6445200	6448200	And we were just playing, hanging out.
6448200	6451200	And he said something to me that we were separated.
6451200	6454200	He was standing on the, he was standing, you know,
6454200	6456200	I was standing separate from him.
6456200	6461200	And he goes, I'm touching you right now.
6461200	6462200	I was like, what do you mean?
6462200	6464200	He's like, well, I'm standing on the floor
6464200	6465200	and the floor is touching you.
6465200	6467200	You're touching the floor.
6467200	6469200	And I was like, huh?
6469200	6470200	And he said, yeah, it even,
6470200	6472200	I'm touching the house across the street.
6472200	6473200	I'm touching that.
6473200	6476200	And his conception, I think it has something to do with,
6476200	6477200	I think about this a lot with kids.
6477200	6478200	Like, what are they perceiving?
6478200	6480200	What are they seeing?
6480200	6484200	What is their kind, like the difference in terms of,
6484200	6486200	and obviously as they grow up,
6486200	6491200	they reach some critical period where they come into agreement
6491200	6495200	with society, the people around them as to the nature of things
6495200	6496200	and what's actually happening, right?
6496200	6498200	Or as we perceive it.
6498200	6500200	Yeah, they start to need to be one.
6500200	6501200	Yeah.
6501200	6503200	But the interesting thing is like,
6503200	6506200	if you look at it in terms of a slice of time, let's say,
6506200	6511200	and I hope this is, it follows with what you're saying.
6511200	6515200	If you were able to just take a slice of time, one plank time,
6515200	6520200	let's say, you know, just one snapshot,
6520200	6523200	everything would be the same object.
6523200	6525200	Is that accurate?
6525200	6526200	Yeah.
6526200	6527200	Yeah.
6527200	6530200	Once you, because it's all, it's one big field.
6530200	6534200	And yeah, almost, yeah.
6534200	6535200	I'd say yes.
6535200	6537200	I'd go for that.
6537200	6538200	Something like that.
6538200	6541200	Obviously language is tough because we're trying to put
6541200	6545200	to words these very complex things and it might not even be
6545200	6548200	possible in our vocabulary to get there,
6548200	6553200	but we can kind of analyze and get around it sort of.
6553200	6554200	True.
6554200	6555200	Okay.
6555200	6556200	I think I may be one more thing.
6556200	6560200	So this is where it's kind of interesting because really there is,
6560200	6563200	the essence is there's no one seeing.
6564200	6566200	This is where it gets Zen.
6566200	6571200	The specification is to a time scale form of that elementary
6571200	6574200	awareness that we're talking about elementary memory to find
6574200	6577200	over the transforming holographic field.
6577200	6580200	And so, I mean, this is the kind of the essence of the Zen
6580200	6585200	Satori where all of a sudden you've been concentrated on your
6585200	6586200	Koan.
6586200	6588200	Who is it that sees?
6588200	6589200	All right.
6589200	6592200	And all of a sudden there's this Satori or Ken show where you,
6592200	6594200	you are the field.
6594200	6598200	You know, there's a famous book by Douglas E. Harding that I having
6598200	6602200	on having no head where all of a sudden you realize there's just
6602200	6607200	this, there's no, there's, there's no, you're, you're that,
6607200	6610200	that you're, you know, there's no separate being.
6610200	6613200	You're, you're his context.
6613200	6618200	He became the Himalayas, you know, after time, but this,
6618200	6623200	this is the essence of the Zen Satori.
6623200	6628200	I spent some time on YouTube discussing, I know you said you
6628200	6630200	watched the Zen experience.
6630200	6633200	I think those are my favorites.
6633200	6634200	Right.
6634200	6636200	This is why Berkson is so Zen.
6636200	6638200	I'm not sure what I got left here now.
6638200	6642200	Well, like I said, so, well, I have a lot of questions even when
6642200	6645200	you're, I have a lot of questions even when we complete the slide
6646200	6647200	share, but
6649200	6654200	so notice this is Berkson's unique panpsychism over on the
6654200	6655200	left.
6655200	6659200	It's, it's a panpsychic model because that field is conscious in
6659200	6660200	essence.
6660200	6663200	It's got elementary awareness and elementary memory, but it's not
6663200	6668200	the consciousness of stirring spoons on that experience of the
6668200	6671200	coffee cup and stirring spoon or if you're a frog, the fly buzzing
6671200	6672200	or anything like that.
6672200	6677200	It's, it's not yet the consciousness of frogs or humans or ants or
6677200	6682200	anything, but it's panpsychic, but there is no aggregation
6682200	6683200	problem.
6683200	6686200	We're not trying to, this is Chalmers famous problem.
6686200	6690200	We're not trying to aggregate or combine the consciousness of all
6690200	6694200	the little tiny particles into the field and explain how we end up
6694200	6696200	with the experience of coffee stirring.
6696200	6699200	You know, how do you get coffee stirring on a bunch of little
6699200	6701200	conscious particles?
6701200	6706200	Well, or to make it even worse for Chalmers, how would you explain
6706200	6710200	how you now get the time scale of the buzzing fly as opposed to the
6710200	6714200	hearing like fly as opposed to the electron cloud fly out of your
6714200	6716200	conscious particles too, right?
6716200	6721200	Of course, time scale is never a problem for any quality of
6721200	6723200	consciousness there's ever seen in my life yet.
6723200	6727200	So they just don't comprehend that one.
6727200	6733200	So the deal is the reconstructive wave specification dynamics
6733200	6734200	takes care of this.
6734200	6739200	I'm specifying this field as a coffee cup and a buzzing fly.
6739200	6742200	I don't know, in other words, I now have a dynamics.
6742200	6746200	I have a mechanism to explain the conscious experience of the
6746200	6751200	external world in this panpsychic field that panpsychism in and
6751200	6752200	of itself does not have.
6752200	6753200	It has no such thing.
6753200	6757200	It fails miserably and drops dead on that.
6757200	6763200	So that's my panpsychic.
6763200	6767200	The only other thing I had that was, I just, I think it's worth
6767200	6771200	mentioning is this.
6771200	6779200	In this model, experience is not in solely within the brain.
6779200	6782200	Therefore, it cannot be stored solely in the brain.
6782200	6790200	Yes, the brain, the brain also as a reconstructive wave can resonate
6790200	6796200	in the same invariance law pattern as the coffee cup we saw,
6796200	6797200	as the coffee stirring.
6797200	6803200	And we can reconstruct or reintegrate in the old terminology
6803200	6805200	that experience.
6805200	6809200	So if you wreck the brain as a modulating device, it's going to
6809200	6813200	look like the memory is gone.
6813200	6817200	A memory stored in the brain is destroyed, but all you've done is
6817200	6823200	wreck the brain's ability to assume the complex modulation pattern
6823200	6828200	that is involved in perception of that coffee cup as we've been
6828200	6830200	discussing.
6830200	6834200	Now, obviously then, in other words, what we really are,
6834200	6838200	and if you took Berkson's theory of the temporal metaphysics,
6838200	6840200	we're four dimensional beings.
6840200	6845200	And we're elongated being of four dimensions in which all of that
6845200	6849200	experience, all the coffee stirrings you've ever seen,
6849200	6852200	are stored in detail.
6852200	6859200	Not in that image form necessarily, but it's all there.
6859200	6863200	And I can reconstruct it by re-assuming the right modulation
6863200	6866200	or resonance pattern.
6866200	6871200	And so obviously you've got a whole different theory of memory
6871200	6872200	implied.
6872200	6875200	I've done a lot of talking about, but also a whole different
6875200	6881200	theory of cognition, because we're using our experience,
6881200	6884200	our experience of coffee cups, our experience of cubes,
6884200	6890200	of rotating cubes, et cetera, to do cognition, to think.
6890200	6895200	And this is where Penrose went when he was talking about why
6895200	6901200	computers can't deal with consciousness.
6901200	6904200	And he started up, obviously, with the Gettle's proof as being
6904200	6909200	an indication or the problem basically showing this.
6909200	6913200	But along the way, in the shadows of the mind,
6913200	6916200	he started talking about what he saw as non-computational
6916200	6917200	thought.
6917200	6920200	And here's a little example I've got here of his non-computational
6920200	6921200	thought.
6921200	6926200	This would be a proof, a visual proof that he tried out of a
6926200	6928200	computation that does not stop.
6928200	6930200	It's called the halting problem.
6930200	6933200	How can I show that a computation does not stop?
6933200	6937200	It goes on infinitely and always ends up with the next logical
6937200	6938200	result?
6938200	6944200	Well, in this case, what he's doing is showing that a hexagonal
6944200	6948200	number and added to a previous hexagonal number always makes a
6948200	6949200	circle number.
6949200	6951200	And that never stops.
6951200	6958200	And so what he does is an example there.
6958200	6961200	You've got the number 19, which is a hexagonal number,
6961200	6964200	and he folds that into a three-sided cube.
6964200	6969200	And then he stacks that three-sided cube over the previous
6969200	6974200	cube, which was an 8, 2 by 2 by 2, a 2 by 2 by 2 cube.
6974200	6978200	And now he's got a 3 by 3 by 3 cube of 27.
6978200	6982200	He's going to go on and take another cubicle number, which is
6982200	6991200	37, fold it in three sides, stack it over the 3 by 3 by 3
6991200	6995200	cube, 4 by 4 by 4 cube, and now he's 64.
6995200	6998200	And obviously this can go on and on and on.
6998200	7001200	So notice what he's doing.
7001200	7002200	It's very visual.
7002200	7007200	He's folding each hexagonal number into a three-sided cube.
7007200	7012200	He's stacking the cube always over the next to make an ever,
7012200	7014200	ever larger cube.
7014200	7017200	So this is a dynamic transformation.
7017200	7019200	Hope I don't lose my slide.
7019200	7020200	Yeah, over time.
7020200	7025200	It requires a mind that's in indivisible flow, not state after
7025200	7028200	state after state, where each previous state disappears as the
7028200	7031200	next one comes, which is the essence of the computer model.
7031200	7034200	You have to have this invisible flow or continuity else the
7034200	7040200	globality of this transformation of continuous folding and
7040200	7042200	stacking cannot be perceived.
7042200	7046200	And the invariance across this transformation, namely always a
7046200	7050200	three-sided cube, always ultimately a stacked cube,
7050200	7053200	the variance can't be registered.
7053200	7058200	So Penrose was really pointing to the essence of invariance laws
7058200	7060200	as being the essence of proofs.
7060200	7068200	And I need this continuous, indivisible transformation.
7068200	7072200	Him being a complete mathematician and totally stuck in the
7072200	7075200	classic metaphysics didn't realize what he's saying.
7075200	7081200	He never has grasped the implications of non-competitional
7081200	7082200	thought.
7082200	7086200	And of course he was trashed heavily in behavioral and brain
7086200	7089200	sciences journal when he did a process of this book.
7089200	7090200	They couldn't stand it.
7090200	7093200	But this is what he was pointing to.
7093200	7096200	This is the essence of true cognition.
7096200	7098200	This is what you have to have.
7098200	7103200	And this is why a computer and AI is never going to equal human
7103200	7104200	thought.
7104200	7109200	Because again, the intrinsic model of time is the classic
7109200	7110200	metaphysics.
7110200	7112200	The discrete instant state of time.
7113200	7117200	No matter how concrete you look at the computer itself with all
7117200	7124200	of its electrical flows and wires, et cetera, the essence of the
7124200	7126200	machine is an abstraction.
7126200	7128200	It's a logical model.
7128200	7133200	It can be carried out on an abacus or a registered machine with
7133200	7136200	beans and shoeboxes as long as you're carrying out the abstract
7136200	7137200	operations.
7137200	7141200	And the abstract operations are state after state after state
7141200	7142200	in discrete time.
7142200	7148200	So inherently, intrinsically, it cannot do this type of thought.
7148200	7151200	And you're never going to get AI.
7151200	7156200	And if you notice, this is actually already simply a special
7156200	7160200	case of the problem of common sense of knowledge, which AI
7160200	7162200	can't deal with either.
7162200	7164200	It's his bet noir, common sense.
7164200	7169200	Yes, there's working on Lacrune trying heavily to solve it in
7169200	7172200	terms of neural net architecture.
7172200	7177200	But neural nets are, again, simply instantiations of
7177200	7179200	Turing machines.
7179200	7181200	So they're faced with this problem.
7181200	7184200	This is just another common sense of knowledge problem.
7184200	7188200	I mean, you can imagine myself, I'm going to build a mousetrap or
7188200	7191200	even a lawn mower, and I got to stack a whole bunch of stuff on
7191200	7194200	top of each other and make a big cube.
7195200	7200200	So I think that's the main thing I wanted to say.
7200200	7203200	Yeah, notice I have a little note here.
7203200	7207200	Penrose identified this thought as demanding consciousness.
7207200	7212200	But again, in other words, he's stuck in a classic metaphysics
7212200	7215200	and doesn't understand that consciousness and pleasantness
7215200	7220200	will flow as time at primary memory.
7221200	7226200	This is just an example of the same thing.
7226200	7230200	Piaget is just replete with this.
7230200	7234200	I mean, if Penrose actually understood the literature of
7234200	7237200	developmental psychology and cognitive psychology that Piaget
7237200	7240200	represents, he would probably be ashamed to do what he had said.
7240200	7244200	But here's another simple example.
7244200	7248200	Piaget is taking children age three to seven.
7248200	7249200	He's got a tunnel there.
7249200	7252200	He moves those little colored beads into the tunnel,
7252200	7254200	and then he rotates the tunnel.
7254200	7256200	There's a halter, and then he asks the child,
7256200	7258200	well, what order will it come out now?
7258200	7262200	And you can see if I do a semi-rotation, 180 degrees,
7262200	7264200	the order is going to be reversed.
7264200	7268200	I'm going to go in as ABC, but I'm going to come out as CBA.
7268200	7272200	If I do a full rotation, I'm going to keep the order the same, right?
7272200	7275200	I'm going to come out again as ABC.
7275200	7280200	But three times, three half turns, I'm going to invert the order.
7280200	7285200	And if I ask seven times, what's the order going to be?
7285200	7290200	Well, if I know the rule by this time that the order changes,
7290200	7292200	odd number of turns, the order reverses.
7292200	7296200	Even number of turns, the order is going to be the same as it went in.
7296200	7298200	I can always tell you, 19.
7298200	7302200	Okay, well, it's going to be, the order is going to reverse, right?
7302200	7307200	It takes the children three to seven years to figure this out,
7307200	7309200	this odd even rule.
7309200	7314200	And in the course of it, what they do is they visualize,
7314200	7316200	just like Penrose and his cubes,
7316200	7320200	they visualize one half rotation, one semi-rotation.
7320200	7321200	What will happen then?
7321200	7322200	What if I do it again?
7322200	7324200	What if I do it three times?
7324200	7327200	Okay, it's going to reverse.
7327200	7332200	And they'll get to a point where they can maybe visualize four semi-rotations,
7332200	7336200	but ask, well, what will happen on number five?
7336200	7337200	They can't.
7337200	7339200	They flake out.
7339200	7340200	They can't visualize it.
7340200	7345200	They can't keep the train of visualization going anymore.
7345200	7348200	So ultimately they come to a point where they can say,
7348200	7350200	what's body seven?
7350200	7353200	Oh, yeah.
7353200	7355200	Odd number of turns, it's going to reverse.
7356200	7360200	And this all comes down to what he describes as concrete operations,
7360200	7362200	which develop over three to seven years.
7362200	7364200	And here's this interesting quote.
7364200	7366200	He says, well, operations, one might say,
7366200	7368200	are nothing more than articulated intuitions,
7368200	7371200	when they're adaptable and completely reversible,
7371200	7373200	since they are emptied of their visual content
7373200	7376200	and survive as pure intention.
7376200	7379200	In other words, operations come into being in their pure state
7379200	7382200	when there's skimethization.
7382200	7384200	So notice that.
7385200	7391200	In essence, the imagery, the dynamic transformation of imagery
7391200	7394200	is absolutely essential in the course of development,
7394200	7397200	exactly like Penrose was pointing to.
7397200	7400200	It's just that as you do it enough,
7400200	7406200	the images almost disappear in terms of very schematized form.
7406200	7409200	And so he says, instead of demanding an actual representation,
7409200	7412200	each inversion will be conceived as a potential representation,
7412200	7415200	like the outline for an experiment to be performed,
7415200	7417200	which is not useful to follow to the letter,
7417200	7419200	even in the form of performing it mentally.
7419200	7424200	So this is really the essence of Piaget's concrete operations
7424200	7428200	or non-computational thought to put it in Penrose's term,
7428200	7431200	which he didn't under the novel Piaget.
7431200	7434200	In other words, you need Berkson's device
7434200	7436200	to support this kind of thought.
7436200	7441200	Again, this is just a common sense knowledge problem.
7442200	7446200	I mean, this is a specific problem,
7446200	7452200	but is this an example of the kind of, I mean,
7452200	7456200	called a thought process, the kind of problem solving
7456200	7460200	that a computer would find difficult to do at this point?
7460200	7462200	Yeah.
7462200	7469200	Common sense knowledge is the essence of the problem.
7469200	7474200	I mean, they've tried to simulate this stuff with neural nets,
7474200	7478200	the developmental series, but people have looked at it
7478200	7481200	and says, well, what's going on in the neural net weight,
7481200	7484200	how the weight changes, nothing to do with how children
7484200	7486200	actually develop.
7486200	7490200	But when I say common sense knowledge problems,
7490200	7497200	my metaphor, my example I like is creating a mousetrap
7497200	7500200	out of arbitrary components.
7500200	7504200	Where I should have put my picture in here.
7504200	7507200	But you imagine you have a little cardboard box
7507200	7510200	and you have a pencil and rubber bands and paper clips
7510200	7513200	and a piece of cheese and some strings and some toothpicks.
7513200	7518200	And I actually ran across this when I was in my teens,
7518200	7520200	it was in Reader's Digest.
7520200	7522200	It was a creativity test for engineers.
7522200	7525200	Well, here's this pile of stuff, can you make a mousetrap?
7525200	7526200	OK.
7526200	7529200	And you can visualize making a mousetrap with a,
7529200	7533200	imagine a box with, you got the pencil drawn back.
7533200	7536200	You've got rubber band outside the box
7536200	7538200	and you have a little hole.
7538200	7540200	The pencil goes through and you can draw the pencil back
7540200	7544200	and maybe you put the toothpick lodged in a little groove
7544200	7548200	in the pencil so that the pencil sticks there.
7548200	7553200	The pencil would be in the inside of the box,
7553200	7557200	holding the pencil and there's a string to the cheese
7557200	7559200	and the mouse pulls the string, pulls the pencil out
7559200	7561200	and sticks himself with the pencil.
7561200	7562200	OK.
7562200	7564200	The pencil flies and hits the mouse.
7564200	7566200	In other words, it's a crossbow trap.
7566200	7568200	It's analogous to a crossbow.
7568200	7569200	OK.
7569200	7570200	Get the picture.
7570200	7572200	I could make, if I got a razor blade,
7572200	7574200	I stick the razor blade into the pencil
7574200	7577200	and I prop the razor blade up in a corner
7577200	7580200	and prop it up with a pencil and maybe rubber bands
7580200	7581200	pulling it down.
7581200	7585200	Give myself some staples to work with.
7585200	7589200	So there's force on the pencil.
7589200	7591200	The mouse has got to be a fairly strong mouse
7591200	7595200	with that trap to pull the razor.
7595200	7597200	It all depends.
7597200	7601200	People whip up these traps all the time.
7601200	7602200	Gotcha.
7602200	7604200	So if you're, yeah.
7604200	7607200	Maybe you have the stapler falling on the mouse.
7607200	7608200	I don't know.
7609200	7610200	This is the common.
7610200	7611200	OK.
7611200	7616200	The problem is that there's no finite set of features
7616200	7620200	that you could put in the database that a machine could use
7620200	7625200	because the features are emerging with the transformation.
7625200	7628200	The rigidity of the pencil and the sharpness and the fact
7628200	7631200	or the fact that I could lodge it in the box corner.
7631200	7636200	The box corner is a nice place to lodge a pencil for the axe.
7636200	7639200	All these things are all these features of the pencil
7639200	7643200	or the functions emerge with the transformation
7643200	7647200	that you're the analogy transformation.
7647200	7648200	You're sort of visualizing.
7648200	7651200	I can make it into a crossbow or I could make it
7651200	7655200	into a giant boulder trap like that destroys Wiley Coyote
7655200	7657200	or something like that.
7657200	7660200	OK.
7660200	7667200	So it becomes a massive problem of representation,
7667200	7669200	excuse me, of the features of objects
7669200	7673200	because there's no finite list, excuse me,
7673200	7677200	all the transformations that are necessary, et cetera.
7677200	7679200	That's the common sense knowledge problem.
7679200	7681200	And you can see why I'm saying, well, just
7681200	7686200	tunnel rotation or stacking cubes of one another
7686200	7690200	is just part of the same kind of problem, the same thought
7690200	7691200	process.
7691200	7692200	Cool.
7692200	7693200	And yes.
7693200	7695200	This is your last slide, right?
7695200	7696200	Yeah.
7696200	7697200	I do believe.
7697200	7699200	If you have time, I have one more.
7699200	7700200	Oh, one more.
7700200	7701200	Yeah.
7701200	7706200	But I thought that would be the one we, part two,
7706200	7709200	if we ever do one, we'll go into relativity
7709200	7715200	because that's another piece of the story of, excuse me,
7716200	7717200	getting hit in the horse.
7721200	7723200	This is another piece of the story that was interesting
7723200	7726200	because I remember Berkson's argument
7726200	7728200	with Einstein and relativity.
7728200	7734200	And in that time I had with Shaw,
7734200	7739200	I was trying to reconcile Berkson to relativity
7739200	7741200	because Berkson believes in becoming,
7741200	7743200	the dynamic transformation of the universe
7743200	7745200	is always evolving and coming.
7745200	7749200	But you have that static block model of space time
7749200	7752200	where everything's laid out in one big block
7752200	7754200	because supposedly there's no simultaneity.
7754200	7759200	Therefore, there's no plane that you can take through that block
7759200	7764200	that represents a universal present across the entire block,
7764200	7769200	a present instance that then grows as the block grows.
7770200	7774200	Because I've destroyed simultaneity, supposedly.
7774200	7777200	And I was trying to reconcile that
7777200	7780200	and I found this article by Millik Kapek
7780200	7787200	where he tries to show that the Minkowski formula
7790200	7793200	for the space time manifold or matrix,
7793200	7798200	the Minkowski space time, actually preserves becoming.
7798200	7802200	And I thought that was cool and I wrote this paper up
7802200	7806200	because then it seemed like, okay, Berkson's got to be coming
7806200	7809200	and this interpretation says there's at least some becoming
7809200	7814200	in the static block universe, there's got to be some becoming.
7814200	7817200	And that seems to be the point of reconciliation.
7817200	7820200	Shaw thought that was cool and he gave it to Gibson
7820200	7822200	who was there at the time.
7822200	7827200	And Gibson read the article and said,
7827200	7830200	well, yeah, scribbled on the top half.
7830200	7833200	Yeah, it's good to take big thoughts, big questions,
7833200	7835200	but you should look at other things.
7835200	7839200	He said, okay, he doesn't like that resolution.
7839200	7843200	And the next day he was giving his talk at the University of Minnesota
7843200	7848200	and he comes up with a statement out of the blue,
7848200	7851200	to anyone there other than someone who happened
7851200	7854200	to have written that particular paper, namely me.
7854200	7857200	So I'm sitting there and I'm probably the only one who knew what he was saying,
7857200	7859200	but this is the quote, he says,
7859200	7862200	physicists must lead us when they say there is no simultaneity.
7862200	7865200	When the camera pans to the hero and tied to the rails
7865200	7869200	and then to the hero rushing to the rescue on his horse,
7869200	7872200	these events are simultaneous.
7872200	7876200	I guess we should add the train in to speed into the hero.
7876200	7882200	So, and I recognized right away another one of those,
7882200	7886200	I know this is, he's siding with Berkson.
7886200	7890200	He's siding with Berkson against Berkson's argument against Einstein,
7890200	7892200	because these are multiple, what's called multiple,
7892200	7899200	I call multiple simultaneous flows that cannot be relativized.
7899200	7901200	And that's another whole topic.
7901200	7903200	I don't know if you want to share that.
7903200	7905200	I think it would be interesting to go into, you know,
7905200	7910200	where this absolutely destroys Einstein
7910200	7913200	and very concretely and very easily.
7913200	7922200	And why relativity in its current interpreted form,
7922200	7924200	interpreted interpretational form,
7924200	7927200	that is where the twin paradox is held to be true,
7927200	7929200	it's got to be ditched.
7929200	7931200	And so, but that's another.
7931200	7932200	Okay, yeah.
7932200	7933200	That's another topic.
7933200	7935200	Already a lot we've covered so far.
7935200	7938200	Can you, this is, this one's your last one, right?
7939200	7942200	I hope so.
7942200	7944200	I have a number of questions.
7944200	7947200	I'd love if, if you still have time,
7947200	7950200	I'd love to just cover up on a couple of things.
7950200	7952200	I guess the first thing,
7952200	7956200	I'm going to tackle this from different perspectives,
7956200	7961200	but taking a step back and thinking about Berkson a little bit.
7961200	7967200	One of the things I think is interesting is,
7968200	7973200	and I'm trying to make a comparison here with,
7973200	7977200	I think a lot about ancient symbols and semiotics generally,
7977200	7982200	but are you familiar with the Yin Yang symbol, the Tai Chi two?
7982200	7984200	Are you familiar with that symbol?
7984200	7988200	It's like two, a white half and a black half.
7988200	7989200	Oh yeah.
7989200	7991200	And the pace, the pace is in between.
7991200	7994200	Well, one thing I think is very interesting about Berkson is,
7994200	8001200	he's spoken about as like a poetic philosopher oftentimes.
8001200	8005200	And of course the debate we just talked at the beginning about
8005200	8010200	between him and Einstein seems to be if there are two halves
8010200	8012200	of the same coin, let's say,
8012200	8018200	Berkson would be the intuitive Einstein representing rationality.
8018200	8021200	Would you say that's a fair kind of,
8021200	8025200	that's a very broad kind of statement, but that is where they kind of...
8025200	8031200	Well, the other way, equivalently the classic metaphysics,
8031200	8035200	classic spatial metaphysical space and time versus the temporal metaphysics.
8035200	8038200	Sure, yeah, you can split it both ways.
8038200	8042200	Which incorporates the latter incorporating intuition,
8042200	8044200	which is another whole topic.
8044200	8046200	Yeah, intuition was a big,
8046200	8050200	intuition was a huge part of Berkson's framework
8050200	8051200	and ideology.
8051200	8055200	But so I bring up the Yang-Yang symbol because the way I perceive it's quite interesting
8055200	8058200	because Berkson's usually portrayed as this poet.
8058200	8061200	And that's part of the reason why he spoke, you know,
8061200	8066200	he spoke and wrote in sort of beautiful language, flowery language.
8066200	8074200	It was kind of tough sometimes, I think, to sort of provide boundaries
8074200	8079200	or like specify exactly where he stood on certain issues perhaps.
8079200	8082200	For other people, for other people that read Berkson.
8082200	8085200	I bring up the Yang-Yang symbol because it's funny,
8085200	8089200	because like within Berkson, that intuitive sense,
8089200	8093200	what you've brought here is a very technical framework.
8093200	8099200	And it's almost like you're bringing in the rationality within Berkson's poetry.
8099200	8101200	Does that make any sense?
8101200	8107200	Does that congeal it all to your, the way you see it?
8108200	8118200	I could see it in a certain way, but I tend to look at it as,
8118200	8122200	I'm just getting even more visual and more concrete than Berkson did.
8122200	8124200	No, I mean, I agree.
8124200	8130200	I think you are getting more concrete because Berkson was, you know, it's funny.
8130200	8132200	He didn't have the language.
8132200	8134200	He didn't have any particular stuff earlier.
8134200	8138200	I'm doing this in a PowerPoint medium with all kinds of stuff.
8138200	8143200	I mean, he, I mean, one of the, one of the reasons it kind of,
8143200	8148200	I ended up doing this, whatever number I'm at, 75 or whatever of these things is,
8148200	8151200	I mean, I published a lot in academic world,
8151200	8155200	but you can't express all the stuff there is,
8155200	8161200	and as dynamically and as neatly in articles as you can in this medium.
8162200	8170200	It's, I mean, I think this was incredibly freeing up powerful medium.
8170200	8174200	I mean, obviously, I'm, you know, I'm sure people look at me and think I'm,
8174200	8177200	I'm in a stone age on it, but because, you know, even,
8177200	8183200	I know even compared to you, I'm in a stone age, but, but, but it's,
8183200	8187200	so some of that, some of it is this medium.
8187200	8192200	When, when you, I guess if you looked at my academic articles,
8192200	8197200	I would appear a little, I probably wouldn't be quite as,
8201200	8205200	obviously you're going only put so many pictures in an academic article,
8205200	8210200	and you have to, well, and I tend to get a little more concrete than Brugton
8210200	8214200	and those things, but there sure seems to be a whole lot of people
8214200	8215200	that you don't understand me.
8215200	8219200	So I don't, I don't, like I said, it's very, it's very Zen.
8219200	8228200	It's very, you have to have a certain intuition of soul in my mind to resonate to this stuff.
8229200	8230200	Yeah.
8230200	8232200	And I agree.
8232200	8239200	I mean, the, and it actually speaks to perhaps a sub point of what Berkson was getting at
8239200	8243200	in terms of duration with, and this is something I do.
8243200	8248200	If you're, if we're going to talk about both creators of content on, on YouTube
8248200	8252200	and another, you're another place, of course, you're, you're written work.
8253200	8260200	I've always found showing things in motion to be, to have things,
8260200	8263200	to explain things better than static imagery.
8263200	8268200	So it's funny when you're showing your off your GIFs or GIFs on these slides
8268200	8270200	and you show the stirring coffee cup.
8271200	8276200	And you can kind of, I think, understand where Berkson was coming from,
8277200	8284200	because would it be fair to say he'd argue most of science, the cutting edge physics,
8284200	8292200	let's say, focuses a lot on the spatial component and doesn't give the temporal dimension,
8292200	8294200	it's fair to do or it's fair emphasis.
8294200	8299200	And actually, as far as the limited physics, I know it's funny.
8299200	8308200	Many, most, not probably not all equations can be are agnostic to the direction of time
8308200	8311200	can be done backwards and forwards.
8313200	8314200	That's the bare minimum.
8314200	8315200	I know.
8315200	8316200	I think, I think that's the case.
8316200	8326200	But of course, the temporal component is probably underappreciated or not.
8326200	8330200	Oh, it's just absolutely, yeah.
8331200	8337200	There's so many, like, there's so many subject matters where the temporal,
8338200	8342200	the problem of time is just simply just not grass.
8342200	8347200	I mean, like I said, when you look at the whole literature on the hard problem,
8349200	8354200	you just don't see any understanding of the problem of time, period.
8355200	8361200	You know, like just as I noted, all the examples of qualia are probably like the redness of the sunset,
8361200	8363200	the taste of the qualifier.
8363200	8367200	So it's all fairly stacked, you know, qualities of motion,
8368200	8373200	like the gently waving curtains of ballet hardcasts or the patients shifting slowly.
8373200	8378200	And there seems to look, okay, that's just not even grasped or understood.
8378200	8379200	And notice that it's all,
8381200	8383200	if I made the field make this point,
8383200	8392200	there's all dynamically changing qualities of form that say, hey, the whole image is form.
8393200	8398200	And so your problem is how do you see the external image,
8398200	8401200	the world, the image of the world out there externally,
8401200	8407200	the coffee cup and changing with this in front of this gently waving curtains.
8407200	8409200	That's the problem.
8409200	8417200	See, it's because of that failure of the grasp of the time and all of all these dynamic forms and change
8418200	8423200	that when you say, oh, I've got a, I've got a model of how you see the image of the world out there.
8423200	8426200	They don't even know that that's a solution to the hard problem.
8426200	8430200	They don't even, it doesn't even dawn on them that that's a solution.
8430200	8434200	But physics, same problem.
8438200	8442200	The fact that they think that they can get away with
8443200	8450200	a completely discreet state model of time and capture what's actually going on
8450200	8455200	in this, in the dynamically transforming matter of field is endemic to them.
8455200	8460200	And on nice examples of it aren't coming to mind at this point.
8460200	8461200	That's fine.
8461200	8462200	Yeah.
8462200	8464200	But they're, how do you think this model?
8464200	8465200	Sure.
8465200	8467200	How do you think, how do you think this model?
8467200	8468200	Oh, sorry.
8468200	8469200	Yeah.
8469200	8476200	The, and also just to be clear for the audience, I don't believe Berkson, he didn't, he didn't
8476200	8479200	create the term holographic theory of mind, right?
8479200	8480200	You are.
8480200	8481200	No.
8481200	8482200	Yeah.
8482200	8484200	Like I said, he was interpreting Berkson.
8484200	8486200	It wasn't until 1947.
8486200	8488200	So yeah, I guess it was after his death.
8488200	8489200	I represent this.
8489200	8494200	Let's take Berkson and, and upgrade him into the, how, how he probably would have talked
8494200	8496200	that he knew about photography.
8496200	8497200	Yeah.
8497200	8505200	Can you intuit how, how does this model help explain qualia?
8505200	8517200	Well, as I said, the transformation of the field is indivisible.
8517200	8519200	Each instant permeates the next.
8519200	8522200	It's already a qualitative transformation.
8522200	8530200	So when you're specifying the brain is specifying the gently waving curtains, it's specifying
8530200	8537200	the qualitative transformation of that field at a certain scale of time.
8537200	8543200	Color itself is, is, is a time phenomenon.
8543200	8549200	It's a, it's a, it's a certain vibration, vibration of a magnet electromagnetic field
8549200	8550200	over time.
8550200	8556200	That again, you're putting this, like Berkson noted, you know, if you take one second of
8556200	8564200	red light and spread it out wave by wave by wave, such just that you could count in the
8564200	8568200	normal amount of time people can distinguish events, you know, you've got 25,000 years
8568200	8574200	that would require to count each wave of one second of red light for 400 billions of vibrations.
8574200	8581200	But in essence, we're compressing the, you know, now notice when you spread it all out,
8581200	8587200	it's almost, almost back to my, my cubes of space.
8587200	8594200	It's almost one giant big pile of cubes homogeneous, you know, no quality.
8594200	8601200	But now when you're specifying that color, it's compressed into a, you know, one second
8601200	8603200	of red light is now, you know, that's what we see.
8603200	8605200	We don't see 25,000 waves.
8605200	8610200	You see this, you know, glob of color of pulsating red.
8610200	8611200	Okay.
8611200	8617200	It's, it's, it's this, it's this huge amount of time being compressed by our perception
8617200	8619200	and by the brain processes.
8619200	8627200	So it's not, now it's becoming more, it's, it's now obviously more qualitative, you know,
8627200	8632200	perceptually than that huge spread out field as it would look at virtually what I call
8632200	8635200	the null scale of time.
8635200	8641200	But it's, but that, but again, the null scale of time is, it's an abstract limit.
8641200	8648200	It never becomes the homogeneous space instant after instant of the classic metaphysics.
8648200	8656200	So all quality, all qualia is a function of time and motion.
8656200	8663200	And at a scale where there's buzzing flies, Aaron flies, brown flies versus red flies
8663200	8669200	versus white flies versus gently waving curtains versus violently waving curtains.
8669200	8670200	Sure.
8670200	8678200	And I'm going to jump around a lot here, but if we're thinking about the, say the double
8678200	8685200	slit experiment, does this, well, I mean, this is a theory of every sort of a theory
8685200	8691200	of everything or theory, at least our state, our perception of things.
8691200	8694200	Does this relate to the double slit experiment in some way?
8694200	8701200	And if so, how?
8701200	8709200	I'm sure it does, but I, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't even know how to answer
8709200	8710200	that question.
8710200	8714200	I know it's a very broad question, but I make, I make connections here between,
8714200	8720200	obviously the double slit is, you know, particles.
8720200	8722200	Oh, sorry.
8722200	8728200	There seems to be a connection between at least the wave particle duality, the observation
8728200	8729200	of that.
8729200	8732200	So our measurement of that.
8732200	8738200	And then it's, it's a resultant effect on, you know, the pattern that's found on the
8738200	8739200	screen, right?
8739200	8747200	So this seemingly, you know, so this theory would have to at least incorporate that, or
8747200	8752200	at least I don't have to explain it per se, but it has to be at least perhaps consistent
8752200	8757200	with that observation.
8757200	8762200	Yeah, I'm drawing.
8762200	8767200	It's like, it's a giant disc loaded to my head that I can't do it right now.
8767200	8771200	Yeah, we just, this is a long conversation.
8771200	8778200	But I think that there is probably a connection here if you were trying to make the case.
8778200	8779200	Yeah.
8779200	8780200	Yeah.
8780200	8786200	I, you know, and I don't think, I mean, I've looked a lot at the quantum theory of them.
8786200	8793200	I've done stuff at it, you know, videos on it, like I noted, you know, about, but I,
8793200	8800200	you know, I would say that making that final link that you're asked actually asking for
8800200	8808200	that resolution, that's kind of a physics problem, more so than my problem.
8808200	8811200	I can't, I can't, I can't do it.
8811200	8813200	But yeah, sure.
8813200	8817200	It's a good question, but yeah, don't don't get the answer for me.
8817200	8818200	No, absolutely.
8818200	8820200	I understand that's something to consider for the future.
8820200	8827200	The other thing I'd say or question I have is it's sort of coming back full circle to
8827200	8831200	well, sort of the top of our conversation.
8831200	8837200	And some of my favorite videos of yours on your channel actually were the Zen related
8837200	8840200	Zen Buddhism and how it relates to this theory.
8840200	8845200	I think you have two, maybe more related.
8845200	8853200	I did one on Zen number 24 and I did one on Zen and the art of mule cycle maintenance.
8853200	8857200	Yes, I think those are, those are my, those are some of my favorite videos of yours.
8857200	8866200	So I wonder if, and this is, you know, speculative or let's say thinking out loud kind of territory.
8866200	8877200	Do you think there's any relationship between the mind and meditation and perhaps the process
8877200	8885200	of quieting those potential say waves or that modulated reconstructive wave as you put it.
8885200	8894200	Is there some perhaps relationship between that and the, the sense of say oneness, say
8894200	8899200	with the world or the outside, what's outside the brain?
8899200	8906200	Yeah, when you go, I think, I think I kind of get the Zen Satori experience.
8906200	8913200	When you go to the, in the context of Berkson framework, but when you go to meditation.
8913200	8922200	Yeah, that's just another whole subject matter what's actually going on there.
8922200	8932200	Obviously the, the Berkson framework, which that says we're a four dimensional being to be were embedded in this
8932200	8942200	holographic field in which we have no actual difference distinction from lays a framework for lots of things that can happen in meditation.
8942200	8955200	You know, but I just haven't really gone into that whole subject of how meditation or the brain waves and how it's operating.
8955200	8958200	And I don't, I just haven't gotten into it.
8958200	8963200	Actually, I don't think there's all that much understood really to go into it.
8963200	8976200	I mean, I know you have people like, you know, the biology of beef and these kinds of books that are written, but no, I'm, I'm just not.
8976200	8983200	I'm just not, it's just, it's just a bridge too far for me to walk over.
8983200	8984200	Yep.
8985200	9002200	I'll say also, I'm jumping around a lot here, but one of the, one of the interesting videos on your channel as well deals with the holographic theory of mind and how it relates to a holographic principle more broadly.
9002200	9010200	And what I was surprised by was how those two things are actually, in your opinion, not compatible.
9010200	9011200	Right.
9011200	9016200	Yeah. Can you, can you talk about that a little bit?
9016200	9017200	Hmm.
9017200	9020200	I can.
9020200	9022200	Probably wouldn't, wouldn't.
9022200	9024200	Pictures would have been good, but.
9024200	9025200	What's up?
9025200	9039200	See, Susskin, I mean, I looked at Susskin's stuff on it and, you know, they're, they're trying to
9039200	9052200	describe the hologram as being on a two-dimensional surface, some, somewhere, basically digital, like bits.
9052200	9053200	Okay.
9053200	9065200	So volume, you know, and they're expressing, we can express all the information of the, in the universe, volume wise, in terms of bits on a two-dimensional surface.
9065200	9066200	Right.
9066200	9084200	First of all, I have major problem with their bits because, as I noted to you before, bits are a massive abstraction that don't exist except over some sort of concrete embodiment.
9084200	9091200	It's like, you know, to represent a bit, it takes tons of transistors on a breadboard.
9091200	9095200	It takes magnetic cores and more stone age philosophy.
9095200	9104200	Something is very concretely, you know, doing voltage changes or whatever to represent those.
9104200	9107200	And we're looking at it and say, ah, that's a bit.
9107200	9113200	Well, what is that on a surface of a black hole for God's sakes?
9113200	9122200	What is, what is, what is your bit other than highly imaginary piece of information stuck mentally on your black hole?
9122200	9126200	I mean, you know, it's, it's not a breadboard.
9126200	9133200	It's not a, it's, it's not a, oh, we can see even worse if you look at Cubis.
9133200	9135200	It's even worse.
9135200	9145200	You know, now you have LC circuits that are, you know, with resistors and capacitors that are representing the qubit.
9145200	9150200	I mean, like with Joseph, Joseph, Josephus and junctions.
9150200	9153200	I mean, come on, you know, that's your bit.
9153200	9154200	That's your qubit.
9154200	9155200	It's on a black hole.
9155200	9159200	What, you know, not that there's all kinds of instantiations of Cubis, but they're all worse.
9159200	9161200	But that's number one.
9161200	9166200	Number two, what, what the heck is the reconstructive wave?
9166200	9175200	What is the source of the reconstructive wave that's beaming through your two-dimensional surface to project the three-dimensional world?
9175200	9176200	Okay.
9176200	9187200	Four, and then problem C, where, how do you introduce time into this thing when you have a whole series of flashes of your reconstructive wave?
9187200	9192200	Do you have projection after projection after projection to create the coffee stirring?
9192200	9199200	Oh, how is these bits, how are they suddenly becoming concrete coffee cups with liquid in them?
9199200	9201200	Stirring, rotating.
9201200	9202200	Come on.
9202200	9207200	I mean, you know, when you, when you look at the conception, it's ludicrous.
9207200	9214200	So it does, it is not Bergson's conception of a holographic field.
9214200	9219200	Suskins 2D hologram.
9219200	9221200	Sorry, but not the same thing.
9221200	9226200	Not even, and not even worth looking at.
9226200	9228200	See, you got me in my head.
9228200	9230200	No, that's okay.
9230200	9231200	I mean, you're passionate about it.
9231200	9232200	I get it.
9232200	9239200	It's something that I have to do a lot more research on and try to understand better myself.
9239200	9250200	So the idea that they're going to use the holographic principle is somehow, somehow it's got something to do with mind and consciousness and holographic theory is just, just insane.
9250200	9252200	Gotcha.
9252200	9254200	I just lost my, my light.
9254200	9256200	So we're coming up on time.
9256200	9267200	The question, like what question I would say, one of the last questions I want to ask you is, how is this, this theory Bergson in general?
9267200	9272200	I mean, you've been a fan of Bergson's for decades now.
9272200	9275200	How is this conception?
9275200	9284200	How does this influence your day to day life or your moment to moment existence, if it does at all?
9284200	9313200	Well, if I were to say spiritually, it would, it would, it would say, hey, I for one think that science, physics, psychology, cognitive science, given Bergson's framework absolutely backs the spiritual vision of man.
9314200	9324200	The Zen vision, if nothing more, but probably also the Hindu vision of what our actual capabilities are.
9324200	9342200	I mean, when I say Hindu vision, I'm thinking of people like saints like Ananda Maima, you know, or Yogananda that could read anyone's thoughts or, or could.
9343200	9351200	You know, Ananda Maima supposedly stopped the train engine with a wheel spinning on a train platform.
9351200	9371200	But that's another, in other words, I think that there's no conflict between science and this whole notion that's permeating people's minds right now that neuroscience says we're just human robot forms with no spiritual component whatsoever.
9372200	9386200	It is utterly destroyed by Bergson and gives us a very solid grounding in science and our own mystical experience that supports it.
9386200	9393200	So I guess bottom line from, from that perspective, Bergson is a great comfort.
9393200	9409200	And if people want to shed the transhumanist vision of where they were, where they were, the idea where we're all getting nice bunch of chips, because it's just all we really are anyhow, and just become enhanced robots.
9409200	9427200	And also there is no, there's no God, there's no karmic laws and etc. etc. that they'll get into Bergson and you can, and you'll see quickly how just shallow and superficial and ununderstanding they, you know, they actually are.
9427200	9444200	They don't include people like Sam Harris or Daniel Dennett, etc. These are, these people are in my mind are extremely badly misled because they extremely do not understand the problem of consciousness and time.
9444200	9462200	That's one thing. After that, it's been a giant pain because, because I never thought that after 50, what are we 50 years that this particular conception would be so buried yet.
9462200	9474200	It's, it's buried in cognitive science that no one wants to look at. It's, it's buried in memory theories, buried in perception theory. It's buried by the Gessonians for Christ's sakes. They won't even look at it.
9474200	9489200	It's buried by the Bergsonians for that matter. Even, even Bergsonian philosophers, who can't deal with it. I guess, feel it. They don't want to deal with it. Oh, it's too, too much. Can't deal with that.
9489200	9501200	Well, it's become, it's become a frustrating pain. And I feel like my life's mission has been a bust. So I feel right now, I'm just telling you that's true. It's been a good, it was a good try.
9501200	9510200	Maybe someone later will come along and take it. Because right now, to me, it's, it's, it's completely being ignored.
9510200	9527200	Yeah. Well, I'm glad I, you know, it's your life's passion or part of your life's passion. And you've, you've picked up the torch. It sounds, it seems like from Bergson on this, and try to keep his ideas alive. So
9528200	9540200	Yeah, well, you know, I'm a little different from Bergson in that respect. I mean, he, he watched himself be buried, you know. Along came Skinner and his, and his rats.
9540200	9541200	Sure.
9541200	9562200	And after that, the computer model of mine, I mean, the complete antithesis, the absolute computer being the absolute embodiment of the classic metaphysics, the realization almost the wet dream realization of how we can instantiate the classic metaphysics as quote mind.
9563200	9576200	I mean, he, he, he watched that. He didn't see the computer thing coming, I'm sure, but I got to live through that one. Yeah, it's still there.
9576200	9588200	All right, Steve, is there anything else? Anything you want to leave us on? Tie this thing up in a bow? Where can our viewers, how can people learn more about you and your work in Bergson?
9588200	9589200	Well, yeah.
9591200	9596200	My I have a little website. It's Steven E Robbins.com STPHN.
9596200	9598200	I'll put it below. Yeah.
9598200	9625200	That's all it's got all my articles on it. It's got a link to the, the videos, the videos I think is the same channel, I think, Steven, Steven, Steven, Steven E Robbins, I'd have to flip out and look at it, but
9628200	9633200	Yeah, so yeah, I'm, I have stuff there that people can look at.
9633200	9634200	Yes, you do. You have your website.
9634200	9640200	It's probably like 20, it's probably like 20 academic articles, you know, yeah, academic journals.
9640200	9654200	They're all it's all linkable. I'll link in the description below your website, your YouTube channel. And I, I think I might parse out a couple of my favorite of your favorite videos of yours to share with with my audience.
9654200	9657200	So Steve, I want to say thank you so much for your time.
9657200	9671200	It's been great energy. This has been fun is so much to think about and kind of let's steal in my brain to try to make this all congeal. But thanks again, and this has been a wonderful time, wonderful conversation.
9671200	9676200	Oh, it was great fun, Carl, isn't it? I do hope people get something out of it. Enjoy it.
9676200	9678200	I'm sure they will.
9678200	9679200	All right.
9679200	9680200	Thanks, Steve. See you.
9680200	9681200	See you later.
