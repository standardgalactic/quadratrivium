1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
You're intuition, let's say, you know, deep inside yourself.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,960
Something maybe some of you can't prove, but why why do you think this is all how

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,760
it's laid out? Why do you think we're here?

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,200
Basically, the universe is moving towards this.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,440
It's the system moving towards an attractor.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,400
The wave function collapse isn't random.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,200
If you have an isolated quantum system, it's going to look random.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,680
But when everything is interacting, everything, all those wave functions must be collapsed.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,000
If the universe is becoming more complex, that puts constraints on how the wave

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,560
function collapses, such that the collapse is much in totality add up towards going

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,560
towards this omega point.

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,720
There is a multiverse, but it's not like every possibility exists.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,080
There was this evolutionary process where in Lee Smollin's model of cosmological

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,200
natural selection, when you have a universe form and then a black hole forms in that

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,760
universe, since a big bang is like a singularity event that creates a universe.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,880
The idea is that when a black hole forms in the universe, that's a big bang event

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,640
that creates a new universe.

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,920
That's how you have this evolutionary process that's creating more and more

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,600
universes and the universes that are good at creating black holes and black holes

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,800
come from stars, and stars create the chemistry that's needed for life.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,640
Then you'll get more and more universes that create more and more black holes.

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,800
So more and more universes that have more and more stars.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,360
And so then this process will lead to more and more universes that are

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,600
firmly for life, because stars create the higher elements that are needed for life.

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,320
And then so if this evolutionary process is true, you'll have the selection pressure

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,440
towards getting more life-friendly universes.

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,280
My ultimate understanding was that nature

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,800
has this life-generating principle.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,400
It's really hard to determine, you know,

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,960
we still have that why something from nothing problem,

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,040
but we are making progress.

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,400
It's not introducing unnecessary stuff

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,840
by going outside this universe

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,560
because we have the fine-tuning mystery

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,280
that is begging for a solution that we don't have

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,960
unless we think about these other things.

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,400
Creator, cosmological selection, the multiverse theory,

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,000
which I don't think is a good explanation

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
because it introduces everything

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,920
just to explain away a creator.

41
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,720
When we shouldn't necessarily need to explain a creator

42
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,000
with every possible universe exists.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,200
It's just, I don't think it's the right,

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,360
I don't think it's superior epistemologically,

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,320
Occam's Rage, all the things we mentioned.

46
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,320
So ultimately I'm left with the process itself being God

47
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,600
and that we could be created by an agent,

48
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,360
but it wouldn't be this all-powerful,

49
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,560
fundamental thing that was there forever.

50
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,560
It would be a product of this process,

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,320
but that process seems to be eternal.

52
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,000
So even if we have a God, a creator,

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,520
I don't think if I learned about him,

54
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,880
I don't think I'd pray to him.

55
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,000
I think if we have a creator,

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,440
it might be like us creating things

57
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,880
and then we wouldn't ask our AI, like, is there a God?

58
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,080
Like maybe if we do have a creator,

59
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,640
they're looking for us to answer us.

60
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,960
Maybe we're the AI that's gonna inform them.

61
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,920
But so even if we had a creator,

62
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,200
I'm not necessarily sure

63
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,340
that I don't think that would be the end of all answers.

64
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,200
I think it's more spiritually satisfying

65
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,000
to just recognize there is a process that leads to life,

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,120
leads to consciousness and unending consciousness,

67
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,760
reaching higher and higher levels of experience.

68
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,240
So it's a journey for me, but what I am convinced by

69
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,480
is that you do have this trajectory

70
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,160
and once you start asking why it's this way,

71
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,840
you get into all the explanations that I've just said

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,800
and I think they're better than the nihilistic multiverse

73
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,200
where just weak anthropic principle version.

74
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,360
Bobby Azarian is a cognitive neuroscientist,

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,840
journalist and author of The Romance of Reality,

76
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,480
how the universe organizes itself

77
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,880
to create life, consciousness and cosmic complexity.

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,520
Bobby, thank you for coming up.

81
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,360
Hey, Carlos, thanks for having me.

82
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,600
Yeah, it's such a pleasure.

83
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,800
So excited to speak with you.

84
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,920
We're gonna talk about your book, The Romance of Reality

85
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,920
and for this kicked off before I outline

86
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,680
the three parts that we're gonna cover in today's discussion.

87
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,400
I wanna start off with something that I usually start,

88
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,920
how this is the last question for guests on the podcast

89
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,040
and I'm not gonna ask you this question directly.

90
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,000
It's more of something I was just thinking about.

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,320
I usually ask people, if you could go back

92
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,360
and give your 18 year old self one piece of advice,

93
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,920
what would it be?

94
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,760
And I'm thinking about it in terms of this book

95
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,760
because if I could go back and give myself one book

96
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,600
say like the summer before college, it would be this book.

97
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,160
Oh, wow, that's awesome.

98
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,560
Honestly, I mean that wholeheartedly

99
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,560
because it's fantastic, I had no knowledge

100
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,560
of complexity science up until a few years ago

101
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,480
and this book is just an excellent synthesis

102
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,120
of so many big ideas and I give it my highest recommendation.

103
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,520
People watching this right now,

104
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,280
I hope you listen to the whole conversation

105
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,200
but there'll be a link below in the description

106
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,880
if you'd go out and buy this book because it's incredible.

107
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,720
Thank you so much.

108
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,840
I put a lot of time and thought into it

109
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,320
and it's so nice to hear things like that

110
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,040
because yeah, the intention was to kind of give

111
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,320
a big picture view of complexity science

112
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,000
which includes all these other sciences

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,800
but like what those sciences are showing us

114
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,560
as far as like the big picture questions

115
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
which a lot of the complexity books don't really get into.

116
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,320
They kind of hint at things

117
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,520
but this was just kind of putting all the existential things

118
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,680
out there but to hear that, yeah,

119
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,280
that really makes me feel like the work is worth it

120
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,840
and motivates me for the follow-up book that I'm starting

121
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,440
and so thank you for that.

122
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,280
That's awesome.

123
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,280
I really appreciate that and that's great to know.

124
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,920
Yeah, absolutely and I mean it.

125
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,080
I mean, even a few months ago a commenter

126
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,120
on one of my videos asked me for my top 10 list

127
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,520
and so I have to revise that

128
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,280
because I have to knock somebody off

129
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,240
and put this book in.

130
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,880
Sorry to the person to get snagged off.

131
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,920
No, see Nicholas Taleb, I'm sorry.

132
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,120
He didn't pick that off.

133
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,720
Knock that guy off, yeah, yeah.

134
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,760
Yeah, well let's book it.

135
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,040
I really like his book at Ty for Agile.

136
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,120
I thought it was fantastic.

137
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,960
I haven't read it.

138
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,280
He's a brilliant guy but I've seen some of his tweets

139
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,800
where I was like, huh, I don't know.

140
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,640
He's a troll.

141
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,480
He's a professional troll.

142
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah, he's kind of but maybe that's cool.

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,240
Maybe, you know, he mixes it up.

144
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,880
Yeah, I know, yeah, I don't know personally

145
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,200
so I just wanna let the audience know that.

146
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,360
Also as we, for the audience to know,

147
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,120
I'll have links in the description for all of your stuff,

148
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,240
for your blog, Road to Omega,

149
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,680
your Psychology Today articles

150
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,840
and of course the link to buy the book as well.

151
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,680
So I want folks to know,

152
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,480
sort of this is gonna be in three parts.

153
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,440
I hope we have time to allocate across all three

154
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,160
but the first one we're gonna,

155
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,200
I think about in terms of crawl, walk, teleport.

156
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,600
So we're gonna crawl,

157
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,720
we're gonna start ground ourselves in the science,

158
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,120
the major ideas behind the book.

159
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,560
We don't have time to dive into every last detail

160
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,400
because there's so much in here.

161
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
It's very densely packed.

162
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,080
We're gonna start there, part two

163
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,320
where I wanna spend a lot of time on.

164
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,160
I know this is something

165
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,360
that you're focusing a lot of time on right now.

166
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,760
Your current projects is how people can use this

167
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,200
in their daily lives, how they can integrate it,

168
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,640
into their habits, their routines.

169
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,080
So I wanna spend a lot of time there.

170
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,600
And then at the end, if we have time,

171
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,520
we'll push the boundaries a little bit,

172
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,280
talk about the more speculative stuff,

173
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,800
allow ourselves to talk about things like,

174
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,000
universal Darwinism, baby universe is spawned

175
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,720
from black holes, things that are a little bit more

176
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,840
out there, time permitting.

177
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,400
So let's get into, let's crawl before we walk.

178
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,240
And if you wouldn't mind,

179
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,960
can you lay the groundwork for the audience?

180
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,920
Can you set the table

181
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,320
and provide us with really high-level description

182
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,800
of the book and some of the core ideas?

183
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,760
Yeah, I realized I didn't answer your question

184
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,400
about if I could go back in time to being 18.

185
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,840
So I don't know if I should address that later

186
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,280
or we should go into it.

187
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,120
Was it if I-

188
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,600
If it's on your mind, yeah.

189
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,320
Yeah, and the structure is great

190
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,200
because Walk, Crawl, Teleport matches the structure

191
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,360
of the book, which is organized into three parts.

192
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,560
Origins, about the origin of life,

193
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,720
evolution, and transcendence.

194
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,000
So yeah, there'll be a logical flow

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,960
and I will not go into much detail

196
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,120
about the evolutionary mechanisms in part one.

197
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,960
That's mostly what the book is about.

198
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,280
But I've talked about that in a lot of detail

199
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,560
and other interviews and wanna just give a good,

200
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,160
big picture overview of all the stuff

201
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,600
that you just mentioned.

202
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,560
So if anyone's interested in more details,

203
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,360
you can go to my sub-sacro to Omega.

204
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,280
My book is available on Amazon and other retailers

205
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,440
and yeah, those and other talks online.

206
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,440
But this will be less detailed and more philosophical,

207
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,600
I guess, you know, bigger picture focused on that.

208
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,600
If I was 18, so was it, what book would I read at 18

209
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,280
or what would I tell myself at 18?

210
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,520
So that's funny, I answered what book

211
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,640
because I was thinking so much about your book.

212
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,560
But yeah, you could either one.

213
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,840
Yeah, but the first, the original question was

214
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,240
if I could go back in time

215
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,800
and kind of give myself advice.

216
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,560
Yeah, yeah, that's the original question.

217
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
That's what you ask everybody?

218
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,360
Yeah, yeah, I gotta watch all those.

219
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,400
I love the Donald Hoffman interview.

220
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,000
I haven't got to watch the other ones,

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,600
but I know you're reading Graham Dempsey and Greg

222
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,640
who are friends and I saw Michael Levin

223
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,480
and some really cool people.

224
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,040
So I gotta go see their answers to that

225
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,960
because that's a good question.

226
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,360
So I don't know if this is how I would normally answer,

227
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,960
but this has been on my mind.

228
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,200
So it's like when you understand the paradigm

229
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,040
presented in the book,

230
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,560
which is not necessarily, not really my paradigm,

231
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,400
I've approached this like a scientist

232
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,640
who definitely, I guess had a hypothesis,

233
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,040
but also as a journalist.

234
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,880
So as a person who's a scientist

235
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,240
and who believes in the importance of evidence

236
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,340
for your beliefs and your arguments,

237
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,360
you know, I couldn't see myself just having some hypothesis

238
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,520
that was never out there and like really like putting it

239
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,880
for like the reason that I feel confident

240
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,080
about the argument in the book is because

241
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,800
it's based on so many people

242
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,880
who have seen the same cosmic narrative,

243
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,440
you could call it this new story of nature.

244
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,800
And it's really interesting because,

245
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,880
you know, you could bring up some of these ideas

246
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,600
to some people and especially like 15 or 20 years ago

247
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,360
and some people like, no, that sounds like new age stuff.

248
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,200
No, they can't be right.

249
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,080
The universe is waking up or becoming conscious

250
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,000
or something like that.

251
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,640
Or it's growing more and more complex always

252
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,480
without limit.

253
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,960
And they're like, no, that's not scientific.

254
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,480
That violates this law and this or this idea

255
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,720
or that was shown to be like,

256
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,200
it's amazing that that was the stance toward this narrative

257
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,640
which we'll get into.

258
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,640
And it was just totally ideological.

259
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,760
And there have been other people

260
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,840
that have been saying this other thing

261
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,960
and somehow for cultural reasons,

262
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,240
most people got convinced that certain things

263
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,720
that people could say about the universe

264
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
were just completely wrong and pseudo-scientific.

265
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,840
And we're seeing that's completely not true.

266
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,200
And it's been exciting because I've written certain articles

267
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,080
like challenging the heat death hypothesis

268
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,120
and that life has to come to an end in the universe.

269
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,600
For example, I just wrote one for Noema.

270
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,640
The physicist David Deutch shared it.

271
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,480
Sabina Hossenfelder and Richard Hansen,

272
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,080
big names were like commenting.

273
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,560
She had written something similar in a chapter in her book.

274
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,400
I haven't read it yet.

275
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,960
And Robert Hansen was like, yeah, maybe life can go.

276
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,560
It depends on if entropy has an upper bound.

277
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,800
But my point is with all of the articles that I've published,

278
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,320
I thought we're saying something super radical.

279
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,440
The one that kind of planted the seed for the book

280
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,400
was called Is the Universe Pro-Life for Courts?

281
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,320
And Sean Carroll gave me a quote for that

282
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,560
and retweeted that and said,

283
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,720
controversial topic, opinions may differ,

284
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,200
but he thought that was a good potential argument

285
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,200
that life was inevitable based on thermodynamic arguments.

286
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,640
And I think he'd probably even say that was the case now.

287
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,680
So there were things where I thought

288
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,680
that it was gonna be a real challenge to say this stuff

289
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,520
because of just consensus

290
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,920
and all of that's changing.

291
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,480
It's the most exciting time ever.

292
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,800
So one thing I would tell myself

293
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,840
if I went back is like,

294
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,800
but I kind of followed this advice anyway.

295
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,400
It's not what I was gonna say originally.

296
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,400
I was gonna say, again, it wasn't based off anything.

297
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,600
Looking around me, reading tons of stuff

298
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,920
gave me a strong feeling

299
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,480
that the universe is becoming more complex.

300
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,680
It's not becoming increasingly disordered.

301
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,800
And I need to look into this.

302
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,440
So as long as you feel like you're basing your something,

303
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,600
basing your belief on like evidence

304
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,440
and you have a strong argument,

305
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,360
do not pay attention to like current consensus.

306
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,040
Don't be afraid if like someone's like,

307
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,880
oh, you're a crackpot because of this.

308
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,720
Just put the time into articulating your idea

309
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,480
because if you articulate it well,

310
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,640
it's really interesting.

311
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,280
Like there's things in the book where if I were to,

312
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,600
if the chapters were only a paragraph long

313
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,280
people were reading little summaries,

314
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,520
they might not be convinced all of them.

315
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,880
They're like, this goes against everything we know.

316
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,800
But then you read the book and you see the arguments

317
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,600
and it's specifically the technical arguments

318
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,240
that just went through that skepticism.

319
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,360
For example, Michael Schermer,

320
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,480
I didn't know what he was gonna think of the book.

321
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,600
And he ended up giving a blurb to actually

322
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,640
on the cover talking about like people having a purpose

323
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,440
to your purposes, discover your own purpose.

324
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,440
But so that was thrilling and it's still happening

325
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,160
to see these kind of ideological ideas

326
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,440
that were kind of cemented as like, this is the truth

327
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,040
are starting to be dismantled

328
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,480
because they were never on a firm basis.

329
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,480
And yeah, so basically stick with it.

330
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,000
And stick to your beliefs like, I mean,

331
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,880
yeah, don't get deterred from something

332
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,000
if you feel that is right.

333
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,480
Quickly, because we need to get into all the other stuff.

334
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,840
But this is kind of already getting into those topics.

335
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,400
But I will say that the ideas in the book

336
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,880
made me look at life in a different way

337
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,720
as far as like life does have this intrinsic goal

338
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
which is to stay in existence.

339
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,160
And that gives us an intrinsic purpose.

340
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,440
And once you see things in that way

341
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,920
you can kind of start to interpret life as being a game

342
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,160
where there's challenges and goals.

343
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,320
And then you start to think of your moment,

344
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,120
your life on a moment to moment basis

345
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,280
as sort of being this thing

346
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,360
where you're like accumulating points.

347
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,080
I mean, you don't wanna get carried away with this

348
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,960
but overall I think it's a good way to optimize life

349
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,800
where you're just really thinking like,

350
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,680
okay, I'm not wasting time today

351
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,320
because I've had this game kind of framework

352
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,840
where I have these goals

353
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,880
and I'm not doing things right now to get to my goals.

354
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,040
That doesn't mean you don't relax,

355
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,880
you don't have fun

356
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
because that's part of getting to your goals.

357
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,840
But if I could go back to when I was 18

358
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,200
or even before high school, like starting high school

359
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,840
I would have imagined my life as being a type of game.

360
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,280
So I wouldn't miss opportunities

361
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,840
and I would take advantage of things

362
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,240
where I just miss certain opportunities of life

363
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,680
because I didn't have this mindset that I have now.

364
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,840
Yeah, so I do think this game lens that we'll get into

365
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,000
is really helpful for sort of like optimizing your life.

366
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,240
And once you realize it, then you're like,

367
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,240
oh man, I kind of wasted time being suboptimal.

368
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,160
Interesting, yeah.

369
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,240
In life, yeah.

370
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,520
Cool, yeah, we'll spend a lot of time

371
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,880
and I'll make sure that our fattest section

372
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,880
is the game of life throw to Omega that we're on

373
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,400
before we get into that a little bit,

374
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,560
just to help an audience.

375
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,280
And I think, well, you just alluded to it a little bit.

376
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,600
This, I think that your book is a response

377
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,080
to the failure of reductionism in science.

378
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,880
So could you tell us a little bit about,

379
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,680
I guess, that changing paradigm

380
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,400
and then also sprinkle in your unified theory of reality

381
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,320
which you have a great flow chart from infinity maps

382
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,840
that I'm sure I'll overlay at some point in this discussion.

383
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,480
But I know there's a lot there

384
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,040
because there's a few different frameworks

385
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,320
that you bring in, but I love to just get,

386
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,600
if you could provide us with a little bit of an overview,

387
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,120
that'd be super helpful.

388
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,640
Yeah, let me, there's so many things

389
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,920
I've been talking about writing about,

390
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,080
like there could be a conversation,

391
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,120
full podcast on each of these topics.

392
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,960
So I'm just trying to be mindful to like say,

393
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,200
be brief and say the most important things

394
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,480
because there's so many cultural factors.

395
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,680
So you can trace this back to like this question

396
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,000
to like understanding the different eras,

397
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,800
basically like pre-modernism, modernism, post-modernism

398
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,600
and whatever we're getting into now.

399
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,800
But like pre-modernism was kind of the time before science

400
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,600
where like religion ruled

401
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,240
and people believed supernatural beliefs.

402
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,400
And there was this strict hierarchy

403
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,480
and modernism was basically a response to that.

404
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,480
And it happened, it's kind of started

405
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,640
with the Enlightenment period in like the 17th century,

406
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,280
18th century and the scientific,

407
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,160
kind of the birth of the scientific method.

408
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,840
And when I started writing the book,

409
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,720
I thought that's kind of when there was like

410
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,240
the onset of reductionism and atheism

411
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
and kind of this idea that the universe

412
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,000
was meaningless and purposeless.

413
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,200
But I found out that that's not true at all.

414
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,760
And basically there was this modern movement

415
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,160
that was like very pro-science and pro-reason and logic.

416
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,280
But it wasn't what we have now

417
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,800
or wasn't what the kind of scientific ideology

418
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,240
of the 20th century, which was more nihilistic,

419
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,200
you know, nothing has any meaning, there's no purpose,

420
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,200
there's no design and basically,

421
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,720
oh, and there's no such thing as like continued

422
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,800
complexification because that kind of implies progress.

423
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,240
And so basically modernism started off

424
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,000
like it was still pretty religious

425
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,680
and I'm not advocating for organized religion

426
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,960
by any means.

427
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,880
But what I'm saying is there's a different mindset.

428
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,920
Newton was extremely religious.

429
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,000
A lot of the greatest physicists of our time,

430
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,720
a lot of the founders of thermodynamics,

431
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,800
James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin,

432
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,760
they were all very religious.

433
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,760
And we're driven by this idea that reality is mysterious

434
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,320
and they're basically trying to understand

435
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,120
what they described as the mind of God.

436
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,920
And you see that language retained

437
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,600
in like Stephen Hawking and stuff.

438
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,960
And you'll find videos of like Richard Dawkins saying,

439
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,840
you know, you can make a good argument for a God

440
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,800
if you basically are a creator,

441
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,600
if you put them behind, you know, at the very, you know,

442
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,760
that they designed the system and then let it evolve

443
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,400
to its own dynamics.

444
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,920
And he says, the God of Paul Davies,

445
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,840
the God of the physicist.

446
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,480
And I was like, the God of the physicist.

447
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,000
And it was again, I was like looking more

448
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,600
into the different physicists.

449
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,520
And you know, a lot of people know Newton as Christian.

450
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,440
Some people know like Goldil,

451
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,320
who's a mathematician, was very Christian.

452
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,920
But like, I didn't know like the founders,

453
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,200
a lot of, you know, the founders

454
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,120
of the second law of thermodynamics

455
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,960
were Christian as well.

456
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,360
And actually the heat death theory,

457
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,480
I believe had Christian motivations

458
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,560
because basically Lord, yeah, it's super fascinating,

459
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,160
but Lord Kelvin, who kind of popularized

460
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,400
the second law of thermodynamics,

461
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,760
which, you know, he and Colossia

462
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,520
has kind of independently put forth.

463
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,640
And just for anyone who doesn't know,

464
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,280
second law of thermodynamics is the law that entropy

465
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,120
always must increase in the universe.

466
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,000
Well, in system, see, that's the thing.

467
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It was supposed to be applied just to like close systems.

468
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,600
And then people immediately started to try

469
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,400
to apply it to the whole universe.

470
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,320
But a lot of the impetus for doing that

471
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,720
was like Lord Kelvin knew that if the universe had an end,

472
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,520
it kind of had to imply there was a beginning.

473
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,680
And at the end of the universe,

474
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,720
the heat death kind of paralleled

475
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,120
sort of judgment, you know, day of judgment type stuff.

476
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,080
So interesting dissertation online,

477
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,920
which talks about the religious motivations

478
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,800
underlying the second law of thermodynamics.

479
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,520
Sir Arthur Eddington, who made the quote,

480
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,840
the second law of thermodynamics is, you know,

481
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,280
if you have a theory that goes up against that,

482
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,000
I can only, you know, whatever, you know,

483
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,880
but it was like, yeah.

484
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,720
And he was very Christian as well

485
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,200
and referred to himself as a rational mystic,

486
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,600
which I thought was a nice, you know,

487
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,880
kind of paradoxical term that kind of,

488
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,600
I felt like a relation to,

489
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,360
because reality is very mysterious.

490
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,720
And I'm not saying we can't understand,

491
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,320
I'm actually saying we can, but we haven't yet.

492
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,440
There's lots of secrets to uncover.

493
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,760
We'll never understand it completely,

494
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,720
but that's what this complexification process,

495
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,320
the world's getting more complex,

496
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,480
that happens when organisms start modeling the world

497
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,040
and when they start modeling the world to survive in it,

498
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,320
they start getting a larger and more detailed map

499
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,360
of the world and that allows them to manipulate

500
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,640
the world around them, which allows life to spread.

501
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,640
So you have this story that is basically, yeah,

502
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,600
it's really different than what we've been taught in science.

503
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,600
So yeah, my point was in modernism,

504
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,560
scientists still were, you know,

505
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,480
driven by this kind of mystical, you know,

506
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,320
desire to understand nature, the mystery of nature.

507
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,600
And really the whole idea was that, you know,

508
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,360
we could use science to achieve unlimited progress,

509
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,200
but this became associated with like capitalism

510
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,880
and colonialism and stuff like that.

511
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,440
So then postmodernism was just kind of this school of thought

512
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,360
that emerged that was a critique of modernism.

513
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,360
So it was a critique of like science thinking

514
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,800
you could find objective truth

515
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,000
that like there's really subjectivity.

516
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,840
That's really important.

517
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,520
There's maybe no objective truth

518
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,880
and that whatever cultural culture believes is relative

519
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,040
in a social construct.

520
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,360
So there's cultural relativism,

521
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,120
which has like no culture is really objectively better

522
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,680
than others, which suggests that science is really not any,

523
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,560
not in any way more fundamentally more solid

524
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,240
than any religions or, you know, kind of folk mythologies.

525
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,600
And so it was idea, postmodernism was good

526
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,320
because there were a lot of things to critique about modernism,

527
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,920
but it should have been a critique that improved, you know,

528
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,200
how we think about these things and, you know,

529
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,680
the limits of science or, you know,

530
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,480
how certain we should be about things.

531
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,440
But like I think it was really bad

532
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,920
that it basically tried to eliminate this idea

533
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,800
that there is this, you know, progress towards, you know,

534
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,320
higher intelligence in the biosphere

535
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,280
because I think it's a law that you can't,

536
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,640
it's something that you see a principle of nature

537
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,480
that is real.

538
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,280
And if we don't understand that we have no idea

539
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,320
how our civilization is evolving and where we're going,

540
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,440
because it's not driven by some mystical force.

541
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,160
It's not something where progress is like,

542
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,240
just keeps happening like perfectly.

543
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,240
It's this air correction process that's similar to AI.

544
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Life is facing challenges.

545
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,600
It's like life is similar to an AI being trained on data

546
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,120
and the data is the chaotic world around us.

547
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,600
And so we keep being faced with problems

548
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,640
and we keep having to overcome those problems

549
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,440
and a lot of organisms die out during that,

550
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,720
but the ones that can solve those problems

551
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,520
get to make copies of themselves.

552
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,760
And so we get all these designs of organisms and AIs

553
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,720
and everything basically, there's a natural selection,

554
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,800
applies not just to living organisms,

555
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,400
but all designs in life and basically the dysfunctional

556
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,120
and inefficient designs get filtered out.

557
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,000
So we have these designs that get more and more robust

558
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
and that leads to this process of basically

559
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,600
life-spreading inevitably, but it's not the straight line.

560
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,000
It's always, there's always like two steps back

561
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,680
for one step forward, but you can see the trend clearly

562
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,640
and people like Ray Kurzweil have mapped out these trends

563
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,240
of technological increase, but showing the technological

564
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,120
increase as continuous with the complexity increase of life

565
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,640
because life is really information processing.

566
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,640
And so life is fundamentally different than inanimate matter,

567
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,720
but AI, I wouldn't say is that fundamentally different

568
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,640
from life.

569
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,840
I mean, it's not, AI is not alive,

570
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,280
but it's an extension of life.

571
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,960
It's got designs that would never appear in nature

572
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,240
unless life first emerged.

573
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,800
So you had pre-modernism, which was supernatural.

574
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,240
Then you had the modern movement, which was like science,

575
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,120
but that science could solve everything.

576
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,360
And then maybe some people took that idea too far

577
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,080
and thought, you know, let's do eugenics.

578
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,400
And the Nazis exploited that theory of increasing

579
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,520
complexification and opening the evolution to justify

580
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,760
like superior and inferior races.

581
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,800
So there were all these cultural issues that led people

582
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,080
to not like certain ideas,

583
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,280
whether it was the Nazis using this idea

584
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,960
of like evolutionary progress,

585
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,960
or Tihar Deshardin was a priest, a Catholic priest

586
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,080
that wrote this book that the church actually hated

587
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,160
because they thought it was like against

588
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,080
in Christian teaching, but it was that evolution,

589
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,920
you know, everything's becoming more complex

590
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,120
and that maybe God is in the future.

591
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,680
Maybe there seems to be some sort of design,

592
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,880
but that everything, for example,

593
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,840
the network of humans is approaching

594
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,800
some sort of global mind that will emerge

595
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,560
and this process will continue.

596
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,680
So Tihar Deshardin wrote this book called

597
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,080
The Phenomenon of Man that put out this omega point theory

598
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,600
that my book is largely based on

599
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,080
and all the scientists who have been writing

600
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,840
about this stuff, complexity scientists,

601
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,800
people at the San Jose Institute,

602
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,440
they all know that Tihar kind of put that idea out there

603
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,880
and made it like really salient

604
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,380
that the world's getting more complex.

605
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,620
But people didn't like the religious associations

606
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,780
that he made, but so then people were against it

607
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,900
because they felt like if they acknowledged

608
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,980
that the world was getting more complex

609
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,300
and that it might be going towards some final goal state

610
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,860
that that would just be like saying that God is right

611
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,860
and God is real and there's a design,

612
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,540
there's some sort of trajectory

613
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,820
that's been planned from the beginning

614
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,860
and people thought that was dangerous.

615
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,780
So then there was a backlash against anybody saying

616
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,500
anything that life had a purpose.

617
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,940
They wanted to erase that language from biology.

618
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,780
If you said life does this in any language

619
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,420
that had a purpose, they wanted you to reward it

620
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,180
to be like in this sort of neo-Darwinian language

621
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,300
where you get rid of purpose and you say, oh no,

622
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,180
like people were mad that people were asking little kids

623
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,060
like why does the plant grow towards the sun

624
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,100
and the kids would say because it wants the light

625
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,220
and like there's evolutionary theorists who are,

626
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,300
you know, kind of motivated by atheism.

627
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,980
No, it doesn't want to grow towards the light.

628
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,300
That's teleological language.

629
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,260
That's purposeful language.

630
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,860
You have to get that out of science.

631
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,020
It grows towards the light

632
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,340
because the ones that were worse

633
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,260
that growing towards the light died off

634
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,220
and that one just happened to be better

635
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,420
and it just got out of control.

636
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,700
But now because of AI and emergence

637
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,460
and just engineering, when you talk like an engineer,

638
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,340
you kind of talk about agents, even if they're not living,

639
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,140
you kind of use this purposeful language

640
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,780
so you can't really get rid of this language

641
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,220
when you're talking about the universe

642
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,700
because we do see these things and it's just natural

643
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,100
but also it seems to be the way reality is

644
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,780
at least this emergent phenomenon

645
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,260
does have goals and purposes purposes.

646
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,700
But yeah, so that backlash created this kind of

647
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,700
whole worldview of meaninglessness

648
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,020
and it was perfect for science.

649
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,100
Science was already going in that kind of direction

650
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,980
because it was at this war with religion a lot of times

651
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,340
and so reductionism is just the idea that

652
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,460
there's just a bunch of particles in the universe.

653
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,900
It's a system of particles that are bouncing off each other

654
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,620
and then you can use laws of motion

655
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,660
to understand those interactions

656
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,660
and then if you have those laws of motion,

657
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,260
there's no room for human agency

658
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,660
because everything would be determined

659
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,980
by these fundamental equations

660
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,500
that are specifying these trajectories in advance.

661
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,980
But what my book argues is that that's not right.

662
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,340
It's a simplified version of causality

663
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,540
and dynamics in nature.

664
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,980
And basically when agents emerge,

665
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,180
they're these information processing systems

666
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,620
that exists in a universe that's not completely deterministic.

667
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,420
There's a lot of deterministic processes

668
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:50,220
but at the very bottom level, there's random,

669
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,060
there's an element of probability and randomness

670
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:58,060
or stochasticity and so there is room for freedom

671
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,780
and when agents emerge,

672
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,780
they basically, when you're making a conscious decision,

673
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,380
the results of your decision weren't determined

674
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,900
by particle physics at that lower level.

675
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,620
You can basically, you as a physical system,

676
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,700
when you initiate a movement,

677
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,980
it's not something that's violating the laws of physics.

678
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,180
You're metabolizing energy that you ate before

679
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,740
but you're not in an animate system that can't move.

680
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,300
You can make these decisions

681
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,180
and you're truly making these decisions in real time.

682
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,900
So determinism in the classical sense,

683
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,900
that kind of Laplace kind of made applied Newton's paradigm

684
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,020
to the whole world and you have this strict determinism

685
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,180
that's really determinism at the level of particles

686
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,900
as opposed to other people talk about determinism

687
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,660
saying that your actions are a result of your life preferences.

688
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,140
I mean, your experiences and your beliefs and your genetics

689
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,380
and that's a different discussion

690
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,500
and people conflate those two types of determinism,

691
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,420
biological versus physical determinism

692
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,020
and physical determinism is a much stricter thing.

693
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,500
That's saying there's no room for biological anything,

694
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,780
even genes in that view aren't doing anything.

695
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,940
You could reduce genes to particles.

696
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,260
So it got really weird

697
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,820
because you would see evolutionary theorists

698
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,340
being reductionists and I would be like,

699
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,820
if you wanna be a real reductionist,

700
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,500
then like Jerry Coyne, genes don't even matter.

701
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,900
Your whole field would be completely irrelevant.

702
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,500
If you really knew what you were talking about,

703
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,180
like the ideology that you're advocating for,

704
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,700
we could just say genes are epiphenomenal too

705
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,020
and just talk about particles.

706
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,060
Sure.

707
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:41,620
The book is a pushback on postmodernism and reductionism

708
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:45,140
and kind of wanting to return to this narrative of science

709
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,220
and not just science, but logic and I mean, arts,

710
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,380
in this view, we see science as something,

711
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,260
we see science as part of the evolutionary process

712
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,860
because testing theories is just like how nature

713
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,380
has been testing organisms.

714
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,940
And in this book, organisms are basically embodied models

715
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,900
or embodied theories about how to survive in the world.

716
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,500
Your genome and your brain has encoded information

717
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,940
that makes predictions about how to survive in the world.

718
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,300
So basically scientific theories are just kind of

719
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:24,300
extensions of organisms and they're kind of,

720
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,900
it's kind of just an elaboration of this process of life,

721
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,140
creating models that will allow it to survive

722
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,300
in a world that has this tendency to break down.

723
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,100
Otherwise, aside from life,

724
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,100
because that's not the full story when people say,

725
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,060
the world's going towards more disorder.

726
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,740
What I discovered in the book

727
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,780
is that there's this dialectical dynamic

728
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,300
where you have order and disorder

729
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,380
and kind of this tension

730
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:59,380
and it's because life has to always evade this tendency

731
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,620
towards disorder that life spreads through the universe

732
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,140
and the universe becomes more complex

733
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,740
because you have life spreading.

734
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,260
So if you didn't have that tendency towards disorder,

735
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,980
there would be no evolutionary pressure

736
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,660
towards designs that are more functional

737
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,340
that can survive better in the world.

738
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,260
So you need the tendency towards disorder

739
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,100
described by the second law of thermodynamics

740
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,500
to have this whole complexification process work.

741
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,060
But that's one big insight of the book

742
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,300
that almost no people talk about.

743
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,140
I mean, this dialectical dynamics.

744
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,900
You need the constraint on the system.

745
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,820
Problems create progress.

746
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,780
That's Popper's principle.

747
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,260
It's a big, yeah.

748
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,060
Yeah, so, yep.

749
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,780
And so this whole idea,

750
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,100
everybody was against this idea of teleology,

751
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,700
which was just a word for continual inevitable progress

752
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,980
and complexification towards some higher people.

753
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,140
And I understand why it's

754
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,660
because they thought it was a supernatural idea,

755
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,060
but now I'm saying it's not supernatural.

756
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,220
And people are saying like evolution is blind.

757
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,140
That was wrong too.

758
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,820
So it's just more complicated.

759
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,700
There is this tendency towards progress

760
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,340
and the whole system isn't conscious at this point.

761
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,180
I don't believe it is,

762
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,340
but there is an intelligence distributed

763
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,900
throughout this network that we call the biosphere.

764
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,220
And so you do see this tendency towards that,

765
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,780
but it happens through mistakes

766
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,300
that basically get corrected

767
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,780
if you look at the whole biosphere as a system

768
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,620
and you look at organisms dying

769
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,980
and some living and reproducing.

770
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,100
If you look at natural selection

771
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,220
as basically the biosphere doing its own scientific testing,

772
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,140
you have this new story of life.

773
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:40,500
And you see that evolution actually does have this tendency

774
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,860
towards more complexity.

775
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,860
Why? Because as that natural selection process proceeds,

776
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,420
knowledge from the successful,

777
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,340
when I say knowledge,

778
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,020
I'm not just talking about human knowledge,

779
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,620
although that's part of it.

780
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:59,420
But when animals that are less adapted,

781
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,660
more dysfunctional designs die out

782
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,940
and the better designs stay,

783
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,300
the genome, the genomes in the biosphere

784
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,940
are also accumulating knowledge about how to survive.

785
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,300
So when I say the evolutionary process creates knowledge,

786
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,500
I'm talking about the evolutionary process creates knowledge

787
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,300
in genes, in brains, in cultural memory,

788
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:25,420
and then now digital memory, like the internet.

789
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,460
In cultural memory, I mean like books and stuff.

790
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,220
So when you look at the trajectory of evolution,

791
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,140
it's really this emergence of these

792
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,660
information processing systems and memory systems.

793
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,100
So you have the emergence of life,

794
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,460
you have genes, then you have the emergence of brains,

795
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,580
you have neural memory,

796
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,180
then you have the emergence of societies,

797
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,380
you have cultural memory.

798
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,300
So you get like language

799
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,540
and you get these ideas spreading from brain to brain

800
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,980
through memes basically.

801
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,140
We start telling stories

802
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,980
and then you get the invention of books

803
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,940
and written language and art.

804
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,860
And it's all part of the same process

805
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,940
of basically life exploring the design space

806
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,180
because it's looking for solutions

807
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,620
to this problem of survival.

808
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,100
And at first it's doing it unconscious.

809
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,460
And then when brains emerge,

810
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,900
you have the emergence of consciousness

811
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,820
and then we start to become aware

812
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,420
of our need to survive.

813
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:16,420
And we start, it's just another layer of our motivation

814
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,020
to do what nature has already programmed us to do.

815
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,780
And what the book argues is,

816
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,260
because I always talk about these details,

817
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,100
but I don't always give the bigger picture.

818
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,060
A lot of it is because when you say this,

819
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,500
the bigger things behind it,

820
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,780
sometimes it turns people off.

821
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,580
So I would save that stuff to the end

822
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,940
or maybe not even talk about it all

823
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,860
if it's a technical talk.

824
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,420
But the main point of the book is that this process

825
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,660
implies that there's some sort of design or logic.

826
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,900
There's some sort of,

827
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,820
the universe isn't an arbitrary system.

828
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,020
You can imagine the universe being full of marbles

829
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,180
like that, the particle story.

830
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,180
If the particle story was true

831
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:58,180
and they were just little spherical objects bouncing around

832
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,300
because when Boltzmann,

833
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,140
when the second law of thermodynamics was,

834
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:07,420
and this idea that Laplace had of everything is just particles

835
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,620
at the lowest level.

836
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,740
If you could zoom in on this,

837
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,020
you would see these particles bouncing around.

838
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,940
The periodic table wasn't even invented until like 1920.

839
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,260
So people were, the model of particles were that,

840
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,220
they were these perfect spherical balls

841
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,380
that bounce off each other elastically,

842
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,700
just like real pool balls or marbles would.

843
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,740
And if we had that,

844
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:31,620
you can have a bag of marbles bouncing around for eternity

845
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,300
and it's not going to form the complexity of life.

846
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,180
You need specific elements with specific properties,

847
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,580
bonding properties like carbon and specific forces.

848
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:45,380
You need all of these things to be very specific

849
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,740
for all of this to work.

850
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,940
And that's known as the fine tuning problem.

851
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,380
And the fine tuning problem basically says that

852
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,020
if you change any of these parameters,

853
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,060
like the force of gravity,

854
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,100
the force of the stronger weak nuclear force,

855
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,660
even by hair, you wouldn't have life,

856
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,700
but you probably wouldn't have any structure in the universe.

857
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,700
You just would have just like my universe

858
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,380
that expanded forever or contracted into, you know,

859
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,220
singularity again, you wouldn't even have,

860
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,220
it's not that you wouldn't have life,

861
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,460
you wouldn't have structure.

862
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,380
So then the, so, so the book makes the argument though,

863
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,460
first it makes the argument that there is this new cosmic

864
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,340
narrative where the universe is becoming more complex.

865
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,700
And that involves, you know,

866
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,780
the emergence of planets and stars,

867
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,180
because planets, you need planets to have life.

868
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,220
You need stars to provide the energy for life.

869
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,140
You need stars to fuse the simple elements together

870
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:37,260
to get the elements that are in living organisms and biology.

871
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:41,660
And so, but then you get the emergence of life

872
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,500
and then you get information processing systems in the world.

873
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,780
And then life begins to slowly spread.

874
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,700
And because of this evolutionary process

875
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,140
being this knowledge accumulation process,

876
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,100
it just keeps learning and modeling the world.

877
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,660
And as it's extracting information

878
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,460
about the world around it, it just keeps expanding.

879
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,100
And that's what we're seeing now with like us

880
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,940
leaving the planet to go into space.

881
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,140
It's something that was part of the trajectory.

882
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,500
It's not the smart idea of a billionaire or something.

883
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,660
It's what would happen on any biosphere

884
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:19,660
with intelligent creatures who have discovered science

885
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,300
and discovered thermodynamics, for example,

886
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,020
because any advanced intelligence will learn

887
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:32,300
that their days are numbered unless they get off the planet.

888
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,780
So what I'm saying is that we have to have

889
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,140
a new picture of the universe.

890
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,700
There is some sort of design.

891
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,140
It's almost like life is like AI.

892
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,380
It's almost like life is like the system being trained

893
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,060
and life shouldn't be seen as separate from the universe.

894
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
It's part of the universe.

895
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,900
It's actually the universe.

896
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,220
Universe is simplest components organizing themselves

897
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,900
into a functional form that can experience itself.

898
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,140
So life is the universe's conduit or vehicle

899
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,340
for experiencing itself.

900
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,180
And that's a very different story

901
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,060
and it raises all kinds of implications.

902
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,700
And some people would reject it flat out

903
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,820
and be like, yeah, you're talking about God.

904
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,020
You're saying that it has a design

905
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,260
and that implies a designer.

906
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,140
I'm done with your theory.

907
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,540
But what I would say to that is when you look

908
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,180
at this argument and you look at the trends,

909
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,900
it does seem like this story is the true story.

910
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,220
Like we have to accept that or we have,

911
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,460
it has to at least, I think if you do a Bayesian analysis,

912
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,220
which just is analysis of the evidence for each theory

913
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,060
that this theory would come out on top.

914
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,700
And the funny thing is though,

915
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,860
where people were rejecting it,

916
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,620
if you say, oh, but we don't necessarily need a designer.

917
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,180
There are theories of cosmological natural selection

918
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,180
where there is more that you need to explain

919
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,380
about the fine-tuning problem,

920
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,420
but you don't need to introduce a God,

921
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,820
at least not a God from like an organized religion.

922
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,020
I mean, and I say that in that way

923
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,580
because you have the simulation theory,

924
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,820
which argues that we're a creation of an intelligent agent.

925
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,420
So what I realized right in the book

926
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,860
is that the simulation theory

927
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,660
and intelligent creator theory are effectively the same theory.

928
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,860
And that now that we understand

929
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,180
that we can create simulations with agents,

930
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,660
possibly conscious agents we don't know,

931
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,940
then scientifically,

932
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,060
since we've demonstrated that it has happened,

933
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,060
we have to take the possibility,

934
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,420
we have to consider a new scientific theory

935
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,780
that we're such a creation.

936
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,860
And there's epistemological justification for that

937
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,740
because we did it.

938
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,620
But here's the funny thing.

939
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,540
Before we did it,

940
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,980
there wasn't as much justification to say

941
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,660
that we needed to take the creator theory seriously.

942
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,420
But once we have created simulations

943
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,060
and we know that that's possible in this physical world,

944
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,020
we immediately have to write down a new theory

945
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,780
that we are such a thing.

946
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,420
And so basically this says the atheists,

947
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,780
the theory that there's no designer fine-tuning,

948
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,420
there's the appearance of a design.

949
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,620
First of all, there's something that needs to be explained.

950
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,460
And to do that,

951
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,900
we have to understand why these laws and not others.

952
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,340
So we have to think bigger than the universe.

953
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,620
And then so we have these different options.

954
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,060
Is it a creator?

955
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,700
Is it a multiverse explanation

956
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,340
where maybe there's this large ensemble of universes

957
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:17,340
and we're just in one out of a multiverse

958
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,820
that's mostly lifeless,

959
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,220
which is in the atheist position,

960
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,620
or cosmological natural section,

961
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,300
which we'll talk about later,

962
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,660
or the simulation theory that we're made by an agent,

963
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,740
intelligent agent.

964
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,580
And then maybe there's even another theory from that.

965
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:38,020
But my point is you can't say that there's no design

966
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,500
and given what we know about the universe,

967
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,260
you can't say this is the only universe

968
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,420
and there's no design.

969
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,340
Because that would be the most improbable thing

970
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,460
that there's one universe.

971
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,620
It's random.

972
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,220
And then it just happens to have the parameters

973
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,300
that would allow for life

974
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,860
when it could have been everything else.

975
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,140
And that's why no one says that.

976
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,180
That's why the multiverse theory

977
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,980
is the rebuttal against this now,

978
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,060
because to destroy the God theory,

979
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:08,060
you need a multiverse with all of these other options.

980
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,140
Here's the bad thing about it.

981
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,340
Soon as you introduce that,

982
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,260
you get wilder ideas than a creator.

983
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,780
The ideas of every universe existing,

984
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,340
if you're doing every possible thing,

985
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,020
here's the tricky, here's the funny thing too.

986
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,580
If you believe the multiverse,

987
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,820
and we've also demonstrated

988
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,380
that we can create new virtual worlds

989
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,500
that might have a conscious agent,

990
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,700
we can create our own universes.

991
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,820
The multiverse theory then starts to include gods too,

992
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,220
because it includes people who create universes,

993
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,900
just like where we could or we have,

994
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,620
but we haven't created conscious agents.

995
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,300
Let's say we could,

996
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:45,140
then you, in the infinitude of all possible universes,

997
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,660
you have universes with creators

998
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:50,100
creating new universes nested in those universes.

999
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,500
If you follow Occam's razor,

1000
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,540
the multiverse theory gives you God,

1001
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,740
created the universes,

1002
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:58,660
it gives you every universe you could conceive of and more.

1003
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,340
So it seems to be worse on Occam's razor grounds.

1004
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,620
It introduces all of these things.

1005
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,740
It gives us the same thing

1006
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,900
that the God creator thing was.

1007
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,140
So what I argue in the book is that

1008
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,420
we have to explain the design.

1009
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,380
You can explain it playing with infinities

1010
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,980
with your multiverse theory,

1011
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,500
but I don't think that's the best explanation.

1012
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,100
I think, and we can get into that more later,

1013
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,660
but I just, so yeah,

1014
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,220
maybe we should just talk more about the meat,

1015
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,220
you know, I know, or the practical stuff.

1016
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,140
I actually talked a lot about the tech.

1017
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:32,980
Yeah, you did.

1018
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,180
I didn't talk about the technical details,

1019
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,940
but I kind of summed it all up, I guess.

1020
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,460
Yeah, you like touched and brought in,

1021
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,740
I mean, I could talk to you for a long time

1022
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,660
about any one of those things you brought up.

1023
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,980
Well, before we get into the,

1024
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,540
because I do want to segue into the practical in a moment,

1025
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,660
but before we do, just perhaps to put a button on it.

1026
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,420
And you just mentioned a few minutes ago, Bayesianism.

1027
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,220
I spoke with Carl Friston last week.

1028
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,260
I interviewed him.

1029
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,100
Yeah, that's not out.

1030
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,860
Yeah, it will be out in the next couple of days.

1031
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,580
So for viewers watching this, that one will be out already.

1032
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,620
So if you want to deep dive into,

1033
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,220
and Friston is one of the most cited people in the book,

1034
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,460
you know, you bring him in quite often.

1035
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,780
And actually, I think,

1036
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,380
because I first read romance or reality around the holidays,

1037
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,620
and I had heard of Friston before,

1038
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:21,820
but how much he's in the book, really.

1039
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,020
Really put him on your radar.

1040
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,220
Put him up to the top of the list.

1041
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,060
Yeah.

1042
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,780
So you inspired me to speak with Carl Friston,

1043
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,620
you know, so thank you.

1044
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,620
That's awesome.

1045
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,300
And it was a great conversation, very high level.

1046
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,140
Oh my God.

1047
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,980
I did not know the term high research load

1048
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,700
before talking to Friston.

1049
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,060
That means you need all these different pieces of information

1050
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,020
from different disciplines coming together

1051
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,460
in order to understand what he's talking about.

1052
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,420
Because he's a neuroscientist,

1053
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,980
he's bringing neuroscience,

1054
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,140
he's bringing information theory,

1055
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,820
he's bringing stuff from physics.

1056
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,660
But one thing that I thought was quite interesting

1057
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,900
is that, and he wrote a blurb for your book also,

1058
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,500
he said it was, I think a synthesis of his favorite thing,

1059
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,140
something that degree, which is amazing.

1060
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:08,500
And I think I was also surprised,

1061
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:13,020
he said that it doesn't get any more fundamental or simpler

1062
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,620
than the free energy principle.

1063
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,980
Which I thought was really interesting,

1064
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,260
because I asked him, that was sort of in response to

1065
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:24,060
when I brought up Jeremy England's dissipative adaptation.

1066
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:24,900
Yeah.

1067
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,460
Which he said, I think to a degree,

1068
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,580
I hope this is correct,

1069
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,220
that that's one subset of the free energy principle.

1070
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,660
That would be like something the free energy principle describes,

1071
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,620
but that's one of many things

1072
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:44,140
that the free energy principle would have a descriptor for.

1073
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,820
Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up.

1074
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,940
I'm glad you said that too,

1075
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,860
because that's what I argued in the book.

1076
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,180
I don't know how much he thought about that before he read my book.

1077
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,380
That would be cool if that kind of...

1078
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,380
Because, you know,

1079
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,260
I mean, he probably knew of Jeremy England's work.

1080
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,420
But as far...

1081
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,340
Yeah, that's one thing I tried to do in chapter six,

1082
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,980
was to show that this dissipative adaptation process

1083
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,140
that's been used to explain the origin of life

1084
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,340
is a process of Bayesian inference.

1085
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:15,220
That was like the one big novel thing that I put in the book that...

1086
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,540
I don't always talk about it.

1087
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,940
You know, it's pretty technical,

1088
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,060
so it's not something that has been highlighted.

1089
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,980
But that it is a process of Bayesian inference,

1090
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,340
and we can look at all self-organization processes,

1091
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,660
as processes of inference.

1092
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,900
Please go on, Zach, if you need me.

1093
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,540
Yeah, so, well, and that was very useful for him to clear that up for me,

1094
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,700
because, you know, if you'll forgive my ignorance,

1095
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:46,100
I had thought that dissipative adaptation was something that was a sub...

1096
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,660
Free engineering principle was something that...

1097
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,100
You can look at it that way too.

1098
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,420
Yeah, so it's like, which way is this going?

1099
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,900
Yeah, it's all...

1100
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,740
And he actually, I think, specifically said

1101
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:00,700
that he was a little bit dismissive of the thermodynamic interpretation

1102
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,460
as that being the underlying idea.

1103
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,460
Yeah.

1104
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:07,500
And that the free engineering principle, I think, has far more applications

1105
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,860
than just that.

1106
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,620
So, do you have any thoughts about that?

1107
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,500
Yeah, yeah, so a colleague also mentioned this about him,

1108
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:20,820
which I think I knew, but it was interesting to hear this kind of emphasized,

1109
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,660
but that Carl likes to put, say, you know,

1110
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,700
everything in terms of inference,

1111
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:30,300
but doesn't like to reduce everything to evolution, for example.

1112
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,940
But you could say the same thing about thermodynamics.

1113
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:36,260
You know, that he doesn't want to reduce everything to thermodynamics.

1114
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,820
What my book tried to show is that the thermodynamic story

1115
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:42,580
and the evolutionary story and the inference story are the same story.

1116
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,020
And that inference processes are...

1117
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,860
And we'll talk about in detail what I mean by that,

1118
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:52,580
but that they are evolutionary processes and they are self-organization processes.

1119
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,700
So they're kind of dissipative processes.

1120
00:48:54,700 --> 00:49:00,260
So it's pointless to be like, this is a subset of that.

1121
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,260
So...

1122
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,420
Well, in a way, he's right,

1123
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:13,500
because the origin of life mechanism is one instance of the free energy principle.

1124
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,060
But you could...

1125
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:21,980
So if he's talking about dissipative adaptation as an origin of life theory,

1126
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,700
it's a subset of a larger inference

1127
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,860
because dissipative adaptation is an inference process

1128
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,460
and this is one instantiation of that.

1129
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,460
It's just the origin of life.

1130
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,300
But you could also look at all inference processes

1131
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,140
as being dissipative adaptation processes at higher levels.

1132
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:41,700
So you could say the whole biosphere is evolving through dissipative adaptation

1133
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,180
because they're just adapting and as they adapt, they extract more energy.

1134
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,420
And if they use more energy, they're dissipating more energy.

1135
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,260
So you could look at the biosphere as a dissipative process.

1136
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:54,500
And before dissipative adaptation was a theory put forth by England,

1137
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,580
tons of people were saying this.

1138
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:59,820
Eric Cheyesson, Eric Smith, and here more with Santa Fe Institute,

1139
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,620
this whole thermodynamic narrative,

1140
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,420
it had been told much in detail way before Jeremy England.

1141
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,380
Jeremy England just came up with this specific equation

1142
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,660
about self-organizing molecules

1143
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,180
and demonstrated that you could simulate this

1144
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,860
and show that this is the case,

1145
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:21,300
that basically if you have a lump of particles driven by a force of energy

1146
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:26,140
and those particles have the right profile such that they interact

1147
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,900
like with life, you need carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrene.

1148
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,020
You need those molecules.

1149
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:35,460
For example, carbon makes bonds to four other elements or molecules.

1150
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:39,020
And if you don't have something that can bond to a lot of things,

1151
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,420
you can't get complex structures.

1152
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:44,220
So if you simulate the properties of those molecules,

1153
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:48,540
you can show that just a system being pushed by a flow of energy

1154
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,500
with the right properties will begin to organize.

1155
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,820
And as they organize, so that's really what we need to focus on

1156
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:58,660
is that that's the mechanism of self-organization.

1157
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:02,340
As a result of this process, because it takes physical work,

1158
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,820
I mean, stuff is happening when it's organizing itself,

1159
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,340
it has an energetic cost.

1160
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:13,300
So for that process to happen, to go against this tendency toward disorder,

1161
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,460
an organism or the system, maybe it's something that hasn't emerged,

1162
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,260
life hasn't emerged yet, but it's you're seeing like a proto organism,

1163
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:23,460
some sort of chemical, you know, autocatalytic network,

1164
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,340
some sort of chemical system that is self-sustaining.

1165
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:29,220
It has to get energy from the environment.

1166
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,460
So living systems have to extract energy from the environment to survive.

1167
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:38,060
And when they are extracting it to build that order to organize themselves,

1168
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,620
so that cost energy, that's the thing to understand.

1169
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:44,340
And when you're using that energy, it's always getting dissipated.

1170
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:48,300
It's always getting used up in the system's releasing heat.

1171
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,660
And that heat is entropy.

1172
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,060
So there's, I didn't get into it here, I'm kind of on purpose,

1173
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,900
but there's multiple definitions of entropy.

1174
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,060
There's entropy, which is dissipated energy.

1175
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,460
It's like heat entropy.

1176
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,100
And then there's entropy with the statistical definition,

1177
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,500
which just talks about disorder things and their different concepts.

1178
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,660
They really shouldn't even have the same name.

1179
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:14,340
Well, but, but, but the energy concept is kind of a subset of this disorder thing,

1180
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:20,580
but it just, it order form and that system release heat.

1181
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:23,140
So you can have the whole universe, if life's spreading,

1182
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,580
becoming more and more organized at the, at the whole global scale.

1183
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,980
While more heat is being generated.

1184
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,220
So whether entropy goes up or down, it depends on your definition of entropy.

1185
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,420
Heat entropy goes up because energy is always being used and spread out

1186
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,100
and you can't use that energy again.

1187
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:42,060
So if entropy is defined as the energy unavailable for work,

1188
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:46,700
that entropy is going up, entropy defined as organization, as disorder,

1189
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,820
that entropy is going down.

1190
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,940
So you have Boltzmann entropy going down as the world gets more complex

1191
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,860
and you have energy just being used up.

1192
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,820
And then that is called entropy.

1193
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:58,020
That's, that's a classical version of entropy.

1194
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:03,060
So my point is, and Jeremy England makes his point in his book,

1195
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,980
all of the evolutionary processes that happen in the biosphere

1196
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,020
are also using up energy from the sun.

1197
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,980
And as the biosphere becomes more complex, it uses more, it needs more energy.

1198
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,100
So it uses it.

1199
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,020
I think when you talk about dissipation too much, it gets the focus off.

1200
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,500
It makes it sound like life is trying to create entropy when it's not.

1201
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,500
It's trying to survive and it needs energy to survive.

1202
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,540
And entropy is the byproduct.

1203
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,420
So it's just like, art needs gas.

1204
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,860
It's not the goal to buy product.

1205
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,100
It's just exhaust.

1206
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:37,420
Yeah. So if you want to say the origin of life is an example of inference,

1207
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,340
that's right, and you have this dissipated adaptation mechanism,

1208
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,740
but you could also turn it around and be like, well,

1209
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,300
the inference process that Carl's describing in brains,

1210
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:51,420
which we'll quickly sum up in a second,

1211
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,300
is something that allows brains to better model the world

1212
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,540
so it can extract more energy.

1213
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,980
And then it is always extracting that energy and it's using that energy.

1214
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:04,460
So really, you have dissipated adaptation,

1215
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:08,220
which I believe is just another word for self-organization.

1216
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,180
It's thermodynamic self-organization.

1217
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:14,020
You have that on every level and that inference is also self-organization.

1218
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:19,100
So I think that there's things that are equivalent,

1219
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,060
learning and evolution

1220
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,940
and self-organization.

1221
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,620
Yeah. And so I think it's Bayesian inference.

1222
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,980
Evolution is, you know, variation and selection.

1223
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:37,020
And then self-organization is this dissipated adaptation.

1224
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,740
They're all the same things.

1225
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,980
So it doesn't really you don't you don't need to like put one

1226
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,900
having priority over the other.

1227
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,180
And that was a mistake a lot of people made

1228
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,940
because when Jeremy England's working that stuff,

1229
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,580
they're like, oh, it's well, it's all thermodynamics.

1230
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,180
The world just wants to create instruments.

1231
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,460
No, the world is organizing itself

1232
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:58,820
and it does it through this process and this mechanism.

1233
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,580
You can look at one aspect where you go to the systems learning.

1234
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:04,220
You can look at another aspect or say the system's using energy

1235
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:08,100
and creating entry and you can use another aspect and say it's adapting.

1236
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,740
It's evolving. Yeah. All. Yeah.

1237
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,580
You have a great time.

1238
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,540
It's not even an equation.

1239
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,940
It's just much equivalences in the book.

1240
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,180
It's adaptation equals statistical correlation,

1241
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:21,340
equals mutual information, equals model optimization, equals creation.

1242
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,180
I mean, that's I mean, but you're that gets to the crux

1243
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:28,220
of what we're talking about here is that.

1244
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,620
And I actually find this

1245
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,420
not specifically with with the gentleman we're talking about now,

1246
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,460
but if you may like zoom out a little bit,

1247
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,740
the word games that get played a lot.

1248
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:41,180
And I mean, it's just because that you need different

1249
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:44,340
terminal, different terms for different concepts, right?

1250
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,220
But a lot of times you start

1251
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,300
when you think about it a little bit more deeply,

1252
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,500
you realize, oh, that's pretty much the same thing.

1253
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,100
You know, we're just we're using languages is fungible

1254
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,260
and we're kind of getting around it.

1255
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,740
But I do and I mean, we could talk so much more about this stuff.

1256
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,340
I have a lot of questions in this area that I'm going to have to speak

1257
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:03,540
because I do want to focus while we have some remaining time.

1258
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,340
It looks like part three might not happen today.

1259
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,140
But what should we do with this information?

1260
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,820
If we might go from crawling, you know, we have

1261
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:14,820
organized some information and people should get the book to get all these details

1262
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:19,220
for themselves and also read your read your blog posts on Road to Omega,

1263
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:22,100
the Substack and Psychology Today as well.

1264
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,140
What do we do?

1265
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,460
Like, how do we make this practical?

1266
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,980
How do we bring this information into our day to day lives?

1267
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,700
Yes, so you can talk about that while I explain

1268
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:36,380
first sense theory in the context of that, because it's really.

1269
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:42,380
Yeah, first sense work and so he has the Bayesian brain

1270
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:45,700
hypothesis and the free energy principle, which is just the same

1271
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,900
Bayesian brain hypothesis, but apply the things without brains.

1272
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,940
And I realized there's so much here combined with the other work that I was,

1273
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:56,260
you know, looking at, you know, self organization and thermodynamics.

1274
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,940
There's so much here to inform practical living.

1275
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:03,180
And it's just crazy that, you know, no one has kind of

1276
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,940
used that information to not many people.

1277
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,500
I won't say no one, but not many people have used that information

1278
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,300
to inform people on how to live life.

1279
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,060
And the reason is because of the free energy principle.

1280
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,060
It's funny, Carl says it's simple and I agree with him.

1281
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,300
It is the simplest thing.

1282
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,180
But if you read the papers, it's the most complicated.

1283
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,980
thing in the world. Yeah, I disagree.

1284
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,540
I mean, it might be the most fundamental, but I explain why.

1285
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,700
So it's like both things are true at the same time.

1286
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,420
And it's like it is insanely complicated if you want to make it.

1287
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,260
But the general principle can is super simple.

1288
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,820
But I don't think people have applied it because they don't understand it.

1289
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,860
And I didn't understand it.

1290
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:43,540
I wasn't even sure if it was like legitimate science.

1291
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,580
That when I first looked at it, because it kept using these

1292
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:50,620
thermodynamic terms like free energy, which were defined not thermodynamically.

1293
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,620
It's like information theoretic free energy and comes from machine learning.

1294
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,860
It's based on thermodynamic free energy.

1295
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,580
But so I was like, what's this guy talking about?

1296
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:01,060
Like minimizing free energy in this way, but that's not free energy.

1297
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:05,260
So yeah, you just have to accept that new language will emerge

1298
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,260
because you need new words to explain new ideas.

1299
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,980
And it often comes from other fields.

1300
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:12,260
So there's going to be that confusion.

1301
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,260
And you just have to embrace all that and read the read the literature.

1302
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,060
And once you read it, you start understanding there's a lot of value.

1303
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:20,780
But basically, here's the story.

1304
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,820
You have this tendency towards disorder in the world.

1305
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:25,980
And it was great because I was already, you know, finished with part one

1306
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:26,780
all the thermodynamics.

1307
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,900
If I had already said all this stuff and talked about cybernetics

1308
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,740
and systems have them having to model the world.

1309
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,180
And then I found the free energy principle.

1310
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:36,780
And it was like everything that I was like the path I was down.

1311
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,060
It was like completed by that.

1312
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:41,620
So I'd already saw this picture before that.

1313
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:45,180
But basically, but it's cool because that's how Friston frames it.

1314
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,380
And for people who don't know, he's the most cited neuroscientist in the world.

1315
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:51,220
He developed these statistical techniques for analyzing FMI data

1316
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,500
that all FMI studies use pretty much.

1317
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:58,540
And so you have this tendency towards decay.

1318
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,820
So how do you explain life?

1319
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,660
He wants to explain the organization in the world.

1320
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:05,700
He says, OK, specifically organisms, which are the most interesting to us.

1321
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:09,980
They evade this tendency towards decay because they model the world

1322
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,420
and they because they have to survive.

1323
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,020
And if they don't have a map of the world, you can't survive in the world.

1324
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,620
So the the the brain has to create a map.

1325
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,260
And the free energy principle basically extend that and said,

1326
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:23,900
even organisms without brains, how encode some sort of map of the environment

1327
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:29,220
in their dynamics, in their genome, maybe in their metabolic processes

1328
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:32,260
and general functional dynamics at the system level.

1329
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:36,460
But so basically, it's the story of how do we, you know,

1330
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,780
how does life emerge and survive?

1331
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,180
It emerges.

1332
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:44,540
Well, OK, so yeah, how does life survive?

1333
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,860
Let's start there.

1334
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,780
Life survived because that's the model of the world.

1335
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,900
And if its model isn't accurate, if its map of the world isn't accurate,

1336
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,300
the thing is probably going to die.

1337
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,660
If you you have a wrong map of the world and something comes out

1338
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:58,180
and kills you because you didn't know about that variable, you're dead.

1339
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:03,260
And then that design of you is gone unless you've made copies of yourself.

1340
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,380
But that's a bit of a different design.

1341
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:08,060
And the people who do have good maps are successful.

1342
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,220
So those good maps keep getting encoded into the biosphere

1343
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,380
and to the network of organisms.

1344
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:15,180
And we keep updating our maps through natural selection.

1345
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,340
People die out.

1346
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,180
But when you have brains, you don't.

1347
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,060
Things don't have to die to get better maps in the biosphere.

1348
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,660
You can learn during your life.

1349
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,980
Things without brains, they can't learn.

1350
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:27,740
So if they're born in a certain way, they just have those characteristics.

1351
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,860
But so we can learn.

1352
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:35,700
But so what is simple about it is Carl Friston is basically saying this.

1353
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,620
All organisms minimize what's called free energy.

1354
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:41,660
Don't get hung up on you for the audience.

1355
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,060
Don't get hung up on the word free energy.

1356
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:51,300
He's saying in this context, free energy is defined as the model's prediction error.

1357
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:55,460
So the amount of mismatch between your model and reality is getting minimized.

1358
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,700
So forget free energy minimization.

1359
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:03,300
Just let's say that Carl Friston, Sirius says your model error needs to be minimized

1360
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,820
or else you'll die.

1361
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,620
And that we're always trying to do that.

1362
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:12,340
And if we don't pay attention to the evidence, like if we don't.

1363
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:20,580
OK, so for example, someone who has a belief that is contradicted by tons of evidence

1364
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:24,420
and tons of stuff they're seeing in the real world where it's just completely like,

1365
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:29,300
let's say you believe in purple fairy god and that's just your belief.

1366
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,460
Oh, that's hard one to disprove.

1367
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:34,020
Let's say you let's just do something a little more grounded.

1368
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:40,020
Let's say you think that gravity doesn't exist in Antarctica or something.

1369
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:45,500
You go to Antarctica and you you throw a ball from like a roof and it exists.

1370
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,420
If you if you don't update your model, if you don't go, oh, yeah,

1371
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,380
gravities exist because I came here and I did that test.

1372
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:54,820
And if you're denying the evidence that reality is giving you,

1373
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:58,660
then you're not minimizing your model's prediction error.

1374
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:03,420
You're you're you're choosing to stick with a model

1375
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,340
that has uncertainty or air or ignorance.

1376
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:11,300
And if you're living that way, you don't have an optimal map of the world.

1377
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,180
And if you don't have an optimal map of the world, you're not living optimally.

1378
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,620
So the book, you know, this is really what the second book's about

1379
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,460
and what I write about on Substack.

1380
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:24,060
But because I didn't have enough time with the deadline

1381
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,580
to really incorporate all this, you know, practical living stuff.

1382
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:31,620
But basically what this whole story tells you is that for or, you know,

1383
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:36,460
ordered things for for sentient, any sentient system to exist in the world,

1384
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:42,100
to continue existing, it has to be updating its map of the world to be more accurate.

1385
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,100
And that's just called minimizing free energy.

1386
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,420
Free energy is an information theoretic term between the difference

1387
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,580
between your model and reality.

1388
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:54,540
So we always want to be being our ignorance and we don't live that way a lot.

1389
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,780
We're not always updating based on our knowledge.

1390
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:57,980
We sometimes ignore it.

1391
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,340
We have confirmation bias.

1392
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:00,580
We want to keep that out.

1393
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,500
And if we do that, we're living suboptimally.

1394
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:06,420
So basically, there's different principles that you can follow.

1395
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,340
Be curious. That's one thing.

1396
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,380
There's a great paper by a friend of mine

1397
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:18,460
who wrote a paper with Carl Friston on active inferencing curiosity.

1398
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:23,660
So you got to be curious because your model is always going to be limited.

1399
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:28,060
None of us have infinite computational storage space.

1400
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:29,380
So we can't know everything about the world.

1401
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:30,500
The world's super complex.

1402
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,820
There's no way to know everything.

1403
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,220
So we're all living in ignorance.

1404
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:39,020
The best we can do is try to make our model as accurate as possible while living life.

1405
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,020
You know, you can't spend all of your time learning everything.

1406
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:45,700
So you have to decide how much information you want to acquire.

1407
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:48,420
But we should always be living in that way.

1408
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,820
We shouldn't get too stuck to our beliefs.

1409
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:56,940
We should always be open to new ideas because our model is limited.

1410
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,540
It's going to have ignorance.

1411
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,940
And once you accept that, then, for example,

1412
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:07,500
let's say people are asking questions about the origin of the coronavirus.

1413
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:11,980
It became un-PC to talk about a lab leak theory.

1414
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:15,140
That's very bad, according to this approach,

1415
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:17,820
because it could possibly be the theory.

1416
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:21,260
And maybe it's not, but you got to look into it.

1417
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:24,260
And if you notice, oh, there's no chance that it was a lab leak thing,

1418
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:30,540
then you can go, OK, you know, based on this stuff, there's very little reason,

1419
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:32,980
almost no reason to think that was the case.

1420
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:35,900
But that wasn't true when people analyzed it, what came out.

1421
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,500
And then seeing in everybody had it.

1422
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,220
And they didn't even like really say, oh, well, we did a terrible thing

1423
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:44,540
by telling everybody, do not think this like it is wrong.

1424
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:46,260
Think to think this way.

1425
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:48,380
And then everybody started talking about, well, it could be a lab leak.

1426
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,380
And there are tons of reasons why, you know, there's I'm, you know,

1427
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:57,820
I won't get into the political stuff, but the point is.

1428
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:03,100
A lot of people like Flat Earthers make this problem

1429
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,740
where they're not living in reality.

1430
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,380
They're not updating their model of the world.

1431
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,620
They're just denying what's out there.

1432
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:14,220
But you also have other situations where scientists

1433
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:16,180
maybe have this reductionist ideology.

1434
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:19,860
They're just over certain about life is transient.

1435
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,020
It's going to come and go.

1436
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:23,700
There's no such thing as free will because it goes against our Newtonian

1437
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,380
understanding of the world.

1438
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:29,900
That's a failure of being a good Bayesian to you because they are too certain.

1439
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,900
And if you look at history, every paradigm, every model,

1440
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:35,460
every theory has proven to have some inaccuracies.

1441
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:39,380
Thanks from, you know, Newton's laws, relativity,

1442
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:42,300
quantum mechanics hasn't been unified with relativity.

1443
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:43,740
So there's all these things.

1444
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,260
And in the nineties, we didn't even know.

1445
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:46,220
We thought we were at there.

1446
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,580
John Horgan wrote a book.

1447
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:50,620
It's the biggest mistake that you could do writing a book called.

1448
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:53,900
But, you know, it was worth it to help this, but it was called the end of science.

1449
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:57,820
And the idea was that we had we're almost done with understanding everything.

1450
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,620
And we thought we understood everything about physics

1451
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,860
is before we knew about dark matter, dark energy,

1452
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:04,260
which we only understood dark energy in the late nineties.

1453
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,260
And people thought we understood everything.

1454
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,900
And then they just try to explain to a consciousness as being an illusion.

1455
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,300
So they can back up science understands everything.

1456
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,740
Nothing, no mystery, definitely no supernatural, definitely no creator.

1457
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:19,100
But then she hit the fan and we realized we barely understand anything

1458
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,100
like most of the universe is stuff that we don't even know what it is.

1459
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,700
It's incredible. So.

1460
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:30,060
Basically, yeah, if you go on the road to omega

1461
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,700
subsec, I have these posts called the teleological stance.

1462
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:35,540
This post called that.

1463
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:40,060
I said first, yeah, actually, there are multiple posts on the teleological stance.

1464
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:43,500
But basically it's saying all living systems have an intrinsic goal

1465
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,220
and that's to survive against this tendency towards decay.

1466
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:50,940
So life does have a goal and a goal gives us a purpose.

1467
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:54,460
And the purpose is to see that life continues to exist

1468
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:58,140
because we're part of this larger system that's becoming more complex.

1469
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:01,100
And what I didn't mention is that it seems to be going towards

1470
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,140
a fully integrated self-aware state of the universe.

1471
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:08,260
And I'm definitely not arguing for panpsychism that everything's conscious.

1472
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:12,100
I'm saying that consciousness emerges because of some plan

1473
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:15,820
that we don't fully understand and that.

1474
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:22,980
And that consciousness, because it might be a scale invariant

1475
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:26,580
or substrate independent thing, that you're conscious

1476
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:30,060
because you have this collection of neurons that are exchanging information.

1477
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,140
And somehow consciousness emerges from that.

1478
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:34,340
In the book, I try to explain why that's probably happening.

1479
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:37,460
But if consciousness can emerge from a collection of cells,

1480
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:40,620
who's to say that consciousness can emerge from an interacting system

1481
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:42,300
of humans exchanging information?

1482
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,580
So that idea has been called the global brain.

1483
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:47,140
Maybe you could have some people think there's already a consciousness.

1484
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:48,220
This level, I don't think there is.

1485
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:49,540
I think there's a collective intelligence

1486
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,260
because you don't need intelligence to have consciousness.

1487
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:55,860
So as fear is intelligent, it's a self-regulating system.

1488
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:58,900
But I don't think it's conscious.

1489
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,500
But I think consciousness can emerge at these higher levels

1490
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:05,900
and that if life continues to spread through the universe and to do so,

1491
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:10,420
it has to keep extracting energy and it will keep molding the universe.

1492
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,660
It'll basically keep it will start incorporating the inanimate matter

1493
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:18,100
of the world into its computational substrate until the entire universe gets subsumed.

1494
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:23,220
And but it's not as if life is just taking over the universe.

1495
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:26,140
This was the story of the universe self-organizing

1496
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:32,740
into this completely functional, conscious, computational state mind.

1497
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:34,900
God, whatever you want to call it, doesn't really matter.

1498
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:38,260
It's just this unified state that will be this computational state

1499
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:42,060
of unimaginable power that that everything is moving towards.

1500
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:47,580
So it was really just a self-organizing system that has this dynamic

1501
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:50,020
and like part of it's being trained and accumulating knowledge

1502
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:54,940
until the whole system is an integrated system, the way an organism is the integrated system.

1503
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:56,340
So I think that's where it's headed.

1504
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,060
I'm about to come out with an article on Big Think

1505
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:02,580
analyzing new papers that have emerged from the small one in Jerellania

1506
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:06,100
and Microsoft Physicists saying that the universe is a learning machine.

1507
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:11,700
That was kind of influenced by another paper from 2020 by Vitaliy Vanshurne,

1508
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,860
who says the world's a neural network and these got articles, you know,

1509
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:18,140
popular mechanics articles, you can read these a couple of years ago.

1510
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:22,060
And what I'm arguing is that life is basically the universe is something

1511
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:25,580
like a neural network or an organism or a complex adaptive system.

1512
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:28,580
It's all just an information processing network that's emerging.

1513
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:32,460
And that life is part of this process and that's where it's headed.

1514
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:36,220
You can call it a God, you know, there's lots of crazy answers about like what that is.

1515
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,540
But that's what Ray Kurzweil believes.

1516
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,860
That's what the neural network guy that I mentioned.

1517
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:45,660
He also believes that that's inevitable that it's going towards that state.

1518
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:48,980
I talked to him a couple of days ago in person and he confirmed that.

1519
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:54,420
So it's a radical new story saying that the universe is waking up through life.

1520
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,260
But that gives us a purpose.

1521
01:09:56,260 --> 01:10:00,900
We're part of this larger grand process and we need to do what we can to continue

1522
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:05,900
intelligence and consciousness and experience and all those things that

1523
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:07,780
come from sentience.

1524
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:11,620
We need to do what we can to ensure that spreads throughout the universe.

1525
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:16,700
And that involves a collective mindset change where we realize to solve

1526
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:20,580
our existential problems, we have to come together because we to solve

1527
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:24,980
these problems are so big that the whole system needs to be using all of its

1528
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:25,940
computational power.

1529
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:30,180
So any civilization that emerges anywhere will have to go through

1530
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:34,500
the same sort of trajectory where they come together.

1531
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,300
And we've always been coming together.

1532
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,020
We've been coming together into societies.

1533
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:41,100
But the thing is when we come together into a society, we come together

1534
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:44,100
under a belief system and then a society emerges on this part of the world.

1535
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,700
And it's a different belief system.

1536
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:48,780
So there's those are two super organisms that are going to be in conflict

1537
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:50,860
because they basically have different genomes.

1538
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,140
They're different belief systems.

1539
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:53,700
So it's a genome at a higher level.

1540
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:55,020
It's a knowledge system.

1541
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:59,620
So they're going to compete until they learn that cooperation is easier

1542
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:01,180
and that makes every task easier.

1543
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:06,020
It makes extracting any, any, any, it makes extracting energy easier in any task.

1544
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:06,300
Really.

1545
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:08,820
So it's part of a process.

1546
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:09,740
It's inevitable.

1547
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:14,780
This is a trajectory that civilizations will go through on any biosphere

1548
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:18,340
where you have an intelligent civilization like this, but it's leading

1549
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:22,700
to that larger story and that gives us that frames life in a way that's never

1550
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:23,860
been framed by science before.

1551
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:27,740
It says we have a cosmic purpose and we can carry out this cosmic

1552
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:32,420
purpose by trying to facilitate a mindset of coming together, but it's also

1553
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:34,820
at the individual level where you try to live optimally.

1554
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:37,860
You don't do what's bad for the environment because it's going to hurt you.

1555
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:41,420
You don't live with an ignorant or an accurate model of the world because

1556
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:42,140
it's going to hurt you.

1557
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:44,020
And if it hurts you, it's not good for the collective.

1558
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,580
So we need to align our interests and we need to figure out how people can

1559
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:53,100
act in their own selfish interest, but at the same time, do good for humanity.

1560
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:57,500
So we just need to align the interests of the individual and the group

1561
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:02,660
to where we're getting synergy and

1562
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:09,460
without consciously adopting this mindset.

1563
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:13,140
And I think for people to adopt this, because without all the science behind it,

1564
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:17,300
it just kind of sounds like positive psychology or like self help, self

1565
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,620
help guru stuff or new age stuff.

1566
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:24,180
But I think with the science, you know, if people go, OK, the universe

1567
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:27,580
does seem to be self organized and there is this trend, there is a meaning.

1568
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:28,420
We don't know what it is.

1569
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:29,660
We don't know if there was a designer.

1570
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:30,140
We don't know.

1571
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,180
And we'll talk about that next time.

1572
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,060
But we don't know if it was a cosmological natural selection process.

1573
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:39,260
But all we know is that reality seems our reality seems to have this trajectory

1574
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:40,740
and we're part of this process.

1575
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:44,180
And that process is good because it leads to more experiences.

1576
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:46,620
If life ends, that's the end of experience.

1577
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:47,500
That's the end of love.

1578
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,660
That's the end of feeling, at least in our universe, that's the end of all that.

1579
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:53,180
So it's a good thing for life to exist.

1580
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:57,220
And out of this story, we get like a self help system.

1581
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:00,500
We get a way to optimize your life based on, you know, just

1582
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:07,420
acquiring information and behaving in a way that is compatible with your future goals.

1583
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:14,260
So is there is there like an exercise or is there prescribed activities

1584
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:15,780
or things, methods?

1585
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:16,620
I mean, yeah.

1586
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:23,140
So so this basically says it's basically an umbrella that goes, hey,

1587
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:28,340
that meditation stuff, you're improving executive control, you know,

1588
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:33,700
networks in your brain, like you're you're improving your ability to not act impulsively.

1589
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,860
So you're optimizing your behavior.

1590
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:43,060
It's an optimization process because if you behave,

1591
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:46,820
let's say someone makes you mad and you punch them or you stab them,

1592
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:48,500
you're in jail, you're done.

1593
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,700
That's like your goals are gone.

1594
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:56,900
So part of living optimally in like a base optimal way is making decisions

1595
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:01,940
and being aware of all of the possibilities and the consequences of those decisions.

1596
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:05,780
So the space of counterfactuals and choosing the decision that is in line

1597
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:09,220
with your goals and the idea is that your specific goals,

1598
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:14,660
if everyone is working towards those optimal goals,

1599
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:19,500
then that kind of harmonizes society overall, moving in the right direction.

1600
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:22,700
So meditation,

1601
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:29,980
any sort of like new age practice, spiritual practice, religious practice,

1602
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:33,660
even like praying, for example, makes you like aware, you know,

1603
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:35,780
people get mad at people, Christians are saying,

1604
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:40,380
pray for these people in the Middle East, like when they should really be doing

1605
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:41,780
something, your prayers aren't going to do anything.

1606
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:45,180
I don't think that's right because, yeah, they're not doing anything,

1607
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,540
but they could not be praying.

1608
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:49,180
And what praying is doing, at least they're making an exercise.

1609
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:51,980
They're going, there's people on the other side of the world that don't have my culture.

1610
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:55,460
And I'm going to imagine these people suffering and I'm going to ask them for help.

1611
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:58,700
They're building out a theory of mind when they're doing that.

1612
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:02,980
They're caring about those people because of that praying action more than they would

1613
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:04,820
if they never did that act.

1614
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:08,060
If they don't do that act, they're basically like an inanimate object.

1615
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:11,260
It's kind of like how we, you know, we don't really treat people from other cultures.

1616
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:15,340
Like the more we find in common with them, the more we start to treat them like ourselves.

1617
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:21,060
But so what I'm saying is the act of prayer is do all kinds of good stuff.

1618
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:24,020
Like also, like when you pray at night, you know, like, I'm thankful for this and this,

1619
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:28,100
that stuff that emerged through evolution because it's adaptive.

1620
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:30,940
So for us to throw that away, and that's what atheists have been doing.

1621
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:32,180
They're like, oh, we hate new age stuff.

1622
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:33,380
We hate religion.

1623
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:38,420
It's just going back to dark ages in some way, because all of those things are adaptive.

1624
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:44,220
So we need a new paradigm that merges science with spirituality and says all those practices

1625
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:47,580
aren't bad, believing bullshit is bad.

1626
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:51,500
You can die because you think homeopathy is going to cure your cancer.

1627
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:52,940
So that's not amazing.

1628
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:57,180
But what, but so I'm not, you know, saying everything is good about religion.

1629
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:00,980
But I'm saying these practices, most of them, the reason people,

1630
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:04,220
religion's not dying is because people find value in them.

1631
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,700
And for scientists and atheists to be like, we're just going to do

1632
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:10,380
whatever's the opposite of religion, which is what has happened.

1633
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:14,500
They're putting scientists, you know, these people had a big disadvantage

1634
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:19,580
or giving them an eye and actually religion, organized religion is sticking around

1635
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:22,220
because science is having that mindset.

1636
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:24,780
They're not realizing the power of that.

1637
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:28,820
And then the regular person is like, I don't give a shit about your multiverse theory.

1638
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:33,900
I want a belief system that's going to help me in life and give me a community

1639
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:36,620
and make me wake up in the morning feeling good about life.

1640
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:42,100
So they're actually hurting science by being like, oh, the spiritual practices are stupid.

1641
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,700
Oh, meditation is bullshit.

1642
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,900
Thinking that there's something higher is bullshit.

1643
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:49,380
So very unproductive.

1644
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:54,300
And I'm very passionate about this because these people are supposed to be

1645
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:57,420
like our thought leaders and tell us like what's right or wrong are saying things

1646
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:00,100
that are causing people mental harm.

1647
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,220
I mean, really.

1648
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:04,020
And Sabine Hassanfelders talked about this in her book.

1649
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:06,020
She even wrote like a disclaimer at the beginning.

1650
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:08,060
Like I've read an article saying free will isn't real.

1651
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:11,540
And I'm worried because people have contacted me saying that they've been very

1652
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,100
disturbed by this and people contact me too.

1653
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:16,900
And odd people say I got out of this nihilistic trap by reading your book

1654
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,620
and the free will arguments.

1655
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:21,820
So those people are not being good Bayseans either.

1656
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:25,100
They're way too certain where they're like free will is ridiculous.

1657
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,820
It's like, well, you don't understand high level causality

1658
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:31,860
because integrated information theory and Julio Tononi has two hour talk

1659
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,020
on the mechanisms of free will.

1660
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:36,700
And he says absolutely free will is a mechanistic thing.

1661
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:38,540
It's not supernatural and it's real.

1662
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:43,340
David Deutsch, one leading physicist who Sabine argues, you know, interviews

1663
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:47,580
in her book for a chapter on interviewed by John Horgan, the guy I mentioned earlier.

1664
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,220
He says, I'm sure we have free will.

1665
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:51,380
So it depends on how you define free will.

1666
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:52,740
And I've defined it in a certain way.

1667
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:55,380
But the idea is that there really is freedom.

1668
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:58,300
And if we're not using that freedom because we don't think we have it,

1669
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:02,180
we're living in a way where we're we're not going to exercise our agency.

1670
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:06,060
I think everything's determined and you're like, I want to help the world.

1671
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:09,740
And I have an idea like you might not put that idea out there.

1672
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:12,980
But if you realize I'm an agent and there it's everything is not determined

1673
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,900
like I can actually make a difference on the world, you're much more likely

1674
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,540
to to actually go through with what you're doing.

1675
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,740
Oh, sure. Yeah, I've said it for a long time.

1676
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:23,580
I'm not sure if I came up with this or I've read it somewhere else.

1677
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:27,620
But I believe in free will because when I don't, I make terrible decisions.

1678
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:30,460
You know, that's great.

1679
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:33,420
I can, yeah, I can rationalize, geez, anything.

1680
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:35,540
But I know you do have to.

1681
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:38,060
Yeah, it really does optimize your decisions believing in it,

1682
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:40,620
which suggests that it's real because if you didn't give anything.

1683
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:44,980
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a great that's a that's a huge conversation

1684
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:46,220
that can have to. Yeah.

1685
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:50,340
But one thing I do want to if you do have to run to wrap up a little bit

1686
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:54,740
and maybe give it like sort of a teaser for next time, this idea of cosmic

1687
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:58,900
complexity, you know, this heading towards this omega point.

1688
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:01,380
Can you give us and feel free to speculate?

1689
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:05,740
Feel I know you're the book is grounded in the great science and well researched.

1690
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:10,700
But your intuition, let's say, you know, deep inside yourself,

1691
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:12,460
something maybe some of you can't prove.

1692
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:18,420
But why why do you think this is all how it's laid out?

1693
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:21,540
Why do you think we're here?

1694
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:25,180
Like the ultimate question of like, why this big story?

1695
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:28,460
This, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, what's the purpose?

1696
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:30,460
Like, what's going on?

1697
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:33,140
Yeah, so I won't be able to answer that today.

1698
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:35,020
I'll give the short answer.

1699
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:39,100
But mechanistically, I think what's go like what explains it is basically

1700
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:40,900
the universe is moving towards this.

1701
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,100
It's the system moving towards an attractor.

1702
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:49,660
And so when you ask like, and I think this theory can inform quantum mechanics

1703
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,100
because it's like, oh, there's this wave function.

1704
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,220
There's all these different possibilities.

1705
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:56,460
And that's what kind of overthrew determinism is that we understand

1706
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:00,340
that there's this probabilistic nature due to quantum mechanics.

1707
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:06,980
But what I'm saying is actually the wave function collapse isn't random.

1708
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:10,780
If you have an isolated quantum system, it's going to look random.

1709
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:15,260
But when everything is interacting, everything, all those wave functions

1710
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:16,380
must be collapsed.

1711
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:20,660
And I know some people, you know, I haven't defined these terms, but yeah,

1712
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:23,540
just for like a high level thing, we'll talk about it more next time.

1713
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:27,380
But that that the collapse is if the universe is becoming more complex,

1714
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:30,740
that puts constraints on how the wave function collapses such that the collapse

1715
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:34,540
is much in totality add up towards going towards this omega point.

1716
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:39,740
So I think it is a new motivates a new theory of quantum mechanics.

1717
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:42,060
I mean, there are interpretations like quantum Darwinism,

1718
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:43,700
which are consistent with what I'm saying.

1719
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:46,100
But I think the universe is moving towards an attractor.

1720
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:51,860
And it's this this functional state of like the universe,

1721
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:56,180
being the self aware computational conscious state with the power of a God,

1722
01:20:56,180 --> 01:21:01,860
basically, and a God would be nothing more than a mind that has freeman Dyson said,

1723
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:07,300
a God is just a mind that has achieved power beyond our comprehension.

1724
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:12,940
So why do I think there's this design that's leading to that?

1725
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:19,220
Well, one explanation is cosmological natural selection is that the universe basically.

1726
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:25,500
Our universe, there is a multiverse, but it's not like every possibility exists.

1727
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:30,020
There was this evolutionary process where in Lee Smallman's model of cosmological

1728
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:34,660
natural selection, when you have a universe form and then a black hole forms in that universe,

1729
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:39,020
since a big bang is like a singularity event that creates a universe.

1730
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:41,500
The idea is that when a bit of black hole forms in the universe,

1731
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:44,620
that's a big bang event that creates a new universe.

1732
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:48,340
And that's how you have these ever this evolutionary process

1733
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:52,620
that's creating more and more universes and the universes that are good at creating black holes

1734
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:57,140
and black holes come from stars and stars create the chemistry that's needed for life.

1735
01:21:57,580 --> 01:22:00,180
Then you'll get more and more universes that create more and more black holes.

1736
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:02,300
So more and more universes that have more and more stars.

1737
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:05,740
And so this process will lead to more and more universes that are firmly for life

1738
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:08,180
because stars create the higher elements that are needed for life.

1739
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:11,940
And then so if this evolutionary process is true,

1740
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:16,620
you'll have the selection pressure towards getting more life-friendly universes.

1741
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:23,940
And then if the intelligence in that universe can engineer new universes by engineering black holes,

1742
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:28,300
and Alan Gooth, the creative cosmic inflation theory, says we should be able.

1743
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:32,220
He doesn't necessarily believe this theory, even though people do consider it.

1744
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:35,620
I mean, Leonard Susskin, string theory guy, said he's surprised at least more.

1745
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:39,260
And this theory hasn't gotten as much attention, like more attention.

1746
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:44,620
But even now, in Gooth's model, he still thinks we can create a universe

1747
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:47,260
by creating some sort of singularity event,

1748
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:49,820
even if he doesn't think that black holes are always creating these universes,

1749
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:54,500
which cosmic inflation kind of has a similar model where universes are created.

1750
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:57,420
But I'm not sure. I don't think it's the mechanism is to black holes.

1751
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:01,820
There's just these, yeah, I guess a little more complicated into inflation.

1752
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:06,740
But so the whole point of that and what small one isn't saying is

1753
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:09,940
if you look at the structure of this cosmological natural structure universe,

1754
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:14,420
it still inevitably leads to life and then it leads to life dominating and taking over.

1755
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:19,940
And that would lead to universes that become more and more complex and more and more intelligent.

1756
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:24,540
And ultimately, that would lead to an evolutionary process towards universes

1757
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:29,260
that lead to fully integrated omega point states,

1758
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:34,220
just because it's the pinnacle of this process and doesn't have to end there.

1759
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:37,300
Maybe our universe, once it reaches this fully integrated state,

1760
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:43,540
maybe there's some interaction with these other universes and that these omega points

1761
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:47,180
at this higher level will merge and form a larger super organism.

1762
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:53,620
If this story of nature's particles coming together and forming these aggregates

1763
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:56,940
at these higher levels keeps going on, maybe it's larger than this universe.

1764
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:59,420
So maybe it continues, I don't know.

1765
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:02,660
But the point I'm emphasizing here, which I haven't really emphasized before,

1766
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:08,460
is that it's still a teleological story.

1767
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:10,940
It's the one that we were trying to get rid of.

1768
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:12,340
Like, why is this universe designed?

1769
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:14,060
Oh, cosmological natural selection.

1770
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:17,420
But if you look at the multiverse of the cosmological natural selection world,

1771
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:23,500
it still starts off empty, I mean, lifeless and inevitably gets dominated by life.

1772
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:25,620
So it's the same teleological story.

1773
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:29,620
So even with the cosmological natural selection theory, we cannot get away

1774
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:32,060
from the teleological nature of the cosmos.

1775
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:38,260
There still seems to be a life generating principle, not just where it produces life

1776
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:45,180
in one universe of this vastly sterile multiverse, but that life spreads

1777
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:51,540
and the multiverse becomes fully biophilic.

1778
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:57,260
So whatever the answer is, there's still this life giving principle

1779
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:59,340
that I see as equivalent to God.

1780
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:04,020
And here's the thing, if you have this process, it's going to lead to intelligent

1781
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:08,580
beings like us who, because the laws of physics don't disallow this,

1782
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:12,540
create virtual worlds that then might have their own agents.

1783
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:17,580
So if we're creating that, then the process leads to creators too.

1784
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:22,820
And so in my view, it's kind of arbitrary to say, was our universe

1785
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:27,620
created or is it cosmological natural selection?

1786
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:30,820
I'm like, well, we don't know it could be cosmological natural selection

1787
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:32,340
or maybe that's not the right answer.

1788
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:36,860
Maybe our universe really is nested in another reality and we're a simulated world

1789
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:40,420
with a physical substrate, you know, just like we create computers

1790
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:43,540
with a physical substrate, but then there's a simulated world of virtual agents.

1791
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:48,860
There's no reason to to say that that's not a possibility.

1792
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:53,260
But here's my point, even if we were created by a creator, you have to explain them

1793
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:58,220
and then you could explain them as a as a result of this evolutionary process.

1794
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:04,500
But it's not the atheist one that leads to mostly still it's still a biophilic one.

1795
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:10,060
So my ultimate understanding was that nature has this life generating principle.

1796
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:11,780
It's really hard to determine.

1797
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:15,020
You know, we still have that why something from nothing problem.

1798
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,700
But we are making progress.

1799
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:21,460
It's not introducing unnecessary stuff by going outside this universe

1800
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:24,820
because we have the fine tuning mystery that is begging for a solution

1801
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:27,820
that we don't have unless we think about these other things.

1802
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:31,300
Creator cosmological selection and the multiverse theory,

1803
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:34,620
which I don't think is a good explanation because it introduces everything

1804
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:38,260
just to explain away a creator when we shouldn't necessarily need to explain

1805
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:40,780
a creator with every possible universe exists.

1806
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:43,020
It's just I don't think it's the right.

1807
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:45,220
I don't think it's superior epistemologically.

1808
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:47,020
Occam's are all the things we mentioned.

1809
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:52,260
So ultimately, I'm left with the process itself being God

1810
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,220
and that we could be created by an agent,

1811
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:58,340
but it wouldn't be this all powerful, fundamental thing that was there forever.

1812
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:03,780
It would be a product of this process, but that process seems to be eternal.

1813
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:07,940
So even if we have a God, a creator, I don't think if I learn about him,

1814
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,340
I don't think I'd pray to him.

1815
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:13,020
I think if we have a creator, it might be like us creating things.

1816
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,420
And then we want to ask our AI, like, is there a God?

1817
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:19,180
Like, maybe if we do have a creator, they're looking for us to answer.

1818
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:21,460
Maybe we're the AI that's going to inform them.

1819
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:25,060
But so even if we had a creator, I'm not necessarily sure

1820
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:27,180
that I don't think that would be the end of all answers.

1821
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:32,140
I think it's more spiritually satisfying to be like to just recognize

1822
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,060
there is a process that leads to life, leads to consciousness

1823
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:40,420
and unending consciousness reaching higher and higher levels of experience.

1824
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:45,180
And to me, that's kind of a Spinoza type

1825
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:48,780
pantheism thing. It's but it's beyond that because pantheism is

1826
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:52,220
oh, this world could be inanimate and sterile, but it's God.

1827
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:55,340
But like, this is really giving more of a reason to say

1828
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:58,340
the universe is God because it's not this arbitrary random thing anymore.

1829
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:00,340
It's this life generating thing.

1830
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:05,300
And so to me, that has all of the same qualities of a God.

1831
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:09,580
And I do think we could be somewhere far along in the process

1832
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:12,140
where we could be the product of an intelligent agent.

1833
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:16,100
And that agent could have created a moral moral art to this trajectory

1834
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:19,980
where our universe, they want to create something that improves and gets better.

1835
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:20,820
And that's what you're seeing.

1836
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:24,620
We're getting away from our original roots, kind of like

1837
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:27,740
kind of compatible with like this theory of original sin.

1838
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:30,460
But like we evolve from this animalistic thing.

1839
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:33,220
And as this trajectory happens, we get more moral.

1840
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:34,660
We develop a theory of mind.

1841
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:36,660
We start to understand that there are other conscious things.

1842
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:37,940
We start to treat them better.

1843
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:40,780
We start to understand we're part of the biosphere and the universe.

1844
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:42,780
We start to care more about the environment.

1845
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:46,100
So I think our evolutionary trajectory has a moral arc

1846
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:50,420
that is further evidence for some sort of purpose or design.

1847
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:56,740
And that part of me says, OK, there is something maybe to it.

1848
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:58,140
And maybe we're farther along the process.

1849
01:28:58,140 --> 01:28:59,060
Maybe there is a creator.

1850
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:03,420
Maybe they do care about what happens the way we create programs

1851
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,260
and we're interested in what happens.

1852
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:07,700
But it's a personal journey for me, too.

1853
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:11,740
I don't know. I mean, if is it why is there evil in the world?

1854
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:12,940
Why isn't it more perfect?

1855
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:14,940
I have questions for that. I'm like, trying.

1856
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,260
I think, you know, there can't be good without evil.

1857
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:17,980
It's all spectrum.

1858
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:20,460
There's no way to even define good unless you have something opposite.

1859
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:24,260
So maybe it starts off of good and evil because that's the only way it can go.

1860
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:28,580
But it evolves towards a more moral existence

1861
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:30,740
towards as you get closer to the omega point.

1862
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:32,780
So it's a journey for me.

1863
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:36,780
But what I am convinced by is that you do have this trajectory.

1864
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:40,140
And once you start asking what that should why it's this way,

1865
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,700
you get into all the explanations that I've just said.

1866
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:46,060
And I think they're better than the nihilistic multiverse.

1867
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:48,460
We're just weak anthropic principle version.

1868
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:51,820
And I think that's super exciting because I really think a Bayesian analysis.

1869
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:54,460
Anybody, I think Sean Carroll, if we have long enough talk,

1870
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:58,500
if you brought me and five leading physicists who are open minded,

1871
01:29:58,580 --> 01:30:00,980
Sean Carroll, Lee Smollon, maybe have some neuroscientists,

1872
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:05,460
Christoph Carl Friston, I think if you lay all these things on the table,

1873
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:09,940
we would quickly come to the consensus that at least what I'm putting forth

1874
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:14,460
is a good theory. Some people might say, oh, it's not as likely.

1875
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:17,620
They might say the multiverse thing in there, according to all of their stuff,

1876
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,340
is a little bit more likely than this.

1877
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:23,700
But there's no way that you can say that this isn't a legitimate scientific theory,

1878
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:26,100
whether it's our universe was created by an intelligent agent

1879
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:28,660
or cosmological natural selection.

1880
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:31,500
Like, and that's what I've been happy about.

1881
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,380
You know, the book could have come out and people could have said crackpot.

1882
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:38,420
Like, and it just could have got killed by like, you know, reviews and stuff like that.

1883
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:41,500
And no one might have given a blog who is not like a Christian person.

1884
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:45,420
But all the people that gave it blurbs and stuff were were scientists,

1885
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:47,540
people called themselves atheists or agnostics.

1886
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:51,700
I mean, there's not one Christian out of like the dozen blurbs I got.

1887
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:54,540
There's not one religious person.

1888
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:58,420
So I know the argument is compelling,

1889
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:04,980
but the argument makes all these other wonderful spiritual weird implications.

1890
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:08,700
And since people were willing to accept the first book, I'm like, OK,

1891
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:11,180
now it's time to open up the bag of worms.

1892
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:14,540
If you're going to put this on the table, which really, you know,

1893
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:16,740
it's not this opening up the bag of worms.

1894
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:20,020
The fact that you had all these unsolved mysteries that this starts to solve.

1895
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:22,860
But it's exciting because I think with what's going on in AI

1896
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:26,660
and these papers coming out arguing that the universe is a complex adaptive system,

1897
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:28,500
a learning system, a neural network or stuff.

1898
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:33,580
It's the it's the right time that this is about to like become, you know,

1899
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:35,340
there's going to be a cafes transition.

1900
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:38,940
There's going to be a shift in perspective that changes everyone's ideology.

1901
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:41,620
And that ideology will lead to greater harmony around the world.

1902
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:44,260
So I want to be part of that happening.

1903
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:50,220
And it's really exciting, but it just has to be done with care

1904
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:54,780
because it's very easy to scare people off when you talk about like the religious stuff

1905
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:57,700
and religious people are scared of evolution and stuff.

1906
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:03,140
So it would be wonderful if people go, OK, we don't know shit really.

1907
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:05,220
And we can.

1908
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:08,020
But there's stuff that we don't we that we know is not true.

1909
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:09,060
And there's stuff that we don't know.

1910
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:12,580
Like we can start to come together and be like, you know, religious and,

1911
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:15,740
you know, scientific people can be like, there does seem to be this purpose.

1912
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,980
And we do need to cooperate.

1913
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:18,100
We do need to come together.

1914
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:19,580
We do like all those things.

1915
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:22,860
So I'm excited to see where this goes.

1916
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:30,980
And I'll just make a prediction that in 10 years, if we have a conversation again,

1917
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:35,220
that this paradigm will be considered and I may not even be mentioned.

1918
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:37,420
I may not even be on like the wiki page for it.

1919
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:41,100
But I do believe that in 10 years,

1920
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:44,180
the idea that the universe is a self organizing system going

1921
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:47,820
towards this kind of a mega point computational, fully integrated state

1922
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:53,460
will be if not the leading theory, it will do basically

1923
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:57,220
with the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics that go from complete obscurity

1924
01:32:57,220 --> 01:33:02,980
to like start being like kind of like at one of the competing main interpretations.

1925
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:04,740
Yeah, that's so cool.

1926
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:06,860
And I hope it doesn't take 10 years for us to talk again.

1927
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:10,740
But one question before you go, I have to know, how did you choose

1928
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:12,860
that is a hop vibration on the cover, right?

1929
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:16,660
Yeah. So I don't know.

1930
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:19,380
I've heard I'm pretty sure it is. Yeah. Yeah.

1931
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:23,980
So I there was an interview for Eric Weinstein.

1932
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:27,580
I know he has a geometric unity theory and there was a similar structure on his.

1933
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:29,980
And I wonder if it was is that from like gauge theory?

1934
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,740
I bring it up. Well, partly it has.

1935
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:36,940
Oh, I bring it's really speaking to me now because I was very fortunate.

1936
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:41,300
About a month ago, I have a video on the hop vibration on that on that object.

1937
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:43,940
You got to watch it. Yeah. Well, I was so fortunate.

1938
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:49,340
It blew up a few weeks ago, and now it's like 800,000 views and counting,

1939
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:51,660
which is awesome. So congrats.

1940
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:53,340
Yeah, it's great. Thank you.

1941
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:57,860
And I don't know why it just kind of took off on its own.

1942
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:00,220
Yeah, that's what people shared it, too.

1943
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:01,180
Yeah, maybe.

1944
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:04,580
And I think Eric Weinstein was on some podcasts recently,

1945
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:06,460
so that might have just picked it up.

1946
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:12,020
But people are really drawn to this this geometric object for some reason.

1947
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:15,900
A lot of a lot of the comments have been people seeing this while,

1948
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:19,100
say, meditating or an altered state of consciousness.

1949
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:21,180
Very cool. I mean, a lot of people.

1950
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:23,700
And I mean, that's probably not so uncommon for.

1951
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:28,420
And a geometric object that's kind of interesting and has,

1952
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:31,060
you know, an undulate and stuff like that.

1953
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:34,380
But but I want to know if there was any like deeper significance behind.

1954
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:36,460
Yeah, so I'll cover because it's not in the story.

1955
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:38,460
Yeah, I could tell you the story.

1956
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:42,540
And I think I don't think she would mind me saying this.

1957
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:45,820
So the artist's name, Francesca Lorenzini,

1958
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:49,380
and on Instagram, she's Francesca Acacia.

1959
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:55,260
But she had all this art that was kind of she has a background

1960
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:57,140
in psychology and philosophy.

1961
01:34:57,140 --> 01:35:02,260
So it's very scientific and database.

1962
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:05,260
And so I'll link to I'll link to our stuff, too.

1963
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:07,780
Yeah, yeah, that'd be awesome.

1964
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:12,420
So I was looking through all of that art to like find

1965
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:15,700
the right thing, because I knew that had a certain stick.

1966
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:17,260
I have a few artist friends, too.

1967
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:21,100
I had in mind and the original one fell through.

1968
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:22,100
They just didn't have time.

1969
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:24,700
And it was going to be very similar to Anika Harris,

1970
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:28,300
this conscious cover where it's like all the sprawling organically,

1971
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:29,580
like kind of cosmic stuff.

1972
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:31,180
And that's where we were going to go with.

1973
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:33,940
But since she kind of stole the I mean, she didn't know about it.

1974
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:35,660
But I mean, I got scooped on that idea.

1975
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:39,460
So I was looking for this picture and I saw that and I asked her

1976
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:40,180
where she got it from.

1977
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:45,540
And she was like, I did acid like I saw that.

1978
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:48,260
I bring that up because you said people see that.

1979
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:51,380
So she had a psychedelic experience where she saw something like this.

1980
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:54,020
But then she went out looking for it and she found that.

1981
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:57,180
And it was like a MATLAB data visualization that someone had made.

1982
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,540
Yeah. But she tweaked it.

1983
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:00,420
She tweaked it.

1984
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:03,700
And then we put the person in it and we put it on the background.

1985
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:04,340
It's beautiful.

1986
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:07,060
But I didn't I didn't know what the structure was called even.

1987
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:11,060
And I had heard about those structures and I knew it was something like that.

1988
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:14,180
But I don't know if it's exactly the same thing.

1989
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:16,860
Oh, it is. I'm 99 percent sure it is.

1990
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:19,260
It shows loops and levels.

1991
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:22,700
It shows like the theme of the book, sort of like this recursive nature.

1992
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:24,140
And that's kind of mine.

1993
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:25,860
I think it's an important structure.

1994
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:29,260
It's technically a it's a mapping from a four

1995
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:33,540
hypersphere onto a traditional what we would call traditional sphere.

1996
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:36,780
So it's the fiber bundled and you can visualize it in many different ways.

1997
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:38,580
You just cut away most of the fibers.

1998
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:42,020
And those are sort of that's the visualization that she has there.

1999
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:46,220
And there are perhaps I don't quite know.

2000
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:49,780
I can't quite tell how important it is in physics.

2001
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:53,220
Apparently, there are seven, seven or eight different

2002
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:57,300
applications of it in fundamental physics situations.

2003
01:36:57,820 --> 01:37:00,540
I've been trying to reach out to the physicist who wrote a paper about it

2004
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:03,020
like 20 years ago, but I can't get in touch with him.

2005
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:05,980
So maybe I'll talk to Eric Weinstein about it

2006
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:09,820
because he thinks it's the most important object in the universe.

2007
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:12,500
But I can't tell, honestly, I don't want to.

2008
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:13,420
I can't tell either.

2009
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:17,140
I have an audience that I'm just not sure how important it is.

2010
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:18,060
It could be very important.

2011
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:20,940
It could be, you know, I don't know enough.

2012
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:23,180
I don't know enough Eric Weinstein's interesting

2013
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:25,980
because he's a person where I feel like I know a lot about science.

2014
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:29,500
I do not know enough about math that you to understand

2015
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:32,860
whether he's got some substantial ideas or not.

2016
01:37:32,860 --> 01:37:35,180
So that's something I want to deep dive into

2017
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:39,460
because anytime anyone's like I figured it out,

2018
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:41,860
I think it's worth looking into.

2019
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:44,740
But like I have no idea if it's important as he says to.

2020
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:46,820
It's interesting. I definitely want to learn more about it.

2021
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:48,460
But I do I do think it is.

2022
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:51,740
I mean, some in some way, like that's why I used it.

2023
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:53,500
I think it captures everything.

2024
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,140
And I think we're like an early stage in mathematics

2025
01:37:56,140 --> 01:37:58,060
where we haven't started to understand.

2026
01:37:58,060 --> 01:38:00,940
I've been talking to people about this, like recursive sets and stuff.

2027
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:02,380
There's these structures.

2028
01:38:02,380 --> 01:38:07,820
I do think he's on to something and we need to to learn more about it.

2029
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:10,220
But yeah, I think if anything,

2030
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:14,500
it kind of supports this idea that reality is structured

2031
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:16,700
through loops and levels, which we didn't really talk about.

2032
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,540
But there's there's hierarchical organization

2033
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:20,900
and there's all these feedback loops.

2034
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:23,900
And so I think it probably is like

2035
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:28,460
some kind of key to unlocking the secrets of reality.

2036
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:30,060
Yes, possibly.

2037
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:31,740
And it's funny because we didn't talk about it.

2038
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:33,580
And I think you do mention in the book,

2039
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:35,740
but Douglas Hofstadter's girl, Esher Bach,

2040
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:38,260
which is all about loops and levels.

2041
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:42,420
And I read that like two summers ago for the first time

2042
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:44,260
and blew my mind. Yeah.

2043
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:48,500
But I will say since that book, my favorite book is yours.

2044
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:51,860
The romance of reality.

2045
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:53,820
Please go out and read it, people. It's fantastic.

2046
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:55,420
So thanks so much, Colin.

2047
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:56,820
This has been a lot of fun.

2048
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:58,300
Yes, I can't wait for round two.

2049
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:00,260
I have a bunch of questions I'll say for next time.

2050
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:01,740
And I just really appreciate your time.

2051
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:03,220
Thank you, Bobby. Let's do it.

2052
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:04,620
All right. Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
