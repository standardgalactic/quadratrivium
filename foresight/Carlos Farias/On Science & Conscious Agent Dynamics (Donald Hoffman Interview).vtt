WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
Don thank you for coming on. Thank you Carlos for inviting me. It's a pleasure to be back.

00:04.800 --> 00:10.560
Yes, I'm so excited and the viewers are too to have you on for round three. For anyone who

00:10.560 --> 00:14.640
hasn't yet caught the first two rounds of our conversations, those will be linked below in

00:14.640 --> 00:20.320
the description. People who want to catch up. And today what we'll do is we'll type some loose ends

00:20.320 --> 00:26.800
and cover some topics that we haven't had time for in previous conversations. And as an extension

00:26.800 --> 00:32.560
from round two, where we primarily covered your fusions of consciousness paper, which came out

00:32.560 --> 00:39.280
earlier this year. And just to give the audience a very brief summary of what that paper entails,

00:39.280 --> 00:46.400
as you propose a theory of a network of conscious agents that serves as the basis of the fundamental

00:46.400 --> 00:51.360
level of reality. And then emerging from that through a series of steps is everything that we

00:51.360 --> 00:57.280
know. So everything is space and time, quantum dynamics, everything comes emerges from that

00:58.240 --> 01:03.680
from that proposal. So I'd love to hear and get it kicked off here. What has been the reception

01:03.680 --> 01:12.160
to that paper so far? Well, it pretty well, it's it's already been cited. So it's pretty early

01:12.160 --> 01:19.040
for a paper to be cited. Yeah, literally same year. And in the that journal, apparently,

01:19.840 --> 01:25.120
that's the highest downloaded paper in the last of papers, all their papers in the last six months

01:25.120 --> 01:30.800
or something like that. So Wow. So it's gotten not a no 11 or 12,000 downloads, which for a geek

01:30.800 --> 01:35.840
paper is pretty good. That's a pretty great in entropy, right? That's an entropy, right?

01:37.840 --> 01:44.080
So that's awesome. Yeah, it's pretty good. But of course, the proposal itself is quite radical. So

01:44.160 --> 01:52.240
I expect and enjoy pushback and feedback. That's how science works. If you put out radical proposals,

01:52.240 --> 01:58.640
you need to be prepared for all sorts of counters. And that's how you learn. Absolutely. And it takes

01:58.640 --> 02:03.680
time. Yeah, as you put it, it's very early, early days. But it doesn't take time for people to

02:03.680 --> 02:09.120
write critiques and get back and to build off the theory itself. And one thing I'd be really

02:09.120 --> 02:16.080
interested to hear about is core to your to your work is the Amplity Hedron. So the work from Neymar

02:16.080 --> 02:23.760
Connie Hamed, his discovery, or maybe invention, I think it's probably more of discovery, but of this

02:23.760 --> 02:29.760
geometrical object that sits outside of space time. I was wondering, do you I haven't quite seen any

02:29.760 --> 02:34.320
collaborations with between you and Neymar. But have you spoken with him? Are you have any

02:34.400 --> 02:42.320
dialogues with him around your ideas? Not yet. I mean, I think I would enjoy doing that at some

02:42.320 --> 02:50.080
point. The Amplity Hedron, by the way, is for massless particles. And so it's not the whole story

02:50.080 --> 02:57.840
as Neymar himself would say, working on other structures like the EFT Hedra that are for all

02:57.840 --> 03:03.920
particles of all masses and spins. The real deep structure there is the decorated permutations.

03:03.920 --> 03:10.320
So we've really connected with decorated permutations. We have a, in the fusion's paper,

03:11.120 --> 03:20.320
we show how to take any Markov chain and map it canonically into decorated permutations. So we

03:20.320 --> 03:27.840
give a dynamical, for the first time, a dynamical interpretation of these Amplity Hedra, well,

03:27.840 --> 03:32.640
the decorated permutations behind behind the Amplity Hedra, in terms of entities that are

03:32.640 --> 03:39.360
undergoing a Markovian dynamics. So yeah, we'll see where that leads. But we've been then

03:40.640 --> 03:46.480
using that to figure out, okay, how do we map from the Markov chain now to specific properties,

03:46.480 --> 03:56.320
like momentum and spin and energy and so forth. Because the decorated permutation link does tell

03:56.320 --> 04:00.720
us what parts of the Markov chains to focus on when we're trying to think about how they map

04:00.720 --> 04:09.120
to particles. So that was the real win in getting the fusion's paper result, that it showed us what

04:09.120 --> 04:15.520
part of the dynamics we needed to focus on in trying to figure out the mapping between the

04:15.520 --> 04:21.040
concentration dynamics and properties of particles, like position momentum and spin and energy.

04:22.480 --> 04:28.800
Gotcha. And one thing I, as I was doing research prepare for this conversation, I stumbled upon

04:29.360 --> 04:34.320
a presentation you gave last year at Chapman University at the mine and agency conference.

04:34.960 --> 04:41.280
And I was going through that and noticed you had a slide, and maybe I'll even, with your permission,

04:41.280 --> 04:48.560
I can overimpose this, just so folks can see it, showing the links from the conscious agent

04:48.560 --> 04:52.560
level all the way up to the Amplity Hedron. And I was wondering, are there any differences, because

04:53.280 --> 05:00.080
if I recall, it was asymptotic behavior, feeding into permutations, feeding into Birkhoff polytubes,

05:00.080 --> 05:04.160
feeding into the positive grass mania, and then feeding into the Amplity Hedron. So it's a lot

05:04.160 --> 05:10.240
of steps there. And is that where you landed with the fusion's subconscious paper? Because I think

05:10.240 --> 05:16.320
when we discussed it, there were, maybe it's condensed the levels a little bit. But is that

05:16.400 --> 05:22.880
still accurate? Is that still the same framework? Shortly after we gave, after I gave that talk,

05:24.160 --> 05:30.960
we discovered this projection onto the decorated permutations. And so we actually

05:30.960 --> 05:36.480
view this as a step forward from the talk that I gave at the Chapman University, that there we

05:36.480 --> 05:45.200
were mapping onto the asymptotics directly, but we were trying to figure out how that mapping went.

05:45.200 --> 05:50.720
We didn't understand exactly how we would project onto the asymptotics. And it was in thinking through

05:50.720 --> 05:58.000
that, that we discovered this mapping onto the decorated permutations, which gave us a direct

05:58.000 --> 06:02.960
link into the deepest structure that the physicists have found. So I'm actually much happier. And I

06:02.960 --> 06:09.920
have a talk that I gave at Stanford, which is similar to the Chapman talk, but the Stanford talk

06:09.920 --> 06:18.480
is like the Chapman talk, but it updates that slide and talks about the new results about

06:18.480 --> 06:24.480
mapping markup chains into decorated permutations. And so we worked pretty quickly to get that paper

06:24.480 --> 06:30.960
out by this January. The fusion's paper, will we go into that? Gotcha. Okay, I'll have to look for

06:30.960 --> 06:36.160
that Stanford talk and I will link to that in the description of this video for curious viewers.

06:36.160 --> 06:42.080
Because also, I think I noticed that talk, whoever uploaded it, the volume is extremely low

06:42.080 --> 06:46.080
on that Chapman University. So I had to turn it up all the way and put on captions in order to

06:46.720 --> 06:52.480
follow what was happening there. Yeah, sorry. Stanford talk is a little bit easier to understand

06:52.480 --> 06:58.400
and get to here. And there we have the updated for the fusion stuff. But even since the Stanford

06:58.400 --> 07:02.960
talk, we've been made far more of progress. Things I would have loved to talk of Stanford,

07:02.960 --> 07:08.800
but we didn't discover them yet. Yeah, it's happening too fast. And one question from one

07:08.800 --> 07:16.160
of the commenters on the last video was from Dennis Sovin. He asks, or she I make sure,

07:17.200 --> 07:21.760
extremely interesting. Thank you. Are there any experimental evidence available? Or do you have

07:21.760 --> 07:29.120
any projects planned to prove the fusions of consciousness proposal? Yes, we have. We've been

07:29.120 --> 07:40.320
working on a computational experiment to do this to test this. So and the logic of our experiment,

07:40.320 --> 07:47.440
we need to find something inside space time that we can explain based on this dynamics of

07:47.440 --> 07:52.240
conscious agents beyond space time. So the question is where what there's lots of stuff in

07:52.240 --> 07:57.280
space time to try to target to try to explain with a computational experiment. So what is the most

07:57.280 --> 08:04.560
intelligent and most accessible thing that we could do? And you might say, well, neuroscience,

08:04.560 --> 08:09.520
right? That seems to be the most related to consciousness. And so if you're having a theory

08:09.520 --> 08:14.640
of consciousness from outside of space time, surely you want direct related directly to brain

08:14.640 --> 08:22.640
activity. But that's brains are really complicated physical objects. You know, some people say

08:22.640 --> 08:26.880
they're the most complicated thing that people have ever discovered in space time.

08:26.880 --> 08:31.280
That may not be where we want to start. Of course, ultimately, we ought to understand it. And

08:31.280 --> 08:37.280
I'm a cognitive neuroscientist. So I've actually studied the brain for for decades and done FMRI

08:37.280 --> 08:44.400
and EEG and collaborative experiments and so forth. But if we're having a theory outside of

08:44.400 --> 08:52.000
space time and mapping it into space time, what we want to do is test it where it's the simplest

08:52.720 --> 08:59.200
and easiest to test it. And so what we're proposing is to test it

09:02.000 --> 09:08.240
at what particle colliders are finding when they study the inside of protons. So they smash

09:08.240 --> 09:15.680
electrons into protons, for example, a very high energy electron ion colliders. And they

09:16.400 --> 09:20.720
look at what happens, you know, you destroy in many cases, you destroy the proton in the process,

09:20.720 --> 09:26.160
but you see all these quarks and gluons and a sea of quarks or it depends on the energies,

09:26.160 --> 09:31.520
what they call the the Q squared, the energies and also the the temporal resolution that the

09:33.120 --> 09:41.360
Bjork and X and so forth. So what we're proposing to do is, and this proposal will come out in on

09:41.360 --> 09:48.000
June 24, it's, you know, it'll be made public on June 24. We're proposing a series of experiments

09:48.000 --> 09:54.880
to show that we can get the exact momentum distributions of the the quarks and gluons at

09:54.880 --> 10:00.480
the all the various values of Bjork and X and Q squared that have been tested at at colliders,

10:00.480 --> 10:06.560
in other words, to map to match the momentum distributions exactly. And so we would need

10:06.560 --> 10:13.680
to find a master Markov chain, and a specific set of trace chains, so called Markovian trace chains,

10:14.640 --> 10:19.040
and then temporal windows of sampling of those trace chains that give us exactly

10:19.680 --> 10:25.280
the sequence of momentum distributions from high Q squared and Bjork and X, you know, all the values

10:25.280 --> 10:30.080
that they that they map. So that's what we're going after. And again, that sounds, well, gee,

10:30.080 --> 10:34.000
you're going after, you know, high energy particle physics, that sounds really, really

10:34.000 --> 10:40.320
complicated. I want you to start with neuroscience. It's just the opposite. The particles, what are

10:40.320 --> 10:46.800
particles? The elementary particles, physicists will tell you, are nothing but the irreducible

10:46.800 --> 10:53.120
representations of the Poincare group of the symmetries of spacetime. In other words, they are

10:53.120 --> 10:59.280
the most simple aspects of the actual geometry or symmetries of the geometry of spacetime.

10:59.920 --> 11:06.080
So if we're going to make a connection, that's where we have the most data, and where it's

11:06.080 --> 11:11.360
complicated, as it might seem, it's the least complicated thing that we can do. So that's

11:11.360 --> 11:16.480
why we're going after that. I'm not a particle physicist. I'm learning as much as I can. But

11:16.480 --> 11:21.760
fortunately, we've been joined by a world class particle physicist, Schrapo and Chatterjee,

11:21.760 --> 11:29.760
who's who's collaborating with us on this, who, you know, likes our ideas. And so we have a real

11:29.840 --> 11:35.600
first rate particle physicist who's been at the forefront for, I don't know, 30 or 40 years.

11:36.160 --> 11:44.160
That was CERN and Fermilab, who's not collaborating with us, Chaitan and Prakash. And we have a

11:44.160 --> 11:53.920
student, Ben Nepper, and then me, so four of us working on this idea. So that's where we intend

11:53.920 --> 11:59.120
to go. Then we want to crawl our way up. Of course, eventually we want to get to, you know,

11:59.120 --> 12:04.880
brains and neuroscience and so forth. But if you can't get quarks and gluons,

12:06.720 --> 12:12.080
you're not going to get brains. You got to start where, you know, where there's really hard data

12:12.080 --> 12:17.600
and where people can really push. And you can you really know the mapping from the dynamics of

12:17.600 --> 12:24.080
conscious agents, precisely into space time, at the smallest scale. And then you can crawl your

12:24.080 --> 12:32.240
way up. I presume we're going to have to crawl our way up through, like, we're starting with,

12:32.240 --> 12:37.040
you know, sub nuclear physics, then we need to go to nuclear physics, then we need to go to chemistry.

12:37.680 --> 12:44.320
And then we can crawl our way up to biology and then to brain science. We need to go systematically

12:44.320 --> 12:50.080
and make sure each step up is secure. So yeah, the question is, of course, a great question.

12:50.720 --> 12:55.520
And we have to start, we have to reverse the ladder of physics, we have to start at the bottom,

12:55.520 --> 13:00.480
quote unquote, and climb up the ladder, the typical way that people think about physics and

13:00.480 --> 13:05.360
all the way up through biology. They think of it as the basic science and then the special sciences,

13:05.360 --> 13:11.840
right? We're turning it around, we're saying, no, wait a minute, physics is not the basic science,

13:11.840 --> 13:18.480
consciousness is, and physics is just the simplest part of our interface. It's the most

13:18.480 --> 13:22.080
elementary part of our interface. And so that's why we're connecting with the simplest part of

13:22.080 --> 13:27.120
the space-time interface, and then building our way up to the more complicated parts of it. Sure.

13:27.680 --> 13:32.800
Great question. Yeah, yeah, thank you, Dennis Oven. And I might have some other, yeah,

13:32.800 --> 13:37.200
commentary questions sprinkled throughout here as well. So really appreciate that. If people

13:37.200 --> 13:41.200
will comment below with questions, you know, that's, that's, that's, that's be really great.

13:41.920 --> 13:48.640
I actually think this, this feeds into something that we've literally, I've mentioned at the end of

13:48.640 --> 13:52.000
both of our interviews where I was like, I can't believe we didn't get to this one topic because

13:52.000 --> 13:59.040
I really want to talk to you and dive deep into this. It's the UVIR interaction, which I learned

13:59.040 --> 14:05.280
about through your interview with Jonathan Pageau. And can you explain what this is for the audience?

14:05.280 --> 14:09.040
I think that there's some deep implications here, and I have a bunch of different questions to ask

14:09.040 --> 14:14.960
you about that. But could you, could you set us up with, with what this is? Yeah, it's, it's

14:14.960 --> 14:26.160
truly profound and important aspect of modern physics. It, the, the big success in physics has been

14:26.160 --> 14:34.160
reductionism until recently, right? Statistical thermodynamics is an incredibly successful field

14:34.160 --> 14:42.720
where you can explain phenomena like heat and entropy and heat and thermodynamics at a macro

14:42.720 --> 14:49.680
scale by thinking about reducing to smaller scale and looking at the dynamics of little

14:49.680 --> 14:56.240
particles and looking at the, their distribution of entropy and so forth. That gives you a deep

14:56.240 --> 15:04.320
insight into heat and thermodynamics. So that's, that's a real win for standard reductionist

15:04.320 --> 15:08.480
kinds of thinking. And the hope had been that, well, we can just continue that we can just keep

15:08.480 --> 15:14.000
going. So the kind of reductionism I'm talking about is, I mean, there's many kinds of reductionism,

15:14.000 --> 15:19.920
but I'll be very specific about the reductionism. As you go to smaller and smaller scales of space,

15:20.880 --> 15:27.200
the hope is you'll get to more and more fundamental elements of reality and more and more fundamental

15:27.200 --> 15:32.400
laws. And the hope is that, that will continue forever. We will continue to go to smaller and

15:32.400 --> 15:38.400
smaller scales, find more and more fundamental constituents of reality and, and more and more

15:38.400 --> 15:45.520
fundamental laws that govern those. And that, and that has worked up dramatically well. But

15:45.840 --> 15:53.920
we actually know that our, our best theories of physics, namely Einstein's series of spacetime,

15:53.920 --> 15:59.440
special and general relativity and quantum field theory are, which is based on spacetime. The

15:59.440 --> 16:06.000
fields are defined over spacetime. So the, our modern best physical theories, which are, you

16:06.000 --> 16:12.720
know, assume spacetime at their core also tell us the very mathematics of those spacetime based

16:12.960 --> 16:18.960
theories tell us that spacetime itself cannot be fundamental, that it ceases to have any

16:18.960 --> 16:24.960
operational meaning at the Planck scale, 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, 10 to the minus 43

16:24.960 --> 16:30.720
seconds. And what you find is, as you try to go smaller and smaller, but for example, using

16:30.720 --> 16:36.080
light with finer or radiation with smaller and smaller wavelengths, right? That's how you resolve

16:36.080 --> 16:41.520
finer and finer details. Well, when you do that, you know, quantum theory, in fact,

16:42.480 --> 16:47.520
Einstein in 1905 is equals H new kind of with light tells you that you're going to get more and more

16:47.520 --> 16:52.160
energy. The smaller the wavelength, the more and more energy. And then Einstein also told us in

16:52.160 --> 16:57.520
1905 that energy equals mass. And as theory of gravity tells us, well, that Matt, you know,

16:57.520 --> 17:06.240
as you increase the mass energy density of the vacuum, space is going to curve. And the problem is

17:06.240 --> 17:13.360
when you get beyond a certain point of mass energy density, spacetime gets a singularity,

17:13.360 --> 17:20.160
it actually falls apart, you get a black hole. And so it ceases to have any operational

17:20.160 --> 17:26.720
meaning. And this is well known. I mean, for example, in 2005, David Gross published a paper.

17:26.960 --> 17:38.240
He won the Nobel Prize in 2004, by the way, for his work on, I think, quantum

17:38.240 --> 17:44.000
criminodynamics. So in 2005, you know, basically, you know, celebration of Einstein, you know,

17:44.000 --> 17:50.560
the centenary of Einstein's special relativity theory, 1905 to 2005, he basically said, thank you,

17:50.560 --> 17:55.360
you know, wonderful job, and now spacetime is doomed. And that's the way science works, right?

17:55.440 --> 17:59.760
You thank people for their incredible contribution. And then you show the holes,

18:01.040 --> 18:05.280
and the way forward. And so he pointed out spacetime is doomed and cited a bunch of people

18:05.280 --> 18:10.160
who are saying spacetime is doomed. And the problem is this, what you mentioned, the UVIR.

18:11.120 --> 18:16.160
Typically, so UV, physicists talk about UV when they say they're going to smaller and smaller

18:16.160 --> 18:22.320
scales with higher and higher energies. So an IR is what they talk about when they go to, you know,

18:22.320 --> 18:27.600
larger scales and lower energies. But it turns out as you try to push to smaller and smaller

18:27.600 --> 18:32.960
scales, you're trying to go UV, more and more UV, what happens is you create a black hole.

18:33.600 --> 18:38.240
And as you put more energy in, the black hole gets bigger. That's so you're starting to get bigger.

18:38.240 --> 18:43.040
So now the scale is getting bigger. So that's sort of a UVIR kind of thing that you thought

18:43.040 --> 18:48.560
you were going to go smaller. And instead, you're going bigger. And so you're starting to see that

18:49.360 --> 18:55.360
basically, why the UVIR thing is so important is it means the death of reductionism,

18:55.360 --> 19:00.400
of the kind of reductionism that I just talked about. Some people, when they hear me say this,

19:00.400 --> 19:06.320
will say that they think I'm saying there's, it's the death of scientific explanation.

19:06.320 --> 19:11.920
No, no, no, no. Scientific explanation is one thing. It's a broad class of theories.

19:12.720 --> 19:19.840
Reductionism is just one kind of scientific explanation. That particular flavor of scientific

19:19.840 --> 19:26.000
explanation, which is the, you know, the UV going to UV and getting smaller and smaller scales

19:26.000 --> 19:34.800
and getting deeper and deeper entities and, and laws, that works up to a point and then it falls

19:34.800 --> 19:40.080
apart. Our best theories tell us that. So that's why it's so important. I should mention another

19:40.080 --> 19:47.360
reason why this whole thing is so important because it tells a beautiful story about how

19:47.360 --> 19:53.040
science works. It's, I think, not really well understood. And here's the kind of misunderstanding

19:53.040 --> 20:04.400
that can come up. I just said that Einstein and quantum theory assume that space time is fundamental

20:05.120 --> 20:10.160
and they take that assumption and they try to build a mathematical model, right? So Einstein's

20:10.160 --> 20:15.680
special and general relativity, quantum field theory, fields defined over space time. So they,

20:15.680 --> 20:20.480
they take the idea that space time is fundamental. They make it mathematically precise.

20:22.320 --> 20:26.160
But then their mathematics comes back and tells you that space time is not fundamental,

20:26.160 --> 20:31.440
that space time is doomed. It doesn't even make sense beyond 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.

20:32.000 --> 20:39.040
So here, so a lot of people will say, aha, well, we've caught physics in a, they've shot

20:39.040 --> 20:45.360
themselves in the foot logically. And here's the logical problem. You assume to begin with that

20:45.360 --> 20:51.040
space and time are fundamental or space time is fundamental. You then went ahead and took that

20:51.040 --> 21:00.960
intuition and you put mathematics to it. Now, either your mathematics faithfully represents

21:00.960 --> 21:07.920
that space time is fundamental or it doesn't. Suppose it does faithfully represent that space

21:07.920 --> 21:11.840
time is fundamental. Well, then how in the world could it come back and tell you that it's not

21:11.840 --> 21:18.720
fundamental? Surely that wouldn't happen. Okay, so forget that. So therefore, it must be that your

21:18.720 --> 21:23.040
mathematics didn't faithfully represent your intuition. That space time is fundamental. And

21:23.040 --> 21:28.160
if it didn't, then why could you even trust it to tell you that space time is not fundamental?

21:28.160 --> 21:34.160
So you couldn't pot. So in other words, there's no way, according to this, this kind of logic,

21:34.800 --> 21:39.520
without self contradiction, you couldn't use your, your physical as theories to show that

21:39.520 --> 21:46.240
space time is not fundamental. So the, so the whole thing is, is, is just a self contradiction.

21:46.320 --> 21:54.240
So that's the way, you know, some philosophers will argue about this kind of thing. And here's the,

21:55.040 --> 21:59.680
the problem with that is very, first my simple, gee, how do you get out of that? I mean,

22:00.960 --> 22:04.080
looks like you've really shot yourself in the foot. How do you get out of it? Sure.

22:04.080 --> 22:10.960
It's quite simple. It completely misunderstands scientific theories. Scientific theories make

22:11.040 --> 22:16.800
assumptions. And when you, when you write down a scientific theory, you know that your assumptions

22:17.440 --> 22:23.280
are just assumptions. They're fallible. They're not the final word. And so what you do when you

22:23.280 --> 22:29.120
write down a scientific theory is you try to get a mathematically precise statement of those

22:29.120 --> 22:35.920
assumptions. And if you've done it right, your mathematics will itself tell you the limits

22:35.920 --> 22:43.600
of your assumptions. And that's what you want. Because when, so the mathematics will tell you

22:43.600 --> 22:49.040
the power of your assumptions, the area of application of your assumptions, what problems

22:49.040 --> 22:54.400
they can solve. But the mathematics will also tell you the limits of your assumptions. And we know,

22:55.120 --> 23:01.840
a priori, that there is no theory of everything. There isn't. There's all, there's only a theory

23:01.840 --> 23:07.600
of everything except my assumptions. And you'll always have to get deeper and deeper assumptions.

23:07.600 --> 23:14.160
And that's a never ending process. And so this is essential to how science moves forward.

23:14.800 --> 23:19.520
At every step, you will take your intuitions, you'll put them to mathematics.

23:21.440 --> 23:25.920
And then the mathematics will come back and tell you the limits of the intuitions, the assumptions

23:25.920 --> 23:31.680
in your intuitions. If it's a good theory, if it's a bad theory, it'll just pat you on the back.

23:32.400 --> 23:37.840
And, and, and you won't make any progress, right? You, what you want is a theory that comes back

23:37.840 --> 23:42.880
and slaps you in the face and says, at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, precisely, your theory

23:43.920 --> 23:50.240
ceases to make sense. It has no operational meaning. That's what you want. So, and the same thing has

23:50.240 --> 23:57.040
come up with my theory about conscious, well, I have a theory in terms of using evolutionary game

23:57.040 --> 24:02.800
theory to show that, that evolution shaped us not to see reality. So that, that space and time and

24:02.800 --> 24:10.320
the notions of organisms and resources and competition for resources is not fundamental.

24:10.320 --> 24:16.080
And the same argument has been used against that. People will say, look, okay, Darwinian evolution.

24:17.520 --> 24:21.360
That assumes organisms in space and time competing.

24:21.840 --> 24:27.120
Nature, red and tooth and claw for limited resources and mates and so forth. So either the

24:27.120 --> 24:36.000
evolutionary game theory accurately modeled those intuitions, or it didn't. If it didn't

24:36.000 --> 24:42.960
accurately model them, then you can't use it to disprove, you know, the fundamental nature of,

24:42.960 --> 24:47.760
you know, organisms and space, time and resources and competition. And if it did

24:48.320 --> 24:54.720
accurately model Darwin's ideas, then it couldn't possibly contradict Darwin's ideas. So you're,

24:54.720 --> 25:01.680
so once again, you've shot yourself in the foot. And again, the answer is that completely misunderstands

25:01.680 --> 25:11.680
the most elementary aspect of scientific theory building and progress. We want to, to get mathematical

25:12.640 --> 25:18.080
models of our theories that show us the, the limitations of the fundamental assumptions

25:18.080 --> 25:23.680
because they, they are necessarily going to mean that limitations. That's necessary

25:24.320 --> 25:28.720
because there is no final theory of everything. And once you realize that, then the whole question

25:28.720 --> 25:32.480
about this particular kind of shooting yourself in the foot goes out the window. Of course,

25:32.480 --> 25:35.840
there are, there are ways to shoot yourself in the foot logically, but this isn't one of them.

25:36.400 --> 25:43.200
Sure. Yeah. No, that's really great. I agree, I agree with you. The, I think one thing,

25:43.920 --> 25:50.640
maybe we could just follow back on a little bit, because as, as you pointed out, I do think it's

25:50.640 --> 25:56.240
a very powerful idea that the UV IR interaction, and it's not something that I think is in a,

25:56.240 --> 26:02.560
a popular, you know, consciousness for very few people know about this, this dynamic that occurs.

26:02.640 --> 26:09.200
But what I, what seems to happen is, so you have the, the ultraviolet, the, the smaller

26:09.200 --> 26:15.760
higher energy scales you have infrared, the very large scales. And is it, is what happens,

26:15.760 --> 26:23.280
is it kind of wraps around where the micro laws come back around to the macro laws, or

26:23.280 --> 26:27.920
does it push back upward? Like, where is, if we had to think about it, if you had to

26:27.920 --> 26:33.840
analyze it, how would you do it? Well, I would say that the physicists themselves are, are really

26:35.040 --> 26:39.600
eagerly exploring that very kind of question, because it looks like there's a lot to it. The

26:39.600 --> 26:46.160
mathematics suggests all sorts of UV IR interactions. So this is, I would say right now, a very hot

26:46.160 --> 26:55.280
topic in, in, in physics, high energy physics research. So, so the one I mentioned about,

26:55.360 --> 27:00.240
you know, as you try to go to smaller scales, you effectively are making a bigger black hole,

27:00.240 --> 27:04.400
so you're going to larger. That, that's just one symptom. I think that there are going to be many,

27:04.400 --> 27:11.200
many more UV IR correspondences. So, so I think that that's, that what I mentioned is just the tip

27:11.200 --> 27:15.920
of a big iceberg. And the physicists themselves are just now beginning to really explore that,

27:15.920 --> 27:20.080
that huge iceberg. So it's still a pretty big mystery. We don't really know, because I was

27:20.080 --> 27:28.480
wondering if, like, I think about it in terms of, let's say you had UV at the floor, the ground

27:28.480 --> 27:35.440
level, you have IR at the ceiling, let's say. So it's like, if you go in one direction or the other,

27:35.440 --> 27:40.080
does it pop back around? Like, if you go through the ground, does it pop back up through the ceiling,

27:40.080 --> 27:46.480
or instead does it, does it go through the, does it go back up? Does it bounce back? Or

27:46.480 --> 27:53.120
does it wrap back around? If that makes sense. We don't know the right kinds of questions. And

27:53.120 --> 28:00.320
we may, you know, our theory of consciousness outside of space-time may help, eventually,

28:00.320 --> 28:06.800
in understanding this, because what we're saying is that the space-time itself is nothing but

28:07.840 --> 28:12.640
a fairly trivial data structure. It's a four-dimensional, I mean, if it's string theory,

28:12.640 --> 28:20.400
maybe 11 or 12-dimensional, whatever. But the dimensions of the dynamics of the

28:20.400 --> 28:28.080
consciousness outside of space-time could be, you know, quadrillions of dimensions. I mean,

28:28.080 --> 28:32.080
it's just the number of dimensions, and these are not dimensions curled up inside space-time,

28:32.080 --> 28:37.600
like you think about in string theory, you think about these are small dimensions that are in some

28:37.600 --> 28:43.200
sense inside space-time, curled up inside. Now, these are entirely beyond space-time,

28:43.200 --> 28:49.360
entirely outside, and space-time itself is, you know, a relatively trivial data structure,

28:49.360 --> 28:53.760
a user interface that, you know, systems of consciousness use to interact with each other.

28:54.320 --> 29:02.000
And so that framework may be what we actually ultimately will need to understand this UVIR

29:02.800 --> 29:12.480
back and forth of just space-time as merely a data structure, an interface that maybe the

29:12.480 --> 29:19.440
framework we have to go to, that way we actually will see the limits of that data structure.

29:19.440 --> 29:24.720
Yeah, one question I had, and also a commenter I'll have to find over the name of the commenter

29:24.720 --> 29:29.200
and overlay it on the screen for this portion, because I can't remember who it was, but there's

29:29.280 --> 29:37.440
a question about how the epithetodendron, which I believe it maps for particle scattering with its

29:37.440 --> 29:48.160
volume, how does an object have volume outside of space and time? Well, so for example, think about

29:49.120 --> 29:59.200
the volume of a square, a 5 by 5 square. Well, it's, let me say 5 inch by 5 inch,

29:59.200 --> 30:03.040
but 5 units, whatever the units might be. Well, then it's 25, right, 5 times 5.

30:03.040 --> 30:12.000
Okay, now go to a three-dimensional cube. So it's an object that has the same length

30:12.000 --> 30:16.880
in three dimensions. Now, what is its volume? It's 5 times 5 times 5, which would be 125, right?

30:17.680 --> 30:21.840
Well, now go to four dimensions. Well, that's 5 times 5. So it's 5 to the fourth.

30:21.840 --> 30:28.080
Now go to six dimensions, 5 to the sixth and so forth. Now go to 10 dimensions, 5 to the 10th.

30:28.080 --> 30:32.720
And so in each case, you can compute the volume, no problem. And all you're doing is you're,

30:32.720 --> 30:41.360
you're, so the way to think about this is our ability to visualize as human beings

30:41.840 --> 30:50.320
is pretty trivial. We can visualize in two dimensions, three dimensions, and it stops.

30:51.520 --> 30:58.400
It's very easy for us to think that the pretty pathetic limitations of our intuitions

30:59.280 --> 31:07.440
put a hard and fast limitation on the nature of reality. No, no, no, no, no. I would love

31:07.440 --> 31:14.560
to be able to visualize in a thousand-dimensional space. I'm stuck with three, three piddling

31:14.560 --> 31:21.200
dimensions. And I feel that limitation all the time. It's my limitation. It's not

31:21.840 --> 31:29.440
a limitation on reality. It's a limitation on my paltry imagination. So where our,

31:29.440 --> 31:35.840
our visualization abilities fall apart, at least we have enough visualization abilities to get the

31:35.840 --> 31:41.360
picture. Oh, okay, a square five times five, five times five. Okay, four dimensions, it must be five

31:41.360 --> 31:47.760
to the fourth. So we get the pattern and then we realize we can go up to three dimensions.

31:48.480 --> 31:54.800
Reality goes limitless. Quadrillions of dimensions, Google dimensions,

31:57.280 --> 32:05.200
and then infinite dimensions. So, so there, that's where mathematics is so powerful,

32:05.200 --> 32:11.360
where we, our intuition stop at three, mathematics can go to infinity and beyond.

32:12.400 --> 32:16.880
Right, absolutely. And staying in this, I mean, we're going to stay in the non-intuitive

32:16.880 --> 32:20.960
kind of landscape for a little bit because I have a bunch of questions to ask you in the,

32:20.960 --> 32:26.960
regarding the quantum, quantum space, a quantum realm, let's say, a quantum mechanics. And the

32:26.960 --> 32:34.640
first is, so you get space time from your fuses of consciousness, your network of conscious agents,

32:35.280 --> 32:40.400
and the quantum, everything is very not intuitive, you know, it's, it's outside our

32:40.400 --> 32:46.320
regular comprehension. Does your theory of a network of conscious agents, does that

32:47.360 --> 32:52.800
like lend itself towards explaining some quantum phenomena, like things like the delay choice,

32:52.800 --> 32:57.920
quantum eraser experiment, like the really, the really strange stuff that were, we seem like

32:57.920 --> 33:04.240
miles away from trying to understand or getting to understanding. Does, does it lend any credence

33:04.240 --> 33:10.000
to that? Or does, does it help explain that? Are you finding any interesting early evidence there?

33:10.960 --> 33:17.040
Right. So, so the answer is yes. And I should say that the physicists themselves, for example,

33:17.040 --> 33:20.160
like Nima or Connie Ahmed, when they say that space time is doomed,

33:22.320 --> 33:27.040
they're also saying that quantum theory is doomed. Yeah, both. That is not fundamental. And

33:27.600 --> 33:34.000
that he, he says that he thinks that they will both arise, quote unquote, joined at the hip

33:35.040 --> 33:44.320
from some deeper structure. And the idea is that, yes, I think that that's correct. And that we will

33:44.320 --> 33:49.440
get not only space time, but quantum theory arising from as a projection of this theory of conscious

33:49.440 --> 33:59.360
agents. Now, the weirdness of quantum theory is largely because I claim it's a projection. It's

33:59.360 --> 34:06.560
not the full, the reason we have to use the amplitudes and, and, and do all the, the complicated

34:06.560 --> 34:12.000
stuff in quantum theory. And we get things like entanglement and so forth is because quantum theory

34:12.960 --> 34:22.000
is only giving you a mathematics of a projection of reality, not the full reality.

34:23.440 --> 34:29.280
And, and so there's been some work even by quantum theorists showing that many of the properties

34:29.280 --> 34:34.000
of quantum theory, and by the way, people who want to actually check on this, there's a paper by

34:34.000 --> 34:39.280
Chris Fuchs, FUCHS, called Quantum Bayesianism. Oh yeah, I was going to ask you about that next.

34:39.840 --> 34:44.960
Right. And, and he goes in and actually talks in that paper about many of the properties of

34:44.960 --> 34:54.240
quantum theory that that are simply due to lack of information. And so it's no surprise if space

34:54.240 --> 35:00.480
time is a projection of this deeper dynamics of conscious agents and that dynamics of conscious

35:00.480 --> 35:05.680
agents could have countless dimensions and lots of things going on in space time has four dimensions.

35:05.680 --> 35:11.360
And it's just a trivial projection. It's no surprise that most of the information is lost.

35:11.360 --> 35:16.320
And so quantum theory really is the mathematics of how to deal with partial

35:17.200 --> 35:22.400
knowledge when you've lost most of the knowledge through projection. And so that's what we're,

35:22.400 --> 35:29.040
that's how I see this thing going. But, but yeah, of course, our, as I mentioned earlier on, we want

35:29.040 --> 35:33.440
to first show that we can get the momentum distributions of the quarks and gluons inside

35:33.440 --> 35:37.280
protons, but eventually mean ultimately we want to show that all of quantum theory

35:37.280 --> 35:39.840
arises as a projection of this dynamics of conscious agents.

35:40.800 --> 35:44.480
Yeah. Yeah, I was literally going to ask you next about Chris Fuchs, because he,

35:45.280 --> 35:50.160
I mean, I see a lot of overlap between your theory and quantum Bayesian Bayesianism.

35:50.720 --> 35:56.640
And especially because I was rereading your fusions of conscious paper. And as you point out a few

35:56.640 --> 36:04.400
minutes ago, trying to make as few, that's the word, trying to make as few presumptions as possible

36:04.400 --> 36:10.240
going into your theory, you make, you make only two, you posit that there are conscious experiences.

36:10.240 --> 36:14.160
Seems very basic. I'm with you on that. I think most people would be anyone watching this.

36:14.880 --> 36:18.800
I got to say you're having a conscious experience. So it's gonna be hard to debate that.

36:18.800 --> 36:23.680
And then the second one is that there are probabilistic relations among conscious experiences.

36:23.680 --> 36:27.280
That seems, yeah, sure, I'm with you there. And that seems to be

36:28.160 --> 36:34.560
to overlap very highly with Cubism, which was just the shorthand for quantum Bayesianism.

36:35.280 --> 36:39.280
And even Fuchs in a 2010 paper, he wrote this quote, I thought was great,

36:39.280 --> 36:42.960
quantum mechanics is an addition to Bayesian probability theory,

36:42.960 --> 36:48.000
not a generalization of it, not something orthogonal to it altogether, but in addition.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.240
Which I thought was really interesting, because he's like layering out saying,

36:52.320 --> 36:57.280
what's more fundamental? And it's this, this, this probability. And of course, probability

36:57.280 --> 37:03.360
relations are, are core to your theory as well. So are there, can you, is there an overlap there?

37:03.360 --> 37:09.520
Or can you compare contrast? Is there a difference? Yeah, I know Chris. Yeah, we were there together

37:09.520 --> 37:15.440
at the Chapman University Conference and so forth. I've been trying to persuade him to

37:15.520 --> 37:24.320
join our, join us and work with us on this stuff. But yeah, so there's a lot in principle that we

37:24.960 --> 37:32.720
agree on. I don't know that he's, Chris in his paper of quantum Bayesianism

37:33.280 --> 37:39.200
points out that, you know, the observer is really important, right, that quantum theory is basically

37:39.200 --> 37:45.040
a story about how the observer takes track of the data and counts for their own data and,

37:45.040 --> 37:50.640
and what they, so it's, but he says, I don't owe you a theory of the observer. I'm a physicist,

37:50.640 --> 37:54.880
I don't owe you a theory of the observer. And of course, that's what I'm after here. I'm doing

37:54.880 --> 37:59.520
that the theory of conscious agents is a theory of the observer. And I think ultimately,

38:01.840 --> 38:08.320
without a theory of the observer, you'll not make progress. You really, that's what we're

38:08.320 --> 38:13.680
saying. We're saying conscious agents, these agents are experiencers, they're, they're observers.

38:13.680 --> 38:20.560
And it's only when you actually study the dynamics of observation that you're going to understand

38:20.560 --> 38:25.680
how physics arises as a projection, you know, space-time physics arises as a projection of that.

38:25.680 --> 38:30.240
It's just one of, one trivial projection out of countless other kinds of projections that you

38:30.240 --> 38:38.880
could have. So, so, you know, Chris and I, you know, we're friends. I enjoy talking with them.

38:39.600 --> 38:44.800
And I would love to have them collaborate. But we'll see. I mean, it's,

38:47.360 --> 38:56.800
maybe if we get success on modeling quarks and gluons, we can rope Chris in to join us. Well,

38:56.800 --> 39:01.840
we'll see. I like Chris. He's, he's, he's brilliant, of course. And, and, and we have enough differences

39:01.840 --> 39:06.880
that is, that there's a good, it's a good interaction because there are differences. And

39:06.880 --> 39:11.840
so that's what you want in a scientific collaboration, right? Sure. Absolutely. And the other,

39:11.840 --> 39:16.480
a couple of other things on the quantum side before moving into some more non-physics territory in a

39:16.480 --> 39:24.480
bit. The, that I wanted to ask you this one on our last conversation, the recent Nobel Prize winners.

39:24.480 --> 39:32.160
So, Aspect, Klauser and Zellinger. If you could, did you mind just explicating for the audience

39:32.160 --> 39:38.560
a little bit about, I mean, as a groundbreaking work over many decades, you know, they all had,

39:38.560 --> 39:44.480
I was tracing out like, oh, this is decades apart, their, their work. And they found that this is

39:44.480 --> 39:50.640
from Quanta, some wonderful publication for folks who are familiar with it. But they wrote, I think

39:50.640 --> 39:56.240
the high level summary is that they found reality has no fixed and predetermined state until you

39:56.240 --> 40:00.960
measure it. That's what they found. That's right. That's true of John Bell's. But would you, could

40:00.960 --> 40:05.520
you give us like just a high level summary of that and, and I guess how it plays into your work?

40:06.320 --> 40:14.880
So, so yes, the, the, the recent Nobel Prize last December was for the experimental

40:16.320 --> 40:24.640
test of the prediction of quantum theory that local realism is false. So local realism has two

40:24.640 --> 40:32.640
parts. One is locality, which says that particles have properties that whose influences propagate

40:32.640 --> 40:38.800
no faster than the speed of light. So properties, the influences can't, you know, there's a speed

40:38.800 --> 40:46.000
limit on the universe and you can't exceed that, at least for information transfer. And the, and

40:46.720 --> 40:58.320
that's locality. Realism is the, the claim that particles have definite values of their properties

40:58.320 --> 41:03.760
even when they're not observed, like position, momentum and spin. And Einstein was famous for his,

41:04.880 --> 41:11.840
you know, support for realism. He said that, you know, if without disturbing a system, you can predict

41:11.840 --> 41:16.960
with probability one, the value of a property, then that, then that value of the property

41:18.080 --> 41:23.520
really does exist and it really did exist, right? That's, that's realism. And most people would side

41:23.520 --> 41:27.680
with Einstein. Of course, right? You can predict with probability one before you measure without

41:27.680 --> 41:32.800
disturbing it, what, what the value is, then the value did exist before. And it really is real. And,

41:32.800 --> 41:38.320
and so, so, so most of our intuitions would line up with Einstein that realism is true. But

41:39.280 --> 41:43.920
quantum theory says, no, local realism is false. And that's what the,

41:45.200 --> 41:49.280
the Nobel Prize for over several decades, you know, starting in Clouser and

41:51.280 --> 41:59.760
Aspect and then Zeilinger, the over decades, these guys did the test and then closed loopholes in

41:59.760 --> 42:05.920
the previous test and then closed more loopholes because this is such a big one. I mean, our intuitions

42:05.920 --> 42:12.640
are so much against local realism being false. We believe local realism. We believe realism.

42:14.560 --> 42:21.200
That, that they really needed to go to all sorts of links to close any possible loopholes. And,

42:21.840 --> 42:31.920
and so it's just plain false that particles have definite values of properties when they're not

42:31.920 --> 42:38.080
observed. And by the way, Chris Fuchs paper, again, the quantum basing paper, gives an example.

42:38.720 --> 42:42.560
He, if you, so people want to see, you can see an actual quantum example

42:43.280 --> 42:48.240
that that, that, that he goes through, it's not Fuchs example of, you know, himself, he's quoting

42:48.240 --> 42:53.120
and explaining some other work by their physicists. But, but Fuchs, Fuchs paper is a great place to

42:53.120 --> 43:01.840
do it because he gives a good explanation. A quantum setup where you can know with probability one,

43:02.560 --> 43:09.040
what value you will get when you make a particular measurement, but you can prove using quantum

43:09.040 --> 43:15.040
theory and that particular experimental setup that it's impossible for the value to exist prior to

43:15.040 --> 43:20.880
you making the measurement. So you, so Einstein was wrong. Here's a quantum system where you know

43:20.880 --> 43:26.240
with probability one, what you're going to get without disturbing the system when you measure

43:26.560 --> 43:32.400
without disturbing system, you know, with probability one, what the value is that you're

43:32.400 --> 43:37.600
going to get when you do measure the system. And you can prove that that value does not exist

43:38.800 --> 43:47.040
prior to the measurement. So, so that's the real kicker is that that the act of observation

43:47.680 --> 43:53.600
is not an act of fact discovery. It's an act of fact creation, which is the kind of

43:54.320 --> 43:58.240
thing that John Wheeler would like to say, the, you know, the act of observation is an act of

43:58.240 --> 44:04.720
a fact creation. And, and that's what the, the theory of consciousness is saying as well that

44:05.680 --> 44:11.200
the coin of the realm are conscious experiences. And that's, and that's what's happening is we're,

44:11.200 --> 44:16.240
we're, you know, the fundamental reality are these conscious experiences that arise and disappear.

44:16.880 --> 44:24.160
And space time itself is just a user interface. One possible out of many, many countless

44:24.960 --> 44:30.640
other possible interfaces that we could use to interact with the other conscious agents.

44:31.280 --> 44:34.800
You know, I'm looking forward once we kneel down in relationship with

44:35.360 --> 44:39.600
space time to then start to explore all, all the other kinds of interfaces that are possible.

44:39.600 --> 44:44.960
Space time is, is not the only one and it may not be a particularly interesting one. It may be

44:45.600 --> 44:49.520
I think, probably trivial one. I think we got saddled with a cheap model.

44:51.520 --> 44:56.080
Maybe it was the best we could afford, Don. I think that there are conscious agents out there

44:56.080 --> 45:01.360
with interfaces where they can understand, they can, they can imagine 50,000 dimensions. And I,

45:01.360 --> 45:07.360
I'm jealous. Yeah. At least we're not stuck in one dimension or one in the, like the second

45:07.360 --> 45:12.400
dimension, you know, flat land. I was going to ask you like maybe E. Coli, maybe, maybe E. Coli only

45:13.360 --> 45:18.880
Yeah, who knows what their perceptual experience is like. The, I wanted to ask you,

45:18.880 --> 45:23.920
next was going to be about John Wheeler and has it from Bit, the participatory universe that he,

45:24.960 --> 45:32.560
that he posited. Does that, I mean, I know that's, you know, it's, that's an idea that decades old

45:32.560 --> 45:37.840
and it's not such a popular idea anymore. Or what, I don't know if it ever really caught on.

45:38.560 --> 45:44.160
Um, he had some pretty out there ideas like the one electron universe and everything, but,

45:44.160 --> 45:51.040
but it from bit in particular, the participatory nature of things that seems fairly similar to

45:51.040 --> 45:54.640
what you're, what you're proposing here, right? Is there any tie with, with your theory?

45:55.760 --> 46:05.280
I, I agree with you. And, uh, I think Wheeler agreed. He actually cited me. And is it from

46:05.280 --> 46:13.760
bit paper? Oh, I didn't realize that. Wow. Yeah. 1989. Wow. I, um, with, with, uh, Bruce Bennett

46:13.760 --> 46:22.480
and Chaitan Prakash, we published a book called Observer Mechanics in 1989. And it, it 300 pages

46:22.480 --> 46:28.800
of math, which was our first attempt at this theory of conscious agents. And Wheeler cites it

46:28.800 --> 46:33.280
in his it from bit paper. I think it's like reference 170, 175 or something like that.

46:33.280 --> 46:39.840
So if you want to see it, it's Bennett, Hoffman, Prakash, and he cites. So he'd actually seen our,

46:39.840 --> 46:47.680
our book. And, uh, we, in fact, in our book, use the notion of a participator as the technical

46:47.680 --> 46:54.000
term. And we got that from Wheeler, right? So we, we, we chose the term participator,

46:54.000 --> 46:57.360
which was sort of our, our, our name for conscious agents in that book.

46:58.320 --> 46:58.960
Gotcha.

46:58.960 --> 47:02.640
conscious agents were, we called them participators. We had a more coding dynamics of

47:02.640 --> 47:09.680
participators. So, so yes, we were influenced in our 1989 book by Wheeler's ideas, at least

47:09.680 --> 47:15.360
for the language that we used. Um, and then Wheeler was, had clearly looked at our book and,

47:15.360 --> 47:21.280
and liked it enough to cite it in his it from bit paper. So, and I think a lot of physicists

47:22.080 --> 47:27.200
like Wheeler's idea, but don't know what to do with it. Right? I mean, Wheeler,

47:28.400 --> 47:33.760
it's the kind of thing where you go, there's, there's, he's onto something and he's, he's a genius

47:33.760 --> 47:38.960
and he was, everybody understood. He was, you know, a physicist genius and, you know,

47:40.400 --> 47:46.160
very famous physicists were his students. Feynman was a student of Wheeler's and so forth. So,

47:47.040 --> 47:51.680
uh, he was nobody's fool. That's for sure. He was, he was brilliant. You can't dismiss him out of

47:51.680 --> 47:57.120
hand. It was, I think a lot of physicists think that, you know, there may be something deep there,

47:57.120 --> 48:00.480
but, but you know, science has to, you know, physics has to catch up. We have to get to the

48:00.480 --> 48:08.480
point where we can, you know, put beef on the idea that, that Wheeler saw and hopefully the

48:08.480 --> 48:15.360
theory of conscious agents may be a step in that direction. Gotcha. That's great. And then the last

48:15.360 --> 48:22.160
physics piece before we jump into some non-physics stuff, Seth Lloyd and his ontology of qubits and

48:22.160 --> 48:26.720
gates, which I know you've referenced in at least one of your papers before, you know, you were

48:26.720 --> 48:32.320
pursuing a different ontology than his, but I don't know if you, if you followed his work

48:32.320 --> 48:38.800
in that space at all, but it also seems similar in some respect to sort of like Wolfram's work

48:38.800 --> 48:46.080
with the computational sort of digital universe concept and ideas. But do you have any comments

48:46.080 --> 48:50.480
about Seth Lloyd's work or if that has any overlap with, with what you're working on?

48:51.040 --> 48:55.440
Well, there, there is a way in which they're similar and a way in which they're very, very

48:55.440 --> 49:01.440
different. So the similarity is that they're not taking space time as fundamental. They're

49:01.440 --> 49:09.040
trying to build it up. Right. So that, but Seth Lloyd is using, trying to start with quantum

49:09.040 --> 49:14.720
theory and build it up for quantum bits and quantum gates. And it's brilliant, brilliant work.

49:15.840 --> 49:22.320
But on that, I, I think that Nima or Connie Hamed is right that, that, that we,

49:25.040 --> 49:29.680
starting with quantum theory is not going deep enough. We're going to have to find a deeper

49:29.680 --> 49:35.760
framework entirely outside of space time and quantum theory and show that space time and

49:35.760 --> 49:42.160
quantum theory together arise joined at the hip. So I, I agree with Nima on that. And part of it is

49:42.160 --> 49:53.680
that, that quantum theory, at least the evolution like the Schrodinger equation

49:54.000 --> 50:05.280
has time as a parameter. So it's, it's, so space time is doomed. That version of quantum theory is

50:05.280 --> 50:10.880
doomed too. It's not fundamental. We're going to have to get something, something deeper. So,

50:11.440 --> 50:18.560
so, you know, of course, I think in science, we need to let a thousand flowers grow. So I, I wouldn't

50:19.200 --> 50:22.960
try to stop their work at one bit. I would encourage their work. I should, I would say it

50:22.960 --> 50:28.400
should be funded. And, and, and, and also the work was trying to show some kind of automata,

50:28.400 --> 50:32.960
maybe some kind of cellular automata or something like that, at the foundations of space time. But

50:32.960 --> 50:42.240
if, if the idea is that, that, that space time is fundamental, and these are just like the,

50:42.240 --> 50:48.000
the building blocks of space time, then I think it's not going deep enough. I think we, we really

50:48.000 --> 50:59.040
need to let go of our clinging to space time and view it for what I think it is, which is merely a

50:59.040 --> 51:07.920
user interface. That is, it's, there's a deeper dynamical reality utterly beyond space time. And

51:07.920 --> 51:15.040
that space time is, is one of countless interfaces that that dynamical reality can use to interact

51:15.040 --> 51:20.880
with itself. Yeah. So, so that's, I think the difference. So in spirit, they're trying to

51:21.600 --> 51:27.120
get at the foundations with, with Seth Lloyd is really trying to use quantum theory to boot up

51:28.320 --> 51:34.320
space time. And, and in other cases, you know, might be various kinds of automata.

51:36.080 --> 51:43.360
And I guess, you know, in some sense, there is probably some kind of mathematical map between

51:43.360 --> 51:51.040
our probabilistic Markovian dynamics of conscious agents and automata. And for example, our, our,

51:52.160 --> 51:55.920
it's as easy to prove that the Markovian dynamics is computationally universal.

51:57.280 --> 52:02.720
So anything that you can do with automata, you can do, or with Turing machines, universal Turing

52:02.720 --> 52:08.400
machines, or neural networks, you can do with Markovian dynamical systems. So they're computationally

52:08.400 --> 52:15.120
universal. But there's another aspect to it. And that is that the Markovian dynamical systems

52:15.120 --> 52:22.160
are not limited to computation. In particular, the measurable spaces and the measurable sets on

52:22.160 --> 52:26.960
which the probabilities are defined need not be computable. They could not be recursively

52:26.960 --> 52:35.200
neural. There's, as far as I can see, there's no reason to restrict the definition of probabilities

52:35.200 --> 52:45.840
to our resets. So if that's right, then, then Markovian dynamics is not restricted to

52:46.480 --> 52:49.600
computer computability. Of course, it gets computability trivially.

52:50.960 --> 52:57.760
And that's one reason why we felt comfortable in our, in our basic definition of conscious agents

52:57.760 --> 53:02.080
to have it be so trivial. I mean, there are, there are conscious experiences,

53:02.080 --> 53:07.200
and they have dynamical interactions with them. So we, what didn't we put in? We didn't put in a

53:07.200 --> 53:15.360
notion of a self. We didn't put in notions of learning, memory, problem solving, attention,

53:15.920 --> 53:22.960
none of that. But we knew that since networks of conscious agents are computationally universal,

53:23.840 --> 53:28.160
that any, anything that you could build a neural network of, so neural network of learning and

53:28.160 --> 53:32.960
memory and intelligence, you know, like chat, GPT and so forth, anything that you can do with

53:32.960 --> 53:37.440
those networks, you can do with conscious agent networks were computationally universal. So

53:37.440 --> 53:44.160
that's why we didn't want to put the kitchen sink into our definition. We wanted to make our

53:44.160 --> 53:52.560
definition is absolutely spare as possible while retaining computational universality

53:52.560 --> 53:56.400
so that we could then build everything else and we'd be forced to build everything else.

53:56.400 --> 54:01.440
And so, so that was why that was our choice. And that's what you want. That's, that's Occam's razor

54:02.080 --> 54:07.600
right in the building of scientific theories is minimal set of assumptions as possible.

54:08.320 --> 54:15.520
And that's so yeah. Yeah, that's great. And before we kept off the sort of physics related

54:15.520 --> 54:22.000
kind of questions, truncated a comment or question from carbon 1479. They asked,

54:22.400 --> 54:29.680
I'm truncating it a bit here, but does your model lead towards an eternal block universe

54:30.640 --> 54:38.640
or multiverse? No. No, okay. So the like the Einstein block universe where he's space time,

54:38.640 --> 54:46.480
there's a space time flow from and no, it doesn't lead to that kind of universe at all.

54:46.960 --> 54:58.080
In fact, it says that that the space time itself is one trivial, fairly trivial kind

54:58.080 --> 55:03.760
of interface that networks of consciousness can use. As I said earlier, it's the cheap model.

55:03.760 --> 55:08.080
It's a I think it's a cheap model. So even the interface isn't a block universe, even the

55:08.320 --> 55:14.400
even even the yeah, even our interface version is not a block universe by any means.

55:16.560 --> 55:21.360
Here, here's one way that could be concrete about why it's not time.

55:23.600 --> 55:27.840
Time is not fundamental in our Markovian dynamics. You might say, wait a minute,

55:27.840 --> 55:32.720
you're talking about Markovian dynamics. Now, dynamics sounds like you have some notion of time.

55:33.120 --> 55:41.120
And there is a notion of sequence in the Markovian dynamics. But time as physicists think about it

55:41.120 --> 55:48.160
is intimately linked with the second law of thermodynamics, which says that entropy is

55:48.160 --> 55:55.360
always increasing in some sense, that law gives the arrow to time, the direction to time. And

55:55.920 --> 56:01.520
with our Markovian dynamics of conscious agents, there is a step sequence, but it's

56:02.240 --> 56:06.240
straightforward to write down Markovian dynamics in which the entropy does not increase.

56:07.600 --> 56:15.200
It's a constant entropy. But it's also trivial. It's a three step proof to show that if you take

56:15.200 --> 56:20.320
such a Markovian dynamics in which there is no arrow of time, so there's no physics time at all

56:20.320 --> 56:28.000
in it. Any projection of that dynamics, so you're taking this Markovian dynamics and you're projecting

56:28.000 --> 56:41.040
it to another dynamics where you've lost information. So it's another Markovian dynamics

56:41.040 --> 56:46.240
which is a projection of the deeper one. So it's a projected dynamics, but it's lost information.

56:46.800 --> 56:53.440
The very act of losing information in the projection entails that you will have

56:54.000 --> 57:02.400
an increasing entropy in the projected dynamics. So you will have an arrow of time in that

57:02.400 --> 57:10.880
projected dynamics, not as an insight into the original dynamics. It's an artifact of the projection.

57:11.840 --> 57:20.640
And so the entropic arrow of time that is the foundation of, for example, the spacetime cube

57:20.880 --> 57:28.960
is not an insight into this deeper reality. It's a trivial artifact of the projection process.

57:28.960 --> 57:35.040
It's something that happens, quote unquote, like a mistake of the projection. It's entailed

57:35.040 --> 57:42.640
by the projection. It's not a deep insight into the deeper reality. So that's a good question.

57:42.640 --> 57:47.600
But you can see that why we're definitely not just the spacetime cube and even the time part

57:47.600 --> 57:52.880
of that cube, we're saying is an artifact of projection, that that arrow, the notion of an

57:52.880 --> 58:00.560
arrow of time that would allow you to trace out the cube. Of course, the cube itself now is this

58:00.560 --> 58:07.200
spacetime loaf in which in some sense you're seeing all of time at once. But there is an arrow

58:07.200 --> 58:12.240
nevertheless in that loaf. And that arrow is an artifact of the projection process.

58:13.040 --> 58:22.640
So in the original, not yet projected space, let's talk about space is already throwing

58:22.640 --> 58:31.200
it off a bit. But let's say in that realm, if there is a sequence, there's no time there.

58:32.080 --> 58:38.320
But how does the sequence play out? Or how do you get the orderedness of it? I mean,

58:38.320 --> 58:44.160
is that is the block? That seems to me like a block universe, but that seems to me like a block

58:44.160 --> 58:51.200
space sort of in that these sequences exist, but no time. So how does that how's that ordered?

58:52.400 --> 58:54.960
Right. So in the theory of Markov change, you do get these

58:56.960 --> 59:02.400
ordered spaces where you look at all possible trajectories that the dynamics could take.

59:02.960 --> 59:09.520
And those typically denoted by a capital omega. So often that the spaces are written and then

59:09.520 --> 59:13.520
individual trajectories are a little omega. So you have all these little omegas that are possible

59:13.520 --> 59:17.840
trajectories and together all of them make up the big omega. And these are infinitely long

59:17.840 --> 59:23.600
trajectories and so forth. And then once you put a probability measure on these trajectories,

59:23.600 --> 59:28.080
you can then see whether that particular more COVID dynamics has a growing entropy or not

59:29.040 --> 59:33.840
on that. But but it turns out you don't need to have a growing entropy and therefore you don't

59:33.840 --> 59:40.000
need to have a physics kind of notion of time at all. So there is a notion of sequence, an order.

59:40.640 --> 59:47.840
So you have a total. So here's the thing. You have a total ordered set of steps. So there's a

59:47.840 --> 59:55.040
total order, but but that's time has more structure than that. It's got a growing entropy and so

59:55.040 --> 01:00:02.400
forth. Time in modern physics is subject to Lorentz transformations and the whole bit.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:10.400
What we want to like to show is that here we have this Markovian dynamics. There need to be no

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.320
arrow of time because there's no increasing entropy. And we can show that under certain

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:20.560
projections, yeah, it looks like a Lorentz transformation. So for example, the projections

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:25.920
might be various kinds. If I have a big Markov chain, there you can do so called trace chains.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:30.720
You could do various projections onto different traces of subsets of states or maybe even

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:37.520
subsamples of steps. And what this is one direction I'm really interested in pursuing is to show that

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:44.080
under what conditions of the tracing and sampling that all the different traces and samples are

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.720
related to each other by, for example, the Lorentz group or the Poincare group, so that we can

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:55.840
actually show where those symmetries come from as just one way of getting a family of projections,

01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:02.480
a group of projections of this deeper dynamics of consciousness. Interesting, cool.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:10.000
When you take a sampling, and this is another comment or question I have to find their name

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.240
and overlay it, but when you take a sampling, let's say of the largest group or the total group,

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:25.040
is there a fractal-like quality to a smaller sampling set? I think they mentioned that you

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:30.080
did an interview at some point, I mean, you mentioned that there was some kind of like

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:39.680
self-similar, some self-similarity between say a sampling of a space and say the omega,

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.480
the totally large space. Is that ringing any bells or is this totally off?

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:50.880
Well, it's a pretty interesting direction to think about. The

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.960
there's the notion of self-similarity. Well, first, if we have this big

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:07.440
consciousness dynamics, you might get trace chains of it that are similar in various

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:15.600
ways to the to the original, certainly. But there's something very, very deep about,

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.360
well, I'll just put it this way. First, yeah, straightforward to get self-similarity. You

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:28.160
can do that with Markov Dynamics, but there's something really, there's something even deeper,

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:36.000
and there's something that physicists and scientists call universality. This was discovered by

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:43.360
Eugene Wigner working on the Manhattan Project and trying to get the energy levels of the

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:50.320
uranium atom, which are so complicated he couldn't get it. So what he did was he

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:57.520
used large random matrices, just matrices of random numbers. And he showed that the,

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:05.440
he found that the eigenvalues, so the eigenvalues are a way of characterizing the intrinsic properties

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.800
of a matrix. And you could have lots and lots of eigenvalues and they'd be spaced. You could have,

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:17.440
maybe an eigenvalue would be close to one, another eigenvalue, but the spacing,

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:23.360
they wouldn't get too close and they wouldn't get too far away. And you got this distribution of

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:29.600
the spacing between the eigenvalues. And this has shown up all, he discovered that and it seemed to

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:36.160
match the spacing of energy levels of the uranium atom. And then this whole thing about

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:42.080
universality, you mentioned the magazine, Quanta. Quanta Magazine has wonderful videos and articles

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:47.840
on universality. So if you just Google Quanta Magazine and universality, there's a fun world to

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:55.840
enter through Quanta Magazine on that. But our Markov Dynamics, we have these,

01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:04.640
a Markov kernel is a matrix. It's an end-by-end matrix. It could be a billion-by-billion. And

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:11.280
many of the matrices that we're going to study are random. They're random numbers where the

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.120
numbers are between zero and one. It doesn't matter what the range of the numbers is, the random

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:24.080
numbers. So universality is going to pop out of this where we're dealing with just random matrices.

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:32.240
And so I'm right now just, and that has to do with like phase transitions. So how do you go from

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:40.480
one, for example, state of matter to another phase transitions all? So I'm, that question is good

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:48.800
because it's pointing to a huge realm of research that I'm really eager to jump into. Yeah, there's

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:54.160
a notion of self-similarity, but then there's this whole universality thing. And it's really

01:04:54.160 --> 01:05:00.240
deeply tied somehow to random matrices. And matrices are the foundation of this theory of

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:06.720
conscious agents. And many of them are going to be random. Many of them will not be random too.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:12.640
So it's going to be really interesting to explore. So yeah, we get fractal kind of behavior. We also

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:20.640
get behavior that's very deterministic, right? You can model both. So you don't necessarily have

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:27.760
to get fractal behavior in a Markov chain, but you absolutely can. And you can get universality as

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:34.320
well. So it's a very, very flexible framework. And I'm very eager to, to explore. I may need to have

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:40.960
some other experts who are more expert on the math, you know, the mathematics here is pretty intense.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:48.640
Yeah, there's a lot of different areas that you jump in between. I spoke with Carl Friston

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:54.400
a few weeks ago and talked about his free energy principle. And I was wondering,

01:05:54.400 --> 01:06:00.400
because one of the things he mentioned to me in our conversation was, his quote was, there's,

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:05.600
it doesn't know of anything that's more fundamental than the free energy principle.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:14.160
So, you know, trying to, trying to minimize, I think it's a variational free energy in a system,

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:20.480
you know, anything, any agent in a system is trying to do that. Do you find, have you found

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:26.480
any of those kinds, that kind of dynamic from your conscious agent framework? Are they exhibiting

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:32.080
this kind of behavior? But do they abide by the free energy principle?

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:38.800
Right. So in, in the theory of Markov chains, what you, you're going to get very, very similar

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:45.120
kinds of things popping out. There's something called potential theory. In, in, in, so you're

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:53.520
going to have is systems in which you can model what would look like heat. So the free energy,

01:06:53.600 --> 01:07:01.840
the Gibbs free energy, for example, is the enthalpy minus delta, so, so the, the delta G,

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:08.320
you know, the change in the Gibbs free energy equals delta H, which is the change in the enthalpy

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:16.640
minus T delta S, which is T is the temperature and degrees Kelvin, and delta S is the change

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:27.760
in the entropy. So, so what I see happening is that these are going to be high level descriptions

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.800
of when we actually look at Markov chains, you're going to find that they're, you have this

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:39.840
dynamics is happening in a, in a large dimensional space, and certain states are going to have

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.520
higher probabilities. You're going to be in some sense more, the dynamics will be more attracted

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:49.760
to those states. And then, and then less attracted to be put somewhere else, it'll, it'll tend to,

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:54.560
to converge to certain kinds of states. And so we're going to be able to model all, you know,

01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:02.320
absolutely Gibbs free, free energy, enthalpy, entropy, the whole bit within the Markovian

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:07.920
dynamics. Now, one thing that I'll mention that, that may be a difference in, in our frameworks,

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:14.320
you know, I think that the Gibbs free energy ideas is, is important and, and should be pursued.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.680
But typically, the work that they're doing is assuming

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:27.200
it was built on the work of Judea Pearl, directed acyclic graphs.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.520
Markov chains are more general.

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:43.440
Directed acyclic graphs are a special kind, a special subclass of Markov. But there's no reason

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:51.200
not to have cycles. Why, why should it be acyclic? Lots of things in nature are, are cyclic. And so

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:58.320
the, the Markovian dynamics that we're, we're studying, of course, can model directed acyclic

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:03.520
graphs as a special case. There are special Markov chains that do that, but it is not restricted to

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:10.640
that. And so that's, that's going to be one difference. Another important thing is that

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:20.960
in, in some cases, it, in the discussions, it seems like some of the proponents of the, you know,

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:31.680
free energy principle are thinking that the, there's with the directed acyclic graph and the

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:36.320
free energy principle, you have what's called a Markov blanket, right? There's the, the states of

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:42.400
the system inside, then there's the external world, and then there's a blanket. And so if you have a

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:49.360
set of nodes that are your system, the blanket is technically defined as all the parents of the

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:56.320
nodes in your system, all the descendants of the nodes of your system, and all the parents

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:02.800
of the descendants of the nodes in your system, that those, those are, those nodes form the Markov

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:10.960
blanket. This is from Judea Pearl's work and for directed acyclic graphs. Now it, it's a theorem

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:25.360
that the state of the nodes inside the blanket and the state of the nodes of the rest of the world

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:32.160
outside of the blanket are conditionally independent, entirely conditionally independent, given the

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:40.320
state of the nodes of the Markov blanket. What that means is the only thing that the nodes inside

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:48.480
can know about quote, unquote, the world is captured on the blanket. And it's trivial to show that

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:54.560
there are, there's an infinity of different states of the external nodes that would lead to exactly

01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:01.920
the same state of the blanket nodes, right? Given, right? So you could have tons and tons of states.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:09.920
So the Markov blanket is what we call an interface in our theory, right? It's,

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:19.680
it's an interface. And there's no way that the, so often in many cases there, they talk in this

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:26.320
literature as though you are doing Bayesian inference and actually inferring the true state of the

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:35.520
external world. That's not possible. The state of the nodes outside the blanket and the state of

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:42.000
the nodes inside the blanket are conditionally independent, given the state of the blanket.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:49.440
So there's no way. So all you can do, you can never get a Bayesian estimate of the true state of the

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:55.920
external world. You can't. All you can do is get your best interface description. So the way I think

01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:00.240
about the free energy principle, I think is a little bit different than many of the proponents of

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:05.600
the, of that free energy principle. It's, you're, you're not doing Bayesian inference and getting

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:11.680
an estimate of the true state of the world, not by a long shot. You are simply getting a user

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:18.000
interface that allows you to stay alive as a system. But the staying alive as a system doesn't

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.120
mean that you've actually estimated the truth about the external world. So there may be a difference

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:29.680
in philosophy that would be fun to discuss. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. It's still,

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.520
I talked with him for a while and I've researched it fully. It's, it's still

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:42.720
aspects of it that elude me, if I'm being honest, that the, I'm not sure what's sort of intrinsic

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:49.760
and what's sort of a byproduct and what's, you know, what's sort of naturally happening there.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:54.880
So it's something that I have to, I have to keep following back. There was a great

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:01.760
set of papers in behavioral and brain science a few years back that I can point you to where

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:09.600
they, there's a target article that argues that, that, you know, the free energy principle is

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:13.280
it's used and the notion of Markov blankets is this used

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:22.720
is different from that of Pearl, that Pearl gave a functional definition and in many cases

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:31.040
look like they were giving a physical definition of the boundary. I think since then a lot of

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:36.320
working free energy principles sort of walk back the idea of identification with a physical

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.680
principle. But, but I think there's still a very interesting dialogue going back and forth. I think

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:48.000
the, I think that Gibbs free energy is of course central and it's very, very important.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:55.040
Exactly how it's being used is really critical. My take is,

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.680
as long as we're still thinking inside space time, we're not thinking deep enough.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:07.360
We're going to find that when you analyze the potential theory of Markov chains and so forth,

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.800
you will get all, you'll get Gibbs free energy and all those concepts entirely outside of space

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:18.160
time. And then when we look down to space time as a user interface as a trivial projection of

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:24.240
that deeper thing, we will then see the physics notion of Gibbs free energy and chemistry notion

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:31.280
of Gibbs free energy and so forth as a projection of this much deeper notion of the

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:36.400
potential theory of Markov chains. So that's my take of where it's going.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:41.680
I want to ask you about in a commenter. I have to find the names of these commenters. I have,

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:48.320
I know it's all over the place, but I know there was a commenter who posited something around how

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:54.320
how do you know, and I guess I would assume it's just the best we can do, but

01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:02.320
like math and formal logic, how do we know it's not just another symbol within our interface,

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.960
i.e., how can we be sure, sure with enough confidence that outside of this interface,

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:15.920
say outside space and time, that they say hold true, because like one plus one equals two,

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.360
you know, we know that's true here, but how do we know it's true outside our universe or in

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.600
another universe or, you know, all the way all the way outside of that. So do you have anything?

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:31.440
I mean, it's just something you think about, you've thought about, but you respond to that in

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:37.360
any way? Well, there's several levels of, it's an important question, and there's several levels.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.040
Maybe the simplest level would be if you just have the notion of, for example,

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:49.760
the kinds of basic kinds of geometries we could have of spacetime. Is it flat?

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:56.480
Is it hyperbolic or positive or negative curvature space?

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:07.360
And so we can use this mathematical notion of the geometry to ask the question, well,

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:15.920
what geometry does our universe have? And what we find is what using the cosmic microwave background

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:24.800
radiation, we've been able to say to within a certain level of certainty, our universe has is

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:30.720
flat, it has zero curvature, it's not positive or negative, it's zero. And we can put limits on,

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:38.320
if it's positive curvature, we can put limits on how big it could possibly be. So we can actually

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:43.920
say, okay, I mean, our data are, you know, suggested it's flat, but they don't rule out

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:49.440
a small curvature, because of course noise and so forth, you can't rule it out. So given what

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:55.600
we know about the noise, and even though it's pointed to zero, it might not be exactly zero,

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.840
we can put a limit on the positive curvature in there, and therefore the positive

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:06.240
diameter of our universe. And so that's been done. So that's one way, and you can see,

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:13.040
here we're using geometry, the mathematics, the abstract mathematics to constrain

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:19.280
using data, our understanding of the geometry of the universe we happen to be living in.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:24.000
Okay, so that's one way of getting up. But, but there's a deeper now, there's a deeper, the, the,

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.720
I think the questioner is asking a deeper question, which is why should we trust mathematics at all?

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.440
And these are the mathematics that we're using.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:42.560
It's not, it's not the final word, by any means. And I would say, yeah, I agree that

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:52.800
mathematics is this powerful tool, but we have to be extremely aware that what humans have

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:58.320
discovered of mathematics is trivial. I would say if all the mathematics that is to be known,

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:04.080
we know probability zero of it. We know measure zero of the mathematics to be discovered.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:14.960
And, and we know that there are many different axiom systems that are that that we can use.

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:23.200
And so it's now one way that some people have responded to this kind of thing though, for

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:30.720
example, like Max Tegmark, is to say, well, that just means to him, he thinks mathematics

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.280
is fundamental reality. And that doesn't just mean the mathematics that we now understand,

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:40.800
that's all the mathematics. And so for any possible kind of mathematical system, there's a

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:45.360
universe. And so he, I think he calls it his level four multiverse, where anything that's

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:50.000
mathematically possible, including stuff that we haven't discovered yet, is actual, and all those

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:59.200
universes exist. Now, but there's another answer to this as well, which is to say,

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:11.120
if we're going to reason at all, if we want to argue, we want to have differences of opinions

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:19.360
and try to convince each other, we're using logic. Or if we don't have that, what do we have?

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:28.640
Force, I mean, I'll force you to agree with me. Who's interested in that? So we use logic,

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:39.200
we use reason, we try to use evidence. The more precise your reasoning, the more you're really

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:48.240
moving into mathematics, the less precise, the more your reasoning is probably not worth listening to.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:54.240
So we're in this real interesting catch 22. We can't,

01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:00.560
we know that the mathematics we know is trivial compared to what's out there to be known. We

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:06.480
know that there are many different axiom systems that are mutually incompatible, and all are

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:19.200
interesting. So there is this, and yet, we don't want to say, we shouldn't use persuasion and

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:27.120
reason and logic in our discussions on politics and religion or whatever, or in science, or in

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:35.040
social studies, or in arts and humanities. We see reason and logic and argumentation,

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:46.000
like intelligent argumentation going on. And that certainly is far better than just brute force

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:53.440
saying, believe me, you must do it my way, you must assert and state what I, we don't want to do

01:20:53.520 --> 01:21:01.520
there. So we're in an interesting position where it's humbling. If we don't use

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:09.040
math and logic, we're screwed. If we do use math and logic, we can't prove that we're using the

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:14.080
right stuff and we don't know what's out there that we don't know. So my attitude is,

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:29.200
we have to go with what we have so far and always be humble. Say, my theory is just the best theory

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:37.840
I have so far. And of course, it's just a theory. And of course, sooner, hopefully, then later,

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:43.680
people will look back and laugh at our theories. We look back at the, we look back a few centuries,

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:50.880
and we see the confident pronunciations of people. That's embarrassing. It's completely,

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:59.040
earth, air, fire, and water, that's not it. You know, caloric, that's not it. And even Newtonian

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:06.880
theory, it's beautiful, that's not it. And the same thing will be true of quantum theory and

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:15.120
spacetime. That's not it. And those who, it's really, if we don't want to embarrass ourselves,

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.920
we should be the ones that are saying about our own theories. Of course, this is just the next

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:25.200
baby step. If we don't have that attitude, we will look very, very silly in short order,

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:30.720
hopefully shorter, sooner than later. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, the response I think is basically,

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:35.840
and I don't think this person commenting was critical. They were just curious,

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:39.360
but it would be like, well, what do you have that's better? What do you have that's better than

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:43.360
math and formal logic? It's like, if you have something that's better, let me know,

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:50.000
because we'll try to use it. But it's hard to, yeah, it's the best we can do is what we have

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:56.560
available. But I do think I want to turn to, and perhaps we could close in this kind of area, is

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:04.880
personal experience as a teacher. Because I do think, well, you know, each of our

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:08.080
individual life stories and our own personal experiences, those are

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:20.800
as true, as close to real as we can get, perhaps, or as the life force, the day-to-day

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:25.680
living that we do. And one thing that I think we mentioned this on this interview,

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:34.080
earlier rounds is your meditation practice. You spend upwards three hours a day, most days

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:39.040
meditating. And I'd love to hear more about that, because when I've heard you talk about

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:46.960
your practice, it's quite fascinating to me. How did you land on that practice? Did you try

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:51.280
out a bunch of different forms? How did you find what works for you?

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:59.040
Well, I should say that I got into it simply because I was having a hard time sleeping,

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:04.560
and so I didn't want to take pills. And so I decided to meditate. So it wasn't like some

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:11.840
deep... My guess is that if I hadn't had trouble sleeping, I wouldn't have ever meditated. And

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:20.640
I'm glad that I've meditated, because it turned out to be far more than just a sleep aid. It has

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:33.520
transformed me in many, many ways. I was helped because I had a friend, Joe Arpaia, who had written

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:41.200
a book on meditation with, I guess, a forward by the Dalai Lama as well. And I had actually...

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:49.840
He had asked me to read and give him comments on a draft before he published it. And I wasn't

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:55.440
myself interested in meditation. I didn't do it, but Joe was a friend and a good friend, and

01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:03.040
still is a very, very good friend. And so I gave him comments. So I had some understanding,

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:08.160
a little bit of understanding, just from reading of the Buddhist approach to it.

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:14.560
And then I read a little bit of a guy named Thomas Keating, who was a

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:26.640
Benedictine monk. So that's from a Christian Catholic kind of perspective. But then,

01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:38.560
he also had lots of influence from Buddhism as well. So I saw that there was these mystical

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:44.720
aspects of Christianity and Buddhism were not that far apart. I mean, they used different

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:50.400
languages. The Buddhists aren't that terribly interested in Mother Mary, whereas Father Keating

01:25:50.400 --> 01:26:00.160
was. As far as the practice was concerned, they didn't really affect the practice. And so my practice,

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:12.400
and then I'd say I've been heavily influenced as well by Eckhart Tolle. I think that his

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:20.560
is a fairly non-religious explication. And I really like that, a very non-religious explication of

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:26.720
meditation and very, very practical. And then you're not trying to get anywhere.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:35.280
You're either present now or you're not. And there's no issue about getting good at meditation

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:42.640
or anything like that. It's am I present now? If not, why not get present? Be present now.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:50.960
And there's nothing about having to use decades and decades of effort to finally get enlightened

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:56.560
and so forth. So I've really been helped by Eckhart's thing, because the mind naturally

01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:04.880
tries to get into this thing where I try really hard. And if I try real hard and do all these

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:12.080
hours, then I will get enlightened eventually. The reason I have to spend so much time is

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:19.200
my guess is that I just have a lot of issues, a lot of emotional issues. And so I just have to be

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:25.520
there and face this stuff. And what Eckhart Tolle had called the pain body, I think I was born.

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:34.800
I know from the stuff my parents were dealing with before I was born, they were in deep,

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:39.520
deep emotional pain. And I was born into that. And so we each get a deck of cards that we're

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:45.600
dealt with. And I came into the world kicking and screaming. I cried non-stop for my first year,

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:52.720
basically. I was just born that way and gave my parents tremendous difficulty.

01:27:53.600 --> 01:28:01.200
So and I'm still facing, probably, we know that a child born to a mother who is highly stressed

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:11.600
gets methylated in certain ways. You have change to your genetics. And so I suspect that I was born

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:19.760
into this world screaming and crying because I was methylated. My mom was very anxious. My parents

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:27.280
were very anxious. My dad was in the military. They were only 21 years old, 22 years old. They were

01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:34.720
little kids scared to death, well, alcohol abuse and their families and so forth. They were just

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:43.120
trying to get their act together. So their stress gets taken into the child, methylation.

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:47.120
If your parents are stressed, it makes good evolutionary sense that you would methylate

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:54.800
the child to be ready for stressful situations. So I came ready to deal with stress. I was stressed

01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:02.000
out all so hyper vigilant and so forth. And so my guess is that the reason I have to spend so much

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:08.320
time is I'm dealing with methylation. Literally, it's a biological, you know, from that point of

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:16.320
view, it's a biological thing. And so the unwinding of that is I've been at it for 30,000 hours of

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:25.520
meditation. And other people get born to parents who are calm and never get methylated in this way.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:32.960
And so it's a different, you know, I would say that, you know, I got the cards I was dealt with,

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:40.640
people get different cards. It's been painful, but I've learned a lot. And, you know, so I'm not

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:48.720
complaining about it. Those are my cards. And I've learned to, you know, more and more be with what

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:56.640
is. And in some sense, the bigger the challenge you face, the more you learn. And this has been a

01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:03.360
huge challenge for me. I mean, having to spend several hours a day just facing that and almost

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:08.640
like looking at this little child that's that's inconsolable and just being there and consoling

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:16.560
them and staying with it. So I've learned a lot in the process. And I think it's fed into my work

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:24.400
on consciousness because I'm really facing, you know, very personal level, this, this whole thing

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:37.360
about consciousness. My own take is our theory of conscious agents has a theorem. It's a theorem

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:44.320
with a theory that there is just ultimately one conscious agent. There is one. And all

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:56.800
conscious agents are projections, traces of that one conscious agent. And so, and that but but

01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:01.200
it's also a theorem of the theory that that we can never get a complete mathematical description

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:06.400
by a long shot of that one conversation. It trend. So our mathematics says it exists. And it says you

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:13.600
can't actually describe it. It's it transcends mathematics. We can't do it. You'd have to climb

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:17.520
up all of something called Cantor's hierarchy and there's no end to Cantor's hierarchy of

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:25.520
infinities. So you could never get to that that that final description. But my own personal view

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:36.240
is that you and I and each person that I meet and in an amoeba and my cat.

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:45.040
I'm actually, each of us is the one that that that in other words, that that infinite

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:49.440
consciousness that transcends any mathematical description, looking at itself

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:56.960
through a particular little interface. And so I'm the way I view it right now is that, you know,

01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:02.240
I'm talking with Carlos, but it's really the one talking with one. It's the one using a

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:09.600
it's the one using a Hoffman avatar talking with the one using the Carlos avatar. And it's it's

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:14.400
it's doing this for very, very deep reasons. In some sense,

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:22.240
the one which transcends any experience plunges itself into particular experiences. And

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:28.640
thereby gets to know itself better. But that's that's a few words for something I think is

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:34.880
extremely deep. A system can never know itself completely. You can't ever know yourself completely.

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:42.960
But in meditation, when you sit in silence without any thought, and you literally,

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:49.680
when you really let go of all thoughts, and you just are you, you just be,

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:57.200
then you are really and fully the one looking through this particular little window.

01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:04.480
This particular little interface, but you are the one. And you're not separate from that. That's

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:10.000
that's what you are. When you get caught up in your ideas, your thoughts, and get lost in them,

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:15.920
and criticism, and comparing with other people, and, and identifying yourself with, you know,

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:20.960
Oh, I got this car, I got this house, or I'm on this smart, or I'm this stupid, or whatever. All

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:27.360
these things, then you're still the one, but you've got to cover it up with all these thoughts that

01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:35.280
hiding your true identity from yourself. And somehow that seems to be also a necessary part

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:42.640
of the whole thing of the one going to sleep, and then waking up, deciding to really plunge

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:46.720
yourself into this particular little interface. As I've said, I think space time is a pretty

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:52.480
trivial little interface, but you know, the one chooses this, it probably has thousands and

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:59.600
trillions, countless other interfaces that it plunges into, and learn something new about it.

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:05.280
It's inexhaustible. The one is inexhaustible, and the exploration is inexhaustible. And so,

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:10.880
in some sense, what you learn in meditation is the attitude of

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:29.280
Yes, to whatever comes. Yes, not resistance, not letting go of fear. And that's what life may be

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:37.600
about, which is being open to whatever comes, and being open to learn, no matter what happens,

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:46.320
and not crawling back into our shells and complaining and whining. When we look at little

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:56.000
children, you look at an infant, a 15-month-old, and mom says, you know, it's time for us to

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.480
leave the swimming pool now, or it's time for us to get out of the sandbox, and the child breaks down

01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:10.960
and cries, and you realize, wow, you understand what the child is doing, but you also understand

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:15.120
that's a lot of pain that the child is going through. And if they just understood that mom and

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:22.080
dad, in the healthy cases, loves them, and there's other fun stuff that's going to happen,

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:28.560
and just went with it, life could be a lot better. And so, I think that anytime I find myself

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:36.240
saying no to this moment, complaining in any way, I'm the little child in the sandbox

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:46.400
that's unnecessarily causing myself grief. So what meditation really teaches you is you are the one,

01:35:47.280 --> 01:36:00.480
everything's going to be fine, even death, and you've got to, you're here for the ride and enjoy

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:06.880
the ride, be open to whatever comes on the ride, and that's easier said than done. That's why I

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:13.360
spend three hours a day in meditation. So I'm not saying this as someone who's there, I'm saying it

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:22.000
as someone who needs three hours a day to open up to the ride. And I'm good with that too.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.480
That means, as I said, that was my deck of cards. Other people, like Eckhart Tolle,

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:33.120
it happened overnight. And I could wish that happened to me, but that's not me. That's him.

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:42.000
And so the one does, it has, tries on all sorts of different avatars, and it's all part of learning

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:48.960
about itself. So it's a long answer to the question, but I think that it does feed in to my research.

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:53.920
And in fact, I would say this, that the best ideas I have in research come after,

01:36:54.880 --> 01:37:00.000
you have to do your reading, after your homework, of course, you have to, there's no substitute for

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:07.200
that. But then if you want the really good ideas, go into silence. The real creativity comes when

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:12.640
I let go of all thinking and just go into absolute silence, interior silence. That's

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:21.120
where the best ideas come from. Yeah. Do you have any advice for people? Let's say there's

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:24.480
viewers out there, they don't have, they don't have a meditation practice, but they've been

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:32.000
considering it or they're thinking about starting one. Do you have any tips or advice for people,

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:39.280
maybe starting out? My advice, again, I'm thinking about people sort of like me,

01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:48.800
that may not want to be heavily invested in any particular religion. We'd like to have

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:53.600
something that's just practical, that's helpful, but maybe you don't have to buy into a bunch of

01:37:53.600 --> 01:38:05.360
other stuff. For that, I would say Eckhart Tolle, his book The Power of Now and

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:16.080
New Earth, those are fabulous books. I've read them and reread them. I've gone through them

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:25.040
multiple times and he has a number of audio tapes that you can use audio books or audio

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:34.560
lectures he's given and I find them extremely helpful to listen to. Rather than me giving

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:44.720
advice, I would suggest here's the dude that's really helped me a lot. I've listened to all

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:56.240
of stuff. I don't detect any nonsense. I detect a genuine person. Now, I know that I say this to

01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:00.240
some people and some people say, well, no, you really need to do this more advanced

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:08.160
Buddhist thing or whatever and that's perfectly fine, but I think for many American, many

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:20.240
non-religious people, the approach that Eckhart gives is going to be the most easily understood

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:29.360
and used, but of course, there are Zen approaches. There are every mystical tradition, Sufism,

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:49.440
mystical Christianity, Hinduism and all the mystical traditions. I'm not pushing any

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:54.560
particular religion at all. When you look at the mystical side of each of the religions,

01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:05.440
Judaism as well, they all are pointing in the same direction, fallibly, but genuinely pointing

01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:13.200
in that direction of going into, ultimately, it comes down to letting go of thought.

01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:23.360
Literally, entire silence, interior silence, no thought at all. So the thought isn't your

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:27.280
master. I use thought, of course, as a scientist. I'm talking with you. I'm using thought,

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:35.040
but there's a time where you say, okay, it's time to stop thinking all together and just be

01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:42.720
and just to spend a few minutes or a few hours and then have it actually be the habit instead of

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:47.680
going through the day sort of lost in thought because most of the thoughts that we have

01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:52.640
just going through the day, when you look at them, they're completely dysfunctional.

01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:02.640
They're useless and many of them are painful. It's much better to understand that thought

01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:13.360
by itself is like a wild animal. It's just running around. So tell it to stop. You learn to just let

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:19.120
go of the thoughts or to watch them and not believe them. If they're not going to stop,

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:25.520
you learn to watch them and not believe them. Eventually, they go away and then thought becomes

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:35.120
very useful. When I need it for science, it's far more useful, but when I need creativity,

01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:39.520
in many cases, thought is the background I need. I need to have done my homework. I need to have read,

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:46.720
but then when the true creativity is often something that transcends any thought.

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:56.720
So learning the care and feeding of thought and to train it and to not let it run you,

01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:03.120
but to have you use it as a tool and be able to put that tool down when you don't need it anymore

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:09.280
or when you don't want to use it. So the tool tends to run us. It tends to tell you who I am

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:14.880
no thought can tell me who I am. That's it. That's one of the key things. There is no thought.

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:21.280
I am such and such a scientist. I am the owner of this car. I am such and such. My name is,

01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:27.120
I did this. I am the president of that. I have this big cap. All these thoughts

01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:34.160
don't get anywhere close at all to telling you who you really are. They're distractions.

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:42.560
You can only find out who you are in utter and complete interior silence. That's the only time

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:47.840
when you will actually find out who you really are and no thought is ever adequate.

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:57.360
Yeah, that reminds me too. A few minutes ago you mentioned something about Benedictine

01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:04.400
monks. Are you familiar with Joseph Campbell? Yes, in his work. Yeah, he was for folks who

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:11.120
audience who is not familiar. He was a mythological and religious historian and teacher

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:16.480
for like 38 years, I think at St. Lawrence College. He had this great anecdote how he went to,

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:20.720
I think it was in Thailand. He went to some conference that was between

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:28.880
Buddhists and Catholics and a meeting of the minds. He said, the theologians that met on both sides

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:34.400
were just talking past each other. They could not understand each other's theologies.

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:39.040
But the monks on both sides, the Buddhist monks and the Catholic monks, they were like,

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:43.680
oh yeah, we get it. We're in the same wavelength. We're doing the same thing. We're talking the

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:49.520
same kind of process. We're getting the same feelings. That's what I think you alluded to

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:54.480
before. These like different mystical traditions and the practices that they have, there's a lot

01:43:54.480 --> 01:44:03.760
of overlap between them and the kind of interior Meister Eckhart is another one. There's so much

01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:09.760
overlap that it seems like we're doing the same thing and it's just a different window dressing

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:19.440
of the different traditions that are there. I agree. When you go into silent,

01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:23.840
then all those trappings disappear and you get in touch with the same thing.

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:31.360
Yeah. Unfortunately, I have to take off. Yeah. I think that's a wonderful place to end.

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:36.800
And I just so appreciate your time, Don. Thank you again. Thank you. It was a great pleasure.

01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:41.520
Wonderful. And thank you also. I really like that you bring up these questions that people have

01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:47.520
because I do like to try to address the questions and that this is very, very good. Thank you.

01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:52.560
Yes, I appreciate it. Yeah, I'm sure there'll be even more coming. And I will overlay the,

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:57.520
because a few questions I had in mind, but I can't remember the commenters' names, but I'll

01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:03.040
overlay them when those sections come along. And yeah, thank you again, Don. I wish you all the

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:07.920
best and appreciate it so much. Thank you, Carlos. Great pleasure. Take care.
