WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.480
Mike, thanks for coming on.

00:01.480 --> 00:02.320
Yeah, good to see you again.

00:02.320 --> 00:03.280
Thanks for having me.

00:03.280 --> 00:04.200
Yeah, such a pleasure.

00:04.200 --> 00:05.320
Absolutely.

00:05.320 --> 00:08.120
I can't believe we're on round three of our conversations

00:08.120 --> 00:08.960
here right now.

00:08.960 --> 00:10.160
Time flies by.

00:10.160 --> 00:13.000
And for people in the audience who haven't yet

00:13.000 --> 00:14.640
caught our first two rounds, those

00:14.640 --> 00:17.280
will be linked below in the description.

00:17.280 --> 00:19.680
And around one, we covered the computational boundary

00:19.680 --> 00:22.760
of the self paper, the cognitive light cone diagram

00:22.760 --> 00:24.840
that folks will be familiar with, I'm sure.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.960
And then around two, we covered observer-dependent computing,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.640
your paper with Joshua Bungard on polycomputing,

00:31.640 --> 00:35.160
and also the technological approach to mind everywhere.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.640
Today, we're going to cover a couple of papers

00:37.640 --> 00:41.120
that were recently published just in the last couple of months.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.200
Your paper on bioelectric networks

00:43.200 --> 00:46.280
being the cognitive glue for organisms,

00:46.280 --> 00:49.280
and then Darwin's engential materials.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.080
That'll be the second paper we cover.

00:51.080 --> 00:54.360
And then finally, biology, Buddhism AI,

00:54.360 --> 00:56.440
your paper with collaborators that I think

00:56.440 --> 01:00.880
will be the third act of our conversations today.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.280
So I'd love to get us kicked off first.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.160
And those papers will be linked below in the description

01:05.160 --> 01:07.880
as well for folks who want to dive into those.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.880
They can be pretty technical, but I

01:09.880 --> 01:13.840
recommend going through them and discovering them

01:13.840 --> 01:14.360
for yourselves.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.440
There's a lot of great diagrams in there as well

01:16.440 --> 01:18.840
to help people kind of grok these concepts too.

01:18.840 --> 01:23.560
So if we get started off on the bioelectric networks,

01:23.560 --> 01:26.480
the cognitive glue enabling evolutionary scaling

01:26.480 --> 01:29.520
from physiology to mind, your paper,

01:29.520 --> 01:32.240
could you provide us with a brief high level summary

01:32.240 --> 01:34.160
of the paper and what's covered here?

01:34.160 --> 01:34.640
Yeah.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.200
Well, I guess the first thing to do

01:37.200 --> 01:39.400
is to talk about what cognitive glue is

01:39.400 --> 01:41.640
and why such a thing is needed.

01:41.640 --> 01:48.120
And I use that term just to kind of draw attention

01:48.120 --> 01:49.000
to the following thing.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.520
We often people think about collective intelligences

01:55.520 --> 02:00.840
as flocks of birds and colonies or termites or bees

02:00.840 --> 02:02.160
or something like that.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.520
And they contrast that sharply with themselves.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.000
They say, well, I'm not a colony.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.040
I'm a unified individual with my own thoughts and goals

02:11.040 --> 02:12.040
and all of that.

02:12.040 --> 02:15.600
But actually, if you sort of look inside, what you find

02:15.600 --> 02:17.240
is that, no, actually, you are a colony.

02:17.240 --> 02:20.680
Like each of us is a collection of cells, neurons

02:20.680 --> 02:22.280
and a whole bunch of other stuff.

02:22.280 --> 02:26.160
And I want to emphasize this idea

02:26.160 --> 02:29.560
that that is not to be taken for granted.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.080
You cannot take for granted.

02:31.080 --> 02:34.560
It's actually kind of a miracle, not in the sort of religious

02:34.560 --> 02:36.600
sense, but in the scientific sense of something really

02:36.600 --> 02:40.080
profound that needs understanding and explanation.

02:40.080 --> 02:43.600
It's kind of a miracle that a collection of individual cells

02:43.600 --> 02:45.320
with their own agendas and their own ability

02:45.360 --> 02:48.800
to pursue various goals and physiological space

02:48.800 --> 02:51.280
and gene expression space and so on,

02:51.280 --> 02:53.560
that there is a way to arrange those things that

02:53.560 --> 02:58.800
gives rise to this emergent new self that operates

02:58.800 --> 03:02.040
in a different problem space and, in fact, will end up

03:02.040 --> 03:03.600
often will end up denying the fact

03:03.600 --> 03:06.720
that it is made up of parts with their own agendas.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.160
I mean, that's kind of wild.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.080
That's interesting.

03:09.080 --> 03:09.640
Right?

03:09.640 --> 03:14.560
And has its own goals where some of these goals are often

03:14.600 --> 03:16.640
at odds with the goals of the parts.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.360
And we often do things that aren't particularly good

03:19.360 --> 03:21.960
for certain cells in the body and so on, right?

03:21.960 --> 03:23.920
Or even certain organs.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.680
So that's it right there.

03:26.680 --> 03:30.320
That it's very clear that there must be a mechanism

03:30.320 --> 03:37.160
for doing that, for transitioning from just a pile of cells

03:37.160 --> 03:40.880
to something with its own self.

03:40.880 --> 03:44.120
And we can sort of define, we can do a little bit of definition

03:44.120 --> 03:45.080
there too, if you want.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.440
But so that's the goal, right?

03:47.440 --> 03:51.000
So now, even though people don't think about that very much,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.560
like that, the reality is that, of course,

03:53.560 --> 03:55.840
the whole field of neuroscience is predicated on the fact

03:55.840 --> 03:58.800
that we know what the cognitive glue is

03:58.800 --> 04:00.400
for behavior in the brain.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.840
It's electrical signaling.

04:02.840 --> 04:07.320
And let's say electrochemical signaling in the brain.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.560
So that's the idea.

04:09.560 --> 04:13.880
And my point in this paper and in some previous papers

04:13.880 --> 04:18.000
is that there's a reason why electrical signaling is so

04:18.000 --> 04:19.400
good at this in the brain.

04:19.400 --> 04:22.600
It's because it's had lots of practice evolutionarily

04:22.600 --> 04:25.520
where this all comes from is by serving as cognitive glue

04:25.520 --> 04:28.560
for a morphogenetic agent, which is the thing that

04:28.560 --> 04:32.000
arises when a bunch of individual cells in an embryonic

04:32.000 --> 04:35.320
blastoderm suddenly start to cooperate

04:35.320 --> 04:36.720
toward a very specific goal.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.360
They're all going on a journey in this anatomical space

04:39.360 --> 04:42.200
of possible configurations, of possible shapes

04:42.200 --> 04:43.160
that anything can be.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.360
They're all committed to helping each other

04:45.360 --> 04:47.360
get to one particular region of that space that

04:47.360 --> 04:50.440
corresponds to the target morphology of that species.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.880
And so, yeah, so that's what this paper is about.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.240
It's about how bioelectricity serves

04:58.240 --> 05:01.480
as that kind of cognitive glue and then evolution kind of

05:01.480 --> 05:04.360
pivoted it to do the same thing in three-dimensional space

05:04.360 --> 05:06.240
for the control of behavior.

05:06.240 --> 05:06.840
Awesome, yeah.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.840
Thank you for that summary.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.240
And I'd love to hear, I mean, one of the second questions

05:10.240 --> 05:13.720
I had here was, how did you land on the term cognitive glue?

05:13.720 --> 05:16.560
Like, were there any other terms of phrases

05:16.560 --> 05:20.320
that you were kind of deciding between?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.760
For that one, I mean, I don't know,

05:21.760 --> 05:24.640
I use a lot of kind of these kind of terms

05:24.640 --> 05:25.800
that I just sort of come up with.

05:25.800 --> 05:29.400
But for that one, I'm not sure if there were any competitors.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.640
I mean, you can think about some sort of binding policies.

05:32.640 --> 05:37.680
You can call it some sort of an self-emergence mechanism.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.280
I mean, you can come up with it.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.360
But I just thought it was simpler to point out

05:41.360 --> 05:45.280
that it literally is a kind of cognitive glue,

05:45.280 --> 05:48.480
because without it, think about what

05:48.480 --> 05:50.840
happens during general anesthesia, right?

05:50.840 --> 05:56.600
So you walk into the doctor, and there you are.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.920
And you have all kinds of thoughts and hopes about what

05:58.920 --> 06:01.120
happens, and you say, boy, I hope the surgery goes well.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.720
I've got a big thing.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.120
I've got to do a month through now.

06:04.120 --> 06:08.040
And then the gas comes in, and one of the things that happens

06:08.080 --> 06:12.520
is the gap junctions between your cells get inhibited.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.440
So now you're gone.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.520
For the next however many hours, you're not there.

06:16.520 --> 06:17.760
Your cells are still there.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.360
All the pieces are still there.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.240
Nobody's damaged.

06:20.240 --> 06:20.880
Nobody's dead.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.840
The cells are all functional, but you're gone.

06:24.840 --> 06:27.960
And one reason you're gone is because that cognitive glue

06:27.960 --> 06:29.760
has been temporarily dissolved.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.080
It's the there really needs to be something

06:32.080 --> 06:34.320
that binds all this together.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.600
And glue, it's kind of silly, because it's not

06:36.600 --> 06:37.880
that physical kind of thing.

06:37.880 --> 06:43.880
But this idea that everybody has to be kept together

06:43.880 --> 06:47.080
and the way that glue does in a particular space.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.440
It's not just physical proximity.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.960
The cells stay close to each other.

06:50.960 --> 06:54.320
It's a kind of informational proximity.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.720
And actually, people like Giulio Tononi and others

06:57.720 --> 06:59.560
actually study this from an information study,

06:59.560 --> 07:01.760
that integration from an informational perspective.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.000
But that's really what's needed is a mechanism

07:04.000 --> 07:08.600
to hold together the cognitive system that

07:08.600 --> 07:10.280
is then going to make claims about itself

07:10.280 --> 07:14.640
being a separate agent from the parts that make it up.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.680
Yeah, it's interesting.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.240
One very specific question I had in the paper.

07:19.240 --> 07:22.080
And it may have been in there, but maybe I just potentially

07:22.080 --> 07:22.580
missed it.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.720
But there's a quote in there.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.440
If you don't mind me just reading it off here.

07:27.440 --> 07:30.160
It's developmental bioelectricity as a precursor

07:30.160 --> 07:32.880
of brain-like processes, which reveals not only

07:33.160 --> 07:36.200
evolutionary pivots between two different problem spaces,

07:36.200 --> 07:38.560
but also shows a path to solving the problem of collective

07:38.560 --> 07:41.560
intelligence across scales of organization.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.000
What are the two different problem spaces?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
And perhaps it's just an example being made there.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.880
But I think there's a mention here of evolutionary pivots.

07:49.880 --> 07:53.680
Can you give the audience an example of what you mean by that?

07:53.680 --> 07:54.080
Sure.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.680
Well, so first, let's name some problem spaces here.

07:56.680 --> 08:01.000
Just kind of roughly in order from the beginning of life.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.840
So you've got the space of metabolism.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.040
That's a problem space because you

08:06.040 --> 08:07.040
have to figure out how to keep.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.640
If you're going to persist in the real world,

08:08.640 --> 08:12.000
you have to figure out how to operate metabolism.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.600
And then there'll be some sort of physiological problem

08:15.600 --> 08:17.440
space where, aside from metabolism,

08:17.440 --> 08:18.840
you have other physiological features

08:18.840 --> 08:19.960
that you're trying to outkeep.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.160
And then at some point, you get a transcriptional space

08:22.160 --> 08:24.800
where there's actually genes now that can be expressed.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.760
And so that space, a very high-dimensional space

08:27.760 --> 08:29.680
of the correct gene expression for whatever

08:29.720 --> 08:31.480
you need to be doing at the moment.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.960
And then when you get to multicellularity,

08:33.960 --> 08:36.240
there's an anatomical morphospace.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.400
How many eyes are you supposed to have?

08:38.400 --> 08:39.520
Are you supposed to have eyes?

08:39.520 --> 08:41.640
What's the where's the head go?

08:41.640 --> 08:43.240
Where's the tail go?

08:43.240 --> 08:43.960
Those kind of things.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.960
So that's the space of that's an anatomical space.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.560
And then after that, you get to behavioral space

08:49.560 --> 08:52.480
because eventually you develop muscles and nerves.

08:52.480 --> 08:55.680
And now you can actually move around in three-dimensional space.

08:55.680 --> 08:58.560
And so now you can do what's classically known as behavior.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.880
All these other things are behavior, too.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.000
They're just behavior in weird spaces

09:02.000 --> 09:03.720
that we don't normally think about.

09:03.720 --> 09:07.600
And then maybe if you're some sort of human

09:07.600 --> 09:08.960
or something else,

09:08.960 --> 09:11.680
you might also operate in linguistic space.

09:11.680 --> 09:14.120
So we actually have a project now looking at navigation

09:14.120 --> 09:15.760
of linguistic space as exactly

09:15.760 --> 09:17.880
that kind of navigational process.

09:17.880 --> 09:18.720
Oh, interesting.

09:18.720 --> 09:19.560
Yeah, yeah.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.080
And maintaining this idea.

09:21.080 --> 09:23.280
So there's one central concept to all of this,

09:23.280 --> 09:24.360
which is navigation.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.480
This idea that the space is rich,

09:26.480 --> 09:27.440
it has structure.

09:27.440 --> 09:31.720
You, as an agent, have various kinds of preferences

09:31.720 --> 09:33.560
about which parts of that space are better for you

09:33.560 --> 09:34.600
and which parts are worse.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.160
And therefore you need to navigate it.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.480
Now, you have different degrees of competency

09:38.480 --> 09:39.320
of navigating it.

09:39.320 --> 09:42.240
You might navigate it the way that a bowling ball

09:42.240 --> 09:44.040
or a dandelion seed might,

09:44.040 --> 09:46.600
which is you have very little internal control,

09:46.600 --> 09:48.400
if any of what happens.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.400
Or you might be some sort of something in between.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.840
You know, there's various seeds with little cork screws

09:53.840 --> 09:55.400
and things that kind of help them

09:55.440 --> 09:57.040
do various simple things.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.680
You might be some kind of a, you know,

09:59.680 --> 10:01.080
a simple homeostatic agent,

10:01.080 --> 10:03.080
like a little thermostat that's actually better

10:03.080 --> 10:04.320
than these other things.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.000
Or you might actually be a learning system

10:06.000 --> 10:10.680
that can have anticipation and associative learning

10:10.680 --> 10:11.520
and things like that.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.720
Or you might be really complex and you might have planning

10:13.720 --> 10:17.040
and you might be able to really think forward pretty well.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.240
And then you might be really complex

10:19.240 --> 10:21.200
and have a gigantic cognitive light cone

10:21.200 --> 10:24.600
where you can sort of imagine lots of complex things

10:24.640 --> 10:28.040
far into the future way outside of your current scenario.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.600
So anywhere along that continuum,

10:30.600 --> 10:33.040
there's some, you might have some competencies, right?

10:33.040 --> 10:35.720
And you navigate that, those spaces.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.280
And so what I mean by evolutionary pivots

10:37.280 --> 10:39.240
is simply that once you're good

10:39.240 --> 10:41.280
at navigating one kind of space,

10:42.120 --> 10:45.600
it's relatively, I think, this is all, you know,

10:45.600 --> 10:47.800
this is all kind of the framework that I work on.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.840
So lots of things we don't know yet,

10:50.840 --> 10:53.280
but I think it's relatively easy for evolution

10:53.280 --> 10:55.200
to switch spaces on you.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.440
Because if you're good at navigating

10:57.440 --> 10:59.120
a particular kind of space,

10:59.120 --> 11:01.920
we can swap some sensors and some effectors

11:01.920 --> 11:05.520
and you can use all the competencies you have

11:05.520 --> 11:06.720
to navigate some other space.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.360
So just for example,

11:09.800 --> 11:10.840
hybrids, right?

11:10.840 --> 11:12.320
Hybrids are when you take a brain

11:12.320 --> 11:15.080
and you put it in a robotic body such as a vehicle.

11:15.080 --> 11:19.560
And so in that case, the brain instead of leg muscles

11:19.560 --> 11:21.760
might be connected to some wheels

11:21.760 --> 11:24.320
and instead of eyes, it might have some photo arrays.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.360
And if the brain is good at doing these things,

11:27.360 --> 11:28.720
and so people have made these things

11:28.720 --> 11:30.640
and they have various behaviors.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.800
And it sounds kind of crazy and wild,

11:33.800 --> 11:36.960
except that that is the normal scenario.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.080
You see, your brain doesn't actually interface with reality.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.640
Your brain interfaces with your eyes

11:41.640 --> 11:43.240
and your muscles and various things.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.440
And all of this is highly plastic.

11:46.440 --> 11:51.440
When we've made tadpoles where the eye is on its tail

11:51.480 --> 11:53.120
instead of in the head,

11:53.120 --> 11:55.680
those animals can see perfectly well immediately.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.160
They don't require new evolutionary adaptation,

11:58.160 --> 11:59.680
periods of evolutionary adaptation,

11:59.680 --> 12:01.520
they could just see in this new configuration.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.200
And that's because, and the same reason why

12:04.200 --> 12:06.800
sensory augmentation and sensory substitution.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.160
So this has been known since at least the 70s,

12:09.160 --> 12:11.440
probably before that, that you can do all kinds of,

12:11.440 --> 12:13.720
you can give humans all kinds of weird sensors

12:13.720 --> 12:16.360
and effectors and they very quickly become part of them.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.560
So they become, for example,

12:19.600 --> 12:21.680
Rocky Rita in the 70s used to do this thing

12:21.680 --> 12:23.400
where it's like, you know that toy,

12:23.400 --> 12:24.240
I don't know what it's called,

12:24.240 --> 12:25.520
but it's like the square thing

12:25.520 --> 12:27.120
with a bunch of metal nails

12:27.120 --> 12:29.840
and you put your hand on it and it kind of makes the imprint.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.240
So you can imagine an inverse of that

12:32.240 --> 12:34.760
where the little pegs go and move in and out.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.600
So you take that thing and you put each peg,

12:36.600 --> 12:38.400
you connect each peg to a pixel on a camera

12:38.400 --> 12:39.720
that you wear on top of your head.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.560
And then you take that thing

12:41.560 --> 12:43.800
and you put it up against your belly

12:43.800 --> 12:46.160
so that it's poking you based on the pixel

12:46.160 --> 12:47.800
that nail is poking you or not, right?

12:47.800 --> 12:51.920
And so he did experiments with people who were blind

12:51.920 --> 12:53.720
who learned to navigate that way

12:53.720 --> 12:57.320
because you can remap the information

12:57.320 --> 12:59.360
that you're getting through your skin

12:59.360 --> 13:00.960
because the plasticity is incredible.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.120
Look at the rubber hand illusion.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.320
You can see these videos online

13:05.320 --> 13:08.200
where you've had, as a tetrapod,

13:08.200 --> 13:10.280
you've had, your brain has known

13:10.280 --> 13:13.200
how many hands you have for how many millions of years now.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.240
And within seven minutes of this visual input

13:16.240 --> 13:17.960
of somebody stroking this rubber hand,

13:17.960 --> 13:19.520
you've now decided that you have three hands.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.600
You're perfectly willing to abandon that prior.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.720
And when somebody hammers the rubber hand,

13:23.720 --> 13:25.080
people jump up and scream.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.880
And so the plasticity is incredible.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.760
And that's why when people get prosthetics

13:29.760 --> 13:32.720
where the wrist goes 360 degrees around,

13:32.720 --> 13:34.160
when they reach for a cup,

13:34.160 --> 13:37.440
they'll rotate the way that your normal wrist never rotates

13:37.440 --> 13:39.840
because they get used to it, that's your body now.

13:39.840 --> 13:44.640
And so all of these things, this kind of plasticity.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.280
So that's why I think evolution fundamentally

13:47.280 --> 13:49.200
makes these kinds of systems

13:49.200 --> 13:53.240
that they kind of figure out what they are on the flies

13:53.240 --> 13:56.400
or like Josh Bongard's robots from what, 2006 or so,

13:56.400 --> 13:57.880
when he made these robots

13:57.880 --> 14:01.080
that didn't have a predetermined model of what they were

14:01.080 --> 14:03.400
and where the effectors were and where the sensors were.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.920
And they sort of flopped around like babies,

14:06.920 --> 14:08.360
they flopped around until eventually

14:08.360 --> 14:10.360
they figured out how to move around

14:10.360 --> 14:12.160
because they built a model of themselves

14:12.160 --> 14:14.160
and what their structure was.

14:14.160 --> 14:18.520
And that has the awesome side effect

14:18.520 --> 14:20.080
that if you rip off one of the legs,

14:20.080 --> 14:22.840
it'll just go through a similar process

14:22.840 --> 14:25.960
and remap to the new and then move in a different way,

14:25.960 --> 14:27.440
given what you have now.

14:27.440 --> 14:30.520
This is exactly what we see in biology

14:30.520 --> 14:34.400
where with a very wide range of various

14:36.840 --> 14:40.680
accommodations to novel circumstances can be had

14:40.680 --> 14:43.720
because evolution makes these problem-solving machines

14:43.720 --> 14:46.800
that are very good at defining

14:46.800 --> 14:48.960
and redefining themselves on the fly.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.000
So that's what I mean, right?

14:50.000 --> 14:52.680
These tricks that work well in one world,

14:52.680 --> 14:54.520
swap some stuff around, swap a time scale,

14:54.520 --> 14:56.120
swap the sensors, swap the effectors

14:56.120 --> 14:58.320
and now you're walking around in some other kind of space.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.040
I have a feeling that that's what's happening.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.720
That's my guess.

15:01.720 --> 15:02.560
That's wild.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.640
I'd never heard about this, the 2006 Bongard.

15:05.640 --> 15:06.760
Oh yeah, look it up, it's great.

15:06.760 --> 15:10.960
I think it's very, it's really foundational, yeah.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.200
I have to do some digging on that for sure.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.120
Thank you for mentioning.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.840
And there's, yeah, so many great,

15:16.840 --> 15:19.480
wow, so much awesome stuff I wanna unpack there.

15:21.440 --> 15:25.520
One of which, well, a few things that I think keep coming up,

15:26.480 --> 15:28.880
sometimes like a phrase or an idea

15:28.880 --> 15:31.280
that from our discussions

15:31.280 --> 15:33.280
or from listening to you on other podcasts,

15:33.280 --> 15:36.280
you know, you say all intelligence is collective intelligence.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.280
So I think it's really great.

15:37.280 --> 15:40.760
I think the emphasis, a lot of people need to hear that.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.720
The other thing, and I think you just touched on it a bit,

15:43.720 --> 15:47.480
is that, or maybe in our previous discussions you did too,

15:47.480 --> 15:49.120
we, a lot of people think of the brain

15:49.120 --> 15:51.480
as having this like exalted status

15:51.480 --> 15:53.440
of that the brain can do all these things

15:53.440 --> 15:55.480
that other parts of the body can't do.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.560
But what's, and it's in this paper as well

15:58.560 --> 16:00.120
and other papers too,

16:00.120 --> 16:03.280
but sometimes there's memory stored outside the brain,

16:03.280 --> 16:06.320
you know, in some of the research that you've done.

16:06.320 --> 16:09.920
Can you give us a sense of what does the brain do

16:09.920 --> 16:12.920
that's actually different than the body cells?

16:12.920 --> 16:16.920
So, yeah, so what does it have

16:16.920 --> 16:20.640
that say other parts of the body can't do?

16:20.640 --> 16:22.560
Yeah, yeah.

16:22.560 --> 16:26.120
So as much as I try to lean on the commonalities

16:26.120 --> 16:28.320
between brain and other tissues,

16:28.320 --> 16:29.600
I mean, it's pretty obvious.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.920
There's a reason why we have brains.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.280
Brains give us extra features

16:32.280 --> 16:34.160
that we wouldn't have otherwise.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.560
And so just to, you know, just, I mean,

16:37.560 --> 16:39.880
the most obvious one is speed.

16:39.880 --> 16:43.120
So neural bioelectricity is way faster

16:43.120 --> 16:44.520
than developmental bioelectricity.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.640
And I think that was part of an arms race

16:46.640 --> 16:48.520
at the beginning when things started moving around

16:48.520 --> 16:51.400
and trying to eat each other and avoid being eaten.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.960
Speed became of the essence.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.720
You know, I mean, developmental biology,

16:54.720 --> 16:57.080
I mean, yes, you want to complete embryogenesis

16:57.080 --> 16:57.920
as quickly as you can,

16:57.920 --> 16:59.680
but it's not under the same speed constraint,

16:59.680 --> 17:01.200
I think as actual behavior, you know,

17:01.200 --> 17:02.720
three-dimensional behavior.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.760
So there's speed in this idea.

17:04.760 --> 17:07.080
Then there are the point connections.

17:07.080 --> 17:09.160
So neurons can be incredibly long.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.160
And so if you want to make a directed connection

17:11.160 --> 17:12.360
from here over there,

17:13.360 --> 17:15.520
without that neural architecture

17:15.520 --> 17:17.600
of having an axon that reaches all the way down,

17:17.600 --> 17:19.960
I mean, they can be meters long in some animals.

17:20.960 --> 17:25.040
Without that, the basic bioelectric system is cumbersome

17:25.040 --> 17:27.200
because it basically thinks spread as waves

17:27.200 --> 17:28.800
or, you know, they propagate

17:28.800 --> 17:30.120
through the gap junctional milieu.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.320
It's not the same as, right?

17:32.320 --> 17:34.960
So those are kind of the architectural things.

17:34.960 --> 17:38.440
I mean, a lot of the components are conserved.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.280
So ion channels, neurotransmitters, electrical synapses,

17:42.280 --> 17:43.640
all that stuff is conserved,

17:43.640 --> 17:45.440
but it's used in a different way,

17:45.440 --> 17:48.880
both for speed and for direct connections, you know?

17:48.880 --> 17:51.320
And then there's just, there are the things

17:51.320 --> 17:53.840
that we know that are associated with brains

17:53.840 --> 17:55.240
that we haven't found anywhere else.

17:55.240 --> 17:59.200
So for just as a sort of high-end example is language, right?

17:59.200 --> 18:01.920
So I've seen no credible claims

18:01.920 --> 18:04.000
that the other organs in your body

18:04.000 --> 18:06.560
are using this kind of syntactic language structures

18:06.560 --> 18:07.840
that brains use.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.120
Not saying it's impossible.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.280
Who knows, we might find some kind of syntax,

18:11.280 --> 18:14.320
but there isn't any evidence for that yet that I know of.

18:14.320 --> 18:17.160
So that I think, you know,

18:17.160 --> 18:18.920
but other basic stuff is the same,

18:18.920 --> 18:22.720
you know, perceptual control and predictive coding

18:22.720 --> 18:25.040
and all kinds of that happens in all cells.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.440
I wanna come back real quick,

18:27.440 --> 18:28.960
because I do think this is important

18:28.960 --> 18:31.560
to something else that you said a minute ago

18:31.560 --> 18:33.040
about the collective intelligence

18:33.040 --> 18:34.480
and the fact that people need to hear that.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.560
So I wanna just talk for a moment

18:37.560 --> 18:40.120
about what it is that I think they need to hear about it.

18:40.120 --> 18:44.600
Because some people, and I keep, I'm always fishing,

18:44.600 --> 18:46.440
let's see if this helps at all,

18:46.440 --> 18:48.560
but I'm always fishing for a better way to make this point.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.560
And I don't know how effective this is.

18:52.520 --> 18:57.520
Some people get really kind of destabilized

18:57.600 --> 18:58.840
by these sorts of ideas,

18:58.840 --> 19:03.840
because what they hear is, I'm not real, I'm an illusion.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.400
And there are lots of scientists

19:05.400 --> 19:07.200
that are pushing this narrative, right?

19:07.200 --> 19:09.600
So we are to blame for this.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.920
I'm not surprised that people have these ideas.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.840
But, you know, this idea that, well, we don't exist.

19:14.840 --> 19:17.160
You know, you're a big pile of cells

19:17.160 --> 19:19.960
and you're not really here and it's all an illusion.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.080
And that's a really destabilizing idea.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.800
It's destabilizing on a personal level,

19:23.800 --> 19:25.280
it contributes to the loss of meaning,

19:25.280 --> 19:28.160
it contributes to societal issues.

19:29.120 --> 19:33.680
And so I wanna just say what I think the lesson here is.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.280
When you see science like this,

19:37.280 --> 19:42.280
the lesson isn't that you are somehow devalued

19:42.720 --> 19:44.640
from what you thought you were,

19:44.640 --> 19:48.920
and that the meaning of your life is reduced,

19:48.920 --> 19:50.640
and that your primary experience

19:50.640 --> 19:53.200
of being a coherent being with choice,

19:53.200 --> 19:56.200
with the responsibility of deciding what do you do next,

19:56.200 --> 19:59.120
that these things are now out the windows somehow.

19:59.120 --> 20:01.360
I think that's the wrong conclusion to draw from any of this.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.160
The conclusion isn't that the majesty

20:04.160 --> 20:07.280
of the integrated mind is reduced.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.920
The right conclusion is, well, two things.

20:09.920 --> 20:13.840
One is that actually we just learned an amazing thing

20:13.840 --> 20:15.840
that matter can do.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.000
We didn't know that before.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.040
We thought dumb matter was just kind of dumb.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.040
And what we're learning now,

20:23.040 --> 20:26.520
we're not learning something that changes

20:26.520 --> 20:27.360
how we view ourselves,

20:27.360 --> 20:29.640
we're learning something that changes how we view matter.

20:29.640 --> 20:33.200
And this is something that I think Ian McGilchrist says as well

20:33.200 --> 20:38.040
that we've underestimated certain kinds of matter.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.680
This idea that, no, actually,

20:41.680 --> 20:45.200
and this is, I know I've used this example before,

20:45.200 --> 20:48.040
but there's a scene in a lot of science fiction,

20:48.040 --> 20:50.640
most recently I saw it in Ex Machina, right,

20:50.640 --> 20:54.400
where the guy starts cutting his arm

20:54.400 --> 20:57.880
because now he's worried that he's an android, right?

20:57.880 --> 21:00.320
And I mean, yeah, a lot of people feel that way,

21:00.320 --> 21:04.320
but if you cut your arm or you go get a CT scan

21:04.320 --> 21:05.480
and they say, whoa, you know what?

21:05.480 --> 21:07.280
You're full of cogs and gears.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.120
The conclusion from that isn't,

21:09.120 --> 21:11.440
oh man, well, I guess I'm not as real as I thought

21:11.440 --> 21:12.280
and I'm not, you know,

21:12.280 --> 21:14.040
I guess I don't get to use my free will now.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.840
And that's not the answer.

21:15.840 --> 21:19.440
The conclusion should be amazing.

21:19.440 --> 21:24.360
Cogs and gears can give me my spiritual meaning like amazing.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.760
I've just learned something about cogs and gears, great.

21:26.760 --> 21:29.240
So that's, you know, I just want to be clear

21:29.240 --> 21:33.520
that I think this kind of analysis of what it is

21:33.520 --> 21:35.160
that we are, how we get here, you know,

21:35.160 --> 21:39.400
the self-construction of the self from cells

21:39.400 --> 21:41.200
during embryogenesis and all that,

21:41.200 --> 21:44.600
that doesn't, it doesn't have any negative implications

21:44.600 --> 21:47.200
for what you are and what you can do, just the opposite.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.920
It sort of raises the remarkable magic

21:50.920 --> 21:55.360
of these unbinding principles that you say, wild,

21:55.360 --> 21:59.320
you can actually create a being that I know I am.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.680
I mean, that's the part that I think Descartes

22:00.680 --> 22:02.640
had had exactly right.

22:04.640 --> 22:07.800
Apparently you can get there through this particular method.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.560
And there was, I forget what it is,

22:09.560 --> 22:10.800
but there was also another,

22:10.800 --> 22:13.200
an old science fiction story where, you know,

22:13.200 --> 22:15.560
these aliens kind of land on earth

22:15.560 --> 22:19.160
and they find out that humans are basically made of meat.

22:19.160 --> 22:21.560
And they say, that is the most disgusting,

22:21.560 --> 22:23.400
like you're telling me a pile of meat

22:23.400 --> 22:25.280
can have these exalted thoughts that we,

22:25.280 --> 22:27.400
in our silicon, you know, implementations,

22:27.400 --> 22:28.920
how like that's, there's no way.

22:28.920 --> 22:32.200
There's no way a pile of carbonaceous agoo

22:32.200 --> 22:35.000
is gonna have these kind of, you know, mathematical truths

22:35.000 --> 22:37.200
that we perceive with our, with our silicon minds.

22:37.200 --> 22:42.200
And right, and it's all completely arbitrary.

22:42.800 --> 22:47.880
Somebody who doesn't want to find gears under their skin

22:47.880 --> 22:49.680
and cogs and things like that.

22:49.680 --> 22:50.520
Why not?

22:50.520 --> 22:52.600
Because they've bought into the fact that proteins

22:52.600 --> 22:57.600
and RNA does it, is that anymore?

22:57.960 --> 23:00.520
You know, why are you any happier with that?

23:00.520 --> 23:03.360
None of that, none of that is intrinsically

23:03.360 --> 23:04.600
any better than anything else.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.080
So I think it's very important not to get,

23:07.080 --> 23:09.800
not to take the wrong message from all this kind of stuff

23:09.800 --> 23:13.840
and to somehow dissolve your fundamental worth

23:13.840 --> 23:15.280
just because we've seen some of the parts

23:15.280 --> 23:16.240
that are under the hood.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.200
We knew that we're gonna be parts under the hood.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.280
In fact, I'll go one step further

23:20.360 --> 23:21.280
and for the people who, right?

23:21.280 --> 23:25.280
Because one thing that people sometimes say

23:25.280 --> 23:27.280
at this point is, you're right,

23:27.280 --> 23:30.080
you've just done a deconstruction of all materialism

23:30.080 --> 23:32.320
and none of it matters unless we're a soul.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.280
Yeah, so some people feel that way

23:34.280 --> 23:37.480
that basically, right, the proteins,

23:37.480 --> 23:39.880
just like the gears all know good.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.400
So the thing with that is without even getting

23:42.400 --> 23:44.480
into the kind of the factual nature

23:44.480 --> 23:47.560
or just think purely logically, fine, fine,

23:47.560 --> 23:48.400
maybe you're a soul.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.560
What's the mechanism of the soul?

23:49.600 --> 23:50.560
There's gonna be one.

23:50.560 --> 23:51.480
It's gonna do something

23:51.480 --> 23:53.680
and it's gonna have some kind of features.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.080
If it doesn't have any, if it has no parts,

23:56.080 --> 23:59.080
then it can't change, then you can't learn,

23:59.080 --> 24:01.200
you can't make decisions, you can't improve,

24:01.200 --> 24:02.040
you can't do anything.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.680
It's gonna have some kind of structure.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.040
Maybe it's, I'll give it to you

24:05.040 --> 24:07.640
that maybe it's a completely different,

24:07.640 --> 24:10.080
something material science has never seen before.

24:10.080 --> 24:13.840
Great, but it's still gonna have some kind of descriptive

24:13.840 --> 24:18.560
laws that govern how it acts in whatever space it lives in.

24:18.560 --> 24:19.880
And then we're gonna be back to the same.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.240
Somebody's gonna say,

24:21.240 --> 24:23.840
but it's got rules that govern its behavior.

24:23.840 --> 24:25.360
That's not what I mean,

24:25.360 --> 24:29.800
but that's not enough to give me my magical feeling of stuff.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.040
So we gotta get over this.

24:32.040 --> 24:36.640
The non-material kind of way forward

24:36.640 --> 24:38.200
doesn't help at all.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.320
And we have to get over the fact

24:40.320 --> 24:42.360
that finding mechanisms under this somehow

24:42.360 --> 24:45.080
robs the larger scale of its meaning.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.120
That's just, sorry, that's a long diatribe,

24:48.120 --> 24:50.000
but that's what I wanted to say.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.320
No, no, that's great.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.080
That's spot on too.

24:53.080 --> 24:57.560
It's funny, because I had on Bobby Azarian,

24:57.560 --> 25:00.640
who's a cosmologist and wrote a great book

25:00.640 --> 25:01.720
called Romance of Reality.

25:01.720 --> 25:03.640
And he refers to this quite a bit,

25:03.640 --> 25:08.200
more in the sort of the deterministic lack of free will,

25:08.200 --> 25:10.280
but the similar kind of vein

25:10.280 --> 25:12.560
that a lot of people feel like

25:12.560 --> 25:15.520
as soon as you start to explain this stuff,

25:15.520 --> 25:19.040
it's like you're explaining away the soul or the mystery

25:19.040 --> 25:21.000
or what makes it interesting, right?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.280
But at least it seems like to me

25:23.280 --> 25:25.360
that it's just like a never-ending process.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.760
Like there's always something to learn

25:26.760 --> 25:29.000
and continue to be curious about.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
And it's funny, yeah, if you update your priors

25:34.320 --> 25:38.360
and you're not stuck to, if you're open-minded enough

25:38.360 --> 25:41.640
to all the different possibilities that are out there

25:41.640 --> 25:43.240
and you get this new information,

25:43.240 --> 25:45.800
yeah, you just keep, like you said, if you're a robot,

25:45.800 --> 25:49.160
you just say, okay, well, that's interesting.

25:49.160 --> 25:50.000
Yeah, that's interesting.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.400
And you just update and you move on

25:51.400 --> 25:54.320
and you've changed how you view the world.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.160
Yeah, that's fine.

25:55.160 --> 25:57.160
I'm the world's most amazing robot.

25:57.160 --> 25:58.600
I thought I was a meaty robot.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.000
Now I'm a metallic robot.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.480
Great, who cares?

26:02.480 --> 26:04.400
My list of things I was gonna do,

26:04.400 --> 26:06.440
the amazing things I was gonna do,

26:06.440 --> 26:09.240
still nothing's canceled, still right there.

26:09.240 --> 26:11.520
I'm still gonna go do those things.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.440
So that's what I wish,

26:13.440 --> 26:17.200
I don't know how convincing any of this is to anybody,

26:17.200 --> 26:19.760
but that's one thing that I really wish

26:19.760 --> 26:21.400
people wouldn't internalize.

26:21.400 --> 26:25.960
There's so much, both personal and social loss of,

26:27.360 --> 26:29.560
loss of meaning, I think is the best way,

26:29.560 --> 26:32.680
as Varvaki says, around all of this kind of stuff.

26:32.680 --> 26:35.120
And that's the last thing I wanna contribute to.

26:37.360 --> 26:40.360
Yeah, I mean, that's a whole fascinating route

26:40.360 --> 26:41.200
that I could go down to,

26:41.200 --> 26:44.320
because I feel like, let's just say this,

26:44.320 --> 26:48.880
like if that new information would lead you down

26:48.880 --> 26:51.280
this kind of nihilistic path,

26:51.280 --> 26:52.120
and I kind of feel like

26:52.120 --> 26:54.280
you were probably gonna go down that path anyway.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.520
Yeah, 100%.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.920
Yeah, it's sort of,

26:56.920 --> 26:59.960
you're using it as a reason to get stuck

26:59.960 --> 27:02.440
in a really a vicious cycle potentially,

27:02.440 --> 27:05.960
but yeah, that's really interesting.

27:05.960 --> 27:07.440
But actually, I think this,

27:07.440 --> 27:09.040
where I was gonna go to next anyway,

27:09.040 --> 27:11.960
and it's in this paper and the next paper as well,

27:11.960 --> 27:16.600
you had this concept called the play the hand your dealt.

27:18.160 --> 27:20.400
And you, I mean, you're using this very,

27:22.000 --> 27:23.800
how should I say it, materially,

27:23.800 --> 27:26.160
you're talking about the cellular collectives

27:26.160 --> 27:29.160
that can carry out different steps

27:29.160 --> 27:31.760
with its sort of second order functions.

27:31.760 --> 27:36.880
It's not, they're far more, let's say malleable,

27:36.880 --> 27:40.880
and far more open-ended kind of strategies

27:40.880 --> 27:42.560
for accomplishing their goals.

27:42.560 --> 27:45.280
Can you talk to us about that and what that,

27:45.280 --> 27:48.280
I think you, the acronym is PhD,

27:48.280 --> 27:50.000
so play the hand your dealt.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.240
Yeah, well, let's just start with a specific example.

27:55.120 --> 28:00.120
So you take a salamander egg

28:00.680 --> 28:03.480
and there's a certain tricks you can do

28:03.480 --> 28:06.360
to increase the number of the chromosome count

28:06.360 --> 28:09.680
within the number of copies of the genome

28:09.680 --> 28:10.880
that are in there.

28:10.880 --> 28:13.120
And so when you do that,

28:13.120 --> 28:16.200
so let's say we increase instead of two N,

28:16.200 --> 28:18.920
you can make four N, five N, six N and so on.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.560
So as you do that, the cells,

28:20.560 --> 28:23.200
the embryonic cells get bigger and bigger.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.800
The salamander stays the same size.

28:25.800 --> 28:29.520
If you take a cross section through a kidney tubule,

28:29.520 --> 28:31.440
which normally is made of, I don't know if you can picture

28:31.440 --> 28:35.520
this, but like six to eight cells that work together

28:35.520 --> 28:38.280
to form this kind of like long tube,

28:38.280 --> 28:39.400
they get bigger and bigger,

28:39.400 --> 28:41.480
but the animal stays the same size

28:41.480 --> 28:42.840
and the tubule stays the same size.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.760
So what this means is that fewer and fewer

28:44.760 --> 28:48.040
of these larger cells participate in each tubule, right?

28:48.960 --> 28:52.000
And so far, so we have two amazing things so far.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.520
Number one is you've got the wrong number of chromosomes,

28:55.520 --> 28:58.040
fine, you're still a good salamander, amazing.

28:58.040 --> 29:01.520
Number two, your cells are the wrong size, no problem.

29:01.520 --> 29:04.360
We manage the cell number to make up

29:04.360 --> 29:06.120
for this different in cell size.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.080
You're still a good salamander.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.920
Number three, if you make the cells absolutely gigantic,

29:11.920 --> 29:14.000
and these are I think six or eight N,

29:14.000 --> 29:17.320
I don't remember exactly, what happens is,

29:17.320 --> 29:19.960
there's not room for even two cells to be there.

29:19.960 --> 29:23.360
So what happens is one single cell wraps around itself

29:23.360 --> 29:24.840
and leaves a hole in the middle

29:24.840 --> 29:26.960
to give you that same tubule, okay?

29:26.960 --> 29:28.520
Aside from the whole issue.

29:28.520 --> 29:32.640
So what it is is it's using different molecular mechanisms.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.880
In the first case, it was cell-to-cell communication.

29:34.880 --> 29:37.120
In the next case, it's cytoskeletal bending.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.640
You're using different molecular mechanisms

29:40.640 --> 29:43.400
in the service of an anatomical large-scale goal.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.840
That's a kind of top-down causation, super interesting,

29:45.840 --> 29:48.360
but for our purpose, more importantly,

29:48.360 --> 29:50.480
look at your job as a salamander.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.760
You come into this world,

29:51.760 --> 29:55.120
you can't tell how many chromosomes you're gonna have.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.960
You don't know what your cell size is.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.520
You don't know how many cells you're gonna have

29:58.520 --> 29:59.400
because people have done that too.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.440
You can take away cells, you can add cells.

30:01.440 --> 30:02.400
You don't know any of that stuff.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.000
You need to be able to, your goal

30:04.000 --> 30:06.080
is to be able to make a good salamander

30:06.080 --> 30:07.480
no matter what you start with.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.000
So that's within limits, obviously.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.760
I mean, all of these things are not infinitely stretchable.

30:12.760 --> 30:14.480
So that's one example.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.000
Here's another example, plenaria, flatworms.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.080
The species that we work with

30:19.080 --> 30:21.880
reproduces by tearing themselves in half and regenerating.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.400
That's how they reproduce.

30:23.400 --> 30:26.600
That means that they have somatic inheritance.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.520
Any mutation that doesn't kill the stem cell

30:29.520 --> 30:31.920
is gonna be proliferated into the body

30:31.920 --> 30:34.440
and expanded in the body in the next generation.

30:34.440 --> 30:36.640
So if you look at these worms, they're mix-a-ploid.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.560
Every cell has a different number of chromosomes.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.080
The genome is a total mess

30:40.080 --> 30:41.960
because they just accumulate this stuff.

30:41.960 --> 30:44.560
400 million years they've been accumulating all this junk.

30:44.560 --> 30:48.880
And yet that's the species with perfect regeneration,

30:48.880 --> 30:52.560
high cancer resistance, no aging in the asexual form.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.840
Incredible, right?

30:56.840 --> 31:01.400
And so the same story there is what you have to do

31:01.400 --> 31:03.160
is you have to have an algorithm

31:03.160 --> 31:05.360
that builds a correct plenarian

31:06.440 --> 31:08.880
despite errors in the hardware.

31:08.880 --> 31:10.200
And that's what I think.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.760
So there's my play the hand-in-the-dilts concept

31:13.760 --> 31:16.760
is that coming into this world as a new creature,

31:16.760 --> 31:19.760
there's precious few things you can depend on for most.

31:19.760 --> 31:22.080
I mean, there are hardwired things like C. elegans,

31:22.080 --> 31:24.800
nematodes, and maybe some other species.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.520
But I think, and there's all spectrum.

31:27.520 --> 31:30.440
So I would sort of imagine that something like nematodes

31:30.480 --> 31:32.480
where every nematode, every C. elegans

31:32.480 --> 31:33.960
has exactly the same number of cells

31:33.960 --> 31:35.200
and they all have the same lineage.

31:35.200 --> 31:37.880
So that's a very cookie cutter organism and that's here.

31:37.880 --> 31:40.600
Plenaria are super plastic and they're out there.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.000
And salamanders are somewhere here

31:42.000 --> 31:43.040
and humans are somewhere,

31:43.040 --> 31:44.160
mammals are somewhere here.

31:44.160 --> 31:47.800
We all have different degrees of that competency.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.720
But that's the idea.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.280
Most of us don't come into the world

31:52.280 --> 31:55.200
being able to expect very specific things

31:55.200 --> 31:57.560
and then just crashing and burning

31:57.560 --> 31:59.280
when those assumptions aren't met.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.560
This is why we can make tadpoles with eyes on their backs

32:02.560 --> 32:07.880
that can see, and this is why slippers goat

32:07.880 --> 32:13.880
when that two-legged, right, the goat that didn't have any form.

32:13.880 --> 32:16.120
Shippers, goat, yeah, something like that.

32:16.120 --> 32:19.280
Yeah, learn to walk upright.

32:19.280 --> 32:22.480
And they found that a lot of the changes

32:22.480 --> 32:27.000
that come along with bipedal locomotion were already made

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
because of the incredible plasticity of the organism.

32:33.200 --> 32:36.400
And it's why skin cells taken off of frog embryos

32:36.400 --> 32:38.440
becomes xenobots and why,

32:38.440 --> 32:40.560
and instead of just like collapsing and dying

32:40.560 --> 32:44.160
and all of these things, that's play the hand you're dealt.

32:44.160 --> 32:47.240
That's the idea that we have to...

32:47.240 --> 32:48.720
There may have been life at one point

32:48.720 --> 32:52.440
that was much more cookie cutter, but none of that survived.

32:52.440 --> 32:54.520
Nowadays, if you're gonna survive,

32:54.520 --> 32:58.320
nowadays, you're the kind of life that is able to do this.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.240
Right, and can you tell us about...

33:01.680 --> 33:02.960
One thing I was thinking about too,

33:02.960 --> 33:04.120
with the play the hand you're dealt,

33:04.120 --> 33:06.960
sort of like whatever materials you have there,

33:06.960 --> 33:08.480
that's what you're gonna use,

33:08.480 --> 33:10.720
is, and with bioelectricity, of course,

33:10.720 --> 33:13.960
like the electromagnetic spectrum,

33:13.960 --> 33:17.680
that's sort of what's available to these cells, right?

33:17.680 --> 33:19.760
And I'm thinking, and perhaps this is just

33:19.760 --> 33:21.520
because it's at the limits of our science,

33:21.520 --> 33:24.200
have you found either in your own research

33:24.200 --> 33:27.120
or in research of your contemporaries,

33:27.120 --> 33:31.600
like evidence of organisms making use of quantum fields?

33:31.600 --> 33:33.960
Like are all the different fields that are available,

33:33.960 --> 33:35.440
you know what, I mean, electricity,

33:35.440 --> 33:39.400
I understand why bioelectricity is so great.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.080
I mean, we use a lot of the same,

33:42.040 --> 33:45.520
the ion, like the ion channels, like logic gates,

33:45.520 --> 33:47.800
we use that stuff in our technology,

33:47.800 --> 33:49.720
you know, similar kind of processes.

33:49.720 --> 33:52.160
But anything in the quantum realm that you've seen?

33:53.160 --> 33:56.840
So we don't study that specifically,

33:56.840 --> 33:58.920
so I don't have any data about it.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.480
There are certainly people that study quantum biology,

34:01.480 --> 34:05.440
there's some great people who, you know,

34:05.440 --> 34:07.440
Claree Ciello and my former postdoc,

34:07.440 --> 34:10.560
Nerocia Morgan, they're into this kind of stuff.

34:10.560 --> 34:12.760
And as our other people,

34:12.760 --> 34:14.440
and I'm sure there are interesting things

34:14.440 --> 34:16.400
that we don't particularly work on it.

34:17.400 --> 34:20.080
My gut feeling is that,

34:21.720 --> 34:22.920
not being an expert in this,

34:22.920 --> 34:25.800
but just for whatever it's worth, my gut feeling,

34:25.800 --> 34:28.520
it's gonna be the sort of thing that if it exists,

34:28.520 --> 34:31.480
it's not gonna be some weird special adaptation where,

34:31.480 --> 34:33.880
you know, all look birds are using, you know,

34:33.880 --> 34:36.840
quantum spin to navigate the magnetic field

34:36.840 --> 34:38.000
and that's it, it's not gonna be like that.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.040
I think, I mean, that may also be,

34:40.040 --> 34:41.400
but I don't mean that.

34:41.400 --> 34:45.360
I think what we're gonna find is that it's everywhere,

34:45.360 --> 34:48.640
like it's a basic fundamental, if it's there,

34:48.640 --> 34:49.680
if quantum biology is there,

34:49.680 --> 34:51.400
which I suspect it probably is,

34:51.400 --> 34:54.280
it's gonna be used for everything.

34:54.280 --> 34:55.320
We're gonna find out all the things

34:55.320 --> 34:58.520
that we take for granted now that are just,

34:58.520 --> 34:59.520
you know, we kind of assume

34:59.520 --> 35:00.880
there's a classical explanation for it,

35:00.880 --> 35:02.120
but we don't know what it is.

35:02.120 --> 35:04.480
I have a feeling we're gonna find out a lot of this stuff

35:04.480 --> 35:07.480
is at bottom, exploiting some of those properties.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.160
That's just, that's totally a guess on my part.

35:10.160 --> 35:13.960
I don't have any data to, you know, support any of that.

35:13.960 --> 35:15.800
But that's my guess.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.720
Yeah, yeah, that's interesting.

35:17.720 --> 35:21.840
I would see, the very little I know about the quantum,

35:21.840 --> 35:24.000
like quantum mechanics is that I would assume

35:24.000 --> 35:26.160
these structures, even cellular structures,

35:26.160 --> 35:29.440
they're tiny to us, but they're too large,

35:30.360 --> 35:31.520
like, you know, it breaks down.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.860
The quantum effects are just,

35:33.860 --> 35:35.240
what happened to a way smaller lens,

35:35.240 --> 35:37.040
but like you just pointed out,

35:37.040 --> 35:39.360
like I think that there's some research

35:39.360 --> 35:40.240
I've done a little bit of digging,

35:40.240 --> 35:43.240
but I have to do more about quantum biology.

35:43.960 --> 35:47.920
Yeah, look at, also look at the work of Chris Fields

35:47.920 --> 35:50.040
and folks that he works with,

35:50.040 --> 35:54.200
because there are aspects of what's important about that field

35:54.200 --> 35:56.400
that has nothing to do with being small.

35:56.400 --> 35:59.000
So there are really important aspects of, you know,

35:59.000 --> 36:00.880
in terms of what's an observer and reference,

36:00.880 --> 36:02.160
for observer reference frames,

36:02.160 --> 36:05.720
and these kinds of things that apply across scales.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.920
So Chris has some beautiful papers about that.

36:08.920 --> 36:12.360
So it's not just for tiny particles and things like that.

36:13.240 --> 36:14.440
That's good to know too.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.040
And before we move into Darwin's and Gentryl materials,

36:17.040 --> 36:18.760
I think it's still applicable here.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.200
Can you tell us about, I think there was one podcast you did

36:21.200 --> 36:25.280
where you talked about trophic memory in deer

36:25.280 --> 36:26.440
and antler structures,

36:26.440 --> 36:27.960
and actually the scientist that was studying it

36:27.960 --> 36:29.680
actually sent them to you,

36:29.680 --> 36:31.120
and you have a bunch of these.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.680
Can you just tell us a little anecdote?

36:33.680 --> 36:36.880
Yeah, well, okay, so first, what is trophic memory?

36:36.880 --> 36:41.400
So there's certain species of deer that every year

36:42.040 --> 36:44.160
they shed their antlers and then they grow them back.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.640
Antlers are real bone, they're not like horns.

36:46.640 --> 36:49.320
They're real bone with velvet and innovation and all that.

36:49.320 --> 36:53.000
So there was this team, last named Bubenek,

36:53.000 --> 36:56.680
and it was two folks, a father and son,

36:56.680 --> 36:58.320
and they live in Canada.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.120
And they did experiments for,

37:00.120 --> 37:01.680
I'm gonna say well over 30 years,

37:01.680 --> 37:04.320
maybe 40 years together, something like that,

37:04.320 --> 37:06.920
where what they found is that if you see,

37:06.920 --> 37:08.720
you got this deer and you take a knife

37:08.720 --> 37:13.000
and you etch a little cut into somewhere

37:13.000 --> 37:15.320
on this branch structure.

37:15.320 --> 37:18.480
And that year, it kind of heals with a little callus,

37:18.480 --> 37:20.040
the bone heals, and that's that.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.200
And then the whole thing drops off.

37:22.200 --> 37:25.840
And then next year, when they regrow their antlers,

37:25.840 --> 37:29.040
it grows with an ectopic branch point at the location

37:29.040 --> 37:31.640
where the damage was last year.

37:31.640 --> 37:35.760
Now, I read this, and so they got these papers

37:35.760 --> 37:38.560
from 60s and 70s and beyond.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.520
It's an amazing data set.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.200
No one's ever gonna get a data set like this.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.800
I mean, who's got a herd of deer

37:44.800 --> 37:46.360
that they can watch for 40 years?

37:46.360 --> 37:48.560
It's a, in modern biology careers,

37:48.560 --> 37:53.560
that's not exactly conducive to getting a good associate,

37:54.320 --> 37:56.480
this is in a professor position.

37:56.480 --> 37:59.720
But they've got this incredible data set.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.120
And when I first read about this,

38:01.120 --> 38:05.320
I thought it was amazing because if you try to think

38:05.320 --> 38:10.320
about the current, what passes for an explanation

38:11.360 --> 38:13.360
for a biological phenomenon nowadays?

38:13.360 --> 38:16.400
So if you find this, you look at a typical cell paper,

38:16.400 --> 38:18.960
figure seven is gonna be a molecular pathway, right?

38:18.960 --> 38:20.760
So there's some arrow diagrams on this thing bind,

38:20.760 --> 38:21.960
so that thing, and then they go over here

38:21.960 --> 38:23.640
and they bind to this other thing.

38:23.640 --> 38:26.320
Just try to come up with a model like that

38:26.320 --> 38:27.760
for what's going on here.

38:27.760 --> 38:30.800
So there's a large scale structure.

38:30.800 --> 38:34.240
It gets a damage input at a particular location.

38:34.280 --> 38:35.840
The whole thing falls off.

38:35.840 --> 38:40.000
The cells at the scalp, which are tens of centimeters away,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.480
remember the three-dimensional position

38:42.480 --> 38:44.720
where the damage was last year.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.600
And then when the bone cells start growing,

38:46.600 --> 38:50.240
they revise the genetically encoded rules to say,

38:50.240 --> 38:51.920
oh, by the way, when you get to this point,

38:51.920 --> 38:53.800
make an extra thing to the right.

38:53.800 --> 38:57.600
Like what possible explanation

38:57.600 --> 39:00.800
using conventional conceptual tools that we have?

39:00.800 --> 39:01.880
Could you come up with it?

39:01.880 --> 39:03.240
It just completely fails.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.400
And so this is one of the things I tell my students

39:05.400 --> 39:08.320
is that your developmental biology textbook

39:08.320 --> 39:10.680
is full of things that are readily explained

39:10.680 --> 39:13.280
by the conceptual tools that we have now.

39:13.280 --> 39:15.720
That's what's in the textbook, other success cases.

39:15.720 --> 39:20.160
So what's fun is to look for the blank space in between.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.840
What are all the things that are not in there, right?

39:21.840 --> 39:22.680
And they're not in there

39:22.680 --> 39:24.040
because we don't have a clue as to how it works.

39:24.040 --> 39:26.040
So this is the kind of, I mean, I love that stuff.

39:26.040 --> 39:28.560
So I'm always thinking about these kinds of things.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.120
So anyway, so at one point,

39:30.120 --> 39:33.320
so we wrote Daniel Lobo and I wrote a paper about this

39:33.320 --> 39:36.360
and explaining like what the implications of that are

39:36.360 --> 39:38.840
for the inverse problem,

39:38.840 --> 39:41.200
which plagues regenerative medicine and so on.

39:41.200 --> 39:45.080
And Bubenek emailed me and he said,

39:45.080 --> 39:46.840
he said, you're one of the few people

39:46.840 --> 39:48.960
that sites this stuff nowadays.

39:48.960 --> 39:53.080
I need to like basically clean out the house, the garage.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.440
Would you like these antlers?

39:54.440 --> 39:56.760
And I was like, to hell yes, of course I would.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.320
And that's such a unique, I mean, it's amazing work.

39:59.360 --> 40:02.320
It's such a unique dataset.

40:02.320 --> 40:05.840
And so we received in my lab 13, I think it was 13,

40:05.840 --> 40:08.240
13 large boxes of these antlers.

40:08.240 --> 40:13.240
And I sent them all to the veteran,

40:15.240 --> 40:16.280
a Tufts Veterinary School.

40:16.280 --> 40:20.600
They have a CAT scan machine where they CT scan horses

40:20.600 --> 40:21.440
and things like that.

40:21.440 --> 40:23.400
And so they CT scanned all of these things.

40:23.400 --> 40:26.400
So I have somewhere, I've still got the antlers

40:26.400 --> 40:27.640
during boxes in the closet.

40:27.640 --> 40:29.080
I have a couple of them on the wall actually

40:29.080 --> 40:30.320
in the lab as you walk into the lab.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.400
There's a couple on the wall.

40:31.400 --> 40:34.880
But yeah, but I still got these boxes.

40:34.880 --> 40:37.720
And it was incredible because every set of antlers

40:37.720 --> 40:41.240
is labeled with the name of the deer and the year.

40:41.240 --> 40:44.720
So it'll be like, Lenny, 1987, Lenny, 1988.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.440
And because you have to do these longitudinal,

40:46.440 --> 40:48.040
like you have to know which deer it was.

40:48.040 --> 40:50.000
And he kept meticulous records.

40:50.000 --> 40:55.640
And so we have all of these antlers.

40:55.640 --> 41:00.640
And it's a very unfortunate model system

41:00.840 --> 41:02.200
because if you want to do experiments,

41:02.200 --> 41:04.320
I mean, who's going to have deer and wait years

41:04.320 --> 41:05.720
for an outcome like it's crazy.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.880
But the closest thing to that actually

41:07.880 --> 41:09.560
is our two-headed plenarium

41:09.560 --> 41:11.800
because it's a very similar kind of thing.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.920
It's a physiological stimulus

41:14.920 --> 41:16.520
that gets somehow catalyzed

41:16.520 --> 41:20.360
into multi-generational repair processes.

41:20.360 --> 41:22.440
Because once you've make them two-headed,

41:22.440 --> 41:23.400
you can keep cutting them.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.560
They stay two-headed forever.

41:25.920 --> 41:28.640
And luckily, plenarium are much more tractable than deer.

41:28.640 --> 41:32.000
So I suspect those things are highly related,

41:32.000 --> 41:34.920
but that's my deer antler story.

41:34.920 --> 41:37.360
That's awesome. That's so cool.

41:37.360 --> 41:40.520
That must be what a fixture to have in the lab, too.

41:40.520 --> 41:42.040
It's right in the front as you walk in.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.360
Great story, too.

41:43.360 --> 41:45.280
Awesome. Thanks for sharing that.

41:45.280 --> 41:46.680
So I'd love to turn towards,

41:46.680 --> 41:47.800
and there's going to be a lot of overlap

41:47.800 --> 41:50.200
between this paper and what we just discussed.

41:50.200 --> 41:53.640
And I'm sure we'll talk more about bi-electricity as well.

41:53.640 --> 41:57.400
But the second paper, Darwin's Ingencial Materials,

41:57.400 --> 42:00.160
Evolutionary Implications of Multiscale Competency

42:00.160 --> 42:01.920
and Developmental Biology.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.840
And both of these papers, the first two,

42:03.840 --> 42:06.080
they really just dropped in the last few months, right?

42:06.080 --> 42:07.400
April 2023.

42:07.400 --> 42:10.440
So these are hot off the presses for folks.

42:10.440 --> 42:13.480
I don't really heard you talk about these in other podcasts.

42:13.480 --> 42:17.000
So it's great that we're getting a chance today to do that.

42:17.960 --> 42:19.240
And before we jump right into the paper,

42:19.240 --> 42:20.240
is this an illusion at all

42:20.240 --> 42:23.120
to the His Dark Materials book series?

42:23.120 --> 42:24.680
Like the title?

42:24.680 --> 42:26.800
No, not really.

42:26.800 --> 42:27.640
No.

42:27.640 --> 42:28.480
Okay, just wondering.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.920
I mean, that's a little bit of a flyer,

42:29.920 --> 42:31.600
because it's Darwin's Materials.

42:31.600 --> 42:32.880
I was like, is there sort of a...

42:32.880 --> 42:35.160
Yeah, it does sound like that, doesn't it?

42:35.160 --> 42:37.360
No, not really.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.720
Okay, cool. Yeah, just an aside.

42:39.720 --> 42:41.880
But would you mind, I mean, just like you did

42:41.880 --> 42:42.720
for the first paper,

42:42.720 --> 42:44.360
could you provide like a simple overview

42:44.360 --> 42:47.040
and then I have a bunch of questions to ask you about?

42:47.040 --> 42:47.880
Yeah.

42:48.760 --> 42:52.320
Let's start from this idea

42:53.200 --> 42:56.360
and I tried to formalize this in my tame paper

42:56.360 --> 42:58.280
from a few years ago.

42:58.280 --> 43:00.920
This idea of a spectrum of,

43:00.920 --> 43:02.000
you can call it many things,

43:02.000 --> 43:03.560
it's a spectrum of persuadability.

43:03.560 --> 43:05.840
That's what I call it in the paper, a spectrum of agency.

43:05.840 --> 43:08.640
Just the idea that you can put any system

43:08.640 --> 43:11.000
on this continuous spectrum

43:11.000 --> 43:15.560
that tries to capture how much autonomy the thing has

43:15.560 --> 43:17.160
from an engineering perspective.

43:17.160 --> 43:18.840
How much can I expect?

43:18.840 --> 43:22.280
How much problem-solving chops does this thing have?

43:23.000 --> 43:24.520
When I'm not around to force it.

43:24.520 --> 43:29.520
So, and you can go from Legos to thermostats,

43:32.680 --> 43:35.240
to animals that learn, to humans,

43:35.240 --> 43:37.480
and then everything in between is there, right?

43:37.480 --> 43:40.640
Okay, so now we can ask the following question.

43:40.640 --> 43:41.880
As an engineer,

43:41.880 --> 43:44.120
and so this is another paper I wrote with Jamie Davies

43:44.120 --> 43:47.080
a few years ago, maybe a year ago,

43:47.080 --> 43:50.000
talking about engineering with agential materials,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.680
because engineering is very different

43:52.680 --> 43:55.840
based on where along that spectrum your parts are.

43:55.840 --> 43:59.280
If you are engineering with Legos, everything is on you.

43:59.280 --> 44:01.880
The only thing the Lego's gonna do is keep its shape.

44:01.880 --> 44:02.960
That's all it knows how to do.

44:02.960 --> 44:04.120
So everything else is on you.

44:04.120 --> 44:06.160
Everything that you need to happen,

44:06.160 --> 44:07.920
you have to somehow make sure it happens.

44:07.920 --> 44:11.560
And this is how molecular synthetic biology works.

44:11.560 --> 44:14.040
You're gonna put in circuits that do specific things.

44:14.040 --> 44:16.840
It's on you to implement every part

44:16.840 --> 44:18.600
of the functionality that you want.

44:20.560 --> 44:24.680
If you, and so humans have been engineering with bricks

44:24.680 --> 44:28.080
and wood and metal for thousands of years,

44:28.080 --> 44:31.280
and use a certain set of techniques to do that.

44:31.280 --> 44:32.440
What are those techniques?

44:32.440 --> 44:36.360
Well, they don't involve psychological tools.

44:36.360 --> 44:39.120
They involve very kind of low level,

44:39.120 --> 44:41.520
put everything where it goes and glue it down

44:41.520 --> 44:43.040
and attach this thing to that thing.

44:43.040 --> 44:44.840
That's your toolbox.

44:44.840 --> 44:48.840
Well, if you're building autonomous vehicles

44:48.840 --> 44:51.960
or self-guided missiles or houses or whatever,

44:51.960 --> 44:53.280
you've got some other stuff,

44:53.280 --> 44:55.080
which are, for example, thermostats.

44:55.080 --> 44:57.560
So if you've got a thermostat, it's interesting

44:57.560 --> 45:00.120
because you don't even necessarily need to know

45:00.120 --> 45:01.280
how the whole thing works.

45:01.280 --> 45:03.920
What you need to know is where is the set point

45:03.920 --> 45:05.280
and how do I change it, right?

45:05.280 --> 45:06.640
And what are the inputs and what are the outputs?

45:06.640 --> 45:07.640
Where does the thermometer go?

45:07.640 --> 45:10.360
Where does the connection to the heating,

45:10.360 --> 45:12.040
to the cooling and heating go?

45:12.040 --> 45:14.000
And what you know is that it's gonna do certain things

45:14.000 --> 45:15.680
when you're out there to micromanage it.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.720
Do you have to leave rules for what to do

45:17.720 --> 45:18.880
at every single temperature level?

45:18.880 --> 45:19.720
You don't.

45:19.720 --> 45:20.680
It's gonna do that on its own.

45:20.680 --> 45:22.000
So you've got some other tools

45:22.000 --> 45:23.280
and these are the tools of cybernetics.

45:23.280 --> 45:25.160
So for more complex systems,

45:25.160 --> 45:28.440
you'll have control theory and all these kinds of tools

45:28.440 --> 45:32.120
to deal with something that has a simple level of agency.

45:32.120 --> 45:35.600
It's got very basic, kind of primitive goals

45:35.600 --> 45:39.240
that it tries to set, and if you don't understand

45:39.240 --> 45:40.880
anything about cybernetics,

45:40.880 --> 45:44.480
you are not going to get the most out of these components.

45:44.480 --> 45:46.840
If you don't understand what homeostasis is,

45:46.840 --> 45:48.400
what goal-directed loops are,

45:48.400 --> 45:49.560
you're not really gonna be very good

45:49.560 --> 45:51.800
at using those in your engineering.

45:51.800 --> 45:52.880
Okay.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.600
And then you move forward and you say,

45:54.600 --> 45:59.600
okay, I'm a proprietor of a circus,

45:59.960 --> 46:01.200
of a rat circus.

46:01.200 --> 46:04.080
And I want these rats to do little tricks, right?

46:04.080 --> 46:07.400
I want them to, and in the Jamie's paper,

46:07.400 --> 46:10.680
I think we talked about building a tower out of dogs.

46:10.680 --> 46:14.280
I could try the traditional route

46:14.280 --> 46:16.400
of stacking them on top of each other,

46:16.440 --> 46:17.360
but that isn't gonna work.

46:17.360 --> 46:18.960
They're gonna crawl off.

46:18.960 --> 46:20.560
They're not gonna just stay where I put them.

46:20.560 --> 46:22.200
So that doesn't work at all.

46:22.200 --> 46:24.000
I have to use a completely different set of tricks

46:24.000 --> 46:26.040
that people who work with wood and metal don't have to use.

46:26.040 --> 46:27.720
I have to train my material.

46:27.720 --> 46:29.640
I have to, now on the one hand,

46:29.640 --> 46:30.800
it's a bit of a pain in the butt

46:30.800 --> 46:33.160
because your material has its own agenda

46:33.160 --> 46:35.280
and you have to have tools to manage it.

46:35.280 --> 46:36.280
But here's the beauty of it.

46:36.280 --> 46:39.640
Once you've trained them to keep a little tower,

46:39.640 --> 46:41.680
if you knock it over, guess what it does?

46:41.680 --> 46:43.040
They get right back up on their own.

46:43.040 --> 46:44.880
You don't have to be there to rebuild it.

46:44.880 --> 46:45.800
Isn't that amazing?

46:46.720 --> 46:48.240
So you've gained something very interesting

46:48.240 --> 46:50.800
by switching the bag of tools you bring to the problem.

46:50.800 --> 46:52.120
You've gained something interesting

46:52.120 --> 46:53.200
and you were only able to do that

46:53.200 --> 46:55.520
because you recognized the agency of the material.

46:55.520 --> 46:56.920
You wouldn't do that, right?

46:56.920 --> 46:59.320
You wouldn't do that if you didn't know,

46:59.320 --> 47:00.920
if you thought that these things are dumb,

47:00.920 --> 47:03.080
like bricks and Legos.

47:03.080 --> 47:04.680
So it's very important.

47:04.680 --> 47:07.800
And then you see this all the way up.

47:07.800 --> 47:11.240
If you're a hacker, you might be hacking the computer,

47:11.240 --> 47:13.920
but you might be doing what they call social engineering.

47:13.920 --> 47:15.920
You might find out that it's much easier

47:15.920 --> 47:18.080
to just trick somebody giving you their password

47:18.080 --> 47:22.000
than to spend all day brute forcing the hashtag or whatever.

47:22.000 --> 47:27.000
So there's this has to be this impedance match

47:27.040 --> 47:28.800
between the tools you bring to the problem.

47:28.800 --> 47:32.400
And the successful engineer is one that recognizes

47:32.400 --> 47:36.280
what's the right level of agency in my material.

47:36.280 --> 47:39.440
And so that leads to the question for regenerative medicine.

47:39.440 --> 47:42.840
We have cells and tissues and you ask,

47:42.840 --> 47:45.040
so what are the tools that I'm gonna use there?

47:45.040 --> 47:47.040
And the assumption up until now,

47:47.040 --> 47:49.760
the assumption has been, well, they're like the bricks.

47:49.760 --> 47:51.920
You have to micromanage all of it.

47:51.920 --> 47:56.920
Yeah, that's been the standard assumption of the paradigm.

47:57.160 --> 47:59.840
And but it's very much an open question.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.800
Are they more like the Legos

48:01.800 --> 48:03.040
or are they more like the rats

48:03.040 --> 48:04.840
or are they more like something in between?

48:04.840 --> 48:06.920
Or are they more like the thermostat or where are they?

48:06.920 --> 48:09.600
And regenerative medicine is gonna be cracked

48:09.600 --> 48:12.100
by the people who pick the right level.

48:12.100 --> 48:15.220
It's not gonna be cracked by assuming the wrong level

48:15.220 --> 48:18.020
nor down, so it's not gonna happen

48:18.020 --> 48:22.300
if you assume these things are low agency machines.

48:22.300 --> 48:24.780
It's also not going to happen if you assume

48:24.780 --> 48:28.540
that they're magical, inexplicable things

48:28.540 --> 48:32.480
that aren't gonna obey any kind of rational rules.

48:32.480 --> 48:34.460
That's not gonna work either somewhere in the middle,

48:34.460 --> 48:36.020
which is what of course what my lab tries to do

48:36.020 --> 48:38.780
is to pick the right set of tools from cybernetics,

48:38.780 --> 48:41.980
from behavioral science to take advantage.

48:42.360 --> 48:45.500
So having said all of that, here's the thing with the paper.

48:45.500 --> 48:47.460
So what I just took you through

48:47.460 --> 48:51.540
is how human engineers view the spectrum

48:51.540 --> 48:53.980
of agential materials, right?

48:53.980 --> 48:56.100
And so now it comes time to, so we wrote,

48:56.100 --> 48:57.980
so Jamie and I wrote that, and then I said, okay,

48:57.980 --> 49:00.020
so now what does evolution do?

49:00.020 --> 49:01.580
Evolution is also an engineer.

49:01.580 --> 49:06.580
So the question is, does evolution assume

49:07.140 --> 49:09.540
and work at the, assume that these things are like Legos

49:09.540 --> 49:10.980
and work at the lowest level,

49:10.980 --> 49:12.780
which means search the really difficult

49:12.780 --> 49:17.780
and really kind of rugged space of molecular properties

49:18.900 --> 49:21.780
or would evolution take advantage

49:21.780 --> 49:23.820
of the competency of the material?

49:23.820 --> 49:25.660
Because the thing about evolution is evolution

49:25.660 --> 49:28.620
doesn't work with Legos, evolution works with cells

49:28.620 --> 49:31.700
and cells and tissues used to be independent organisms.

49:31.700 --> 49:33.580
They don't come as blank slates that are dumb

49:33.580 --> 49:35.220
and have to be micromanaged.

49:35.220 --> 49:37.580
They come with behavioral competencies,

49:37.620 --> 49:41.100
with preferences, with various kinds of agendas.

49:41.100 --> 49:45.060
And so what that paper is, is an exploration of,

49:45.060 --> 49:47.460
if we take that seriously, the fact that evolution,

49:47.460 --> 49:49.220
of course, evolution is very opportunistic,

49:49.220 --> 49:52.020
it makes use of everything it can, we know that.

49:52.020 --> 49:55.900
What can we conclude if we take seriously the idea

49:55.900 --> 49:57.660
that evolution will not have missed the fact

49:57.660 --> 49:59.140
that it's dealing with a very powerful

49:59.140 --> 50:00.420
agential material that these cells

50:00.420 --> 50:01.740
already know how to do things?

50:01.740 --> 50:03.780
And so what I do in that paper is run down

50:03.780 --> 50:05.500
all of the implications.

50:05.500 --> 50:06.820
What does it mean for evolution

50:06.820 --> 50:09.180
that it isn't working with Legos, it's working?

50:09.180 --> 50:12.620
Of course, people have used evolutionary computation,

50:12.620 --> 50:14.620
like genetic algorithms and things like that

50:14.620 --> 50:16.380
with materials that really are dumb.

50:16.380 --> 50:20.060
So the typical evolutionary algorithm

50:20.060 --> 50:25.060
is done over passive data and it shows you improvements

50:25.060 --> 50:26.420
but the material is very passive

50:26.420 --> 50:28.740
and here I'm saying biological evolution isn't like that.

50:28.740 --> 50:29.620
So what does that mean?

50:29.620 --> 50:31.140
What will that do to evolution?

50:31.140 --> 50:32.540
And that's kind of the flip side, right?

50:32.540 --> 50:36.620
A lot of people study how intelligence,

50:36.620 --> 50:38.700
how evolution gives rise to intelligence

50:38.700 --> 50:41.460
of different types, I sort of reverse that

50:41.460 --> 50:43.980
and of course both are happening simultaneously

50:43.980 --> 50:45.420
but I looked at the other side of things

50:45.420 --> 50:47.620
which is how does intelligence impact

50:47.620 --> 50:50.740
the actual evolution, the intelligence of the substrate?

50:51.940 --> 50:54.220
Sure, that's interesting, still thought provoking.

50:54.220 --> 50:58.540
The, can I tell you something,

50:58.540 --> 51:00.620
an impulse I had while reading the paper

51:00.620 --> 51:02.420
even though it's not stated explicitly

51:02.420 --> 51:04.660
and even something you just said.

51:04.660 --> 51:07.900
Would you, how do you view even the evolutionary process?

51:07.900 --> 51:10.460
I mean, it almost sounds like evolution is an agent

51:10.460 --> 51:12.020
in and of itself.

51:12.020 --> 51:15.660
Do you view it that way or how do you look at it?

51:15.660 --> 51:18.020
Yeah, this is an interesting point.

51:18.020 --> 51:23.020
That's a paper that is on my list to write.

51:23.540 --> 51:25.220
It'll probably be next year at this point

51:25.220 --> 51:28.580
but this idea of evolution itself as an agent.

51:28.580 --> 51:30.740
I wanna be very careful here

51:30.740 --> 51:35.740
because a lot of people still have this kind of ancient view

51:36.340 --> 51:38.220
that there are two kinds of things in the world.

51:38.220 --> 51:40.580
There are dumb material things,

51:40.580 --> 51:45.580
like the machines that the quote unquote machines and so on.

51:46.620 --> 51:48.500
And then there are the mindful things

51:48.500 --> 51:51.860
like humans and angels and God and whatever else, right?

51:51.860 --> 51:55.500
And so when I say, actually I do think

51:55.500 --> 51:59.620
that there's a lens on evolution

51:59.620 --> 52:03.460
which does see it as an agent.

52:03.460 --> 52:06.540
What I'm not saying, okay, so super clear,

52:06.540 --> 52:11.540
not saying that evolution has a high level purpose

52:12.020 --> 52:14.340
the way that a human level purpose

52:14.340 --> 52:17.500
or a beyond human level purpose, not saying any of that.

52:17.500 --> 52:20.660
What I am saying is that there's a very rich spectrum

52:20.660 --> 52:22.820
of agency from very low.

52:22.820 --> 52:26.300
I'm not sure there's a zero, but certainly from very low

52:26.300 --> 52:28.580
all the way to human and beyond.

52:28.580 --> 52:31.180
And I don't think we can blindly assume

52:31.180 --> 52:34.260
that the level of agency for the evolutionary process

52:34.260 --> 52:36.380
is down at the low end.

52:36.380 --> 52:38.380
It might be non-zero

52:38.380 --> 52:41.900
and it might be important to understand what it is

52:41.900 --> 52:43.740
but just again, really clear,

52:43.740 --> 52:46.940
not saying that there's any human

52:46.940 --> 52:48.900
or above level intelligence out there

52:48.900 --> 52:52.740
picking where the lineages go.

52:54.060 --> 52:58.380
I think Carl first and probably said this

52:58.380 --> 53:02.980
well before me, this idea that you can use that framework

53:04.740 --> 53:07.340
to you can, so imagine,

53:07.340 --> 53:08.580
so it's kind of two ways to think about this.

53:08.580 --> 53:12.900
One way to think about this is that imagine a lineage,

53:12.900 --> 53:15.220
I don't know, 15 million years of alligators or something

53:15.220 --> 53:18.180
just imagine some kind of lineage.

53:19.180 --> 53:23.300
And you can imagine that whole thing as an agent.

53:23.300 --> 53:25.060
It's a very long lived agent

53:25.060 --> 53:28.100
but we're just bad at noticing agency

53:28.100 --> 53:29.500
at different time scales.

53:29.500 --> 53:31.500
It's a spatially a huge agent

53:31.500 --> 53:33.220
but we're also too fixated on agents

53:33.220 --> 53:36.620
that are roughly the size of us, medium sized objects.

53:36.620 --> 53:37.700
So if you forget that

53:37.700 --> 53:39.700
and assume that agents can be whatever,

53:40.740 --> 53:42.020
what is happening there?

53:42.020 --> 53:43.860
What's happening there is that continuously

53:43.860 --> 53:46.260
generates hypotheses about the environment.

53:46.260 --> 53:49.380
Those hypotheses are cashed out as offspring

53:49.380 --> 53:50.740
with different features.

53:50.740 --> 53:52.620
Some of those hypotheses are proven false.

53:52.620 --> 53:54.980
Some of those hypotheses are supported.

53:54.980 --> 53:57.660
Those supported hypotheses go on

53:57.660 --> 54:01.020
and shape the cognitive system of the collective

54:01.020 --> 54:03.980
to form new hypotheses that might be even better

54:03.980 --> 54:06.860
more correctly described, you know, reality.

54:06.860 --> 54:11.740
And what's interesting is that much like kind of

54:11.740 --> 54:13.700
consistent with what I said before,

54:13.700 --> 54:17.300
what these hypotheses are are not flat

54:17.300 --> 54:20.180
kind of first order statements about the world

54:20.180 --> 54:23.820
meaning a hardwired solution.

54:23.820 --> 54:25.860
And you know, it is what it is.

54:25.860 --> 54:28.180
They're actually, these hypotheses

54:28.180 --> 54:31.740
are actually problem solving strategies.

54:31.740 --> 54:32.980
They're heuristics.

54:32.980 --> 54:37.980
They're like what comes out of evolution is not,

54:38.820 --> 54:41.180
here's how you be a salamander and that's it.

54:41.180 --> 54:44.900
It's a set of policies that cellular collectives

54:44.900 --> 54:47.460
can operate depending on what's going on.

54:47.460 --> 54:48.900
They're context sensitive.

54:48.900 --> 54:53.020
So these, it's like instead of generating guesses

54:53.020 --> 54:57.420
about the world, what you're generating are policies.

54:57.420 --> 55:00.420
You're generating navigational heuristics, right?

55:00.420 --> 55:02.500
And so that's what that agent is doing.

55:02.500 --> 55:03.340
That's pretty good.

55:03.340 --> 55:05.540
That's not super low agency to be able to do that.

55:05.540 --> 55:06.380
That's something.

55:06.380 --> 55:08.100
That doesn't mean you have self-reflective,

55:08.100 --> 55:11.060
you know, I'd love to evolve some humans

55:11.060 --> 55:13.580
because that would be just like, that's not what I mean.

55:13.580 --> 55:16.380
But it isn't, you know, it's being able to generate

55:16.380 --> 55:20.340
hypotheses and get them falsified and have this like,

55:20.340 --> 55:22.780
so Carl, you know, Carl Friston has some great thoughts

55:22.780 --> 55:26.740
on this, Richard Watson has some great thoughts on this.

55:26.740 --> 55:30.580
But yeah, I mean, there's another way maybe to think

55:30.580 --> 55:32.300
about it, which is that the whole evolutionary,

55:32.300 --> 55:33.180
but never mind the lineage,

55:33.180 --> 55:35.820
but the whole evolutionary process itself,

55:35.820 --> 55:36.980
and that gets hard.

55:36.980 --> 55:38.500
I don't have too much to say about it right now,

55:38.500 --> 55:39.620
but I'm working on it.

55:39.620 --> 55:43.740
This notion of what actually can be an agent,

55:43.740 --> 55:45.740
you know, processes as agents.

55:45.780 --> 55:47.660
That's a whole other kind of kettle of fish.

55:47.660 --> 55:49.620
So I think, you know, well, next year,

55:49.620 --> 55:51.740
maybe if I get anywhere with it,

55:51.740 --> 55:53.340
maybe we talk about it next year.

55:53.340 --> 55:54.700
Yeah, yeah, that'd be interesting.

55:54.700 --> 55:59.700
I'm gonna definitely be on the lookout for that paper.

56:00.700 --> 56:02.620
And I think, yeah, you touched on so much, yeah,

56:02.620 --> 56:04.980
so much already about what's in this paper,

56:04.980 --> 56:08.140
the difference between first order and second order,

56:09.380 --> 56:13.060
say goals or say a certain amount of flexibility

56:13.060 --> 56:18.060
that is built in to the first initial levels there.

56:21.020 --> 56:25.460
What else, what do you think is, I guess,

56:25.460 --> 56:27.860
if you had to say for people to take one thing away

56:27.860 --> 56:29.940
from this paper, say a lay audience,

56:29.940 --> 56:33.940
what do you think would be something that,

56:35.220 --> 56:36.420
you know, this is hard.

56:36.420 --> 56:38.260
I wanna get to a little bit of this,

56:38.260 --> 56:40.180
I love your work, it's fantastic.

56:40.260 --> 56:42.900
But what I want to perhaps push

56:42.900 --> 56:44.980
for some of the people I interview a little bit more on

56:44.980 --> 56:47.460
is like, okay, this is amazing stuff.

56:47.460 --> 56:50.380
How does someone, you know, an individual person,

56:50.380 --> 56:52.100
is there stuff that we can take away here

56:52.100 --> 56:55.540
that are there like truths that, you know,

56:55.540 --> 56:57.420
maybe as part of our day-to-day lives

56:57.420 --> 57:02.340
that we can sort of integrate ideas like from this

57:02.340 --> 57:04.340
or anything from your own life, perhaps,

57:04.340 --> 57:07.580
examples of things that this is illuminated for yourself.

57:08.260 --> 57:10.580
Well, let's put it this way, you know,

57:10.580 --> 57:14.020
I don't know if anything from this paper

57:14.020 --> 57:17.380
will, you know, revolutionize day-to-day,

57:17.380 --> 57:20.420
like mundane life, but a lot of people,

57:20.420 --> 57:23.700
but I will, let's try to pull in that direction.

57:23.700 --> 57:27.380
A lot of people think about evolution

57:27.380 --> 57:30.620
and one of the things that always bugs them,

57:30.620 --> 57:35.060
and especially, you know, a lot of engineers too,

57:35.060 --> 57:40.060
is this standard story of, well, we make random changes

57:41.100 --> 57:43.340
and then we pick the good ones, right?

57:43.340 --> 57:46.140
I don't know about you, but when I first learned about this,

57:46.140 --> 57:49.140
I had been building, you know, electronics

57:49.140 --> 57:51.980
and things like that as a kid for some years,

57:51.980 --> 57:53.980
and then I learned this theory, you know,

57:53.980 --> 57:56.500
it sounded laughable, it sounded like,

57:56.500 --> 57:59.460
you're telling me that I'm gonna make random changes

57:59.460 --> 58:02.580
in this thing, I huff and puff for many hours

58:02.580 --> 58:04.460
and then the person who made these transistors

58:04.460 --> 58:06.540
and everything else will put in even more work than that,

58:06.540 --> 58:08.940
like we're all busting our butts on this stuff

58:08.940 --> 58:10.700
and you're gonna make random changes

58:10.700 --> 58:12.700
and you think eventually things will get better,

58:12.700 --> 58:14.980
like that's, you know, if you've ever built anything

58:14.980 --> 58:17.100
or written code, that sounds crazy,

58:17.100 --> 58:19.940
and then okay, you know, so you learn some things

58:19.940 --> 58:24.340
about modularity and evolvability and some things that,

58:24.340 --> 58:29.060
but a lot of people are still left with this idea

58:29.060 --> 58:32.100
that, okay, in theory it might work,

58:32.100 --> 58:34.980
but we kind of know that genetic algorithms,

58:34.980 --> 58:36.140
you know, they did great for a while,

58:36.140 --> 58:38.100
but they sort of peter out, there's some limit,

58:38.100 --> 58:41.100
you know, there's kind of limitations to what they can do,

58:41.100 --> 58:43.980
and in particular, but part of what makes it,

58:43.980 --> 58:48.220
what makes it a little challenging is what Andreas Wagner,

58:48.220 --> 58:51.620
which I think his work is amazing and important,

58:51.620 --> 58:54.420
what he calls the problem of the arrival of the fittest,

58:54.420 --> 58:59.420
which is that if the best solution is hiding somewhere

58:59.540 --> 59:02.820
in your population, I suppose I'll give you that,

59:02.820 --> 59:05.100
I'll give it to you that eventually we'll sort of find it

59:05.100 --> 59:08.300
and let it expand, but who guaranteed it was there

59:08.300 --> 59:09.140
in the first place?

59:09.140 --> 59:10.740
How do you know that the right solution

59:10.740 --> 59:11.820
is ever going to be there,

59:11.820 --> 59:13.220
depending on what your problems be?

59:13.220 --> 59:17.580
So anyway, so a lot of people are still left with this,

59:17.580 --> 59:20.460
you know, this dissatisfaction about how there's just,

59:20.460 --> 59:22.340
how do we know that there's been enough time

59:22.340 --> 59:24.740
for this kind of process to give us the amazing things

59:24.740 --> 59:26.260
we see in the biological world?

59:27.300 --> 59:28.580
And I'm not talking about that, I mean,

59:28.620 --> 59:31.020
so there are some people that will never buy the story

59:31.020 --> 59:33.180
because they are fundamentally like committed

59:33.180 --> 59:34.780
to another kind of story, I'm not talking about them,

59:34.780 --> 59:39.260
I'm talking about people with a scientific kind of worldview

59:39.260 --> 59:41.380
that want to understand in a naturalistic way

59:41.380 --> 59:46.260
what's going on, but the standard story doesn't seem

59:46.260 --> 59:48.260
like it's the whole story, right?

59:48.260 --> 59:50.460
And there's a lot of very smart people

59:50.460 --> 59:52.780
who are sort of thinking along those lines.

59:52.780 --> 59:56.060
So what I would point out, my kind of contribution

59:56.100 --> 59:59.420
to that is this, part of what makes,

59:59.420 --> 01:00:02.460
part of what makes that process so magical

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.260
is not just the process itself,

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:07.580
it's the fact that you're working on a material that's smart,

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.660
you're working with an agential material,

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.780
that's part of where the power comes from.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:15.060
If the whole thing seems tough to you,

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.900
add to your sort of mental picture,

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.740
the fact that it's not really searching

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:22.940
the incredibly difficult and large space

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:24.980
of all the possible things that could happen,

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:26.700
what it's searching is the space

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.340
of behavior-shaping signals

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.660
by which cells tell other cells what to do.

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:35.940
And that's a much easier space to search, right?

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:40.340
If you're dealing with, if you run that rat circus,

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:44.060
you could try to come up with a kind of

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:48.580
an optogenetic strategy to control every neuron

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:51.500
to get the rats to sort of do whatever they're gonna do,

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.660
that's really hard.

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:53.940
We'll be here till the sun burns out

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:56.900
before we can micromanage it.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.020
But you don't have to do that

01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.500
because you can train the rats.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.820
And that's a much easier, I mean, it's still a bit of search

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.060
because you still have to figure out, well, what's the reward,

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.180
what's the punishment, what are they capable of,

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:08.100
do they do place conditioning,

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.100
do they do associative learning, what do they...

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.900
So there's still some searching involved,

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:16.300
but it's a much easier problem than going bottom up.

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.820
And so this is what I want people to take away from this

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:21.540
is that part of what makes evolution so magical

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:24.980
is that it's working with an agential material

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:26.700
that has tons of competencies.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:31.700
It's evolution is playing with hardware

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.740
that is so far in capability.

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:36.820
And I don't mean the fact that it goes down to the nano level

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:39.340
and I don't mean that it's, in fact,

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:41.620
it's way noisier and more brittle and whatever

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.860
than all the things we try to build.

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:46.420
Despite all that, it is so much more powerful

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:47.820
than anything we've ever made

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:50.940
because it is not a single specific thing.

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:55.940
It's a learning machine, so to speak.

01:01:55.940 --> 01:02:00.460
And that puts evolution on steroids.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:04.660
That's what I think is a huge motivating factor.

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.380
And I think until we understand that,

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.580
we are not going to have, I mean, that's to me,

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.740
that's if I can dare to say this,

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:11.980
the thing that I think is missing

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:14.460
from the standard evolutionary synthesis is this.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:17.300
It's the appreciation of the intelligence of the substrate.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.900
It treats the standard story,

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.460
it treats the substrate as a bunch of dumb Lego blocks

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.620
and everything changes.

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:25.380
When the material has agendas, everything changes

01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.700
and evolution changes massively.

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.660
So, I don't know if that counts as everyday life

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:33.980
for people, I suppose that some people think

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:35.540
about that stuff every day, so.

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:36.700
No, no, it's good.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:39.300
I find it useful because it's a frame,

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:45.060
it's a perspective on how you look at the problem.

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.700
I mean, that's something we've talked about in round two.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:50.820
I think like polycomputing and the role of the absurd,

01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:52.700
the same thing can be computed.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.580
But depending on how you look at it, you actually get,

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.900
you actually are extracting that different value,

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.580
different utility from the same exact thing.

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.500
So, yeah, that's wonderful.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.380
And actually, I think this will,

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.300
just looking at the time a little bit here,

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:09.980
I do wanna cover a little bit

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:13.140
about the biology, Buddhism and AI paper.

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:16.980
I think it was Kair as a driver of...

01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:17.980
I forget exactly.

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:19.820
Yeah, Kair is a driver of intelligence,

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:22.740
but she worked on with a few collaborators,

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:26.100
Dr. Witkowski, Salmanova and Dwayne.

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:31.100
And this, I think actually does bleed into this fairly well

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:34.900
because in the Ingencial Point Materials paper,

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:37.300
you mentioned the idea of like beginner mind.

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:41.500
And you have a quote from Suzuki about the,

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.220
in the beginner's mind, there's many possibilities

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.380
and the expert's mind, there are a few.

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:49.900
So you kind of wanna have a frame of like always being,

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.660
having a frame of always being a beginner

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.880
and being like open and curious to things all the time

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:58.160
is a lot better than, this is a straw manning it,

01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.860
but it's a lot better than being an expert

01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:02.740
and being like, I know everything, I've mastered,

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:03.940
there's nothing else left to go, right?

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:08.260
There's always potential for more learning and more mastery.

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:12.380
So for the Biology, Buddhism and AI paper,

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.540
would you mind providing us again,

01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:16.620
just a brief overview of the overall paper

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:20.180
and also how you got interested in this topic

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:23.740
to begin with and how you got into this group

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.820
of folks who are studying this.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:30.460
Yeah, well, how I got interested in it,

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.220
I've been interested in these kinds of things

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:34.700
for a really long time, both from the perspective

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:38.260
of kind of Eastern thought about the philosophy of mind

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:41.460
and things like that and more broadly questions

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:46.460
of concern and compassion and things like that.

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:50.260
How we met up, to tell you the truth,

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:53.300
I don't remember who reached out first,

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.020
it might have been Thomas Doctor that emailed me,

01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.180
I mean, Olaf and I have known each other,

01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:02.540
he's a great contributor to the artificial life community

01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:05.980
and so I've known him and his work for a long time,

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:09.580
Bill and Eliza and Thomas I met afterwards.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.740
Yeah, I don't recall who made the first step,

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:15.100
but anyway, we've been talking about this stuff

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:16.180
and thinking about it for a long time

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.340
and there's actually a second paper

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:20.700
that just got accepted or we just returned it,

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:21.900
I don't remember exactly where it is,

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.380
but there's a second paper following up

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.380
on all of this stuff.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:28.620
You can find the preprint is on the website,

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:33.620
but this idea of specifically this idea of care

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:36.580
and what do agents care about?

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:40.820
And for me, it has lots of important implications

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:43.660
because I try to understand collective intelligences

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.740
and so if you're gonna have a collective intelligence,

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:48.220
what is it going to care about?

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:50.100
We don't have a good science of that.

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:55.100
And then there's the notion of embedding care

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:57.420
in artifacts that we make.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.780
So robotics, AIs, what are they gonna care about?

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:05.220
It's kind of a funny story when my kid was,

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:08.540
my youngest was, I wanna say he was three or four

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:11.740
and he said, we used to build stuff together all the time

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:14.260
and we did all kinds of engineering things

01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:18.060
and one day he said to me, let's make a cat.

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:19.580
And I said, well, like a robotic,

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:20.700
you wanna make a robotic cat.

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:22.620
And I said, well, let's make a list

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:24.020
of what are the design specs here?

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:25.740
Like what does this thing need to do?

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:28.660
And he says, well, it needs to move around.

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:31.260
I'm like, yeah, maybe like that, that may be doable

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:33.260
and it needs to make meowing noises

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:34.780
and it's pretty much doable.

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.900
And it needs to do something else that it needed to do.

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:38.540
And I said, yeah, probably we could do that.

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:40.900
And then he says, and it needs to care.

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:42.380
And I said, what do you mean?

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.180
You mean it needs to like walk over to you

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:46.580
and let you pet it?

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:49.220
He goes, no, no, not act as if it cared.

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:50.940
I wanted to actually care.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:51.900
And I was like, all right, well, that's it.

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:53.180
You've just broke the whole project

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:55.420
because we don't have a clue

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.940
as to how that is going to happen.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:59.940
And that is, you know, that,

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:04.940
figuring out how that ties into the whole,

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:08.500
you know, the cognitive light cone story

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:09.340
that I've been telling

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.620
and the kind of the spectrum of precipitability.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.820
It's like intelligence is one thing,

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:17.100
problem solving is one thing.

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:20.660
But where does the care come from, right?

01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:21.980
And what do we mean by that?

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:24.780
And a lot of people say things like,

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.540
I care about stuff.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.420
That's just the machine.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:29.940
They're usually pointing at some AI thing

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:31.580
or some robot or something.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:32.540
And they say, well, that's just the machine.

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:34.060
Machines can't care.

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:36.740
And I'm like, well, you used to be a single cell.

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:40.500
And do paramecia care?

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.020
Because now you got a problem.

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.260
If you say that the paramecia care,

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:47.620
then well, guess what's inside of paramecia?

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.540
A bunch of molecular cogs and wheels.

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:53.500
So, you know, you gotta,

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.380
so maybe machines and certainly molecular biologists

01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:58.340
see single cells as a kind of machine.

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:03.180
And that analogy has done pretty well for us.

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:05.140
On the other hand, if you say, no, no,

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.380
the paramecium doesn't care.

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.100
It's just a bunch of chemical reactions.

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:09.780
I mean, we can sort of see what's going on in there.

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:11.980
It's a bunch of chemistry that doesn't care.

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:12.820
I care.

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.260
Like, well, you used to be a single cell.

01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:15.460
So why don't you tell me where that,

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:16.660
when the care got beamed,

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:19.540
like what stage of embryogenesis

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:20.780
does the care get beamed down, right?

01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:21.940
That's a problem too.

01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:24.460
So you got this real issue with people

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:25.980
who think in binary categories,

01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:27.500
they get trapped in this pseudo problem

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.380
that I think I'm unsolvable.

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:34.660
So anyway, so we were really interested.

01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.500
And then of course, from their perspective,

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.780
they're interested in the questions of,

01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:43.900
there's a Buddhist story about care and compassion

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:44.740
and those kinds of things.

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:47.380
So I was interested to see how compatible those things are.

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:50.260
Can we use some tools from that thought?

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:52.100
I mean, there's a whole other thing,

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:57.100
which is this notion of the impermanence of the self.

01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.700
And it goes, I mean, there are obviously

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.540
all different kinds of opinions on this

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:04.900
all the way from there is no such thing.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:07.900
It's a total illusion, right?

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:09.380
That's one set of views.

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.180
And then on the other is the kind of like

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:14.220
the sort of demand on the street version,

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:17.460
which is, well, I've got this permanent to self

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:20.340
and it's this like thing and then it exists.

01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:22.180
And then what I'm interested in

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.260
is kind of the space in between,

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.820
which I think is more accurate.

01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:28.460
So, and by the way, I'm no Buddhist scholar.

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:33.180
I don't pretend to know who thinks what in that area.

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:36.700
I'm just, I'm trying to keep up with Thomas

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:38.940
and Elizabeth and so on.

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:42.540
But there's an intermediate version,

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:45.380
which is that it's not that you don't exist.

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:48.180
You do in the same sense as everything else exists,

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.180
which is as a useful metaphor.

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:54.060
And in fact, you are the most useful metaphor for all,

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:56.940
of all, because you might do away with,

01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:59.180
you might somehow do away with metaphors

01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:04.180
of talking about, I don't know what social structures are,

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:07.300
what grocery stores are.

01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:11.100
Maybe you don't, maybe you now see,

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:14.060
like Eddington said, that a table is mostly empty space.

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:16.020
And so maybe you've internalized physics enough

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:19.100
to know that even the table isn't a great metaphor

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:21.900
that it's mostly fields and whatnot.

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.740
Like all of that is fine,

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:28.740
but there is this metaphor of a self that can do things

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.980
because it's on you to do stuff or not do it.

01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.460
You have to make those decisions.

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:39.580
That's a pretty useful metaphor.

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:41.700
So I don't think it's not real.

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:43.300
I think it is real in the same sense

01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.260
that everything else is real,

01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.420
which is a useful construction.

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:50.300
Also, I think what's useful about it

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:53.780
is that it is continuously self-constructed.

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:56.220
And here's what I mean by that.

01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:59.000
At any given moment, so right now,

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.100
you don't really have access to your past.

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:04.220
The only thing you have access to are the engrams

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.580
left in your brain and body by your past experiences.

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:07.780
That's all you have access to.

01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:10.980
And from that, you reconstruct the story of your past.

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.900
So including the school you went to

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:13.740
and various other things,

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:16.320
you're building that right now at every moment.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.980
It's a little bit like anterior grade amnesia patients

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.100
who can't form new memories.

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:25.340
And so they use these scratch pads,

01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:26.940
at least some of them where you write down,

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:28.500
the first thing you write down is that

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.060
I have anterior grade amnesia

01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:31.700
and then some stuff that happened.

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:32.740
And then at the end, that says,

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:35.300
and don't forget, write this note again tomorrow.

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:39.140
And that's your, like most of us have the same thing.

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:40.540
It's just internalized,

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.580
but now they're using the Stigmergically,

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:45.140
this outside tool because there's some problem.

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:48.740
So we are all really in that state.

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:51.780
It's just we're using an internal scratch pad.

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:53.060
Right now, you don't have any access

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.820
to what happened years ago.

01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:57.420
You just have the memories and they're actively rebuilt.

01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:59.860
And we all know our ability to rebuild accurately

01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:01.900
is crap basically, right?

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:06.220
And these things morph and change and whatnot.

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:08.300
So the story of ourselves changes all the time.

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:13.300
I actually, I did a, I gave a talk the other day

01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:17.460
at this UCLA symposium and I talked about Plenaria

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:21.100
and this idea, in Plenaria, if you teach them something

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:22.860
and then you chop off their heads

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.100
and the tail sits there

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.820
and then eventually they regrow a new head

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:27.620
and they regenerate their memories, right?

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:30.060
And so that means, okay, the memory is stored somewhere

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:31.100
to who knows where it is,

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:34.140
but the interesting part of that is the memories

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:38.380
are actually imprinted onto the new brain as it develops.

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:40.700
And so this new being, this new Plenarian

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:43.260
has to rebuild itself along with its memories.

01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.300
I mean, I don't know how rich a Plenarian's memories really are

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:46.740
but whatever they are,

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:51.100
it has to like completely rebuild itself from these memories.

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.180
And that sounds all crazy and weird

01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:56.980
and it sounds like the cases of like,

01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:02.020
what's the, you know, Blade Runner and everything

01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:05.020
when you find out that, oh crap, my memories aren't really

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:08.140
my memories, I mean, as far as this Plenarian brain is concerned

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.300
it just got downloaded a bunch of false memories.

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.380
That brain was not part of any of the things

01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:14.580
that it remembers, they wasn't there, didn't exist.

01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:17.140
So it's kind of a bunch of false memories.

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:19.740
And so, and so it was like, wow, these Plenarians are crazy

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:21.620
and this thing with the androids is nuts.

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:26.460
And my point was, no, no, no, this is what we are 24 seven.

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:28.540
This is completely normal because all of us

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:31.380
are reconstructing ourselves at every moment.

01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:32.700
And I don't know how wide the moment is,

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:35.580
but I'm sure that neuroscientists will tell us

01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:39.580
you are reconstructing yourself from these past memories.

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:43.060
And so I think that's a deep kind of philosophical thing

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:48.060
because, you know, your self isn't some permanent

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:51.460
monadic structure that just kind of exists.

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.940
It's an active construction, it's a process,

01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:57.580
it's a constant information processing.

01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:00.820
Autopoiesis, you know, of the mind doesn't stop

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:03.940
during embryogenesis, it kind of keeps going, it has to.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:08.940
And it has these interesting implications.

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.980
If somebody, it will go going back to, you know,

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:17.980
I guess I'm now in the business of trying to normalize

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.940
a lot of things that people get freaked out about,

01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:21.740
but you know, imagine, right?

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:24.460
So if somebody finds out that, oh my God,

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.900
like all of these memories that I have now,

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:28.540
that wasn't me, that were downloaded,

01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:31.620
my body was just, you know, was it Boltzmann

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:34.100
or was it Humor, somebody had this puzzle,

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:36.660
like what happens if you're not,

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:38.980
if all your memories were just like,

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.140
you were created 10 seconds ago,

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:44.420
including your memories, right, or something like that.

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:45.660
If you think about it hard enough,

01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:48.900
given that that's normally our situation anyway,

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.860
my answer is, who cares?

01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:53.660
Great, like move on, you've got them now, go for it.

01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:56.140
Now you've got some great memories, like roll with it,

01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:58.380
because what else is it gonna be?

01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:00.700
Of course you were just constructed with your memories,

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:01.700
what else could it be?

01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:03.620
You are constantly constructing yourself

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.260
from the n-grams in your head,

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:08.300
you don't have access to what actually happened before.

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.540
You are, I just don't even, you know,

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.700
that view seems weird to people,

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:15.620
and I can't even verbalize what the alternative would be,

01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:19.220
I just don't even understand what an alternative story

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:20.500
could possibly be.

01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.860
So from that perspective,

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.700
you know, in fact, you can go further with this,

01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:30.340
the body that I have now,

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:33.580
given the turnover of cells and molecules in your body,

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:36.180
was this body actually around 30 years ago

01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:38.340
to do the things that I remember doing?

01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:40.060
It actually wasn't, we know it wasn't,

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:41.860
even though I've not been part of some weird memory

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:44.100
replacement experiment, you know, and I'm not an Android,

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:46.060
this body wasn't there, I know it wasn't,

01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:47.340
we know it wasn't there.

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:49.780
And yet I have these memories, so am I complaining?

01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:50.700
What would you complain about?

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:52.820
If somebody told you that, you know,

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:54.100
yeah, your body was just, you know,

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:55.660
you were killed in a record,

01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:57.020
or maybe your body never existed,

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:57.860
but we just made you,

01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:59.900
and like here are some great memories of a past life,

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:02.460
like bring it on, fantastic, you know,

01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:03.500
I hope they're good ones.

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.420
And because I don't know what the,

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:07.460
I don't even know what the alternative would be.

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:10.660
So I think, for that reason,

01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:13.220
I think all of these things are really,

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:14.460
really hopeful and positive.

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:16.500
You know, they just tell us that,

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.660
we shouldn't be afraid of these technologies,

01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:23.820
this is the amazing thing about being a self

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:24.940
in this universe,

01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:27.820
is you get to constantly construct yourself,

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:29.700
and by the way, guide what happens in the future,

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.900
what you do now determines the experiences

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:34.940
you're going to have, the reactions you're going to have,

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:37.940
which of course, you know, those kinds of disciplines

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:42.940
and traditions are all about that,

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.700
about consistent practice to train yourself to be better,

01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.580
to have, you know, to improve your cognitive,

01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:50.460
you know, apparatus and so on.

01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:53.060
And the commitment, this is the last thing,

01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:56.540
the bodhisattva vow, which is huge,

01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:59.020
it's this commitment, it's a meta goal,

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:02.220
it's the commitment to enlarge your cognitive apparatus

01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:03.420
to enable bigger goals,

01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:05.020
to enable you to pursue bigger goals

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.940
with more compassion facing outwards.

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:09.660
That I think is critical because I think,

01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:11.860
once you are a system with the ability

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.780
to make that commitment,

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.860
it's sort of like, it's an exponential rise after that,

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:19.820
right, it's like discovering the scientific process.

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:21.820
Before that, it was all sort of screwing around,

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:22.860
you know, trial and error,

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:23.860
but as soon as you figured out

01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:25.740
that there's a systematic thing that you,

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:28.980
I am going to literally work to get better at this

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:30.300
and to be able to have more,

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:33.220
increase my cognitive light cone of compassion,

01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:36.180
you can now sort of exponentially go up

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:37.420
because you understand what you're doing,

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:40.860
it's not just, you know, just a random walk.

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:44.180
Yeah, now I love what you've said before too

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.620
about how something to this degree

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.940
that you can't control your next thought,

01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:51.740
but you can't control your thoughts 10 years from now

01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.100
by what you do today, right,

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.180
and what you do every day,

01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:57.020
you can like influence the future.

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:00.660
One thing I really wanted to ask you about,

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:02.260
and it's not in this paper,

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:05.260
but I imagine other folks have worked on this,

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:10.620
the idea of what it's like to perceive,

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:13.460
let's say the self in a broader way.

01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:16.180
And like you mentioned with the Bodhisattva vow,

01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:17.460
and I think this is actually really nice

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:19.820
because it brings us full circle with our conversation

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:20.900
from our very first one,

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:22.980
which was around the cognitive light cones.

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:25.260
And in this paper, you do have a diagram

01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:28.420
where you've like overlaid what the,

01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:32.540
what someone with a wider sense of self,

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:34.780
say a one to help out the community

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:37.700
or something that's also one that takes the vow

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:41.180
to not achieve enlightenment until everyone else does, right?

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:45.580
It's like this leave no living being behind kind of idea, right?

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.660
But do we have any research or even discussions

01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:52.820
with say monks, people who engage

01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:56.740
in say like deep Buddhist meditative practices?

01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:59.860
Do they perceive themselves as like a part of a whole?

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:04.260
Like is their actual sensory experience different

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:07.940
than say a very enlightened person like myself

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:09.780
or like most folks?

01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:10.860
Like does that make any sense?

01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:13.820
Like how they perceive themselves in the world?

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:16.100
Yeah, I think that's a great question.

01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:19.180
I don't think I've got the expertise to answer that question.

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:21.220
I think you could talk to,

01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:23.740
you could have Thomas Doctor on, for example,

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:28.340
and he's a very kind of experienced scholar in that area.

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:32.380
And I think he would, you'd have a good time.

01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:33.860
You could explain all that stuff.

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.140
Yeah, yeah, I think I'll have to.

01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:40.060
And let's see.

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:40.780
And that's great.

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:43.580
So you gave me so much to chew on and so much for the audience too,

01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.980
I'm sure this idea that who you are today

01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:47.340
is not who you were 30 years ago,

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:50.780
just in a very literal materialistic sense.

01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:52.860
And that there's like just this illusion

01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:56.860
of a consistent, continuous kind of experience.

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.980
It's a really, it's a wonderful way to put it.

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:01.980
And if you wouldn't mind, I mean, I do,

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:05.820
I'll probably overlay the cognitive light cone

01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:10.540
with the Bodhisattva, the Bodhisattva vowel one.

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:12.220
How has this been, because this came out,

01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:13.780
this paper came out about a year ago,

01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:14.700
how has it been received?

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:16.740
Have you heard any response from the paper?

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:24.460
A little bit, a little bit.

01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:27.820
Yeah, I don't know.

01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:32.100
I don't track responses super, super carefully,

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.380
so I'm not sure.

01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:36.100
Haven't heard a ton, but I'm gonna guess,

01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:39.460
I'm gonna guess Thomas heard more on it.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:42.140
But I think that, I've certainly had interesting people

01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:43.380
reach out to me to talk about it,

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:46.340
which is pretty much one of the things

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:48.500
I hope for in writing these things.

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.300
So I've had lots of cool discussions.

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:51.500
I don't know more broadly.

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.900
I mean, I have no idea how, in any of these papers,

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:57.100
by the way, I have no clue if anybody reads them

01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:59.420
or who reads them or what happens after that.

01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:01.300
I don't know, yeah, yeah, well, I appreciate that.

01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:03.900
And certainly people contact me,

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:08.180
but it's very hard to know how these things

01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:09.980
are actually spreading or not spreading

01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:11.620
through the community.

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.260
Gotcha, and I'm gonna let you go in a moment.

01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:14.980
But before I do one last thing,

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:16.780
you're a big mid-journey fan.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:21.380
You oftentimes have, seems like you're also a fan

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:22.580
of surrealist arts.

01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:26.300
I've seen stuff from prompts that are,

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:29.500
like, do this in the style of the Codex Seraphoninus

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.860
or in the style of the Chironomous Bosch.

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:35.420
Do you know, like, what is it that draws you towards,

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:36.900
like, those kind of art styles?

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.900
I don't know.

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:45.460
I have had zero art training.

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:46.340
I kind of know what I like,

01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:47.740
but I don't know anything about art.

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:50.780
I can't draw on myself at all, like nothing.

01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:55.500
And yeah, and I mean, all I know is that

01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:59.260
I really like, I'm really interested

01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:00.860
in the space of the possible

01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:05.540
and much, much more so than the actual.

01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:10.540
And everything I look at art-wise

01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:15.540
is either photography of nature or photography thereof.

01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:18.180
I like nature, but other than that,

01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:21.820
yeah, I'm really into imagining

01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:25.220
what could be the latent space of possibilities.

01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:28.260
And I think, you know, mid-journey and systems like that

01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:30.620
are pretty cool in that respect.

01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:34.460
They let you explore this wacky latent space

01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:38.340
that it has of images of all different kinds.

01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:40.740
Yeah, that's just kind of generally,

01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:46.820
I think very much forward in terms of, like, what now,

01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:48.900
what next, what could we do next?

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:51.860
That's, you know, maybe that explains a lot

01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:56.060
of my kind of, you know, not getting worked up

01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:58.900
about whether the past is real or not or what.

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:00.700
It's mostly the forward-looking stuff.

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.260
I mean, like whatever in the past, but like now,

01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:03.260
what do we do now?

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:05.380
So that's more what I'm interested in.

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:10.060
And I like this kind of art that lets you,

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:12.460
yeah, imagine things that could be,

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:15.100
what are the possibilities moving forward?

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:18.260
Yeah, I share same love for that style as well,

01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.500
those styles.

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:22.500
And I just want to say thank you so much, Mike.

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:24.660
These three conversations have been wonderful.

01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:26.700
I appreciate your time, your energy.

01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:29.300
And where should people find out more about you?

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:30.820
I'll link in the description.

01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:31.660
Yeah.

01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:35.060
Well, everything is, there's an official website,

01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:38.980
the academic website is www.drmike11.org.

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:41.100
So one word, drmike11.org.

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:44.340
And that's got all the links to the papers, the software,

01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.940
the presentations, everything else.

01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:51.660
I've got a science Twitter presence at drmike11.

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.300
And I think in a couple of months,

01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.700
there will be a WordPress site.

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:57.100
So I've been working on a site kind of,

01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.460
yeah, I was sort of thinking sub-stack WordPress.

01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.620
I decided WordPress.

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:03.180
And so there's going to be a site

01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:05.900
that's kind of less the official academic stuff

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:07.820
and all kinds of writing that I want to do

01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:09.380
that doesn't really, you know,

01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:11.580
kind of tired of asking the question of,

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:14.500
you know, you write this thing and it's not really,

01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:17.060
it isn't a primary paper and it isn't really a review

01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:18.340
and it's kind of a perspective,

01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:19.500
but it's really interdisciplinary.

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:20.900
It's way too long for a journal.

01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:23.660
And I'm sort of just tired of this issue

01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:25.540
of finding a home for it, you know,

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:27.100
what they say, like, where are we going to put?

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:28.420
Like, okay, forget it.

01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:30.060
We'll just, it'll go there

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:31.940
and then anybody who's interested can read it.

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:32.900
And that'll be that.

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.700
So, yeah, so there'll be, that doesn't exist yet,

01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:38.980
but in the next couple of months, it should be up.

01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:39.900
Awesome, great.

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:41.500
Well, we will watch that space.

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:42.940
And I'll, when it comes live,

01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:45.100
I'll update all the other videos so that people can get there.

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:45.940
That's great, I appreciate it.

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:46.780
Thank you, thank you.

01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:47.620
Yeah, absolutely.

01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:48.460
Thank you, Mike.

01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:49.300
Thanks very much.

01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:50.140
Yeah, thanks for having me on.

01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:50.980
It was great, thanks.

01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:51.820
It was awesome.

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:52.660
Thank you so much.

01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:53.500
All right, all right.
