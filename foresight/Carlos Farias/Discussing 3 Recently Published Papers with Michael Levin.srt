1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
Mike, thanks for coming on.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,320
Yeah, good to see you again.

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,280
Thanks for having me.

4
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,200
Yeah, such a pleasure.

5
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,320
Absolutely.

6
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,120
I can't believe we're on round three of our conversations

7
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:08,960
here right now.

8
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,160
Time flies by.

9
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,000
And for people in the audience who haven't yet

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,640
caught our first two rounds, those

11
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,280
will be linked below in the description.

12
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,680
And around one, we covered the computational boundary

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,760
of the self paper, the cognitive light cone diagram

14
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,840
that folks will be familiar with, I'm sure.

15
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,960
And then around two, we covered observer-dependent computing,

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,640
your paper with Joshua Bungard on polycomputing,

17
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,160
and also the technological approach to mind everywhere.

18
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,640
Today, we're going to cover a couple of papers

19
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,120
that were recently published just in the last couple of months.

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,200
Your paper on bioelectric networks

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,280
being the cognitive glue for organisms,

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,280
and then Darwin's engential materials.

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,080
That'll be the second paper we cover.

24
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,360
And then finally, biology, Buddhism AI,

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,440
your paper with collaborators that I think

26
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,880
will be the third act of our conversations today.

27
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,280
So I'd love to get us kicked off first.

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,160
And those papers will be linked below in the description

29
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,880
as well for folks who want to dive into those.

30
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,880
They can be pretty technical, but I

31
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,840
recommend going through them and discovering them

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,360
for yourselves.

33
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,440
There's a lot of great diagrams in there as well

34
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,840
to help people kind of grok these concepts too.

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,560
So if we get started off on the bioelectric networks,

36
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,480
the cognitive glue enabling evolutionary scaling

37
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,520
from physiology to mind, your paper,

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,240
could you provide us with a brief high level summary

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,160
of the paper and what's covered here?

40
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,640
Yeah.

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,200
Well, I guess the first thing to do

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,400
is to talk about what cognitive glue is

43
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,640
and why such a thing is needed.

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,120
And I use that term just to kind of draw attention

45
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,000
to the following thing.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,520
We often people think about collective intelligences

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,840
as flocks of birds and colonies or termites or bees

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,160
or something like that.

49
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,520
And they contrast that sharply with themselves.

50
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,000
They say, well, I'm not a colony.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,040
I'm a unified individual with my own thoughts and goals

52
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
and all of that.

53
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,600
But actually, if you sort of look inside, what you find

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,240
is that, no, actually, you are a colony.

55
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,680
Like each of us is a collection of cells, neurons

56
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,280
and a whole bunch of other stuff.

57
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,160
And I want to emphasize this idea

58
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,560
that that is not to be taken for granted.

59
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,080
You cannot take for granted.

60
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,560
It's actually kind of a miracle, not in the sort of religious

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,600
sense, but in the scientific sense of something really

62
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,080
profound that needs understanding and explanation.

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,600
It's kind of a miracle that a collection of individual cells

64
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,320
with their own agendas and their own ability

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,800
to pursue various goals and physiological space

66
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,280
and gene expression space and so on,

67
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,560
that there is a way to arrange those things that

68
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,800
gives rise to this emergent new self that operates

69
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,040
in a different problem space and, in fact, will end up

70
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,600
often will end up denying the fact

71
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,720
that it is made up of parts with their own agendas.

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,160
I mean, that's kind of wild.

73
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,080
That's interesting.

74
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,640
Right?

75
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,560
And has its own goals where some of these goals are often

76
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,640
at odds with the goals of the parts.

77
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,360
And we often do things that aren't particularly good

78
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,960
for certain cells in the body and so on, right?

79
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,920
Or even certain organs.

80
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,680
So that's it right there.

81
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,320
That it's very clear that there must be a mechanism

82
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:37,160
for doing that, for transitioning from just a pile of cells

83
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,880
to something with its own self.

84
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,120
And we can sort of define, we can do a little bit of definition

85
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,080
there too, if you want.

86
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,440
But so that's the goal, right?

87
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,000
So now, even though people don't think about that very much,

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,560
like that, the reality is that, of course,

89
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,840
the whole field of neuroscience is predicated on the fact

90
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,800
that we know what the cognitive glue is

91
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,400
for behavior in the brain.

92
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,840
It's electrical signaling.

93
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,320
And let's say electrochemical signaling in the brain.

94
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,560
So that's the idea.

95
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,880
And my point in this paper and in some previous papers

96
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,000
is that there's a reason why electrical signaling is so

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,400
good at this in the brain.

98
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,600
It's because it's had lots of practice evolutionarily

99
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,520
where this all comes from is by serving as cognitive glue

100
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,560
for a morphogenetic agent, which is the thing that

101
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,000
arises when a bunch of individual cells in an embryonic

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,320
blastoderm suddenly start to cooperate

103
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,720
toward a very specific goal.

104
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,360
They're all going on a journey in this anatomical space

105
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,200
of possible configurations, of possible shapes

106
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,160
that anything can be.

107
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
They're all committed to helping each other

108
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
get to one particular region of that space that

109
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,440
corresponds to the target morphology of that species.

110
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,880
And so, yeah, so that's what this paper is about.

111
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,240
It's about how bioelectricity serves

112
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,480
as that kind of cognitive glue and then evolution kind of

113
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,360
pivoted it to do the same thing in three-dimensional space

114
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,240
for the control of behavior.

115
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,840
Awesome, yeah.

116
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
Thank you for that summary.

117
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,240
And I'd love to hear, I mean, one of the second questions

118
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,720
I had here was, how did you land on the term cognitive glue?

119
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,560
Like, were there any other terms of phrases

120
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,320
that you were kind of deciding between?

121
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,760
For that one, I mean, I don't know,

122
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,640
I use a lot of kind of these kind of terms

123
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,800
that I just sort of come up with.

124
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,400
But for that one, I'm not sure if there were any competitors.

125
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,640
I mean, you can think about some sort of binding policies.

126
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,680
You can call it some sort of an self-emergence mechanism.

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,280
I mean, you can come up with it.

128
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,360
But I just thought it was simpler to point out

129
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,280
that it literally is a kind of cognitive glue,

130
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,480
because without it, think about what

131
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,840
happens during general anesthesia, right?

132
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,600
So you walk into the doctor, and there you are.

133
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,920
And you have all kinds of thoughts and hopes about what

134
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,120
happens, and you say, boy, I hope the surgery goes well.

135
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,720
I've got a big thing.

136
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,120
I've got to do a month through now.

137
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,040
And then the gas comes in, and one of the things that happens

138
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,520
is the gap junctions between your cells get inhibited.

139
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,440
So now you're gone.

140
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,520
For the next however many hours, you're not there.

141
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,760
Your cells are still there.

142
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,360
All the pieces are still there.

143
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,240
Nobody's damaged.

144
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,880
Nobody's dead.

145
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,840
The cells are all functional, but you're gone.

146
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,960
And one reason you're gone is because that cognitive glue

147
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,760
has been temporarily dissolved.

148
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,080
It's the there really needs to be something

149
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,320
that binds all this together.

150
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,600
And glue, it's kind of silly, because it's not

151
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,880
that physical kind of thing.

152
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,880
But this idea that everybody has to be kept together

153
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,080
and the way that glue does in a particular space.

154
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,440
It's not just physical proximity.

155
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,960
The cells stay close to each other.

156
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,320
It's a kind of informational proximity.

157
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,720
And actually, people like Giulio Tononi and others

158
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,560
actually study this from an information study,

159
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,760
that integration from an informational perspective.

160
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,000
But that's really what's needed is a mechanism

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,600
to hold together the cognitive system that

162
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,280
is then going to make claims about itself

163
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,640
being a separate agent from the parts that make it up.

164
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,680
Yeah, it's interesting.

165
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,240
One very specific question I had in the paper.

166
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,080
And it may have been in there, but maybe I just potentially

167
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,580
missed it.

168
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,720
But there's a quote in there.

169
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,440
If you don't mind me just reading it off here.

170
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,160
It's developmental bioelectricity as a precursor

171
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,880
of brain-like processes, which reveals not only

172
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,200
evolutionary pivots between two different problem spaces,

173
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,560
but also shows a path to solving the problem of collective

174
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,560
intelligence across scales of organization.

175
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,000
What are the two different problem spaces?

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And perhaps it's just an example being made there.

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,880
But I think there's a mention here of evolutionary pivots.

178
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,680
Can you give the audience an example of what you mean by that?

179
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,080
Sure.

180
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,680
Well, so first, let's name some problem spaces here.

181
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,000
Just kind of roughly in order from the beginning of life.

182
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,840
So you've got the space of metabolism.

183
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,040
That's a problem space because you

184
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
have to figure out how to keep.

185
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,640
If you're going to persist in the real world,

186
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,000
you have to figure out how to operate metabolism.

187
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,600
And then there'll be some sort of physiological problem

188
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,440
space where, aside from metabolism,

189
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,840
you have other physiological features

190
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,960
that you're trying to outkeep.

191
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,160
And then at some point, you get a transcriptional space

192
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,800
where there's actually genes now that can be expressed.

193
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,760
And so that space, a very high-dimensional space

194
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,680
of the correct gene expression for whatever

195
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,480
you need to be doing at the moment.

196
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,960
And then when you get to multicellularity,

197
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,240
there's an anatomical morphospace.

198
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,400
How many eyes are you supposed to have?

199
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,520
Are you supposed to have eyes?

200
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,640
What's the where's the head go?

201
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,240
Where's the tail go?

202
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,960
Those kind of things.

203
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,960
So that's the space of that's an anatomical space.

204
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,560
And then after that, you get to behavioral space

205
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,480
because eventually you develop muscles and nerves.

206
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,680
And now you can actually move around in three-dimensional space.

207
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,560
And so now you can do what's classically known as behavior.

208
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,880
All these other things are behavior, too.

209
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,000
They're just behavior in weird spaces

210
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,720
that we don't normally think about.

211
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,600
And then maybe if you're some sort of human

212
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,960
or something else,

213
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,680
you might also operate in linguistic space.

214
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,120
So we actually have a project now looking at navigation

215
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,760
of linguistic space as exactly

216
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,880
that kind of navigational process.

217
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,720
Oh, interesting.

218
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,560
Yeah, yeah.

219
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,080
And maintaining this idea.

220
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,280
So there's one central concept to all of this,

221
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,360
which is navigation.

222
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,480
This idea that the space is rich,

223
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,440
it has structure.

224
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,720
You, as an agent, have various kinds of preferences

225
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,560
about which parts of that space are better for you

226
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,600
and which parts are worse.

227
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,160
And therefore you need to navigate it.

228
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,480
Now, you have different degrees of competency

229
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,320
of navigating it.

230
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,240
You might navigate it the way that a bowling ball

231
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,040
or a dandelion seed might,

232
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,600
which is you have very little internal control,

233
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,400
if any of what happens.

234
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Or you might be some sort of something in between.

235
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,840
You know, there's various seeds with little cork screws

236
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,400
and things that kind of help them

237
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,040
do various simple things.

238
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,680
You might be some kind of a, you know,

239
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,080
a simple homeostatic agent,

240
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
like a little thermostat that's actually better

241
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,320
than these other things.

242
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
Or you might actually be a learning system

243
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,680
that can have anticipation and associative learning

244
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,520
and things like that.

245
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,720
Or you might be really complex and you might have planning

246
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,040
and you might be able to really think forward pretty well.

247
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,240
And then you might be really complex

248
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,200
and have a gigantic cognitive light cone

249
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,600
where you can sort of imagine lots of complex things

250
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,040
far into the future way outside of your current scenario.

251
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,600
So anywhere along that continuum,

252
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,040
there's some, you might have some competencies, right?

253
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,720
And you navigate that, those spaces.

254
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,280
And so what I mean by evolutionary pivots

255
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,240
is simply that once you're good

256
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,280
at navigating one kind of space,

257
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,600
it's relatively, I think, this is all, you know,

258
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,800
this is all kind of the framework that I work on.

259
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,840
So lots of things we don't know yet,

260
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,280
but I think it's relatively easy for evolution

261
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,200
to switch spaces on you.

262
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,440
Because if you're good at navigating

263
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
a particular kind of space,

264
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,920
we can swap some sensors and some effectors

265
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,520
and you can use all the competencies you have

266
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,720
to navigate some other space.

267
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,360
So just for example,

268
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,840
hybrids, right?

269
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,320
Hybrids are when you take a brain

270
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,080
and you put it in a robotic body such as a vehicle.

271
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,560
And so in that case, the brain instead of leg muscles

272
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,760
might be connected to some wheels

273
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,320
and instead of eyes, it might have some photo arrays.

274
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,360
And if the brain is good at doing these things,

275
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,720
and so people have made these things

276
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,640
and they have various behaviors.

277
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,800
And it sounds kind of crazy and wild,

278
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,960
except that that is the normal scenario.

279
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,080
You see, your brain doesn't actually interface with reality.

280
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,640
Your brain interfaces with your eyes

281
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,240
and your muscles and various things.

282
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,440
And all of this is highly plastic.

283
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,440
When we've made tadpoles where the eye is on its tail

284
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,120
instead of in the head,

285
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,680
those animals can see perfectly well immediately.

286
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,160
They don't require new evolutionary adaptation,

287
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,680
periods of evolutionary adaptation,

288
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,520
they could just see in this new configuration.

289
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,200
And that's because, and the same reason why

290
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,800
sensory augmentation and sensory substitution.

291
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,160
So this has been known since at least the 70s,

292
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,440
probably before that, that you can do all kinds of,

293
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,720
you can give humans all kinds of weird sensors

294
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,360
and effectors and they very quickly become part of them.

295
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,560
So they become, for example,

296
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,680
Rocky Rita in the 70s used to do this thing

297
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,400
where it's like, you know that toy,

298
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,240
I don't know what it's called,

299
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,520
but it's like the square thing

300
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,120
with a bunch of metal nails

301
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,840
and you put your hand on it and it kind of makes the imprint.

302
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,240
So you can imagine an inverse of that

303
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,760
where the little pegs go and move in and out.

304
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,600
So you take that thing and you put each peg,

305
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,400
you connect each peg to a pixel on a camera

306
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,720
that you wear on top of your head.

307
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,560
And then you take that thing

308
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,800
and you put it up against your belly

309
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,160
so that it's poking you based on the pixel

310
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,800
that nail is poking you or not, right?

311
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,920
And so he did experiments with people who were blind

312
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,720
who learned to navigate that way

313
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,320
because you can remap the information

314
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,360
that you're getting through your skin

315
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,960
because the plasticity is incredible.

316
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,120
Look at the rubber hand illusion.

317
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,320
You can see these videos online

318
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,200
where you've had, as a tetrapod,

319
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,280
you've had, your brain has known

320
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,200
how many hands you have for how many millions of years now.

321
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,240
And within seven minutes of this visual input

322
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,960
of somebody stroking this rubber hand,

323
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,520
you've now decided that you have three hands.

324
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,600
You're perfectly willing to abandon that prior.

325
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,720
And when somebody hammers the rubber hand,

326
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,080
people jump up and scream.

327
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,880
And so the plasticity is incredible.

328
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,760
And that's why when people get prosthetics

329
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,720
where the wrist goes 360 degrees around,

330
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,160
when they reach for a cup,

331
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,440
they'll rotate the way that your normal wrist never rotates

332
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,840
because they get used to it, that's your body now.

333
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,640
And so all of these things, this kind of plasticity.

334
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,280
So that's why I think evolution fundamentally

335
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,200
makes these kinds of systems

336
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,240
that they kind of figure out what they are on the flies

337
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,400
or like Josh Bongard's robots from what, 2006 or so,

338
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,880
when he made these robots

339
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,080
that didn't have a predetermined model of what they were

340
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,400
and where the effectors were and where the sensors were.

341
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,920
And they sort of flopped around like babies,

342
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,360
they flopped around until eventually

343
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
they figured out how to move around

344
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,160
because they built a model of themselves

345
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
and what their structure was.

346
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,520
And that has the awesome side effect

347
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,080
that if you rip off one of the legs,

348
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,840
it'll just go through a similar process

349
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,960
and remap to the new and then move in a different way,

350
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,440
given what you have now.

351
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,520
This is exactly what we see in biology

352
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,400
where with a very wide range of various

353
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,680
accommodations to novel circumstances can be had

354
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,720
because evolution makes these problem-solving machines

355
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,800
that are very good at defining

356
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,960
and redefining themselves on the fly.

357
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,000
So that's what I mean, right?

358
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,680
These tricks that work well in one world,

359
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,520
swap some stuff around, swap a time scale,

360
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,120
swap the sensors, swap the effectors

361
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,320
and now you're walking around in some other kind of space.

362
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,040
I have a feeling that that's what's happening.

363
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,720
That's my guess.

364
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,560
That's wild.

365
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,640
I'd never heard about this, the 2006 Bongard.

366
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,760
Oh yeah, look it up, it's great.

367
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,960
I think it's very, it's really foundational, yeah.

368
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,200
I have to do some digging on that for sure.

369
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,120
Thank you for mentioning.

370
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,840
And there's, yeah, so many great,

371
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,480
wow, so much awesome stuff I wanna unpack there.

372
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,520
One of which, well, a few things that I think keep coming up,

373
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,880
sometimes like a phrase or an idea

374
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,280
that from our discussions

375
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
or from listening to you on other podcasts,

376
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,280
you know, you say all intelligence is collective intelligence.

377
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
So I think it's really great.

378
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,760
I think the emphasis, a lot of people need to hear that.

379
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,720
The other thing, and I think you just touched on it a bit,

380
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,480
is that, or maybe in our previous discussions you did too,

381
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,120
we, a lot of people think of the brain

382
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,480
as having this like exalted status

383
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,440
of that the brain can do all these things

384
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,480
that other parts of the body can't do.

385
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,560
But what's, and it's in this paper as well

386
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,120
and other papers too,

387
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,280
but sometimes there's memory stored outside the brain,

388
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,320
you know, in some of the research that you've done.

389
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,920
Can you give us a sense of what does the brain do

390
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,920
that's actually different than the body cells?

391
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,920
So, yeah, so what does it have

392
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,640
that say other parts of the body can't do?

393
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,560
Yeah, yeah.

394
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,120
So as much as I try to lean on the commonalities

395
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,320
between brain and other tissues,

396
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,600
I mean, it's pretty obvious.

397
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,920
There's a reason why we have brains.

398
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,280
Brains give us extra features

399
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,160
that we wouldn't have otherwise.

400
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,560
And so just to, you know, just, I mean,

401
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,880
the most obvious one is speed.

402
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,120
So neural bioelectricity is way faster

403
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,520
than developmental bioelectricity.

404
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,640
And I think that was part of an arms race

405
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,520
at the beginning when things started moving around

406
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,400
and trying to eat each other and avoid being eaten.

407
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,960
Speed became of the essence.

408
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,720
You know, I mean, developmental biology,

409
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,080
I mean, yes, you want to complete embryogenesis

410
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,920
as quickly as you can,

411
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,680
but it's not under the same speed constraint,

412
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,200
I think as actual behavior, you know,

413
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,720
three-dimensional behavior.

414
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,760
So there's speed in this idea.

415
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,080
Then there are the point connections.

416
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,160
So neurons can be incredibly long.

417
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,160
And so if you want to make a directed connection

418
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,360
from here over there,

419
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,520
without that neural architecture

420
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,600
of having an axon that reaches all the way down,

421
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,960
I mean, they can be meters long in some animals.

422
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,040
Without that, the basic bioelectric system is cumbersome

423
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,200
because it basically thinks spread as waves

424
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,800
or, you know, they propagate

425
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,120
through the gap junctional milieu.

426
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,320
It's not the same as, right?

427
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,960
So those are kind of the architectural things.

428
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,440
I mean, a lot of the components are conserved.

429
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,280
So ion channels, neurotransmitters, electrical synapses,

430
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,640
all that stuff is conserved,

431
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,440
but it's used in a different way,

432
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,880
both for speed and for direct connections, you know?

433
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,320
And then there's just, there are the things

434
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,840
that we know that are associated with brains

435
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,240
that we haven't found anywhere else.

436
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,200
So for just as a sort of high-end example is language, right?

437
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,920
So I've seen no credible claims

438
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,000
that the other organs in your body

439
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,560
are using this kind of syntactic language structures

440
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,840
that brains use.

441
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,120
Not saying it's impossible.

442
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
Who knows, we might find some kind of syntax,

443
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,320
but there isn't any evidence for that yet that I know of.

444
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,160
So that I think, you know,

445
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,920
but other basic stuff is the same,

446
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,720
you know, perceptual control and predictive coding

447
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,040
and all kinds of that happens in all cells.

448
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,440
I wanna come back real quick,

449
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,960
because I do think this is important

450
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,560
to something else that you said a minute ago

451
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,040
about the collective intelligence

452
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,480
and the fact that people need to hear that.

453
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,560
So I wanna just talk for a moment

454
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,120
about what it is that I think they need to hear about it.

455
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,600
Because some people, and I keep, I'm always fishing,

456
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,440
let's see if this helps at all,

457
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,560
but I'm always fishing for a better way to make this point.

458
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,560
And I don't know how effective this is.

459
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,520
Some people get really kind of destabilized

460
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,840
by these sorts of ideas,

461
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,840
because what they hear is, I'm not real, I'm an illusion.

462
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,400
And there are lots of scientists

463
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,200
that are pushing this narrative, right?

464
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,600
So we are to blame for this.

465
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,920
I'm not surprised that people have these ideas.

466
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,840
But, you know, this idea that, well, we don't exist.

467
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,160
You know, you're a big pile of cells

468
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,960
and you're not really here and it's all an illusion.

469
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,080
And that's a really destabilizing idea.

470
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,800
It's destabilizing on a personal level,

471
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,280
it contributes to the loss of meaning,

472
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,160
it contributes to societal issues.

473
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,680
And so I wanna just say what I think the lesson here is.

474
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,280
When you see science like this,

475
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,280
the lesson isn't that you are somehow devalued

476
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,640
from what you thought you were,

477
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,920
and that the meaning of your life is reduced,

478
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,640
and that your primary experience

479
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,200
of being a coherent being with choice,

480
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,200
with the responsibility of deciding what do you do next,

481
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,120
that these things are now out the windows somehow.

482
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,360
I think that's the wrong conclusion to draw from any of this.

483
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,160
The conclusion isn't that the majesty

484
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,280
of the integrated mind is reduced.

485
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,920
The right conclusion is, well, two things.

486
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,840
One is that actually we just learned an amazing thing

487
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
that matter can do.

488
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,000
We didn't know that before.

489
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,040
We thought dumb matter was just kind of dumb.

490
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,040
And what we're learning now,

491
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,520
we're not learning something that changes

492
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,360
how we view ourselves,

493
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,640
we're learning something that changes how we view matter.

494
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,200
And this is something that I think Ian McGilchrist says as well

495
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,040
that we've underestimated certain kinds of matter.

496
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,680
This idea that, no, actually,

497
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,200
and this is, I know I've used this example before,

498
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,040
but there's a scene in a lot of science fiction,

499
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,640
most recently I saw it in Ex Machina, right,

500
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,400
where the guy starts cutting his arm

501
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,880
because now he's worried that he's an android, right?

502
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,320
And I mean, yeah, a lot of people feel that way,

503
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,320
but if you cut your arm or you go get a CT scan

504
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,480
and they say, whoa, you know what?

505
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,280
You're full of cogs and gears.

506
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,120
The conclusion from that isn't,

507
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,440
oh man, well, I guess I'm not as real as I thought

508
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,280
and I'm not, you know,

509
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,040
I guess I don't get to use my free will now.

510
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,840
And that's not the answer.

511
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,440
The conclusion should be amazing.

512
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,360
Cogs and gears can give me my spiritual meaning like amazing.

513
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,760
I've just learned something about cogs and gears, great.

514
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,240
So that's, you know, I just want to be clear

515
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,520
that I think this kind of analysis of what it is

516
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,160
that we are, how we get here, you know,

517
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,400
the self-construction of the self from cells

518
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,200
during embryogenesis and all that,

519
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,600
that doesn't, it doesn't have any negative implications

520
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,200
for what you are and what you can do, just the opposite.

521
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,920
It sort of raises the remarkable magic

522
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,360
of these unbinding principles that you say, wild,

523
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,320
you can actually create a being that I know I am.

524
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,680
I mean, that's the part that I think Descartes

525
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,640
had had exactly right.

526
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,800
Apparently you can get there through this particular method.

527
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,560
And there was, I forget what it is,

528
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,800
but there was also another,

529
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,200
an old science fiction story where, you know,

530
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,560
these aliens kind of land on earth

531
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,160
and they find out that humans are basically made of meat.

532
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,560
And they say, that is the most disgusting,

533
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,400
like you're telling me a pile of meat

534
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,280
can have these exalted thoughts that we,

535
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,400
in our silicon, you know, implementations,

536
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,920
how like that's, there's no way.

537
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,200
There's no way a pile of carbonaceous agoo

538
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,000
is gonna have these kind of, you know, mathematical truths

539
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,200
that we perceive with our, with our silicon minds.

540
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,200
And right, and it's all completely arbitrary.

541
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,880
Somebody who doesn't want to find gears under their skin

542
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,680
and cogs and things like that.

543
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,520
Why not?

544
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,600
Because they've bought into the fact that proteins

545
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,600
and RNA does it, is that anymore?

546
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,520
You know, why are you any happier with that?

547
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,360
None of that, none of that is intrinsically

548
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,600
any better than anything else.

549
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,080
So I think it's very important not to get,

550
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,800
not to take the wrong message from all this kind of stuff

551
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,840
and to somehow dissolve your fundamental worth

552
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,280
just because we've seen some of the parts

553
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,240
that are under the hood.

554
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,200
We knew that we're gonna be parts under the hood.

555
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,280
In fact, I'll go one step further

556
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,280
and for the people who, right?

557
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,280
Because one thing that people sometimes say

558
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
at this point is, you're right,

559
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,080
you've just done a deconstruction of all materialism

560
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,320
and none of it matters unless we're a soul.

561
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,280
Yeah, so some people feel that way

562
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,480
that basically, right, the proteins,

563
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,880
just like the gears all know good.

564
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,400
So the thing with that is without even getting

565
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,480
into the kind of the factual nature

566
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,560
or just think purely logically, fine, fine,

567
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,400
maybe you're a soul.

568
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,560
What's the mechanism of the soul?

569
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,560
There's gonna be one.

570
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,480
It's gonna do something

571
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,680
and it's gonna have some kind of features.

572
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,080
If it doesn't have any, if it has no parts,

573
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,080
then it can't change, then you can't learn,

574
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,200
you can't make decisions, you can't improve,

575
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,040
you can't do anything.

576
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,680
It's gonna have some kind of structure.

577
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,040
Maybe it's, I'll give it to you

578
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,640
that maybe it's a completely different,

579
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,080
something material science has never seen before.

580
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,840
Great, but it's still gonna have some kind of descriptive

581
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,560
laws that govern how it acts in whatever space it lives in.

582
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,880
And then we're gonna be back to the same.

583
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,240
Somebody's gonna say,

584
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,840
but it's got rules that govern its behavior.

585
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,360
That's not what I mean,

586
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,800
but that's not enough to give me my magical feeling of stuff.

587
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,040
So we gotta get over this.

588
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,640
The non-material kind of way forward

589
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,200
doesn't help at all.

590
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,320
And we have to get over the fact

591
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,360
that finding mechanisms under this somehow

592
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,080
robs the larger scale of its meaning.

593
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,120
That's just, sorry, that's a long diatribe,

594
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,000
but that's what I wanted to say.

595
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,320
No, no, that's great.

596
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,080
That's spot on too.

597
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,560
It's funny, because I had on Bobby Azarian,

598
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,640
who's a cosmologist and wrote a great book

599
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,720
called Romance of Reality.

600
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,640
And he refers to this quite a bit,

601
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,200
more in the sort of the deterministic lack of free will,

602
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,280
but the similar kind of vein

603
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,560
that a lot of people feel like

604
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,520
as soon as you start to explain this stuff,

605
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,040
it's like you're explaining away the soul or the mystery

606
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,000
or what makes it interesting, right?

607
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,280
But at least it seems like to me

608
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,360
that it's just like a never-ending process.

609
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,760
Like there's always something to learn

610
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,000
and continue to be curious about.

611
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And it's funny, yeah, if you update your priors

612
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,360
and you're not stuck to, if you're open-minded enough

613
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,640
to all the different possibilities that are out there

614
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,240
and you get this new information,

615
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,800
yeah, you just keep, like you said, if you're a robot,

616
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,160
you just say, okay, well, that's interesting.

617
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah, that's interesting.

618
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,400
And you just update and you move on

619
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,320
and you've changed how you view the world.

620
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,160
Yeah, that's fine.

621
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
I'm the world's most amazing robot.

622
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,600
I thought I was a meaty robot.

623
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,000
Now I'm a metallic robot.

624
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,480
Great, who cares?

625
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,400
My list of things I was gonna do,

626
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,440
the amazing things I was gonna do,

627
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,240
still nothing's canceled, still right there.

628
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,520
I'm still gonna go do those things.

629
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,440
So that's what I wish,

630
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,200
I don't know how convincing any of this is to anybody,

631
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,760
but that's one thing that I really wish

632
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,400
people wouldn't internalize.

633
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,960
There's so much, both personal and social loss of,

634
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,560
loss of meaning, I think is the best way,

635
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,680
as Varvaki says, around all of this kind of stuff.

636
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,120
And that's the last thing I wanna contribute to.

637
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Yeah, I mean, that's a whole fascinating route

638
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,200
that I could go down to,

639
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,320
because I feel like, let's just say this,

640
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,880
like if that new information would lead you down

641
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,280
this kind of nihilistic path,

642
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,120
and I kind of feel like

643
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,280
you were probably gonna go down that path anyway.

644
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,520
Yeah, 100%.

645
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,920
Yeah, it's sort of,

646
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,960
you're using it as a reason to get stuck

647
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,440
in a really a vicious cycle potentially,

648
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,960
but yeah, that's really interesting.

649
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,440
But actually, I think this,

650
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,040
where I was gonna go to next anyway,

651
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,960
and it's in this paper and the next paper as well,

652
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,600
you had this concept called the play the hand your dealt.

653
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,400
And you, I mean, you're using this very,

654
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,800
how should I say it, materially,

655
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,160
you're talking about the cellular collectives

656
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,160
that can carry out different steps

657
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,760
with its sort of second order functions.

658
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,880
It's not, they're far more, let's say malleable,

659
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,880
and far more open-ended kind of strategies

660
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,560
for accomplishing their goals.

661
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,280
Can you talk to us about that and what that,

662
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,280
I think you, the acronym is PhD,

663
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,000
so play the hand your dealt.

664
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,240
Yeah, well, let's just start with a specific example.

665
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,120
So you take a salamander egg

666
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,480
and there's a certain tricks you can do

667
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,360
to increase the number of the chromosome count

668
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,680
within the number of copies of the genome

669
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,880
that are in there.

670
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,120
And so when you do that,

671
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,200
so let's say we increase instead of two N,

672
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,920
you can make four N, five N, six N and so on.

673
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,560
So as you do that, the cells,

674
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,200
the embryonic cells get bigger and bigger.

675
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,800
The salamander stays the same size.

676
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,520
If you take a cross section through a kidney tubule,

677
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,440
which normally is made of, I don't know if you can picture

678
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,520
this, but like six to eight cells that work together

679
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,280
to form this kind of like long tube,

680
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,400
they get bigger and bigger,

681
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,480
but the animal stays the same size

682
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,840
and the tubule stays the same size.

683
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,760
So what this means is that fewer and fewer

684
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,040
of these larger cells participate in each tubule, right?

685
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,000
And so far, so we have two amazing things so far.

686
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,520
Number one is you've got the wrong number of chromosomes,

687
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,040
fine, you're still a good salamander, amazing.

688
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,520
Number two, your cells are the wrong size, no problem.

689
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,360
We manage the cell number to make up

690
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,120
for this different in cell size.

691
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,080
You're still a good salamander.

692
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,920
Number three, if you make the cells absolutely gigantic,

693
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,000
and these are I think six or eight N,

694
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,320
I don't remember exactly, what happens is,

695
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,960
there's not room for even two cells to be there.

696
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,360
So what happens is one single cell wraps around itself

697
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,840
and leaves a hole in the middle

698
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,960
to give you that same tubule, okay?

699
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,520
Aside from the whole issue.

700
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,640
So what it is is it's using different molecular mechanisms.

701
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,880
In the first case, it was cell-to-cell communication.

702
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,120
In the next case, it's cytoskeletal bending.

703
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,640
You're using different molecular mechanisms

704
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,400
in the service of an anatomical large-scale goal.

705
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,840
That's a kind of top-down causation, super interesting,

706
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,360
but for our purpose, more importantly,

707
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,480
look at your job as a salamander.

708
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,760
You come into this world,

709
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,120
you can't tell how many chromosomes you're gonna have.

710
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,960
You don't know what your cell size is.

711
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,520
You don't know how many cells you're gonna have

712
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,400
because people have done that too.

713
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,440
You can take away cells, you can add cells.

714
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,400
You don't know any of that stuff.

715
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,000
You need to be able to, your goal

716
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,080
is to be able to make a good salamander

717
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,480
no matter what you start with.

718
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,000
So that's within limits, obviously.

719
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,760
I mean, all of these things are not infinitely stretchable.

720
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,480
So that's one example.

721
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,000
Here's another example, plenaria, flatworms.

722
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,080
The species that we work with

723
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,880
reproduces by tearing themselves in half and regenerating.

724
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,400
That's how they reproduce.

725
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,600
That means that they have somatic inheritance.

726
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,520
Any mutation that doesn't kill the stem cell

727
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,920
is gonna be proliferated into the body

728
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,440
and expanded in the body in the next generation.

729
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,640
So if you look at these worms, they're mix-a-ploid.

730
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,560
Every cell has a different number of chromosomes.

731
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,080
The genome is a total mess

732
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,960
because they just accumulate this stuff.

733
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,560
400 million years they've been accumulating all this junk.

734
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,880
And yet that's the species with perfect regeneration,

735
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,560
high cancer resistance, no aging in the asexual form.

736
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,840
Incredible, right?

737
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,400
And so the same story there is what you have to do

738
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,160
is you have to have an algorithm

739
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,360
that builds a correct plenarian

740
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,880
despite errors in the hardware.

741
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,200
And that's what I think.

742
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,760
So there's my play the hand-in-the-dilts concept

743
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,760
is that coming into this world as a new creature,

744
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,760
there's precious few things you can depend on for most.

745
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,080
I mean, there are hardwired things like C. elegans,

746
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,800
nematodes, and maybe some other species.

747
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,520
But I think, and there's all spectrum.

748
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,440
So I would sort of imagine that something like nematodes

749
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
where every nematode, every C. elegans

750
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,960
has exactly the same number of cells

751
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,200
and they all have the same lineage.

752
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,880
So that's a very cookie cutter organism and that's here.

753
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,600
Plenaria are super plastic and they're out there.

754
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,000
And salamanders are somewhere here

755
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,040
and humans are somewhere,

756
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,160
mammals are somewhere here.

757
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,800
We all have different degrees of that competency.

758
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,720
But that's the idea.

759
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,280
Most of us don't come into the world

760
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,200
being able to expect very specific things

761
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,560
and then just crashing and burning

762
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,280
when those assumptions aren't met.

763
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,560
This is why we can make tadpoles with eyes on their backs

764
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,880
that can see, and this is why slippers goat

765
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,880
when that two-legged, right, the goat that didn't have any form.

766
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,120
Shippers, goat, yeah, something like that.

767
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,280
Yeah, learn to walk upright.

768
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,480
And they found that a lot of the changes

769
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,000
that come along with bipedal locomotion were already made

770
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
because of the incredible plasticity of the organism.

771
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,400
And it's why skin cells taken off of frog embryos

772
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,440
becomes xenobots and why,

773
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,560
and instead of just like collapsing and dying

774
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,160
and all of these things, that's play the hand you're dealt.

775
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,240
That's the idea that we have to...

776
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,720
There may have been life at one point

777
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,440
that was much more cookie cutter, but none of that survived.

778
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,520
Nowadays, if you're gonna survive,

779
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,320
nowadays, you're the kind of life that is able to do this.

780
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,240
Right, and can you tell us about...

781
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,960
One thing I was thinking about too,

782
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,120
with the play the hand you're dealt,

783
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,960
sort of like whatever materials you have there,

784
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,480
that's what you're gonna use,

785
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,720
is, and with bioelectricity, of course,

786
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,960
like the electromagnetic spectrum,

787
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,680
that's sort of what's available to these cells, right?

788
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,760
And I'm thinking, and perhaps this is just

789
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,520
because it's at the limits of our science,

790
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,200
have you found either in your own research

791
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,120
or in research of your contemporaries,

792
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,600
like evidence of organisms making use of quantum fields?

793
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,960
Like are all the different fields that are available,

794
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,440
you know what, I mean, electricity,

795
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,400
I understand why bioelectricity is so great.

796
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,080
I mean, we use a lot of the same,

797
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,520
the ion, like the ion channels, like logic gates,

798
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,800
we use that stuff in our technology,

799
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,720
you know, similar kind of processes.

800
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,160
But anything in the quantum realm that you've seen?

801
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,840
So we don't study that specifically,

802
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,920
so I don't have any data about it.

803
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,480
There are certainly people that study quantum biology,

804
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,440
there's some great people who, you know,

805
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
Claree Ciello and my former postdoc,

806
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,560
Nerocia Morgan, they're into this kind of stuff.

807
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,760
And as our other people,

808
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,440
and I'm sure there are interesting things

809
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,400
that we don't particularly work on it.

810
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,080
My gut feeling is that,

811
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,920
not being an expert in this,

812
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,800
but just for whatever it's worth, my gut feeling,

813
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,520
it's gonna be the sort of thing that if it exists,

814
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,480
it's not gonna be some weird special adaptation where,

815
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,880
you know, all look birds are using, you know,

816
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,840
quantum spin to navigate the magnetic field

817
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,000
and that's it, it's not gonna be like that.

818
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,040
I think, I mean, that may also be,

819
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,400
but I don't mean that.

820
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,360
I think what we're gonna find is that it's everywhere,

821
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,640
like it's a basic fundamental, if it's there,

822
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,680
if quantum biology is there,

823
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,400
which I suspect it probably is,

824
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,280
it's gonna be used for everything.

825
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,320
We're gonna find out all the things

826
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,520
that we take for granted now that are just,

827
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,520
you know, we kind of assume

828
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,880
there's a classical explanation for it,

829
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,120
but we don't know what it is.

830
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,480
I have a feeling we're gonna find out a lot of this stuff

831
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,480
is at bottom, exploiting some of those properties.

832
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,160
That's just, that's totally a guess on my part.

833
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,960
I don't have any data to, you know, support any of that.

834
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,800
But that's my guess.

835
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,720
Yeah, yeah, that's interesting.

836
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,840
I would see, the very little I know about the quantum,

837
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,000
like quantum mechanics is that I would assume

838
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,160
these structures, even cellular structures,

839
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,440
they're tiny to us, but they're too large,

840
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,520
like, you know, it breaks down.

841
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,860
The quantum effects are just,

842
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,240
what happened to a way smaller lens,

843
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,040
but like you just pointed out,

844
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,360
like I think that there's some research

845
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,240
I've done a little bit of digging,

846
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,240
but I have to do more about quantum biology.

847
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,920
Yeah, look at, also look at the work of Chris Fields

848
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,040
and folks that he works with,

849
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,200
because there are aspects of what's important about that field

850
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,400
that has nothing to do with being small.

851
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,000
So there are really important aspects of, you know,

852
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,880
in terms of what's an observer and reference,

853
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,160
for observer reference frames,

854
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,720
and these kinds of things that apply across scales.

855
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,920
So Chris has some beautiful papers about that.

856
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,360
So it's not just for tiny particles and things like that.

857
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,440
That's good to know too.

858
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,040
And before we move into Darwin's and Gentryl materials,

859
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,760
I think it's still applicable here.

860
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,200
Can you tell us about, I think there was one podcast you did

861
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,280
where you talked about trophic memory in deer

862
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,440
and antler structures,

863
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,960
and actually the scientist that was studying it

864
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,680
actually sent them to you,

865
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,120
and you have a bunch of these.

866
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,680
Can you just tell us a little anecdote?

867
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,880
Yeah, well, okay, so first, what is trophic memory?

868
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,400
So there's certain species of deer that every year

869
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,160
they shed their antlers and then they grow them back.

870
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,640
Antlers are real bone, they're not like horns.

871
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,320
They're real bone with velvet and innovation and all that.

872
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,000
So there was this team, last named Bubenek,

873
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,680
and it was two folks, a father and son,

874
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,320
and they live in Canada.

875
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,120
And they did experiments for,

876
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,680
I'm gonna say well over 30 years,

877
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,320
maybe 40 years together, something like that,

878
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,920
where what they found is that if you see,

879
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,720
you got this deer and you take a knife

880
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,000
and you etch a little cut into somewhere

881
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,320
on this branch structure.

882
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,480
And that year, it kind of heals with a little callus,

883
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,040
the bone heals, and that's that.

884
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,200
And then the whole thing drops off.

885
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,840
And then next year, when they regrow their antlers,

886
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,040
it grows with an ectopic branch point at the location

887
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,640
where the damage was last year.

888
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,760
Now, I read this, and so they got these papers

889
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,560
from 60s and 70s and beyond.

890
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,520
It's an amazing data set.

891
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,200
No one's ever gonna get a data set like this.

892
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,800
I mean, who's got a herd of deer

893
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,360
that they can watch for 40 years?

894
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,560
It's a, in modern biology careers,

895
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,560
that's not exactly conducive to getting a good associate,

896
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,480
this is in a professor position.

897
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,720
But they've got this incredible data set.

898
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,120
And when I first read about this,

899
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,320
I thought it was amazing because if you try to think

900
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,320
about the current, what passes for an explanation

901
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,360
for a biological phenomenon nowadays?

902
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,400
So if you find this, you look at a typical cell paper,

903
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,960
figure seven is gonna be a molecular pathway, right?

904
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,760
So there's some arrow diagrams on this thing bind,

905
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,960
so that thing, and then they go over here

906
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,640
and they bind to this other thing.

907
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,320
Just try to come up with a model like that

908
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,760
for what's going on here.

909
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,800
So there's a large scale structure.

910
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,240
It gets a damage input at a particular location.

911
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,840
The whole thing falls off.

912
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,000
The cells at the scalp, which are tens of centimeters away,

913
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,480
remember the three-dimensional position

914
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,720
where the damage was last year.

915
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,600
And then when the bone cells start growing,

916
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,240
they revise the genetically encoded rules to say,

917
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,920
oh, by the way, when you get to this point,

918
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,800
make an extra thing to the right.

919
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,600
Like what possible explanation

920
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,800
using conventional conceptual tools that we have?

921
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,880
Could you come up with it?

922
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,240
It just completely fails.

923
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,400
And so this is one of the things I tell my students

924
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,320
is that your developmental biology textbook

925
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,680
is full of things that are readily explained

926
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,280
by the conceptual tools that we have now.

927
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,720
That's what's in the textbook, other success cases.

928
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,160
So what's fun is to look for the blank space in between.

929
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,840
What are all the things that are not in there, right?

930
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,680
And they're not in there

931
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,040
because we don't have a clue as to how it works.

932
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
So this is the kind of, I mean, I love that stuff.

933
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,560
So I'm always thinking about these kinds of things.

934
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,120
So anyway, so at one point,

935
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,320
so we wrote Daniel Lobo and I wrote a paper about this

936
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,360
and explaining like what the implications of that are

937
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,840
for the inverse problem,

938
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,200
which plagues regenerative medicine and so on.

939
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,080
And Bubenek emailed me and he said,

940
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,840
he said, you're one of the few people

941
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,960
that sites this stuff nowadays.

942
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,080
I need to like basically clean out the house, the garage.

943
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,440
Would you like these antlers?

944
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,760
And I was like, to hell yes, of course I would.

945
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,320
And that's such a unique, I mean, it's amazing work.

946
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,320
It's such a unique dataset.

947
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,840
And so we received in my lab 13, I think it was 13,

948
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,240
13 large boxes of these antlers.

949
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,240
And I sent them all to the veteran,

950
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,280
a Tufts Veterinary School.

951
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,600
They have a CAT scan machine where they CT scan horses

952
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,440
and things like that.

953
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,400
And so they CT scanned all of these things.

954
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,400
So I have somewhere, I've still got the antlers

955
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,640
during boxes in the closet.

956
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,080
I have a couple of them on the wall actually

957
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,320
in the lab as you walk into the lab.

958
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,400
There's a couple on the wall.

959
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,880
But yeah, but I still got these boxes.

960
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,720
And it was incredible because every set of antlers

961
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,240
is labeled with the name of the deer and the year.

962
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,720
So it'll be like, Lenny, 1987, Lenny, 1988.

963
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,440
And because you have to do these longitudinal,

964
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,040
like you have to know which deer it was.

965
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,000
And he kept meticulous records.

966
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,640
And so we have all of these antlers.

967
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,640
And it's a very unfortunate model system

968
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,200
because if you want to do experiments,

969
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,320
I mean, who's going to have deer and wait years

970
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,720
for an outcome like it's crazy.

971
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,880
But the closest thing to that actually

972
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,560
is our two-headed plenarium

973
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,800
because it's a very similar kind of thing.

974
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,920
It's a physiological stimulus

975
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,520
that gets somehow catalyzed

976
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,360
into multi-generational repair processes.

977
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,440
Because once you've make them two-headed,

978
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,400
you can keep cutting them.

979
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,560
They stay two-headed forever.

980
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,640
And luckily, plenarium are much more tractable than deer.

981
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,000
So I suspect those things are highly related,

982
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,920
but that's my deer antler story.

983
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,360
That's awesome. That's so cool.

984
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,520
That must be what a fixture to have in the lab, too.

985
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,040
It's right in the front as you walk in.

986
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,360
Great story, too.

987
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,280
Awesome. Thanks for sharing that.

988
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,680
So I'd love to turn towards,

989
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,800
and there's going to be a lot of overlap

990
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,200
between this paper and what we just discussed.

991
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,640
And I'm sure we'll talk more about bi-electricity as well.

992
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,400
But the second paper, Darwin's Ingencial Materials,

993
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,160
Evolutionary Implications of Multiscale Competency

994
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,920
and Developmental Biology.

995
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,840
And both of these papers, the first two,

996
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,080
they really just dropped in the last few months, right?

997
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,400
April 2023.

998
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,440
So these are hot off the presses for folks.

999
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,480
I don't really heard you talk about these in other podcasts.

1000
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,000
So it's great that we're getting a chance today to do that.

1001
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,240
And before we jump right into the paper,

1002
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
is this an illusion at all

1003
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,120
to the His Dark Materials book series?

1004
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,680
Like the title?

1005
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,800
No, not really.

1006
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,640
No.

1007
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,480
Okay, just wondering.

1008
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,920
I mean, that's a little bit of a flyer,

1009
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,600
because it's Darwin's Materials.

1010
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,880
I was like, is there sort of a...

1011
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,160
Yeah, it does sound like that, doesn't it?

1012
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,360
No, not really.

1013
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,720
Okay, cool. Yeah, just an aside.

1014
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,880
But would you mind, I mean, just like you did

1015
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,720
for the first paper,

1016
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,360
could you provide like a simple overview

1017
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,040
and then I have a bunch of questions to ask you about?

1018
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,880
Yeah.

1019
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,320
Let's start from this idea

1020
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,360
and I tried to formalize this in my tame paper

1021
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,280
from a few years ago.

1022
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,920
This idea of a spectrum of,

1023
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,000
you can call it many things,

1024
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,560
it's a spectrum of persuadability.

1025
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,840
That's what I call it in the paper, a spectrum of agency.

1026
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,640
Just the idea that you can put any system

1027
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,000
on this continuous spectrum

1028
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,560
that tries to capture how much autonomy the thing has

1029
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,160
from an engineering perspective.

1030
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,840
How much can I expect?

1031
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,280
How much problem-solving chops does this thing have?

1032
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,520
When I'm not around to force it.

1033
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,520
So, and you can go from Legos to thermostats,

1034
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,240
to animals that learn, to humans,

1035
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,480
and then everything in between is there, right?

1036
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,640
Okay, so now we can ask the following question.

1037
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,880
As an engineer,

1038
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,120
and so this is another paper I wrote with Jamie Davies

1039
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,080
a few years ago, maybe a year ago,

1040
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,000
talking about engineering with agential materials,

1041
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,680
because engineering is very different

1042
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,840
based on where along that spectrum your parts are.

1043
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,280
If you are engineering with Legos, everything is on you.

1044
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,880
The only thing the Lego's gonna do is keep its shape.

1045
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,960
That's all it knows how to do.

1046
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,120
So everything else is on you.

1047
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,160
Everything that you need to happen,

1048
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,920
you have to somehow make sure it happens.

1049
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,560
And this is how molecular synthetic biology works.

1050
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,040
You're gonna put in circuits that do specific things.

1051
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,840
It's on you to implement every part

1052
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,600
of the functionality that you want.

1053
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,680
If you, and so humans have been engineering with bricks

1054
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,080
and wood and metal for thousands of years,

1055
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,280
and use a certain set of techniques to do that.

1056
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,440
What are those techniques?

1057
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,360
Well, they don't involve psychological tools.

1058
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,120
They involve very kind of low level,

1059
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,520
put everything where it goes and glue it down

1060
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,040
and attach this thing to that thing.

1061
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,840
That's your toolbox.

1062
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,840
Well, if you're building autonomous vehicles

1063
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,960
or self-guided missiles or houses or whatever,

1064
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,280
you've got some other stuff,

1065
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,080
which are, for example, thermostats.

1066
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,560
So if you've got a thermostat, it's interesting

1067
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,120
because you don't even necessarily need to know

1068
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,280
how the whole thing works.

1069
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,920
What you need to know is where is the set point

1070
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,280
and how do I change it, right?

1071
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,640
And what are the inputs and what are the outputs?

1072
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,640
Where does the thermometer go?

1073
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,360
Where does the connection to the heating,

1074
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,040
to the cooling and heating go?

1075
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,000
And what you know is that it's gonna do certain things

1076
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,680
when you're out there to micromanage it.

1077
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,720
Do you have to leave rules for what to do

1078
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,880
at every single temperature level?

1079
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,720
You don't.

1080
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,680
It's gonna do that on its own.

1081
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,000
So you've got some other tools

1082
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,280
and these are the tools of cybernetics.

1083
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,160
So for more complex systems,

1084
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,440
you'll have control theory and all these kinds of tools

1085
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,120
to deal with something that has a simple level of agency.

1086
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,600
It's got very basic, kind of primitive goals

1087
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,240
that it tries to set, and if you don't understand

1088
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,880
anything about cybernetics,

1089
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,480
you are not going to get the most out of these components.

1090
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,840
If you don't understand what homeostasis is,

1091
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,400
what goal-directed loops are,

1092
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,560
you're not really gonna be very good

1093
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,800
at using those in your engineering.

1094
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,880
Okay.

1095
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,600
And then you move forward and you say,

1096
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:59,600
okay, I'm a proprietor of a circus,

1097
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,200
of a rat circus.

1098
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,080
And I want these rats to do little tricks, right?

1099
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,400
I want them to, and in the Jamie's paper,

1100
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,680
I think we talked about building a tower out of dogs.

1101
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,280
I could try the traditional route

1102
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,400
of stacking them on top of each other,

1103
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,360
but that isn't gonna work.

1104
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,960
They're gonna crawl off.

1105
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,560
They're not gonna just stay where I put them.

1106
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,200
So that doesn't work at all.

1107
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,000
I have to use a completely different set of tricks

1108
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,040
that people who work with wood and metal don't have to use.

1109
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,720
I have to train my material.

1110
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,640
I have to, now on the one hand,

1111
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,800
it's a bit of a pain in the butt

1112
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,160
because your material has its own agenda

1113
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,280
and you have to have tools to manage it.

1114
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,280
But here's the beauty of it.

1115
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,640
Once you've trained them to keep a little tower,

1116
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,680
if you knock it over, guess what it does?

1117
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,040
They get right back up on their own.

1118
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,880
You don't have to be there to rebuild it.

1119
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,800
Isn't that amazing?

1120
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,240
So you've gained something very interesting

1121
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,800
by switching the bag of tools you bring to the problem.

1122
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,120
You've gained something interesting

1123
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,200
and you were only able to do that

1124
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,520
because you recognized the agency of the material.

1125
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,920
You wouldn't do that, right?

1126
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,320
You wouldn't do that if you didn't know,

1127
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,920
if you thought that these things are dumb,

1128
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,080
like bricks and Legos.

1129
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,680
So it's very important.

1130
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,800
And then you see this all the way up.

1131
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,240
If you're a hacker, you might be hacking the computer,

1132
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,920
but you might be doing what they call social engineering.

1133
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,920
You might find out that it's much easier

1134
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,080
to just trick somebody giving you their password

1135
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,000
than to spend all day brute forcing the hashtag or whatever.

1136
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So there's this has to be this impedance match

1137
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,800
between the tools you bring to the problem.

1138
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,400
And the successful engineer is one that recognizes

1139
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,280
what's the right level of agency in my material.

1140
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,440
And so that leads to the question for regenerative medicine.

1141
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,840
We have cells and tissues and you ask,

1142
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,040
so what are the tools that I'm gonna use there?

1143
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,040
And the assumption up until now,

1144
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,760
the assumption has been, well, they're like the bricks.

1145
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,920
You have to micromanage all of it.

1146
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,920
Yeah, that's been the standard assumption of the paradigm.

1147
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,840
And but it's very much an open question.

1148
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,800
Are they more like the Legos

1149
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,040
or are they more like the rats

1150
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,840
or are they more like something in between?

1151
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,920
Or are they more like the thermostat or where are they?

1152
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,600
And regenerative medicine is gonna be cracked

1153
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,100
by the people who pick the right level.

1154
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,220
It's not gonna be cracked by assuming the wrong level

1155
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,020
nor down, so it's not gonna happen

1156
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:22,300
if you assume these things are low agency machines.

1157
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,780
It's also not going to happen if you assume

1158
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,540
that they're magical, inexplicable things

1159
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,480
that aren't gonna obey any kind of rational rules.

1160
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,460
That's not gonna work either somewhere in the middle,

1161
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,020
which is what of course what my lab tries to do

1162
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,780
is to pick the right set of tools from cybernetics,

1163
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,980
from behavioral science to take advantage.

1164
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,500
So having said all of that, here's the thing with the paper.

1165
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,460
So what I just took you through

1166
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,540
is how human engineers view the spectrum

1167
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,980
of agential materials, right?

1168
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,100
And so now it comes time to, so we wrote,

1169
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,980
so Jamie and I wrote that, and then I said, okay,

1170
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,020
so now what does evolution do?

1171
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,580
Evolution is also an engineer.

1172
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:06,580
So the question is, does evolution assume

1173
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,540
and work at the, assume that these things are like Legos

1174
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,980
and work at the lowest level,

1175
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,780
which means search the really difficult

1176
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:17,780
and really kind of rugged space of molecular properties

1177
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,780
or would evolution take advantage

1178
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,820
of the competency of the material?

1179
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,660
Because the thing about evolution is evolution

1180
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,620
doesn't work with Legos, evolution works with cells

1181
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,700
and cells and tissues used to be independent organisms.

1182
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,580
They don't come as blank slates that are dumb

1183
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,220
and have to be micromanaged.

1184
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,580
They come with behavioral competencies,

1185
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:41,100
with preferences, with various kinds of agendas.

1186
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,060
And so what that paper is, is an exploration of,

1187
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,460
if we take that seriously, the fact that evolution,

1188
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,220
of course, evolution is very opportunistic,

1189
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,020
it makes use of everything it can, we know that.

1190
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:55,900
What can we conclude if we take seriously the idea

1191
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,660
that evolution will not have missed the fact

1192
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,140
that it's dealing with a very powerful

1193
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,420
agential material that these cells

1194
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,740
already know how to do things?

1195
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,780
And so what I do in that paper is run down

1196
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,500
all of the implications.

1197
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,820
What does it mean for evolution

1198
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,180
that it isn't working with Legos, it's working?

1199
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,620
Of course, people have used evolutionary computation,

1200
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,620
like genetic algorithms and things like that

1201
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,380
with materials that really are dumb.

1202
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,060
So the typical evolutionary algorithm

1203
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:25,060
is done over passive data and it shows you improvements

1204
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,420
but the material is very passive

1205
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,740
and here I'm saying biological evolution isn't like that.

1206
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,620
So what does that mean?

1207
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,140
What will that do to evolution?

1208
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,540
And that's kind of the flip side, right?

1209
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,620
A lot of people study how intelligence,

1210
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,700
how evolution gives rise to intelligence

1211
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,460
of different types, I sort of reverse that

1212
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,980
and of course both are happening simultaneously

1213
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,420
but I looked at the other side of things

1214
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,620
which is how does intelligence impact

1215
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,740
the actual evolution, the intelligence of the substrate?

1216
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,220
Sure, that's interesting, still thought provoking.

1217
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:58,540
The, can I tell you something,

1218
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,620
an impulse I had while reading the paper

1219
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,420
even though it's not stated explicitly

1220
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,660
and even something you just said.

1221
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,900
Would you, how do you view even the evolutionary process?

1222
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,460
I mean, it almost sounds like evolution is an agent

1223
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,020
in and of itself.

1224
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,660
Do you view it that way or how do you look at it?

1225
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,020
Yeah, this is an interesting point.

1226
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:23,020
That's a paper that is on my list to write.

1227
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,220
It'll probably be next year at this point

1228
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,580
but this idea of evolution itself as an agent.

1229
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,740
I wanna be very careful here

1230
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:35,740
because a lot of people still have this kind of ancient view

1231
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,220
that there are two kinds of things in the world.

1232
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,580
There are dumb material things,

1233
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:45,580
like the machines that the quote unquote machines and so on.

1234
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,500
And then there are the mindful things

1235
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,860
like humans and angels and God and whatever else, right?

1236
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:55,500
And so when I say, actually I do think

1237
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:59,620
that there's a lens on evolution

1238
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,460
which does see it as an agent.

1239
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,540
What I'm not saying, okay, so super clear,

1240
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:11,540
not saying that evolution has a high level purpose

1241
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,340
the way that a human level purpose

1242
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,500
or a beyond human level purpose, not saying any of that.

1243
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,660
What I am saying is that there's a very rich spectrum

1244
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,820
of agency from very low.

1245
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:26,300
I'm not sure there's a zero, but certainly from very low

1246
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,580
all the way to human and beyond.

1247
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,180
And I don't think we can blindly assume

1248
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,260
that the level of agency for the evolutionary process

1249
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,380
is down at the low end.

1250
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,380
It might be non-zero

1251
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:41,900
and it might be important to understand what it is

1252
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,740
but just again, really clear,

1253
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,940
not saying that there's any human

1254
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,900
or above level intelligence out there

1255
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,740
picking where the lineages go.

1256
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:58,380
I think Carl first and probably said this

1257
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:02,980
well before me, this idea that you can use that framework

1258
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:07,340
to you can, so imagine,

1259
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,580
so it's kind of two ways to think about this.

1260
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:12,900
One way to think about this is that imagine a lineage,

1261
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,220
I don't know, 15 million years of alligators or something

1262
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:18,180
just imagine some kind of lineage.

1263
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:23,300
And you can imagine that whole thing as an agent.

1264
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,060
It's a very long lived agent

1265
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:28,100
but we're just bad at noticing agency

1266
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,500
at different time scales.

1267
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,500
It's a spatially a huge agent

1268
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,220
but we're also too fixated on agents

1269
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:36,620
that are roughly the size of us, medium sized objects.

1270
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,700
So if you forget that

1271
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,700
and assume that agents can be whatever,

1272
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,020
what is happening there?

1273
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,860
What's happening there is that continuously

1274
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,260
generates hypotheses about the environment.

1275
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,380
Those hypotheses are cashed out as offspring

1276
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,740
with different features.

1277
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,620
Some of those hypotheses are proven false.

1278
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,980
Some of those hypotheses are supported.

1279
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,660
Those supported hypotheses go on

1280
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,020
and shape the cognitive system of the collective

1281
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,980
to form new hypotheses that might be even better

1282
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,860
more correctly described, you know, reality.

1283
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:11,740
And what's interesting is that much like kind of

1284
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,700
consistent with what I said before,

1285
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,300
what these hypotheses are are not flat

1286
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,180
kind of first order statements about the world

1287
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,820
meaning a hardwired solution.

1288
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,860
And you know, it is what it is.

1289
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,180
They're actually, these hypotheses

1290
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:31,740
are actually problem solving strategies.

1291
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,980
They're heuristics.

1292
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:37,980
They're like what comes out of evolution is not,

1293
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:41,180
here's how you be a salamander and that's it.

1294
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:44,900
It's a set of policies that cellular collectives

1295
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,460
can operate depending on what's going on.

1296
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,900
They're context sensitive.

1297
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:53,020
So these, it's like instead of generating guesses

1298
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,420
about the world, what you're generating are policies.

1299
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,420
You're generating navigational heuristics, right?

1300
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,500
And so that's what that agent is doing.

1301
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,340
That's pretty good.

1302
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,540
That's not super low agency to be able to do that.

1303
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,380
That's something.

1304
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,100
That doesn't mean you have self-reflective,

1305
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:11,060
you know, I'd love to evolve some humans

1306
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,580
because that would be just like, that's not what I mean.

1307
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:16,380
But it isn't, you know, it's being able to generate

1308
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:20,340
hypotheses and get them falsified and have this like,

1309
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,780
so Carl, you know, Carl Friston has some great thoughts

1310
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,740
on this, Richard Watson has some great thoughts on this.

1311
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,580
But yeah, I mean, there's another way maybe to think

1312
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,300
about it, which is that the whole evolutionary,

1313
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,180
but never mind the lineage,

1314
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,820
but the whole evolutionary process itself,

1315
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,980
and that gets hard.

1316
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,500
I don't have too much to say about it right now,

1317
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,620
but I'm working on it.

1318
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:43,740
This notion of what actually can be an agent,

1319
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,740
you know, processes as agents.

1320
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,660
That's a whole other kind of kettle of fish.

1321
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,620
So I think, you know, well, next year,

1322
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,740
maybe if I get anywhere with it,

1323
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,340
maybe we talk about it next year.

1324
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,700
Yeah, yeah, that'd be interesting.

1325
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:59,700
I'm gonna definitely be on the lookout for that paper.

1326
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,620
And I think, yeah, you touched on so much, yeah,

1327
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,980
so much already about what's in this paper,

1328
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,140
the difference between first order and second order,

1329
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:13,060
say goals or say a certain amount of flexibility

1330
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:18,060
that is built in to the first initial levels there.

1331
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:25,460
What else, what do you think is, I guess,

1332
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,860
if you had to say for people to take one thing away

1333
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,940
from this paper, say a lay audience,

1334
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:33,940
what do you think would be something that,

1335
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,420
you know, this is hard.

1336
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,260
I wanna get to a little bit of this,

1337
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,180
I love your work, it's fantastic.

1338
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,900
But what I want to perhaps push

1339
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,980
for some of the people I interview a little bit more on

1340
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,460
is like, okay, this is amazing stuff.

1341
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,380
How does someone, you know, an individual person,

1342
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,100
is there stuff that we can take away here

1343
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,540
that are there like truths that, you know,

1344
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,420
maybe as part of our day-to-day lives

1345
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:02,340
that we can sort of integrate ideas like from this

1346
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,340
or anything from your own life, perhaps,

1347
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:07,580
examples of things that this is illuminated for yourself.

1348
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,580
Well, let's put it this way, you know,

1349
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:14,020
I don't know if anything from this paper

1350
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:17,380
will, you know, revolutionize day-to-day,

1351
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,420
like mundane life, but a lot of people,

1352
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:23,700
but I will, let's try to pull in that direction.

1353
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,380
A lot of people think about evolution

1354
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,620
and one of the things that always bugs them,

1355
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:35,060
and especially, you know, a lot of engineers too,

1356
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:40,060
is this standard story of, well, we make random changes

1357
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,340
and then we pick the good ones, right?

1358
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:46,140
I don't know about you, but when I first learned about this,

1359
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:49,140
I had been building, you know, electronics

1360
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,980
and things like that as a kid for some years,

1361
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,980
and then I learned this theory, you know,

1362
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,500
it sounded laughable, it sounded like,

1363
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,460
you're telling me that I'm gonna make random changes

1364
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,580
in this thing, I huff and puff for many hours

1365
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,460
and then the person who made these transistors

1366
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,540
and everything else will put in even more work than that,

1367
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,940
like we're all busting our butts on this stuff

1368
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,700
and you're gonna make random changes

1369
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,700
and you think eventually things will get better,

1370
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,980
like that's, you know, if you've ever built anything

1371
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,100
or written code, that sounds crazy,

1372
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,940
and then okay, you know, so you learn some things

1373
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:24,340
about modularity and evolvability and some things that,

1374
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:29,060
but a lot of people are still left with this idea

1375
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,100
that, okay, in theory it might work,

1376
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,980
but we kind of know that genetic algorithms,

1377
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,140
you know, they did great for a while,

1378
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,100
but they sort of peter out, there's some limit,

1379
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,100
you know, there's kind of limitations to what they can do,

1380
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,980
and in particular, but part of what makes it,

1381
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:48,220
what makes it a little challenging is what Andreas Wagner,

1382
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,620
which I think his work is amazing and important,

1383
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,420
what he calls the problem of the arrival of the fittest,

1384
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:59,420
which is that if the best solution is hiding somewhere

1385
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,820
in your population, I suppose I'll give you that,

1386
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,100
I'll give it to you that eventually we'll sort of find it

1387
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,300
and let it expand, but who guaranteed it was there

1388
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,140
in the first place?

1389
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,740
How do you know that the right solution

1390
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:11,820
is ever going to be there,

1391
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,220
depending on what your problems be?

1392
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:17,580
So anyway, so a lot of people are still left with this,

1393
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,460
you know, this dissatisfaction about how there's just,

1394
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,340
how do we know that there's been enough time

1395
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,740
for this kind of process to give us the amazing things

1396
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,260
we see in the biological world?

1397
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:28,580
And I'm not talking about that, I mean,

1398
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:31,020
so there are some people that will never buy the story

1399
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,180
because they are fundamentally like committed

1400
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,780
to another kind of story, I'm not talking about them,

1401
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:39,260
I'm talking about people with a scientific kind of worldview

1402
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:41,380
that want to understand in a naturalistic way

1403
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:46,260
what's going on, but the standard story doesn't seem

1404
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,260
like it's the whole story, right?

1405
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,460
And there's a lot of very smart people

1406
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,780
who are sort of thinking along those lines.

1407
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:56,060
So what I would point out, my kind of contribution

1408
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,420
to that is this, part of what makes,

1409
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:02,460
part of what makes that process so magical

1410
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,260
is not just the process itself,

1411
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:07,580
it's the fact that you're working on a material that's smart,

1412
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,660
you're working with an agential material,

1413
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,780
that's part of where the power comes from.

1414
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:15,060
If the whole thing seems tough to you,

1415
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,900
add to your sort of mental picture,

1416
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,740
the fact that it's not really searching

1417
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,940
the incredibly difficult and large space

1418
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,980
of all the possible things that could happen,

1419
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,700
what it's searching is the space

1420
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,340
of behavior-shaping signals

1421
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:32,660
by which cells tell other cells what to do.

1422
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,940
And that's a much easier space to search, right?

1423
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:40,340
If you're dealing with, if you run that rat circus,

1424
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:44,060
you could try to come up with a kind of

1425
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:48,580
an optogenetic strategy to control every neuron

1426
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:51,500
to get the rats to sort of do whatever they're gonna do,

1427
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,660
that's really hard.

1428
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,940
We'll be here till the sun burns out

1429
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:56,900
before we can micromanage it.

1430
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,020
But you don't have to do that

1431
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,500
because you can train the rats.

1432
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,820
And that's a much easier, I mean, it's still a bit of search

1433
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,060
because you still have to figure out, well, what's the reward,

1434
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,180
what's the punishment, what are they capable of,

1435
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,100
do they do place conditioning,

1436
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,100
do they do associative learning, what do they...

1437
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,900
So there's still some searching involved,

1438
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:16,300
but it's a much easier problem than going bottom up.

1439
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,820
And so this is what I want people to take away from this

1440
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:21,540
is that part of what makes evolution so magical

1441
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:24,980
is that it's working with an agential material

1442
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,700
that has tons of competencies.

1443
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:31,700
It's evolution is playing with hardware

1444
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,740
that is so far in capability.

1445
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,820
And I don't mean the fact that it goes down to the nano level

1446
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,340
and I don't mean that it's, in fact,

1447
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,620
it's way noisier and more brittle and whatever

1448
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,860
than all the things we try to build.

1449
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:46,420
Despite all that, it is so much more powerful

1450
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:47,820
than anything we've ever made

1451
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:50,940
because it is not a single specific thing.

1452
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:55,940
It's a learning machine, so to speak.

1453
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:00,460
And that puts evolution on steroids.

1454
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:04,660
That's what I think is a huge motivating factor.

1455
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,380
And I think until we understand that,

1456
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,580
we are not going to have, I mean, that's to me,

1457
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,740
that's if I can dare to say this,

1458
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:11,980
the thing that I think is missing

1459
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,460
from the standard evolutionary synthesis is this.

1460
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:17,300
It's the appreciation of the intelligence of the substrate.

1461
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,900
It treats the standard story,

1462
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,460
it treats the substrate as a bunch of dumb Lego blocks

1463
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:22,620
and everything changes.

1464
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:25,380
When the material has agendas, everything changes

1465
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,700
and evolution changes massively.

1466
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,660
So, I don't know if that counts as everyday life

1467
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,980
for people, I suppose that some people think

1468
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,540
about that stuff every day, so.

1469
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:36,700
No, no, it's good.

1470
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:39,300
I find it useful because it's a frame,

1471
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:45,060
it's a perspective on how you look at the problem.

1472
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,700
I mean, that's something we've talked about in round two.

1473
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:50,820
I think like polycomputing and the role of the absurd,

1474
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,700
the same thing can be computed.

1475
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:55,580
But depending on how you look at it, you actually get,

1476
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,900
you actually are extracting that different value,

1477
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,580
different utility from the same exact thing.

1478
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:03,500
So, yeah, that's wonderful.

1479
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,380
And actually, I think this will,

1480
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,300
just looking at the time a little bit here,

1481
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,980
I do wanna cover a little bit

1482
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:13,140
about the biology, Buddhism and AI paper.

1483
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:16,980
I think it was Kair as a driver of...

1484
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:17,980
I forget exactly.

1485
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,820
Yeah, Kair is a driver of intelligence,

1486
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:22,740
but she worked on with a few collaborators,

1487
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:26,100
Dr. Witkowski, Salmanova and Dwayne.

1488
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:31,100
And this, I think actually does bleed into this fairly well

1489
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,900
because in the Ingencial Point Materials paper,

1490
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:37,300
you mentioned the idea of like beginner mind.

1491
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:41,500
And you have a quote from Suzuki about the,

1492
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,220
in the beginner's mind, there's many possibilities

1493
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:45,380
and the expert's mind, there are a few.

1494
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:49,900
So you kind of wanna have a frame of like always being,

1495
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,660
having a frame of always being a beginner

1496
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,880
and being like open and curious to things all the time

1497
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,160
is a lot better than, this is a straw manning it,

1498
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,860
but it's a lot better than being an expert

1499
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:02,740
and being like, I know everything, I've mastered,

1500
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:03,940
there's nothing else left to go, right?

1501
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:08,260
There's always potential for more learning and more mastery.

1502
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:12,380
So for the Biology, Buddhism and AI paper,

1503
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:14,540
would you mind providing us again,

1504
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:16,620
just a brief overview of the overall paper

1505
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:20,180
and also how you got interested in this topic

1506
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:23,740
to begin with and how you got into this group

1507
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:26,820
of folks who are studying this.

1508
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:30,460
Yeah, well, how I got interested in it,

1509
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,220
I've been interested in these kinds of things

1510
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,700
for a really long time, both from the perspective

1511
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,260
of kind of Eastern thought about the philosophy of mind

1512
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:41,460
and things like that and more broadly questions

1513
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:46,460
of concern and compassion and things like that.

1514
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:50,260
How we met up, to tell you the truth,

1515
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:53,300
I don't remember who reached out first,

1516
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,020
it might have been Thomas Doctor that emailed me,

1517
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:58,180
I mean, Olaf and I have known each other,

1518
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:02,540
he's a great contributor to the artificial life community

1519
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:05,980
and so I've known him and his work for a long time,

1520
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:09,580
Bill and Eliza and Thomas I met afterwards.

1521
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,740
Yeah, I don't recall who made the first step,

1522
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:15,100
but anyway, we've been talking about this stuff

1523
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,180
and thinking about it for a long time

1524
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:17,340
and there's actually a second paper

1525
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:20,700
that just got accepted or we just returned it,

1526
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:21,900
I don't remember exactly where it is,

1527
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,380
but there's a second paper following up

1528
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,380
on all of this stuff.

1529
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,620
You can find the preprint is on the website,

1530
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:33,620
but this idea of specifically this idea of care

1531
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,580
and what do agents care about?

1532
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:40,820
And for me, it has lots of important implications

1533
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:43,660
because I try to understand collective intelligences

1534
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,740
and so if you're gonna have a collective intelligence,

1535
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:48,220
what is it going to care about?

1536
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:50,100
We don't have a good science of that.

1537
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:55,100
And then there's the notion of embedding care

1538
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,420
in artifacts that we make.

1539
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,780
So robotics, AIs, what are they gonna care about?

1540
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:05,220
It's kind of a funny story when my kid was,

1541
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:08,540
my youngest was, I wanna say he was three or four

1542
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:11,740
and he said, we used to build stuff together all the time

1543
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:14,260
and we did all kinds of engineering things

1544
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:18,060
and one day he said to me, let's make a cat.

1545
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:19,580
And I said, well, like a robotic,

1546
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:20,700
you wanna make a robotic cat.

1547
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,620
And I said, well, let's make a list

1548
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,020
of what are the design specs here?

1549
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:25,740
Like what does this thing need to do?

1550
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,660
And he says, well, it needs to move around.

1551
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,260
I'm like, yeah, maybe like that, that may be doable

1552
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:33,260
and it needs to make meowing noises

1553
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,780
and it's pretty much doable.

1554
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,900
And it needs to do something else that it needed to do.

1555
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,540
And I said, yeah, probably we could do that.

1556
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,900
And then he says, and it needs to care.

1557
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,380
And I said, what do you mean?

1558
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:44,180
You mean it needs to like walk over to you

1559
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:46,580
and let you pet it?

1560
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:49,220
He goes, no, no, not act as if it cared.

1561
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,940
I wanted to actually care.

1562
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:51,900
And I was like, all right, well, that's it.

1563
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,180
You've just broke the whole project

1564
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:55,420
because we don't have a clue

1565
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,940
as to how that is going to happen.

1566
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,940
And that is, you know, that,

1567
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:04,940
figuring out how that ties into the whole,

1568
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:08,500
you know, the cognitive light cone story

1569
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,340
that I've been telling

1570
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,620
and the kind of the spectrum of precipitability.

1571
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,820
It's like intelligence is one thing,

1572
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:17,100
problem solving is one thing.

1573
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,660
But where does the care come from, right?

1574
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,980
And what do we mean by that?

1575
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:24,780
And a lot of people say things like,

1576
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,540
I care about stuff.

1577
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:28,420
That's just the machine.

1578
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,940
They're usually pointing at some AI thing

1579
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:31,580
or some robot or something.

1580
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:32,540
And they say, well, that's just the machine.

1581
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:34,060
Machines can't care.

1582
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,740
And I'm like, well, you used to be a single cell.

1583
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:40,500
And do paramecia care?

1584
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,020
Because now you got a problem.

1585
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:45,260
If you say that the paramecia care,

1586
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:47,620
then well, guess what's inside of paramecia?

1587
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:49,540
A bunch of molecular cogs and wheels.

1588
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:53,500
So, you know, you gotta,

1589
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,380
so maybe machines and certainly molecular biologists

1590
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,340
see single cells as a kind of machine.

1591
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:03,180
And that analogy has done pretty well for us.

1592
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,140
On the other hand, if you say, no, no,

1593
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,380
the paramecium doesn't care.

1594
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:08,100
It's just a bunch of chemical reactions.

1595
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,780
I mean, we can sort of see what's going on in there.

1596
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:11,980
It's a bunch of chemistry that doesn't care.

1597
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:12,820
I care.

1598
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:14,260
Like, well, you used to be a single cell.

1599
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,460
So why don't you tell me where that,

1600
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:16,660
when the care got beamed,

1601
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:19,540
like what stage of embryogenesis

1602
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:20,780
does the care get beamed down, right?

1603
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:21,940
That's a problem too.

1604
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:24,460
So you got this real issue with people

1605
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,980
who think in binary categories,

1606
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:27,500
they get trapped in this pseudo problem

1607
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,380
that I think I'm unsolvable.

1608
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:34,660
So anyway, so we were really interested.

1609
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,500
And then of course, from their perspective,

1610
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,780
they're interested in the questions of,

1611
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:43,900
there's a Buddhist story about care and compassion

1612
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:44,740
and those kinds of things.

1613
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:47,380
So I was interested to see how compatible those things are.

1614
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:50,260
Can we use some tools from that thought?

1615
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:52,100
I mean, there's a whole other thing,

1616
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:57,100
which is this notion of the impermanence of the self.

1617
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,700
And it goes, I mean, there are obviously

1618
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:01,540
all different kinds of opinions on this

1619
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:04,900
all the way from there is no such thing.

1620
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:07,900
It's a total illusion, right?

1621
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,380
That's one set of views.

1622
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:11,180
And then on the other is the kind of like

1623
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:14,220
the sort of demand on the street version,

1624
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:17,460
which is, well, I've got this permanent to self

1625
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:20,340
and it's this like thing and then it exists.

1626
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:22,180
And then what I'm interested in

1627
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:24,260
is kind of the space in between,

1628
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,820
which I think is more accurate.

1629
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:28,460
So, and by the way, I'm no Buddhist scholar.

1630
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:33,180
I don't pretend to know who thinks what in that area.

1631
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:36,700
I'm just, I'm trying to keep up with Thomas

1632
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,940
and Elizabeth and so on.

1633
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:42,540
But there's an intermediate version,

1634
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:45,380
which is that it's not that you don't exist.

1635
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:48,180
You do in the same sense as everything else exists,

1636
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:50,180
which is as a useful metaphor.

1637
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:54,060
And in fact, you are the most useful metaphor for all,

1638
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,940
of all, because you might do away with,

1639
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,180
you might somehow do away with metaphors

1640
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:04,180
of talking about, I don't know what social structures are,

1641
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:07,300
what grocery stores are.

1642
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:11,100
Maybe you don't, maybe you now see,

1643
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,060
like Eddington said, that a table is mostly empty space.

1644
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,020
And so maybe you've internalized physics enough

1645
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:19,100
to know that even the table isn't a great metaphor

1646
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,900
that it's mostly fields and whatnot.

1647
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,740
Like all of that is fine,

1648
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:28,740
but there is this metaphor of a self that can do things

1649
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,980
because it's on you to do stuff or not do it.

1650
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,460
You have to make those decisions.

1651
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:39,580
That's a pretty useful metaphor.

1652
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:41,700
So I don't think it's not real.

1653
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:43,300
I think it is real in the same sense

1654
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:44,260
that everything else is real,

1655
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:46,420
which is a useful construction.

1656
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:50,300
Also, I think what's useful about it

1657
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:53,780
is that it is continuously self-constructed.

1658
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:56,220
And here's what I mean by that.

1659
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:59,000
At any given moment, so right now,

1660
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,100
you don't really have access to your past.

1661
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,220
The only thing you have access to are the engrams

1662
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:06,580
left in your brain and body by your past experiences.

1663
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:07,780
That's all you have access to.

1664
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:10,980
And from that, you reconstruct the story of your past.

1665
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:12,900
So including the school you went to

1666
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:13,740
and various other things,

1667
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:16,320
you're building that right now at every moment.

1668
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:20,980
It's a little bit like anterior grade amnesia patients

1669
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:23,100
who can't form new memories.

1670
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,340
And so they use these scratch pads,

1671
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:26,940
at least some of them where you write down,

1672
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:28,500
the first thing you write down is that

1673
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,060
I have anterior grade amnesia

1674
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,700
and then some stuff that happened.

1675
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:32,740
And then at the end, that says,

1676
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:35,300
and don't forget, write this note again tomorrow.

1677
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:39,140
And that's your, like most of us have the same thing.

1678
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:40,540
It's just internalized,

1679
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,580
but now they're using the Stigmergically,

1680
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:45,140
this outside tool because there's some problem.

1681
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:48,740
So we are all really in that state.

1682
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:51,780
It's just we're using an internal scratch pad.

1683
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,060
Right now, you don't have any access

1684
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:54,820
to what happened years ago.

1685
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:57,420
You just have the memories and they're actively rebuilt.

1686
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,860
And we all know our ability to rebuild accurately

1687
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,900
is crap basically, right?

1688
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:06,220
And these things morph and change and whatnot.

1689
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:08,300
So the story of ourselves changes all the time.

1690
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:13,300
I actually, I did a, I gave a talk the other day

1691
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:17,460
at this UCLA symposium and I talked about Plenaria

1692
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:21,100
and this idea, in Plenaria, if you teach them something

1693
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,860
and then you chop off their heads

1694
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,100
and the tail sits there

1695
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:25,820
and then eventually they regrow a new head

1696
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,620
and they regenerate their memories, right?

1697
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:30,060
And so that means, okay, the memory is stored somewhere

1698
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,100
to who knows where it is,

1699
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:34,140
but the interesting part of that is the memories

1700
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:38,380
are actually imprinted onto the new brain as it develops.

1701
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:40,700
And so this new being, this new Plenarian

1702
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,260
has to rebuild itself along with its memories.

1703
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,300
I mean, I don't know how rich a Plenarian's memories really are

1704
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,740
but whatever they are,

1705
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:51,100
it has to like completely rebuild itself from these memories.

1706
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:54,180
And that sounds all crazy and weird

1707
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:56,980
and it sounds like the cases of like,

1708
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:02,020
what's the, you know, Blade Runner and everything

1709
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:05,020
when you find out that, oh crap, my memories aren't really

1710
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:08,140
my memories, I mean, as far as this Plenarian brain is concerned

1711
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:10,300
it just got downloaded a bunch of false memories.

1712
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,380
That brain was not part of any of the things

1713
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:14,580
that it remembers, they wasn't there, didn't exist.

1714
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:17,140
So it's kind of a bunch of false memories.

1715
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:19,740
And so, and so it was like, wow, these Plenarians are crazy

1716
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,620
and this thing with the androids is nuts.

1717
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:26,460
And my point was, no, no, no, this is what we are 24 seven.

1718
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:28,540
This is completely normal because all of us

1719
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:31,380
are reconstructing ourselves at every moment.

1720
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:32,700
And I don't know how wide the moment is,

1721
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,580
but I'm sure that neuroscientists will tell us

1722
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:39,580
you are reconstructing yourself from these past memories.

1723
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:43,060
And so I think that's a deep kind of philosophical thing

1724
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:48,060
because, you know, your self isn't some permanent

1725
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,460
monadic structure that just kind of exists.

1726
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,940
It's an active construction, it's a process,

1727
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:57,580
it's a constant information processing.

1728
01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:00,820
Autopoiesis, you know, of the mind doesn't stop

1729
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:03,940
during embryogenesis, it kind of keeps going, it has to.

1730
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:08,940
And it has these interesting implications.

1731
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,980
If somebody, it will go going back to, you know,

1732
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:17,980
I guess I'm now in the business of trying to normalize

1733
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,940
a lot of things that people get freaked out about,

1734
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:21,740
but you know, imagine, right?

1735
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:24,460
So if somebody finds out that, oh my God,

1736
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,900
like all of these memories that I have now,

1737
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,540
that wasn't me, that were downloaded,

1738
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:31,620
my body was just, you know, was it Boltzmann

1739
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:34,100
or was it Humor, somebody had this puzzle,

1740
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,660
like what happens if you're not,

1741
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:38,980
if all your memories were just like,

1742
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:41,140
you were created 10 seconds ago,

1743
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:44,420
including your memories, right, or something like that.

1744
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:45,660
If you think about it hard enough,

1745
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:48,900
given that that's normally our situation anyway,

1746
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,860
my answer is, who cares?

1747
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:53,660
Great, like move on, you've got them now, go for it.

1748
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:56,140
Now you've got some great memories, like roll with it,

1749
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:58,380
because what else is it gonna be?

1750
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:00,700
Of course you were just constructed with your memories,

1751
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:01,700
what else could it be?

1752
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,620
You are constantly constructing yourself

1753
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:05,260
from the n-grams in your head,

1754
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:08,300
you don't have access to what actually happened before.

1755
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,540
You are, I just don't even, you know,

1756
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,700
that view seems weird to people,

1757
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,620
and I can't even verbalize what the alternative would be,

1758
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:19,220
I just don't even understand what an alternative story

1759
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,500
could possibly be.

1760
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,860
So from that perspective,

1761
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:28,700
you know, in fact, you can go further with this,

1762
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,340
the body that I have now,

1763
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:33,580
given the turnover of cells and molecules in your body,

1764
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:36,180
was this body actually around 30 years ago

1765
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:38,340
to do the things that I remember doing?

1766
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:40,060
It actually wasn't, we know it wasn't,

1767
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:41,860
even though I've not been part of some weird memory

1768
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:44,100
replacement experiment, you know, and I'm not an Android,

1769
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,060
this body wasn't there, I know it wasn't,

1770
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:47,340
we know it wasn't there.

1771
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:49,780
And yet I have these memories, so am I complaining?

1772
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:50,700
What would you complain about?

1773
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,820
If somebody told you that, you know,

1774
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:54,100
yeah, your body was just, you know,

1775
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,660
you were killed in a record,

1776
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:57,020
or maybe your body never existed,

1777
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:57,860
but we just made you,

1778
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,900
and like here are some great memories of a past life,

1779
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:02,460
like bring it on, fantastic, you know,

1780
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:03,500
I hope they're good ones.

1781
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,420
And because I don't know what the,

1782
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:07,460
I don't even know what the alternative would be.

1783
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:10,660
So I think, for that reason,

1784
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:13,220
I think all of these things are really,

1785
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:14,460
really hopeful and positive.

1786
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,500
You know, they just tell us that,

1787
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,660
we shouldn't be afraid of these technologies,

1788
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:23,820
this is the amazing thing about being a self

1789
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:24,940
in this universe,

1790
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:27,820
is you get to constantly construct yourself,

1791
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:29,700
and by the way, guide what happens in the future,

1792
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:32,900
what you do now determines the experiences

1793
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,940
you're going to have, the reactions you're going to have,

1794
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:37,940
which of course, you know, those kinds of disciplines

1795
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:42,940
and traditions are all about that,

1796
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:45,700
about consistent practice to train yourself to be better,

1797
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:48,580
to have, you know, to improve your cognitive,

1798
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,460
you know, apparatus and so on.

1799
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:53,060
And the commitment, this is the last thing,

1800
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:56,540
the bodhisattva vow, which is huge,

1801
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:59,020
it's this commitment, it's a meta goal,

1802
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:02,220
it's the commitment to enlarge your cognitive apparatus

1803
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:03,420
to enable bigger goals,

1804
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,020
to enable you to pursue bigger goals

1805
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,940
with more compassion facing outwards.

1806
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:09,660
That I think is critical because I think,

1807
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:11,860
once you are a system with the ability

1808
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:14,780
to make that commitment,

1809
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:17,860
it's sort of like, it's an exponential rise after that,

1810
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:19,820
right, it's like discovering the scientific process.

1811
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:21,820
Before that, it was all sort of screwing around,

1812
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:22,860
you know, trial and error,

1813
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:23,860
but as soon as you figured out

1814
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:25,740
that there's a systematic thing that you,

1815
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:28,980
I am going to literally work to get better at this

1816
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:30,300
and to be able to have more,

1817
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:33,220
increase my cognitive light cone of compassion,

1818
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:36,180
you can now sort of exponentially go up

1819
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:37,420
because you understand what you're doing,

1820
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:40,860
it's not just, you know, just a random walk.

1821
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:44,180
Yeah, now I love what you've said before too

1822
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:46,620
about how something to this degree

1823
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,940
that you can't control your next thought,

1824
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:51,740
but you can't control your thoughts 10 years from now

1825
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:53,100
by what you do today, right,

1826
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,180
and what you do every day,

1827
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:57,020
you can like influence the future.

1828
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:00,660
One thing I really wanted to ask you about,

1829
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,260
and it's not in this paper,

1830
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:05,260
but I imagine other folks have worked on this,

1831
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:10,620
the idea of what it's like to perceive,

1832
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:13,460
let's say the self in a broader way.

1833
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:16,180
And like you mentioned with the Bodhisattva vow,

1834
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:17,460
and I think this is actually really nice

1835
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,820
because it brings us full circle with our conversation

1836
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:20,900
from our very first one,

1837
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,980
which was around the cognitive light cones.

1838
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:25,260
And in this paper, you do have a diagram

1839
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:28,420
where you've like overlaid what the,

1840
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:32,540
what someone with a wider sense of self,

1841
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,780
say a one to help out the community

1842
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:37,700
or something that's also one that takes the vow

1843
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:41,180
to not achieve enlightenment until everyone else does, right?

1844
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:45,580
It's like this leave no living being behind kind of idea, right?

1845
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,660
But do we have any research or even discussions

1846
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:52,820
with say monks, people who engage

1847
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:56,740
in say like deep Buddhist meditative practices?

1848
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:59,860
Do they perceive themselves as like a part of a whole?

1849
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:04,260
Like is their actual sensory experience different

1850
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:07,940
than say a very enlightened person like myself

1851
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,780
or like most folks?

1852
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:10,860
Like does that make any sense?

1853
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:13,820
Like how they perceive themselves in the world?

1854
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:16,100
Yeah, I think that's a great question.

1855
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,180
I don't think I've got the expertise to answer that question.

1856
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:21,220
I think you could talk to,

1857
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:23,740
you could have Thomas Doctor on, for example,

1858
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:28,340
and he's a very kind of experienced scholar in that area.

1859
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:32,380
And I think he would, you'd have a good time.

1860
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:33,860
You could explain all that stuff.

1861
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,140
Yeah, yeah, I think I'll have to.

1862
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:40,060
And let's see.

1863
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:40,780
And that's great.

1864
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:43,580
So you gave me so much to chew on and so much for the audience too,

1865
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:45,980
I'm sure this idea that who you are today

1866
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:47,340
is not who you were 30 years ago,

1867
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:50,780
just in a very literal materialistic sense.

1868
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:52,860
And that there's like just this illusion

1869
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:56,860
of a consistent, continuous kind of experience.

1870
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,980
It's a really, it's a wonderful way to put it.

1871
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:01,980
And if you wouldn't mind, I mean, I do,

1872
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:05,820
I'll probably overlay the cognitive light cone

1873
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:10,540
with the Bodhisattva, the Bodhisattva vowel one.

1874
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,220
How has this been, because this came out,

1875
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,780
this paper came out about a year ago,

1876
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:14,700
how has it been received?

1877
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,740
Have you heard any response from the paper?

1878
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:24,460
A little bit, a little bit.

1879
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:27,820
Yeah, I don't know.

1880
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:32,100
I don't track responses super, super carefully,

1881
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,380
so I'm not sure.

1882
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:36,100
Haven't heard a ton, but I'm gonna guess,

1883
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:39,460
I'm gonna guess Thomas heard more on it.

1884
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:42,140
But I think that, I've certainly had interesting people

1885
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:43,380
reach out to me to talk about it,

1886
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,340
which is pretty much one of the things

1887
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:48,500
I hope for in writing these things.

1888
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,300
So I've had lots of cool discussions.

1889
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:51,500
I don't know more broadly.

1890
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,900
I mean, I have no idea how, in any of these papers,

1891
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:57,100
by the way, I have no clue if anybody reads them

1892
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:59,420
or who reads them or what happens after that.

1893
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:01,300
I don't know, yeah, yeah, well, I appreciate that.

1894
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:03,900
And certainly people contact me,

1895
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:08,180
but it's very hard to know how these things

1896
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:09,980
are actually spreading or not spreading

1897
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:11,620
through the community.

1898
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:13,260
Gotcha, and I'm gonna let you go in a moment.

1899
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:14,980
But before I do one last thing,

1900
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,780
you're a big mid-journey fan.

1901
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:21,380
You oftentimes have, seems like you're also a fan

1902
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:22,580
of surrealist arts.

1903
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:26,300
I've seen stuff from prompts that are,

1904
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:29,500
like, do this in the style of the Codex Seraphoninus

1905
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,860
or in the style of the Chironomous Bosch.

1906
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:35,420
Do you know, like, what is it that draws you towards,

1907
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:36,900
like, those kind of art styles?

1908
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,900
I don't know.

1909
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:45,460
I have had zero art training.

1910
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:46,340
I kind of know what I like,

1911
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:47,740
but I don't know anything about art.

1912
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:50,780
I can't draw on myself at all, like nothing.

1913
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:55,500
And yeah, and I mean, all I know is that

1914
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:59,260
I really like, I'm really interested

1915
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:00,860
in the space of the possible

1916
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:05,540
and much, much more so than the actual.

1917
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:10,540
And everything I look at art-wise

1918
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:15,540
is either photography of nature or photography thereof.

1919
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:18,180
I like nature, but other than that,

1920
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:21,820
yeah, I'm really into imagining

1921
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:25,220
what could be the latent space of possibilities.

1922
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:28,260
And I think, you know, mid-journey and systems like that

1923
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,620
are pretty cool in that respect.

1924
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:34,460
They let you explore this wacky latent space

1925
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:38,340
that it has of images of all different kinds.

1926
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,740
Yeah, that's just kind of generally,

1927
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:46,820
I think very much forward in terms of, like, what now,

1928
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:48,900
what next, what could we do next?

1929
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,860
That's, you know, maybe that explains a lot

1930
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:56,060
of my kind of, you know, not getting worked up

1931
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:58,900
about whether the past is real or not or what.

1932
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:00,700
It's mostly the forward-looking stuff.

1933
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,260
I mean, like whatever in the past, but like now,

1934
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:03,260
what do we do now?

1935
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:05,380
So that's more what I'm interested in.

1936
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:10,060
And I like this kind of art that lets you,

1937
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,460
yeah, imagine things that could be,

1938
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:15,100
what are the possibilities moving forward?

1939
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:18,260
Yeah, I share same love for that style as well,

1940
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:19,500
those styles.

1941
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:22,500
And I just want to say thank you so much, Mike.

1942
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,660
These three conversations have been wonderful.

1943
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:26,700
I appreciate your time, your energy.

1944
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:29,300
And where should people find out more about you?

1945
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,820
I'll link in the description.

1946
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:31,660
Yeah.

1947
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:35,060
Well, everything is, there's an official website,

1948
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:38,980
the academic website is www.drmike11.org.

1949
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:41,100
So one word, drmike11.org.

1950
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:44,340
And that's got all the links to the papers, the software,

1951
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:46,940
the presentations, everything else.

1952
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:51,660
I've got a science Twitter presence at drmike11.

1953
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:53,300
And I think in a couple of months,

1954
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,700
there will be a WordPress site.

1955
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:57,100
So I've been working on a site kind of,

1956
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,460
yeah, I was sort of thinking sub-stack WordPress.

1957
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:01,620
I decided WordPress.

1958
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,180
And so there's going to be a site

1959
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:05,900
that's kind of less the official academic stuff

1960
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:07,820
and all kinds of writing that I want to do

1961
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:09,380
that doesn't really, you know,

1962
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:11,580
kind of tired of asking the question of,

1963
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:14,500
you know, you write this thing and it's not really,

1964
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:17,060
it isn't a primary paper and it isn't really a review

1965
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:18,340
and it's kind of a perspective,

1966
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:19,500
but it's really interdisciplinary.

1967
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:20,900
It's way too long for a journal.

1968
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:23,660
And I'm sort of just tired of this issue

1969
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:25,540
of finding a home for it, you know,

1970
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:27,100
what they say, like, where are we going to put?

1971
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,420
Like, okay, forget it.

1972
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:30,060
We'll just, it'll go there

1973
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:31,940
and then anybody who's interested can read it.

1974
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:32,900
And that'll be that.

1975
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,700
So, yeah, so there'll be, that doesn't exist yet,

1976
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:38,980
but in the next couple of months, it should be up.

1977
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:39,900
Awesome, great.

1978
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,500
Well, we will watch that space.

1979
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:42,940
And I'll, when it comes live,

1980
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:45,100
I'll update all the other videos so that people can get there.

1981
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:45,940
That's great, I appreciate it.

1982
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:46,780
Thank you, thank you.

1983
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:47,620
Yeah, absolutely.

1984
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:48,460
Thank you, Mike.

1985
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:49,300
Thanks very much.

1986
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:50,140
Yeah, thanks for having me on.

1987
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:50,980
It was great, thanks.

1988
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:51,820
It was awesome.

1989
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:52,660
Thank you so much.

1990
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:53,500
All right, all right.
