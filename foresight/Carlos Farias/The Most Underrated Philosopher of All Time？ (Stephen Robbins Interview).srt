1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The holographic principle is basically,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,240
and a hologram at any point is the information

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,920
for the whole object, the whole scene,

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,520
the whole cup, the whole ball, the whole plate.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,920
Berkson was far more famous than Einstein

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,840
in the first two decades of the 20th century,

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,480
which is kind of mind-boggling just to think of now.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,360
Berkson and Einstein had a history in 1922, I believe.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,800
The story is the myth perhaps is that that debate

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,640
prevented Einstein from winning the Nobel Prize that year.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,480
Is that true?

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,520
Yes, right.

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,800
There was only one problem, and that was that

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,120
there was a war going on, and I had been drafted

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,960
as soon as I got out of the seminary

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,720
because my draft status was no longer 4D, which was exempt.

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,240
So I ended up going into the Marine Corps,

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,160
and I was actually in a long-range reconnaissance group

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,760
plowing through the jungle triumph,

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,280
with six guys in the middle of nowhere in the jungle

21
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,520
being dropped up in helicopters, et cetera, et cetera.

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,560
One of Gibson's big ideas was affordance theory, right?

23
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,200
He was that we see...

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Affordance is a big thing, yes.

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,920
We see what is the usefulness of the objects,

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,400
and we see that kind of space.

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,680
It reminds me quite a bit of Donald Hoffman's theories

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,160
around we see the world in terms of

29
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,200
one of the most fit for us as organisms

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,520
rather than what's actually there.

31
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,880
But I know you've done a video on Hoffman.

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,720
Right.

33
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,240
We're gonna blow Hoffman away here, but let me go back.

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,320
Just for one...

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,000
Could you tell us about that mystical experience,

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,600
what that was like?

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,400
Shall we say all of a sudden just kind of

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,920
laying on the deck, kind of like, wow, what's going on?

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,320
And what one felt was that suddenly

40
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,880
that there was this other being that you actually were.

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,120
And this being was infinite.

42
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,120
You and this being had been the same being forever.

43
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,800
I guess I'm reminded of a statement by Thomas Merton,

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,440
the great contemplative monk that a Catholic contemplative

45
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,680
monk in a statement was in true contemplative state,

46
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,320
or actually he meant a mystical state.

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,320
All concept of sin dissolves because this being

48
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,280
that you are is obviously a divine being and cannot sin.

49
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,680
And so when you brought up in the Catholic framework,

50
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,080
sin is very much a doctrine and a dogma,

51
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,000
and you're worried about mortal sins and venial sins

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,600
and confessing sins and so on and so forth.

53
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,240
The whole thing just dissolved because it's felt to be ridiculous.

54
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,920
It's felt to be no longer applicable.

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,120
And the whole world was just one gigantic sea of love, you know?

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,080
I mean, the ecstasy was so intense,

57
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,640
I almost had to have it turned off.

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,360
And there was another interesting concept

59
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,800
that must have come from deep in my being

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,400
because I got this, all is just.

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,720
There was another was justice, everything.

62
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,840
I must have been worried about injustice.

63
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,320
I still am, but at that time it was like,

64
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,800
well, everything is just.

65
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,080
So it was very intense ecstatic experience.

66
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,440
Rather, each instant penetrates,

67
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,600
permeates the next, like the notes of a melody,

68
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,840
each note penetrates, permeates the next.

69
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,120
Some melodic transformation, organic continuity.

70
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,040
How is these bits, how are they suddenly becoming

71
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,000
concrete coffee cups with liquid in them?

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,440
Stirring, rotating, right?

73
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,480
Come on, when you look at the conception, it's ludicrous.

74
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,040
It is not Berkson's conception of holographic feel.

75
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,680
It's a 2D bit hologram.

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,920
Sorry, but not the same thing.

77
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,080
Not even worth looking.

78
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,080
See, you got me mad.

79
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,520
No, that's okay.

80
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,280
I mean, you're passionate about it, I get it.

81
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,280
How is this theory, Berkson in general,

82
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,160
how does this influence your day-to-day life

83
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,280
for your moment's moment existence, if it does at all?

84
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,280
I, for one, think that science, physics, psychology,

85
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,840
cognitive science, given Berkson's framework,

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,840
absolutely backs the spiritual vision of man,

87
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,720
the Zen vision, if nothing more,

88
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,800
but probably also the Hindu vision

89
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,040
of what our actual capabilities are.

90
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,360
I think that there's no conflict between science

91
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,040
and this whole notion that's permeating people's minds

92
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,040
right now that neuroscience says we're just human robot forms

93
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,840
with no spiritual component whatsoever

94
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,480
is utterly destroyed by Berkson

95
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,320
and gives us a very solid grounding in science

96
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,360
and our own mystical experience that supports it.

97
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,800
So I guess bottom line from that perspective,

98
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,920
Berkson is a great comfort.

99
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,720
And if people wanna shed the transhumanist vision

100
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,600
of the idea where we're gonna all get a nice bunch of chips

101
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
because it's just all we really are anyhow

102
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,720
and just become enhanced robots.

103
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,800
And also there is no God, there's no karmic laws

104
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,120
and et cetera, et cetera that they'll get into Berkson

105
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,200
and you'll see quickly how just shallow and superficial

106
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,040
and understanding they actually are.

107
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,640
I don't include people like Sam Harris or Daniel Dennett,

108
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,440
et cetera, these people are in my mind

109
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,480
are extremely badly misled

110
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,880
because they extremely do not understand

111
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,880
the problem of consciousness and time.

112
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,000
So that's one thing, after that, it's been a giant pain

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
because I never thought that after 50,

114
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,920
what are we, 50 years that this particular conception

115
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,080
would be so buried yet.

116
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,200
It's buried in cognitive science

117
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,520
that no one wants to look at.

118
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,800
It's buried in memory theory,

119
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,080
it's buried in perception theory.

120
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,680
It's buried by the Getzonians for great sake.

121
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,040
They won't even look at it.

122
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,720
It's buried by the Berksonians for that matter.

123
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,240
Even Berksonian philosophers can't deal with it.

124
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,200
I can just feel it, they don't want to deal with it.

125
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,280
Oh, it's too much, can't deal with that.

126
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,960
So it's become a frustrating pain

127
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,280
and I feel like my life's mission has been a bust.

128
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,240
So I feel right now, let me tell you the truth,

129
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,800
it's been a good, it was a good try.

130
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,480
Maybe someone later will come along

131
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,000
and take it up because right now, to me,

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,280
it's completely being ignored.

133
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,440
Steve Robbins has a PhD in educational psych and psychology

134
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,760
from the University of Minnesota

135
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,600
with a focus on cognitive science.

136
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,520
His thesis covered turn of the 20th century

137
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,480
French philosopher Henri Berkson

138
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,080
and his alternative model of mind.

139
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,920
In the decades since,

140
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,880
he's published academic journal articles

141
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,320
and three books on Berkson slash consciousness.

142
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Before his doctoral work,

143
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,800
he served as a Marine Infantry Officer in Vietnam.

144
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
After 33 years in the software industry,

145
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,080
he's now retired on a mini farm in Wisconsin

146
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,280
and runs a YouTube channel with over 80 videos

147
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,880
dedicated to Berkson and his holographic theory.

148
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,160
Steve, thanks for coming on.

149
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,440
Oh, thank you.

150
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
It's a pleasure.

151
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,480
Yeah, it's so great to see you and get to chat with you.

152
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,120
I've discovered your channel many weeks ago

153
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,000
and have been digesting each video, they're dense,

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,800
but I highly recommend people check them out.

155
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,640
After this conversation, I'll link all of your,

156
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,080
link to your YouTube channel and your website

157
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,240
in the description of my video.

158
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,440
Right, right.

159
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,640
It's a tiny point, either in space,

160
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,600
somewhere in the channel.

161
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,320
Yes, yes.

162
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,640
Which takes a voyage to discover it currently.

163
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,800
Yeah, absolutely.

164
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,440
A lot of competition, you have to,

165
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,160
it's a tough market.

166
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,720
I know, I'm a similar size channel, so I get it.

167
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,080
So Steve, it'd be great if we could kick us off.

168
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,960
I know you have some prepared slides.

169
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,000
If you want, you can pull those up.

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,120
I'd love to, I know you have some at the beginning

171
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
that goes through your background a little bit

172
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,240
in even more detail, because I love to learn.

173
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,160
I know our audience will have some context on you

174
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,760
to get your story and to figure out what's intrigued you

175
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,440
so much about Berkson.

176
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,320
I consider you one of the world's experts on Berkson.

177
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,000
So if you wouldn't mind, yeah, pulling that up,

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,680
we can get into individuals of your story are great too.

179
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,240
I think seeing the trajectory of your career.

180
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,840
We're gonna have to go visual as you noted,

181
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,120
because there's a lot here to comprehend

182
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,400
that two talking heads make it very slow to get across.

183
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,760
So some pictures work well.

184
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,320
Yes, for the viewers, if you like visuals,

185
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Steve provides a lot of visuals on his YouTube channel

186
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,800
and extensive quotes that help elucidate

187
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,720
the concepts you're trying to get across.

188
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,040
We were thinking about beginning where,

189
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,000
how it began with, well, where I come from, I guess is the...

190
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,160
Yeah, let's get your background.

191
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,400
Where'd you grow up?

192
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
So I'm basically a Minnesota native.

193
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
I'm sitting in Wisconsin right now,

194
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,560
a little bit north of Milwaukee.

195
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,520
I spent a good chunk of my life, like seven years

196
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,400
as a Franciscan seminarian,

197
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,680
down in Chicago and ultimately in Illinois.

198
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,800
In fact, there was a good picture of,

199
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,760
there's my seminary in Illinois and West by Illinois.

200
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,280
And that's not me, but that's some Franciscan.

201
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,560
Just to give a context of what I'm talking about.

202
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Because I spent the last year in 1966 in the vichit

203
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,360
where you're actually dressed up in a habit

204
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,600
and walking around with your cord and your rosary

205
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,200
and et cetera, et cetera.

206
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,760
But I decided to...

207
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,680
Can you tell us what you're up against?

208
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,360
Do you mind giving us some context as to why you

209
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,680
were temporarily, you joined the Franciscan order?

210
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,160
Yeah, I would say this.

211
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,160
My folks were very Catholic, very dedicated, very devout.

212
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,280
And I had some sort of, shall I say, affinity toward this.

213
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,520
I remember reading The Life of St. Francis,

214
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,520
Perfect Joy St. Francis when I was seven years old.

215
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,320
And that already started me off right there.

216
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,160
I was going to be a Franciscan.

217
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,720
Wow, at seven.

218
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,080
Yeah, that division experience was quite the deal.

219
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,240
I was, you know, you got up at midnight

220
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,320
and chanted office, the divine office for an hour

221
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,200
and then meditated and then went back to bed

222
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,680
and got back up at six and did more chanting

223
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,400
of the divine office, you know, tourism logs

224
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,920
or whatever in Latin and then go through the whole day.

225
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,760
There was no talking, et cetera.

226
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,400
But I left in the spring of 1966

227
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,200
because I decided ultimately after seven years

228
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,720
and lots of Latin and Greek and German

229
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,840
the interesting education that was available at the time

230
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,840
in that environment that it wasn't quite the fit for me.

231
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,520
And so I ended up going to the University of Minnesota.

232
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,640
I had to finish off my undergrad.

233
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,600
I crammed two years into one year at Minnesota

234
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,440
and I was in psychology and political science.

235
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,240
I was actually political science was my thing.

236
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,280
But I liked psychology in the mind.

237
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,280
And, but that, that little place there was the absolute

238
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,920
haunt of skin air and behaviorism and his rats.

239
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,920
And the very last course I had in the spring of 66

240
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,240
was by a professor from Michigan

241
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,320
who was teaching Piaget and cognitive development

242
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,800
and the whole theory that actually there's something

243
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,160
in the brain that skinner denied.

244
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,440
For skinner you weren't even supposed to,

245
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,680
the brain was off limits.

246
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,840
You didn't look in the brain, but here you have Piaget

247
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,440
talking about cognitive development.

248
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,440
And that somehow turned me back on to psychology

249
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,440
and there was only one problem and that was this,

250
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,840
that there was a war going on.

251
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,840
And I had been drafted as soon as I got out of the seminary

252
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,280
because my draft status was no longer 4D,

253
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,800
which was exempt.

254
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,240
And so I ended up going into the Marine Corps

255
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,240
for reasons I won't go into.

256
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,440
And I was actually in a long range reconnaissance group

257
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,520
plowing through the jungle, trying,

258
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,080
with six guys in the middle of nowhere in the jungle

259
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,320
being dropped up in helicopters, et cetera, et cetera.

260
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,720
So I spent 68, 69 doing that.

261
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,800
And-

262
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,640
Wow.

263
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,480
Steve, thank you for your service.

264
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,040
These are always interesting experiences.

265
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,040
And I came back to the States and I guess that's a piece

266
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,120
I didn't, it's hard to picture here, but I was very,

267
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,040
I call it, involuted because I was,

268
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,000
when you go through an experience like that,

269
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
you're wanting to find what's the meaning of life

270
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,240
and what the heck is this all about?

271
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,880
And so you sort of go into an intense inward state

272
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,680
and in that state, toward the end,

273
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,200
I was in North Carolina on the sea coast,

274
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,640
in the inland waterway.

275
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,440
I was living with three other ex-officers

276
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,240
and they were still officers in the Marines,

277
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,240
but on top of a yacht basin, yacht club,

278
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,440
but I had what one would call a mystical experience

279
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,800
and which again had an impact on me

280
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,680
because I'm used from the seminary from a course

281
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,240
I took an epistemology, which I didn't have a clue

282
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,480
what was going on, but there's something problematic

283
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,760
with the relationship of subject to an object.

284
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,000
And we'll come back to that in this discussion,

285
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,240
but that mystical experience sort of enhanced

286
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,400
that whole perception that, oh, this is quite interesting.

287
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,880
And you see Piaget, back to him,

288
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,200
he was sort of describing how the child starts out

289
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,800
and actually kind of a mystical state

290
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,240
where he's one with the world

291
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,400
and only gradually does he learn

292
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,560
that he's a self among other selves,

293
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,720
an object among other objects,

294
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,240
a force among other forces

295
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,840
and that he has an identity himself

296
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,080
with respect to this other matrix of beings,

297
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,880
forces and objects.

298
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,040
And so in essence, it's the description

299
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,640
of how one goes from a, should we say,

300
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,120
infatmistic to, excuse me,

301
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,480
needing to zen koan to break through

302
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,920
back to this original state

303
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,160
or where you are one with the universe, shall we say.

304
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,960
So that all struck me.

305
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,960
In fact, that kind of became my thought in that,

306
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,600
well, this is what I really should maybe look at

307
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,000
if I go back to the University of Minnesota,

308
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
which my next arrow says back to Minnesota in 1971.

309
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,080
Steve, do you mind, Steve?

310
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,560
Sorry, I hate to interrupt you

311
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,360
because you're in a great flow here,

312
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,840
but if you care to share,

313
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,080
and I know it might be a very personal experience,

314
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,280
so please, if you don't want it, if you don't care to you,

315
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,720
but could you tell us about that mystical experience,

316
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,640
what that was like?

317
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,320
It's a little hard to describe,

318
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,040
but it was, I kind of found myself,

319
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,600
shall we say, all of a sudden,

320
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,920
just kind of laying on the deck,

321
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,600
kind of like, wow, what's going on?

322
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,600
And this, what one felt was that suddenly

323
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,240
that there was this other being that you actually were.

324
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,640
And this being was infinite.

325
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,640
You and this being had been the same being forever.

326
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,560
And I guess I'm reminded of a statement by Thomas Merton,

327
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,280
the great contemplative monk,

328
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,160
the Catholic contemplative monk,

329
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,040
in his statement was in a true contemplative state,

330
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,920
or actually he meant a mystical state.

331
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,200
All concept of sin dissolves

332
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,840
because this being that you are is obviously a divine being

333
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,720
and cannot sin.

334
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,280
And so when you're brought up in the Catholic framework,

335
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,480
sin is very much a doctrine and a dogma,

336
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,440
and you're worried about mortal sins and venial sins

337
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,760
and confessing sins, et cetera, et cetera.

338
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,040
And this whole thing just dissolved

339
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,400
because it's felt to be ridiculous.

340
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,320
It's felt to be, no longer can be,

341
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,960
it's no longer applicable.

342
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And the whole world was just one gigantic sea of love.

343
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,280
I mean, the ecstasy was so intense,

344
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,800
I almost had to have it turned off.

345
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,400
And there was another interesting concept

346
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,840
that must have come from deep in my being

347
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,560
because I got this all as just.

348
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,880
There was another was justice, everything.

349
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,920
I must have been worried about injustice.

350
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,480
In fact, I still am, but at that time it was like,

351
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,760
well, everything is just.

352
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,360
And so it was very intense ecstatic experience.

353
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,760
And with the awareness that there really wasn't no death,

354
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,200
you had been this being, this whole notion of sin fell away

355
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,680
because, well, there's lots of implications in that.

356
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,680
So, yeah, that's pretty much the content thereof.

357
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,480
Okay, and it wasn't long thereafter.

358
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,440
I mean, that, well, it's kind of funny

359
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,360
because I lived with another one of the tenants

360
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,280
that lived with us, his nickname was Duke.

361
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,240
He had been over in Vietnam for, well, 18 months.

362
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,120
The normal 12 month tour and then his troops,

363
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,120
his platoon turned them on to marijuana

364
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,440
because they thought he was a cool guy.

365
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,800
And he re-extended for six months just to do the marijuana.

366
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,640
Wow.

367
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,960
And then he'd be walking around.

368
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,440
He was in LSD and he could be on an LSD trip.

369
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,520
You never knew it, you know?

370
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,040
Wow, interesting guy.

371
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,600
And because I had gotten out of the ring

372
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,960
or about a week after that mystical experience,

373
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,760
he took me on an LSD trip, which was quite interesting,

374
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,920
which also helped in the ultimate breakthrough

375
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,520
one needs to understand Berkson.

376
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,240
Because Berkson, as we're going to point out,

377
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,760
is very zen, very mystical.

378
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,280
And people that are not zen and not mystical

379
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,560
and don't have this intuition,

380
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,000
I think have a very hard time understanding Berkson.

381
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,280
So, yeah, so like I said,

382
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,880
the arrow, I ended up back at the University of Minnesota

383
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,880
end of fall of 1970, starting 71.

384
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,640
I'm back in graduate school in educational psychology.

385
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,160
It was really called the Cognitive Foundations of Education.

386
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,640
It's really a cognitive psychology thing.

387
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,320
Philosophy was, and ultimately,

388
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,200
computer science is going to come along.

389
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,040
Right, yeah.

390
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,160
Because that was the, 72 was the big year

391
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
that computer science swept into academics

392
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,520
into cognitive psychology.

393
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,080
And the interesting thing you and I talked about before

394
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,280
was how I hit Berkson.

395
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,360
And the reason was I found a course right away

396
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,240
with a Dr. Bart, who was into Berkson, was into Piaget.

397
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,880
And it was a discussion about,

398
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,160
or devoted to Piaget's group theory,

399
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,560
the use of mathematical groups,

400
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,560
which I think he got from Ernst Kassier,

401
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,800
and initially, the great French phenomenon,

402
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,360
or German phenomenologist philosopher.

403
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,160
And my thing was, I was going to write something

404
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,440
about the epistemology of gene Piaget.

405
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,480
This came from my one course in the seminary

406
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,120
on epistemology and my association

407
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,680
with discovery of Piaget at the end.

408
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,200
And I had no idea what I was going to do,

409
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,640
but I thought it was cool.

410
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,840
And Dr. Bart says, well, why don't you write

411
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,720
a comparison of Berkson to Piaget?

412
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,080
And I thought, oh, okay.

413
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,280
I'm thinking, who's Berkson?

414
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,520
I have no clue who Berkson, but I can do that.

415
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,560
Sure, I can do that.

416
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Oh my God, do that.

417
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,720
So I discovered, you know, you go to the library

418
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,960
and you find books on Berkson,

419
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,320
because you're never going to,

420
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,040
or you wouldn't want to read Berkson right off the bat.

421
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,520
But you find it's going to distill it for you, hope.

422
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,520
And by will and car, I found a book on Berkson.

423
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,360
And this is what I ran across right off the bat

424
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,360
in about three or four pages in the car.

425
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,480
This statement by Berkson,

426
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,600
questions related to subject to an object,

427
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,120
do the distinction in the union,

428
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,400
what's it put in terms of time rather than a space?

429
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,920
And I thought, whoa, that's cool, subject to an object.

430
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,280
I have no clue what that thing meant.

431
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,640
I mean, what is that?

432
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,240
That's why I have the Zen picture there.

433
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,320
It's a column.

434
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,360
Yeah.

435
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,160
It's like, what is the sound of one hand flapping?

436
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,280
Who is it that sees?

437
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,120
Okay.

438
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,800
It's a coin that you have to contemplate.

439
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,120
Well, I didn't know what that meant,

440
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,280
but that was enough to tell me

441
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,200
that something cool is going on.

442
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,560
Do you mind, Steve,

443
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,800
if we quickly just give folks a context

444
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,080
as to when Berkson lived, what is-

445
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Oh, yeah.

446
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,200
I mean, I know, but you're the expert, so.

447
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,320
Well, of course, I forgot when he was born right after that.

448
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,400
Yeah.

449
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,000
I mean, yeah, mid-1800s, late-1800s.

450
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,840
Yeah.

451
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,840
Well, he's writing his thesis in 1889, okay?

452
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,360
His thesis was time and free will.

453
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,160
That was the title of it, 1889.

454
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,000
So he's probably about 20,

455
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,920
we can probably go back to about 1879

456
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,320
or something like that when he was roughly born.

457
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,120
So all seems so much for my Berkson expertise

458
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,960
right off the bat, down the drain.

459
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
But he was obviously French.

460
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,040
He was quite brilliant.

461
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,200
I mean, he was extremely diplomatic.

462
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,200
His classmates said he could destroy your theory

463
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
in a matter of a few sentences,

464
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,200
but he did it very diplomatic and nicely.

465
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,120
He won at 18 a very prestigious French prize in mathematics.

466
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,200
And he greatly then disappointed his mathematics professor

467
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,200
because he decided he was gonna go into philosophy.

468
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,200
And that professor said, well, you could have been a politician.

469
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
I just can be a philosopher.

470
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,200
And I'm pointing this out because there's a great mythology

471
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
about Berkson ultimate

472
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
because he ultimately gets in a big argument

473
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
with Einstein over relativity.

474
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
And I think he beat the heck out of Einstein

475
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,200
in terms of proper interpretation of relativity.

476
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,200
That's another story we may not even get into.

477
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,200
But the myth is that he did really understand mathematics.

478
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
And even Einstein ultimately admitted,

479
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,200
well, yes, Berkson totally understands the theory of relativity,

480
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,200
but believe me, when you look at Berkson's book on relativity,

481
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,200
he just dismantles, disdisex,

482
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,200
and reconstructs the whole theory mathematically.

483
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,200
And obviously, effortlessly.

484
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Their famous debate, Berkson and Einstein

485
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,200
had a famous debate in 1922, I believe.

486
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,200
And as a true, I mean, the story is the myth, perhaps,

487
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
is that that debate prevented Einstein

488
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
from winning the Nobel Prize that year.

489
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Is that true?

490
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Yes, right.

491
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
And there's a whole book on it,

492
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
and I'm gonna join a canalist

493
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
called The Philosopher and the Physicist,

494
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
which is the great title,

495
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
going through the debate.

496
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Unfortunately, she completely misses the actual essence

497
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,200
of the debate, which is a problem.

498
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,200
And Berkson, one of my pieces of research,

499
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
this person claimed that Berkson

500
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
was far more famous than Einstein

501
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
in the first two decades of the 20th century,

502
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,200
which is kind of mind-boggling to think of now.

503
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Right, because what happened is,

504
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,200
he published his time in free will,

505
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,200
which was taking the problem of free will

506
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
in the context of the nature of time,

507
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,200
which still is ignored today completely.

508
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,200
You can read Dennett, and A, you don't see Berkson mentioned,

509
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
B, you don't see time mentioned,

510
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
you know, Dennett on free will, then Dennett.

511
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,200
And in fact, almost all of the current discussions

512
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,200
on free will, he follows it up.

513
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:53,200
He spends five years studying memory difficulties,

514
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,200
aphasias, amnesias, and lesions to the brain,

515
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
and comes out with this book,

516
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,200
I got a picture of their matter in memory of 1896,

517
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
because his whole problem was,

518
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,200
does the brain actually store experience?

519
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Does it store that coffee cup out there in front of my guy there

520
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,200
with the stirring spoon, that experience of the coffee stir?

521
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Is that stored in the brain?

522
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,200
And his point was, the whole theory of consciousness

523
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
rests on this question,

524
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
is experience stored in the brain?

525
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,200
And again, you won't find that question ever mentioned anywhere,

526
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,200
not by charmers, not by straws,

527
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,200
and not by any of the people that are the supposed great theorists

528
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
of consciousness nowadays,

529
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
just simply not understood.

530
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,200
The bottom line, his analysis of the subject of all the phenomena

531
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
of memory research at the time,

532
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
was that it couldn't be stored in the brain,

533
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,200
that you did not have to have that hypothesis,

534
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,200
which is now a dogma, that memory is stored in the brain.

535
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,200
In fact, all that could be happening is that the brain,

536
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,200
when it's damaged, simply doesn't,

537
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,200
let's say, form the proper neural patterns

538
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,200
or modulating wave patterns, I'll call it,

539
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,200
that allow the memory to be re-instantiated,

540
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:30,200
the original experience, but not from within the brain itself.

541
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,200
So that's another whole question we ultimately,

542
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
probably actually quite won't get into,

543
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
but we'll see part of it.

544
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,200
And then, in 1907,

545
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,200
he followed up with a book called Creative Evolution,

546
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,200
which was a tour de force on the problem of evolution,

547
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
the problem of Darwinian evolution.

548
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,200
He was not a fan of Darwinian evolution.

549
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,200
And really, the whole nature of the evolution of the universe.

550
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,200
I mean, Tegard Deschardin,

551
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
who actually, I was reading at the time,

552
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
my mystical experience, I should say,

553
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,200
was the great Catholic Jesuit,

554
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,200
kind of a mystic theorist,

555
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,200
was inspired by Berks' work, Creative Evolution.

556
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,200
And he was launched it by that point into quite a bit of fame,

557
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,200
and famed them, to the point where the ladies of Paris

558
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,200
wanted to attend his lectures,

559
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,200
and there was discussions of whether you'd hold the lectures

560
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
in the Paris Opera Hall,

561
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,200
because the attendance was so great.

562
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Yeah, he was a local celebrity in Paris, right?

563
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,200
This, of course, also generated its own self-resistance,

564
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:58,200
because now you had other academics that were like Bruch and Russell

565
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,200
that were extremely upset.

566
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Should we say, we won't use the word jealous,

567
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,200
but they didn't like this, too much popularity.

568
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
And Bruchton took a lot of shots.

569
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,200
The bottom line to not make us too long is that his popularity,

570
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,200
well, again, he really emerged back in 1922, like you noted,

571
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,200
because he had, being a great theorist of time that he was,

572
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,200
his ears pricked up when he discovered that Paul Langevan

573
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,200
had announced what's called a twin paradox,

574
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,200
do you remember where the twin leaves the earth and the rocket

575
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,200
comes back and he's ageless in his brother?

576
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,200
And Bruchton thought that was a complete misuse of relativity.

577
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
It destroyed the logical consistency of relativity.

578
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,200
Hence, he began his arguments and got, ultimately,

579
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Scott Einstein wrote the book Duration and Simultaneity.

580
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:02,200
And that sort of began this period.

581
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
He was actually working with Einstein,

582
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,200
the League of Nations at the time, too.

583
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,200
So he was somewhat prominent in politics at the time,

584
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,200
but that was beginning of his gradual descent into obscurity

585
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,200
and wading into wings, as I like to know,

586
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,200
was behaviorism, skin area and behaviorism,

587
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
the analytical philosophy,

588
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,200
which is very antithetical to Bruchton's continental philosophy.

589
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,200
And he ended up dying of pneumonia after standing in the line

590
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,200
for a long time in Paris, 1941,

591
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,200
occupied by the Germans, by the Nazis.

592
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
He had caught pneumonia.

593
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,200
He was going to declare himself a Jew publicly as the Nazis were demanding.

594
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,200
So he died of pneumonia and that was the end of Mr. Bruchton.

595
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,200
And as I said, he sort of then went into obscurity.

596
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,200
And so that's him.

597
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,200
So meanwhile, someone like me comes along and discovers this quote.

598
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
We were sitting right here.

599
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Yeah, this quote, back to the quote.

600
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,200
Yeah, thank you for the context.

601
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
It's helpful.

602
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Okay.

603
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,200
So that began my reading of that book Matter of Memory.

604
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,200
I mean, I must have read it a dozen times.

605
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,200
In backwards, forwards, from the middle, outwards, every direction,

606
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,200
because when you hit Matter of Memory,

607
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
you really don't know what's going on.

608
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,200
And the book was considered, especially its first chapter,

609
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,200
obscure even by his adherents,

610
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:52,200
by Bruchton's adherents, and we'll see why.

611
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,200
So I'm in Minnesota.

612
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,200
And what's about to happen in Minnesota is the computer model of

613
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,200
mine is going to sweep in in 1972.

614
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,200
The whole whole notion of the brain is a computer.

615
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,200
This, my advisor in the education psychology side was very enamored

616
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,200
of a book by Newell and Simon called General Problem Solving,

617
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Human Problem Solving, which went through their book with their model

618
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,200
of a computer model, the general problem solver,

619
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,200
which tried to simulate solving problems the way humans do,

620
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,200
like cryptorhythmic problems, like Donald plus Gerald equal Robert,

621
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,200
you know, which we have to sign numbers to each letter,

622
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,200
like Donald and Gerald, Robert, or chess.

623
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,200
There's another one of the things in their books.

624
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,200
And so that swept in.

625
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,200
And the other side of the story I was in related to was

626
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,200
on a pure psychology side was

627
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,200
what eventually became my thesis advisor, Dr. Bob Shaw.

628
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,200
And let me, I think that's where we're having subject to an object here.

629
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,200
I forgot to put that.

630
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Oh, I have to remember my source of my thing.

631
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:22,200
So let's, let's, before I go to Shaw, let's go to this point in Berkson.

632
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Here's another of the colons.

633
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
This is in chapter one of that book.

634
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
So, but isn't that up?

635
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Berkson is talking about how do we see the coffee cup out there?

636
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:40,200
And in space extended out there on the table.

637
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
How do we see that coffee cup?

638
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Is there a photograph of the coffee cup in the brain?

639
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,200
And he says, well, obviously, is it obvious the photograph?

640
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,200
He said, I got to keep my things in order here.

641
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:00,200
But neuroscience at the time was developed enough to know that there was no coffee image in the brain.

642
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,200
You couldn't, you weren't going to find an image of the coffee cup in the brain,

643
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,200
which is why I have the little red circle there with the line through it.

644
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,200
So he says, excuse me, but isn't that obvious?

645
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:18,200
The photograph, if the photograph there be is already taken already developed in the very heart of things.

646
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
And at all points in space.

647
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,200
No metaphysics, no physics can escape this conclusion.

648
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Build up the universe with atoms.

649
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Each is subject to the action, variable and quantity and quality according to the distance.

650
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
Exerted and done by all material atoms.

651
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Exerted on it by all material atoms.

652
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
Bring in Faraday, centers of force.

653
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,200
The lines of force submitted in every direction from every center.

654
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,200
Bring to bear upon each the influence of the whole material world.

655
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Call up the Laditsian monads.

656
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
Each is the mirror of the universe.

657
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,200
So that is key to his answer to how we see the coffee cup.

658
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
But you can see it's yet another koan.

659
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:59,200
It's koan number two along with subject to an object in terms of time.

660
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,200
So I have no idea what that meant when I read it.

661
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,200
He went on, he was actually before this, he was talking about the nature of the universe.

662
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Take any object, for example, like the coffee cup there.

663
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Any object is obliged to transmit the whole of what it receives,

664
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,200
to oppose every action with an equal and contrary reaction.

665
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,200
To be in short, really the road by which pass in every direction and modifications

666
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,200
or what can be termed real actions.

667
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,200
It's visualized waves,

668
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,200
propagated throughout the immensity of the entire universe.

669
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Okay.

670
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,200
So he says, so only if we consider any other place in the universe,

671
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,200
we can regard the action of all matter is passing through it without resistance and without loss.

672
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,200
And the photograph of the whole is translucent.

673
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,200
Here is wanting behind the plate the black screen on which the image could be shown.

674
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,200
Our zones of indetermination, there is talk about organisms,

675
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,200
centers of free action that can act upon the world,

676
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,200
play in some sort the part of that screen.

677
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,200
They add nothing to what is there, the effect merely this.

678
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,200
The real action, those waves passing through the coffee cup that

679
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:20,200
the coffee cup is reflecting and sending back to all the other points in the universe.

680
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,200
They affect merely this, the real action passes through those waves,

681
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,200
and the virtual action remains.

682
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
Okay.

683
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,200
So if anyone here listening knows what this means already, let me know.

684
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Unless you've picked up what I've said, but you can see that this is pretty much co-on like,

685
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
very difficult to understand what's going on.

686
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,200
And he's talking about the problem of receiving the coffee cup,

687
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
seeing that coffee cup out there on the kitchen table,

688
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,200
which is really the hard problem.

689
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
And we'll go back to that.

690
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
That's the hard problem.

691
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,200
Always see the coffee cup out there with this qualia.

692
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Okay.

693
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Well, this is where I was going.

694
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,200
My other advisor, who eventually my thesis advisor was Bob Shaw, the bottom there,

695
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Robert E. Shaw.

696
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,200
Now, he was a student of Gibson at Cornell for a couple of years.

697
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Gibson topped the picture, J.J. Gibson.

698
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,200
There we have his dates, 1940, 1974, 1979.

699
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,200
To me, he was the greatest theorist of perception that walked the planet.

700
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,200
Maybe next to Bergson, but actually pure theorist of perception on philosopher.

701
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,200
But he was very philosophical too.

702
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:50,200
He founded the subject of, what we call the subject of ecological psychology,

703
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:55,200
which is, there's now a journal today, the Journal of Ecological Psychology.

704
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,200
It's a whole field or subfield in the study of perception.

705
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:09,200
And Shaw, my advisor there, was the founder of that journal, the Journal of Ecological Psychology.

706
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
He obviously knew Gibson.

707
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
He studied with Gibson at Cornell for a couple of years.

708
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Why he was studying abstract automata theory at Cornell.

709
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Abstract automata theory is, shall we say, another level of abstraction above computer science.

710
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,200
It's the abstract logical description of finite state machines.

711
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:38,200
And Bob was a brilliant guy, as we'll see.

712
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,200
I think it'll become through really evident.

713
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Gibson, if I may, had just such quick, one of Gibson's big ideas was Affordance theory, right?

714
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Affordance is a big thing, yes.

715
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,200
We see what is the usefulness of the objects.

716
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
We see that kind of space.

717
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,200
It reminds me quite a bit of, seems analogous to, although I'm sure there's differences,

718
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:07,200
between Donald Hoffman's theories around sort of our fitness.

719
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,200
We see the world in terms of one of the most fit for us as organisms, rather than what's actually there.

720
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,200
But I know you've done a video on Hoffman.

721
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:25,200
We're going to blow Hoffman away here, but let me go back just for one thick thing here.

722
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Sure, sure.

723
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
But we won't do it here.

724
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
No, I just thought it looked quick to answer.

725
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Just say, let's go back to, look at the very bottom line, okay?

726
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,200
Virtual action.

727
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,200
That's affordances, as we'll see.

728
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Just a little preview.

729
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,200
Yeah, I was going to ask you, I know virtual action, there's a few terms that you use that,

730
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:56,200
when we get to them, I am going to stop and say, let's really define this and get this down.

731
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,200
So virtual action is essentially affordances.

732
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,200
Okay.

733
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,200
Well, yes, but it's worse than that, so we're going to see.

734
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,200
We have to take it in a holographic context, so back to where I was.

735
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Okay, so, let's see what my next slide is.

736
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Okay, so we're going to get there.

737
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:24,200
So, in 1972, like I said, this computer model swept in.

738
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:33,200
I attended a seminar with Shaw, and he went through Feigenbaum's book on computers and thought.

739
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:48,200
And Shaw simply destroyed the whole notion that the computer model of mine had anything to do with reality back then, already in 1972.

740
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Around that time, also, Prebum, Carl Prebum, I don't have a picture of here,

741
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:03,200
published his book called Languages in the Brain, where he argued that the brain was a hologram.

742
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,200
And that accounted for how the brain stored memory.

743
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:24,200
I was trying to buttress the findings of Carl Lashley, where Lashley had tried to destroy memories in the brain and couldn't do it, and decided that, which basically,

744
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:32,200
what Lashley was doing, he was also destroying anything that would be considered neural nets today, but that's another question.

745
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:40,200
And Lashley decided that memories won't be somehow very distributed, and holography, as we'll see, is the essence of distribution.

746
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:50,200
And Carl was trying to argue that, and he had a very minor theory of perception at the time, in Languages in the Brain, how we see that coffee cup out there,

747
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:57,200
that maybe the whole holography had something to do with that, but it was a real coherent theory.

748
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:12,200
But Shaw had invited Prebum to come to a conference, and talk at a conference at the University of Minnesota, and pretty obviously the two had discussions.

749
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:26,200
And that, shall we say the next day that Prebum was there, Shaw was giving his seminar, and he started talking about holography.

750
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:34,200
And so we're going to quickly talk about holography, the construction of a hologram.

751
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:45,200
And so in the construction of a hologram, we've got the hologram plate there, and we've got a form of laser light to the left.

752
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,200
That would be a laser, a coherent frequency laser.

753
00:42:48,200 --> 00:43:02,200
And so the waves from that laser are hitting the hologram plate, and then, I don't have a picture there, but normally some of those waves are bounced off of half-mirror to the object or the scene,

754
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,200
the pyramid or the ball there.

755
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:12,200
So you would have some waves bouncing off the ball in the pyramid and bouncing back toward the plate.

756
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,200
So that's called the object wave, as I've got labeled there.

757
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:25,200
So the hologram is the interference pattern of these two waves, the reference wave and the object wave.

758
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:39,200
And I was going to put a nice picture of an interference pattern there, and I forgot, but it looks, it's just a jumble of lines that look nothing like the pyramid and the ball.

759
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
But that's our hologram.

760
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:49,200
It's a jumble of lines, the interference, the recording of the interference pattern of those two waves.

761
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:55,200
And now, the reconstruction process is interesting.

762
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:10,200
If I beam a wave of light, a coherent wave of the same frequency as the original wave, of the original reference wave, that's now called the reconstructive wave, the reconstructing waves that are just labeled at frequency one.

763
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,200
We're beaming that back through the hologram plate.

764
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:27,200
And what is specified is the source of this original object wave front, namely the pyramid and the ball.

765
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:36,200
So notice, that's called the virtual image, virtual action, but now virtual image.

766
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,200
That's the virtual image, and you can move your head around.

767
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,200
Notice the viewer up there.

768
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:57,200
He can sort of, he's seeing the behind the plate as it were out in space, the image of the pyramid and ball, and he can move his head around and sort of see the side of the pyramid and the side of the balls.

769
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,200
It's a 3D image, so to speak.

770
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,200
So that's the reconstruction process.

771
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,200
Let me see what my next slide is.

772
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:15,200
Now, one can store multiple wave fronts on a hologram.

773
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:28,200
So on the left there, I've got the frequency one case, a reference wave of frequency one being used to store the pyramid and the ball interference pattern.

774
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:38,200
And I can change my reference wave frequency, and therefore my reconstructive wave frequency, frequency two, store an image of the of a cop.

775
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:45,200
And, and that that way from also interference wave interference patterns also on a plate.

776
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:57,200
And so if I modulate the reconstructive way from frequency frequency one, where I'm specifying the pyramid ball to frequency two, I'm specifying now the cop.

777
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,200
I can modulate it back to frequency one and see the ball again.

778
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,200
So I can modulate the reconstructive wave.

779
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,200
Okay, so far so good.

780
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,200
I'm in the footsteps of Shaw here.

781
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:26,200
So then what Shaw says is, well, rather than looking at the brain as being the hologram, what if we look at the universe as being the hologram, the universe is the holographic field.

782
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:34,200
In other words, as he said, the hologram is not in the head, the head is in the hologram.

783
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:50,200
And the brain is acting or is creating the reconstructive wave, passing through the holographic field and specifying a source within the field, the coffee cup stirring spoon the table.

784
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,200
Okay.

785
00:46:52,200 --> 00:47:01,200
So he's flipping pre Brahms thesis around completely.

786
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:08,200
And that's when I realized what Berkson's talking about.

787
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:13,200
But isn't that obvious that the photograph, I got to move your picture.

788
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,200
That's okay.

789
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:23,200
This is that obvious that the photograph of the photograph there be is already taken already developed in the very heart of things.

790
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,200
And at all points in space.

791
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:39,200
What Berkson was describing in that obscure chapter one was that the universal field of matter field of matter is a holographic field.

792
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:46,200
Each point and that that's a little slide I forgot to do.

793
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:56,200
Because each point in that field is is the reflection of has the information for all other points in the field.

794
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:08,200
If I go back to a slide here, for example, if you look at the cup.

795
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,200
Okay.

796
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,200
Visualize it as a set of points.

797
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,200
Okay.

798
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:19,200
Where each point is giving rise to a a spherical wave.

799
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,200
Okay.

800
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,200
This is in the.

801
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,200
Let me go back one more.

802
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,200
I mean, it's related to what you say.

803
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:33,200
There's clearly a relation to quantum mechanics here where, you know, waves and particles, etc.

804
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,200
I'm sure.

805
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,200
I wouldn't.

806
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,200
I wouldn't go into the quantum mechanics of black hole and that's it.

807
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,200
Okay.

808
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,200
Okay.

809
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,200
But here.

810
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,200
So the cup go back to the ball each.

811
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,200
This is we're constructing a hologram.

812
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,200
Okay.

813
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:56,200
Each point on the ball can be considered as giving rise to a little spherical wave that goes out toward that plate.

814
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,200
All right.

815
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,200
And covers the entire plate.

816
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,200
Okay.

817
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:08,200
So, so the information for any one point in that ball covers the entire plate plate.

818
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:24,200
But conversely, then at when you realize a whole set of points of that ball covering that plate, then that at any point in the plate is the information for the entire ball.

819
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,200
Okay.

820
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:31,200
So one one point, the spherical wave from one point covers the entire plate.

821
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:42,200
But now when you see there's a whole set of spherical waves covering the entire plate realize that any point the plate is the information for the whole ball and the pyramid.

822
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:54,200
So, so the whole of graphic principles basically that in a hologram at any point is the information for the whole object.

823
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:59,200
The whole, the whole scene, the whole cup, the whole ball, the whole plate.

824
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,200
So that's back to this.

825
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:17,200
We were the photograph is already taken already developed a very hard of things in all points and all points in space at every point in space is the information for the whole.

826
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:23,200
So we don't need a photograph and then you've got this next quote.

827
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:30,200
Our zones of indetermination in organisms play in some sort the part of that screen they had nothing that what is there.

828
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:36,200
The effect merely this the real action passes through the virtual action remains.

829
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:49,200
So, remember in the previous picture, you know, you're seeing the virtual image, the virtual image of the cup, or the.

830
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,200
So that's the virtual action remaining.

831
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,200
So, what would be the real action?

832
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:02,200
Well, the real actions going back to the other quote is every all those.

833
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:23,200
The remember Berks and talk about the whole this is massive set of real actions were that if you look at the my little picture there of all the all of the lines and waves in my my little symbol symbol of the universe as a holographic field.

834
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,200
We're only picking out that set of real actions.

835
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:34,200
Those waves that are interesting to us that is that actually relate to the body's capability for action.

836
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:42,200
Okay, so hence why why it's virtual action you're seeing how you can act.

837
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,200
You're seeing the possibility of action.

838
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:49,200
I can act on that cup I can act on that on that table.

839
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,200
I see this one again, or it's enough.

840
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,200
In other words, the cup presents affordances.

841
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,200
Sure, the virtual action and the real action would be everything else that we don't perceive.

842
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,200
Yes.

843
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,200
Yes, we're embedded in the field of real actions.

844
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:11,200
What we're seeing is the virtual is the virtual action that subset of the real actions.

845
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:18,200
That the brain is in the body of picking out is interesting to it that relate to its capability of action.

846
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:24,200
When you upgrade Berks into remember the holographic model.

847
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:32,200
The notion of a hologram wasn't discovered until 1947 by Gabor.

848
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,200
Matter of memory is 1896.

849
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,200
That's why no one understood it.

850
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,200
It didn't have this physical model there to get it.

851
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,200
Even when I tell people about it now they still get it.

852
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,200
That's another question.

853
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:52,200
But when you upgrade Berks and then into the holographic language, you'd be taking these quotes.

854
00:52:52,200 --> 00:53:05,200
You'd be saying, well, the universe is a holographic field and the brain is a reconstructive way specific to a virtual image within that field, the coffee cup and stirring spoon.

855
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:13,200
As we'll see, it's a modulated reconstructive way because coffee stirring itself is very dynamic.

856
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,200
All these events are dynamic.

857
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:21,200
The brain is constantly being modulated, dynamically transforming as we'll see.

858
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,200
Can you define what modulation is?

859
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:31,200
Well, that was back to the picture where we simply were changing from frequency 1 to frequency 2 to frequency 3.

860
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:38,200
We're modulating a wave to a different frequency.

861
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,200
But as I understand...

862
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,200
Like frequency modulation.

863
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:51,200
Sure, so forgive my ignorance, but I think when I think of modulation and let's try to be on the same page,

864
00:53:51,200 --> 00:54:03,200
I understand it as a signal that's sent to help the transmission of information or help...

865
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:09,200
See, this is where the limits of my understanding kind of go, but does that make sense?

866
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,200
It's like sending another signal through a signal.

867
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,200
Right, but you simply...

868
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:25,200
Even on that framework, I think you're trying to get to, you're basically modulating the wave into a certain pattern or form.

869
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,200
So that it carries my...

870
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:32,200
You modulate that wave, so it carries my voice pattern, my voice frequency.

871
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:37,200
So that it's reflective of my voice up and down.

872
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,200
It's a more complex modulation.

873
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:45,200
In fact, this is going to be, and ultimately this is going to be a very complex form of modulation that we're talking about here.

874
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:54,200
But the simplest form is you're simply changing from frequency 1 to frequency 2 to frequency 3 and back to frequency 2.

875
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,200
Simply modulating that wave to the different frequencies.

876
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:03,200
That's the simplest form of it.

877
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:10,200
So, well, I got to see where I'm going here.

878
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:19,200
So, as I was saying, so the brain is in this framework is a modulated reconstructive wave.

879
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,200
Put the brain here, and it's specific to specifying the cup.

880
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,200
Now that cup is right where it says it is.

881
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:34,200
Now here's another, I have in the picture, modulation here, modulated reconstructive wave.

882
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:42,200
Let me move from frequency 2 to the cup, frequency 3, the wine glass, frequency 1.

883
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,200
Again, changing that.

884
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,200
What would be the purpose of changing the frequencies?

885
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:56,200
Well, if you remember, each of those objects was stored with a specific reference wave of the same frequency.

886
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:02,200
That cup, that cube was stored with a reference wave of frequency 1.

887
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:06,200
So the interference pattern is kind of related to frequency 1.

888
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,200
It's a function of frequency 1.

889
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,200
The cup was frequency 2.

890
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:22,200
And the interference pattern, the way the waves all meshes a function of that frequency 2 and the object wave from...

891
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,200
Sure.

892
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:33,200
So, if you could, in our moment to moment existence, how many frequency waves are we talking about in terms of what we can perceive?

893
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:40,200
Are we talking like an astronomically large number?

894
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:48,200
Well, what we're going to see here is that this is a...

895
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:58,200
Talking in terms of a simple frequency like this is a way to get the mind going into how this process works, how the holographic specification process works.

896
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:05,200
But when you're talking the brain and the event that's driving the brain, the name of this coffee stirring,

897
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:13,200
you're going to have an extremely complex pattern, modulation pattern, we'll call it,

898
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:21,200
where the notion that it's a simple frequency kind of fades into...

899
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,200
And you're looking at something far more complex.

900
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,200
Sure.

901
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:34,200
So, hang on, you'll see that in a second when we get there with a little more in Gibson, what has to be brought in.

902
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:40,200
So, as I'm saying, it's specific to a specifying this wave.

903
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:45,200
The brain is now specifying the cup right where it says it is in the external field.

904
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,200
It's not right where it says it is.

905
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:54,200
Common sense says to us when I'm looking at my coffee cup out here in the desk, that's where it is.

906
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,200
It's not constructing an image.

907
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:05,200
No, it's not an image inside the brain or in some mental space or perceptual space somewhere.

908
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,200
Like you'll get theorists talking about like Yoshabak will say, well, it's in a perceptual space.

909
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:14,200
Well, what's the perceptual space?

910
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:18,200
So, this is what's called direct perception.

911
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:27,200
That is, indirect perception would be the picture up there where the image of the cup is in the cloud.

912
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,200
Shall we say in the mental space or in the brain somehow.

913
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:40,200
And somehow that corresponds to the world out there in some magical way.

914
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,200
Direct perception says, no, you're directly perceived.

915
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Seeing the cup right where it says it is external in the field.

916
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,200
We're not constructing an image in the brain.

917
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,200
Now, I'm saying, you know, when driving, here we're going to do your question.

918
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,200
What's really driving the modulations?

919
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,200
What I termed the invariant structure of the event.

920
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:06,200
We'll talk about that where this event is extremely complex.

921
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:16,200
It's got the velocity flow fields and the swirling of the liquid, the abodic ratios, which are when you're stirring it,

922
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:21,200
energy of oscillation, the frequency of oscillation ratio to that,

923
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:29,200
inertial tensors, which have the momentum of the spoon, the various forced momentum of the spoon,

924
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:35,200
acoustical invariance, like the clinking of the spoon, which is always coordinate with the motion of the spoon, et cetera.

925
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,200
So we're going to go into that because that's going to take us into Gibson.

926
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:46,200
But every such event has such a structure and that's driving the brain.

927
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,200
We'll get into that.

928
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:58,200
And it's all being specified at a scale of time because that brain has chemical velocities.

929
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:04,200
And this is a neural dynamics there, underlying which are chemical velocities,

930
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:08,200
which can be expressed in the Arrhenius eclage, and it can be modulated too.

931
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,200
It can be changed.

932
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:16,200
You can drop a catalyst, which lets the reactions occur more quickly with not as much energy,

933
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,200
raise the whole chemical velocities.

934
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:22,200
So the brain is, we're seeing the world specified at a normal scale.

935
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:27,200
Normally the buzzing fly, 200 wing beats per second.

936
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:34,200
If you raise the energy state of the brain, increase the chemical velocities,

937
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:38,200
it could be specified as a heroin-like fly, barely flapping its wings,

938
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:45,200
or even raising it still higher, just a cloud of electrons.

939
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:53,200
So we have to break what I like to call the scale policy, that the world just exists at this scale.

940
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,200
It does not.

941
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:59,200
There's multiple scales, and the brain is specifying a specific scale.

942
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:09,200
So this wave is supporting, it's a reconstructive wave, and specific to a scale of time.

943
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:15,200
So with a fair way to, I'm just trying to perhaps simplify it for the audience,

944
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:23,200
there's waves, there's a holographic field made up of waves out in the world.

945
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:30,200
There's waves in my brain, and the waves in my brain are connecting with the waves out in the world.

946
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,200
One could look at it that way.

947
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,200
Okay, simplify.

948
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,200
I mean, that's a really...

949
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,200
But, you know, because there's levels of description, you can see it as waves,

950
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,200
but now, notice I just described, okay, the copycups is set of waves,

951
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:50,200
but also at another level, and it shows you a scale, it's all these invariance logs.

952
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:58,200
Okay, the swirling flow field, the adiabatic ratio of energy or oscillation of frequency as I stir.

953
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,200
So, what I had pictured there...

954
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:06,200
Do you mind just defining invariance for the audience?

955
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,200
We're going to see it in a second.

956
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,200
Oh, great.

957
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,200
Awesome.

958
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,200
Thank you.

959
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:15,200
We're going there, because this is why I have the picture of Gibson there,

960
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,200
and the fact that Shaw was a student of Gibson.

961
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:31,200
Because Gibson was the pioneer in describing the importance of invariance laws in the world.

962
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:41,200
And he saw this information as being part and parcel of the direct specification of the coffee cup out there.

963
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,200
So, here's an example.

964
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,200
Here's an example.

965
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,200
You have what's called a texture gradient.

966
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:53,200
And the texture gradient is a whole pile of texture units,

967
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:58,200
my little circles of the texture units, and they recede in the distance.

968
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,200
The horizontal, there's a little mathematical law.

969
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:09,200
The horizontal distance between each little unit is inversely proportional to the distance from the observer.

970
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,200
S is proportional to 1 over D.

971
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:18,200
And then the vertical separation going back, notice they get completely, completely compressed.

972
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:24,200
That separation is special about the law, 1 over D squared.

973
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:31,200
S, the separation is proportional to 1 over the distance squared from the observer.

974
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,200
So, that's an interesting little thing.

975
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:38,200
Does that have to do with our field of vision?

976
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,200
Or is this just how...

977
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,200
Sorry, if you could go back a step.

978
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,200
Yeah, because I find this very interesting that there's different laws for horizontal versus vertical.

979
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:55,200
The point I forgot to mention, these fields are ubiquitous.

980
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:05,200
These are gravel, this is your gravel driveway, your field of grass, your beach sands, etc.

981
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:13,200
If I turn it upside down, it becomes the cloud ceiling stretching off in the distance to the back.

982
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:19,200
If I turn it on angles like this, it becomes the walls receding.

983
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:33,200
What's being said here is this is an inherent intrinsic mathematical law within these fields, these texture gradients.

984
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:49,200
And it becomes useful because if I move across this gradient, there's an invariance law relative to those texture rows that specify that the cup stays the constant size.

985
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,200
Notice there's including roughly four texture rows.

986
01:04:53,200 --> 01:05:01,200
If I move it forward, it's now including two texture rows, but its height is doubling.

987
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:07,200
So as the height doubles, the number of texture rows is halved.

988
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:17,200
And again, you've got this invariance law where n is the number of rows, s is the height of the cup, or s times n equal k is always a constant.

989
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:32,200
And so this would be an example of an invariance law where there's this invariant ratio of size to the number of texture rows included as I move the cup back and forth across this gradient,

990
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:39,200
which is helping specify the role as stable when I move my cup back and forth.

991
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:51,200
The size of the cup does not change, even though the size is growing under wet retina as I move the cup back and forth toward me.

992
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:57,200
This ratio is constant, and so I don't perceive the cup as changing size.

993
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:03,200
I forgot to say two texture rows included with height is doubling.

994
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,200
Here's another one.

995
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:11,200
This is an optical flow field. So we're putting this whole gradient in motion.

996
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:22,200
Now it's a gradient of velocity vectors where, again, the value of each vector is proportional to one over the distance squared, again, the distance from the observer.

997
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:32,200
So the fastest moving vectors are closest to you if I'm standing far away at the border versus optical flow field.

998
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:37,200
The slowest moving vectors are furthest away near the mountains.

999
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,200
There's a good example as I'm driving along, velocity flow fields.

1000
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:51,200
There's all kinds of interesting little things defined over these flow fields, like the tau ratio, which I've got specified there.

1001
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,200
Don't ask me to translate what it means.

1002
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:58,200
You can see it involves the velocity over time.

1003
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:10,200
But this ratio has been shown to be useful for things like coming in for landing because it specifies the severity of impact.

1004
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:18,200
If the tau value is too great that I'm coming up too fast on that flow field is too fast, I'm going to crash.

1005
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:27,200
As a bird coming into land, I'm using this tau value to modulate my wings so that I land nice and softly.

1006
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:33,200
Or as a pilot, I land nice and softly on the runway.

1007
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:44,200
So here we're starting to get a picture of the information in the light and dynamically transforming optical field that the brain is modulating.

1008
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:48,200
The brain is getting into the action systems.

1009
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:57,200
Those ratios are being used to specify virtual action, how I can act on the world.

1010
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:05,200
Here's an example of what's called grasping tau.

1011
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:12,200
As I'm moving the cup back and forth for modulating how I grasp the cup.

1012
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:21,200
Again, optical information is getting into the action systems to modulate and specify how I can act.

1013
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:25,200
Or affordances.

1014
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:33,200
If we get more dynamic, I like to do what I call the Gibsonian cube.

1015
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:40,200
If you were rotating a cube, you'd have a partition set of these flow fields.

1016
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,200
The top would be a radial flow field.

1017
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:53,200
As the right side moves toward you, the cube is rotating the opposite direction up there in the corner.

1018
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:58,200
If the side is rotating toward you, it's an expanding flow field.

1019
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:03,200
Directly presented to you, it's just a non-expanding or contracting flow field.

1020
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:11,200
As it rotates away from you, it's a contracting flow field.

1021
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:22,200
The edges and the static features of the cube are really simply sharp discontinuities at the junctures of these flows.

1022
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:33,200
If you think they're not, well, here's an interesting little experiment or demonstration that Shaw discussed.

1023
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:41,200
I've got a rotating cube, a wire edged, and it's got a symmetry period of four.

1024
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:45,200
It carries itself into a symmetry period.

1025
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,200
It carries itself onto itself every 90 degrees.

1026
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:52,200
The cube maps right back onto itself every 90 degree turn.

1027
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,200
It looks like the same thing again.

1028
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,200
It's got a symmetry period of four.

1029
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,200
You'll do that four times.

1030
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:05,200
If I strobe the cube at an interval multiple of that symmetry period, four, eight, twelve times per revolution,

1031
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:09,200
I'll get a rigid cube rotating.

1032
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,200
I've got a strobe there.

1033
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,200
It'll still look like a rigid cube.

1034
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,200
Here's my little picture here.

1035
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:23,200
I've got a symmetry period of four, sort of saying the same thing.

1036
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,200
In phase, four, eight, twelve.

1037
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:29,200
Out of phase, this would be out of phase strobe, five, nine, thirteen.

1038
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,200
It's no longer an integral multiple.

1039
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:37,200
Well, if I do the non-intergal multiple, out of phase strobe,

1040
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:43,200
it becomes a wobbly, non-rigid, plastically deforming, not a cube.

1041
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,200
Okay.

1042
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:51,200
Now, one could argue there's a constraint being violated

1043
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:59,200
that normally spatial symmetry that our nice cube carries itself into itself four times per revolution

1044
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,200
is no longer being specified.

1045
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:06,200
You expect spatial symmetry should equal a temple symmetry,

1046
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,200
but it's not when you add that out of phase cube.

1047
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:16,200
I didn't put another picture here of a rotating ellipse

1048
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:23,200
that if, again, you can decompose the edge of the ellipse

1049
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,200
into a whole pile of velocity vectors going around the ellipse,

1050
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,200
and if the ellipse rotates too quickly,

1051
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:34,200
it becomes a rigid, a non-rigid, wobbly object again.

1052
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:41,200
So the point being that these forms in the image,

1053
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:50,200
the coffee cup, the table, are very dynamic.

1054
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,200
They're dynamic forms.

1055
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,200
They're actually qualia themselves.

1056
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:02,200
That's why I said that the whole image is the problem.

1057
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,200
I think I mentioned where Chalmers kind of misled us,

1058
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,200
that the whole image is qualia.

1059
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,200
We're trying to explain the image of the external world.

1060
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,200
It's all qualia.

1061
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:16,200
Hence why we need the brain as a reconstructive wave

1062
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:21,200
specifying a portion of the holographic field.

1063
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:25,200
As we'll see, that holographic field is qualitative of itself.

1064
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:32,200
The cube, the coffee cup, is a qualitative portion

1065
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,200
of a qualitative field.

1066
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:40,200
So all of these are examples now, I think, of invariance laws.

1067
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:45,200
I think the velocity vectors in the distance,

1068
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:50,200
the height of the cup, the rows occluded, the total ratio,

1069
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:54,200
it's all information that is specifying or useful

1070
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,200
part of the specification of the environment,

1071
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,200
the external world.

1072
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:04,200
It's not Shannon's definition of information,

1073
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:08,200
nor can it be brought under Shannon's umbrella.

1074
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,200
This is Gibson's information.

1075
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:15,200
It's resolutely and adamantly ignored

1076
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:19,200
in the neural net and computer model mind.

1077
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,200
As you can see, it can't be.

1078
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,200
Why can't it be?

1079
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,200
It's obviously important.

1080
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:32,200
It's too important to ignore.

1081
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:39,200
So get put in all together, back to my coffee.

1082
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,200
It's got all these invariance laws

1083
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,200
defined over that coffee cup.

1084
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:48,200
The radial flow field, an adiabatic invariance,

1085
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,200
there's the ratio of energy of oscillation,

1086
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,200
the frequency of oscillation.

1087
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,200
I moved that spoon.

1088
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,200
And inertial tens are defined in various momentum.

1089
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,200
These are all defined over time.

1090
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:04,200
You don't find the value of the energy of oscillation

1091
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:08,200
and frequency oscillation as a static, instant, static point.

1092
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,200
We'll come back to that.

1093
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,200
Acoustical invariance, you've got the spoon

1094
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:16,200
clinking against the cup as the spoon moves and sound.

1095
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:20,200
You've got ratios relative to the extra gradients and flows.

1096
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,200
I can move that cup back and forth on the extra gradient,

1097
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,200
remember.

1098
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,200
Constancy remains the same.

1099
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,200
If I had a cubocal cup, I could be rotating my cup.

1100
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,200
And now I have that Gibsonian cube with all the flow fields

1101
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,200
defining the quote edges and vertices of the cup, et cetera.

1102
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:44,200
Grasping tau, as we noted, for grasping the cup, et cetera.

1103
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:48,200
So back to my picture.

1104
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,200
Our little coffee cup, our innocent little coffee cup,

1105
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,200
is this invariant structure.

1106
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,200
And the invariant structure is, that's what I say,

1107
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:03,200
is driving the modulation of the brain as a reconstructive way.

1108
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,200
But I think now, back to your question,

1109
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,200
well, can we really talk about quote frequency one

1110
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,200
or frequency two, really?

1111
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,200
Only in a metaphoric sense that it helps us

1112
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:17,200
understand the holographic reconstructive process.

1113
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:22,200
This is obviously very complex wave form at this point.

1114
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:28,200
If you visualize the brain dynamically changing over time,

1115
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:33,200
being driven by this structure, it's obviously

1116
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:37,200
a very complex structure that's being unfolded into the brain.

1117
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,200
And yet, ultimately, the vision is

1118
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:45,200
that it's all comprising this reconstructive way.

1119
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:52,200
And as I noted before, all models of the brain

1120
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:56,200
have to address this dynamic structure.

1121
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:01,200
Because it's obvious to the information that's specifying,

1122
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,200
it's obvious to the information that's defining the event,

1123
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,200
defining coffee stir.

1124
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:13,200
But neural nets do not and cannot, partly

1125
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,200
because they're in this completely different model

1126
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:19,200
in a different model of time.

1127
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:27,200
The neural net is simply an instantiation of a Turing machine.

1128
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:32,200
And the Turing machine is a discrete state model of time,

1129
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:37,200
or removing state 0 to state 1, et cetera, et cetera,

1130
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:41,200
removing state to state as we move that tape.

1131
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:46,200
So you've got an intrinsically different model of time

1132
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,200
in the computer model as opposed to what we're going to need

1133
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:54,200
to support this holographic field, reconstructive wave,

1134
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,200
invariant structure model.

1135
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,200
And we're going to get to that.

1136
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,200
We're going to break it out in terms of the computer model

1137
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,200
being a discrete view of time.

1138
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,200
Yes.

1139
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,200
And we're going to, we're about to launch right into that

1140
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,200
because that's another piece.

1141
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,200
Continuous, OK.

1142
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,200
Yeah.

1143
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,200
I had one more thing to say about invariance laws.

1144
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,200
It's kind of interesting.

1145
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,200
Over here, another invariance law.

1146
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:22,200
Here we have the aging of the facial profile.

1147
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:26,200
And the law specifying that aging is such.

1148
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,200
If we take a cardioid, which is like a heart shape figure there,

1149
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,200
and place it over a skull, and place the skull

1150
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:35,200
on a nice coordinate system or matrix there,

1151
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:39,200
then if we apply what's called a strain transformation, which

1152
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,200
expands that coordinate grid in all directions simultaneously,

1153
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:46,200
like stretching a rubber sheet, what you do

1154
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:52,200
is start generating an aging of that profile.

1155
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,200
I have a picture there.

1156
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:58,200
If you start with a child, as you do the strain transformation,

1157
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,200
you'll get the second picture there,

1158
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,200
and then the third.

1159
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,200
There's a whole series, obviously.

1160
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:04,200
I just picked out three.

1161
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:08,200
And you can see that we're getting an aging of that profile.

1162
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:15,200
So interesting, because this aging is normally a very slow event.

1163
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:22,200
It takes us, we perceive, we recognize that Joe aged after we,

1164
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:27,200
when we meet him 30 years later, or watch him as he grows.

1165
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:32,200
But the interesting thing is here is that the same law is going to hold

1166
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:38,200
in different space-time partitions of our relativity.

1167
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:42,200
For example, the burden, the essence of relativity,

1168
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:47,200
the real point of it, in Einstein's relativity,

1169
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:54,200
was that the same law holds in either space-time partition,

1170
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:58,200
in the moving, in the stationary system on the bottom right there,

1171
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,200
the law is D equal VT.

1172
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:05,200
In the moving system, it's D prime equal VT prime.

1173
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,200
It's the same form of law.

1174
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:09,200
It's just I've changed the distance units and the time units

1175
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:14,200
in that moving system, or what I call the moving system.

1176
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:18,200
So the same law holds in each partition D equal VT

1177
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,200
or D prime equal to VT prime.

1178
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:23,200
Invariance laws are critical in special relativity.

1179
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:27,200
That's probably the most important piece of special relativity.

1180
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:32,200
It's the importance of invariance laws.

1181
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,200
And I got to see what I say here.

1182
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:39,200
Now, if I go back and notice, I said you could raise the energy state

1183
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:42,200
of the body, increase the chemical velocity.

1184
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:47,200
So I could take that buzzing.

1185
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:53,200
And if I raise the chemical velocities, I drop in frankly LSD

1186
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,200
at the right proportion.

1187
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,200
There's a little paper on that.

1188
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,200
You're going to increase the chemical velocities,

1189
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:05,200
but you're going to slow down the specification of the event.

1190
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,200
That fly is going to go from 200 wing beats per second

1191
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:12,200
to looking like it's barely flapping its wing.

1192
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:16,200
And I got to keep moving you around.

1193
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:20,200
The slow moving wing of that heron-like fly,

1194
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,200
maybe it's a seagull, but we won't argue here.

1195
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,200
What does that mean?

1196
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:28,200
Well, it means it's got a relationship to action,

1197
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,200
the possibility of action.

1198
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:33,200
I can reach out slowly and grab the wing.

1199
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:38,200
I mean, more startlingly, let's say I raise the energy state enough

1200
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:41,200
so that the fly was stuck still.

1201
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,200
I mean, the wing stopped.

1202
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:46,200
Now clearly, I could reach out slowly and grab it.

1203
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:51,200
But this is the exemplar of perception being virtual action.

1204
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:57,200
We're seeing the possibility of action, of how we can act.

1205
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:02,200
This must be so for perception to be ecologically valid

1206
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,200
in all partitions.

1207
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,200
Because I can change the velocity of processes just by changing

1208
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,200
the temperature.

1209
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,200
I can get a fever and I can slow down time.

1210
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,200
Nature has to have allowed for this.

1211
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:22,200
That is, you have to have invariance laws specifying these events.

1212
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,200
That is, the information has to be invariance laws

1213
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,200
as invariant to the spacetime partition,

1214
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,200
or the energy state of the body.

1215
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:33,200
And the energy state is a range of energy states,

1216
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,200
and the time scale that can be specified

1217
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,200
is a massive range of time scales.

1218
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,200
Again, this is affordances.

1219
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,200
It's just an aspect of affordances that the Gibsonians

1220
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,200
never seen.

1221
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,200
Well, you can see it's too much of a stretch for them.

1222
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,200
And I'm going to see why ultimately.

1223
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:57,200
But obviously, if the fly is affording a certain action,

1224
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,200
so is the gall affording a certain action.

1225
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,200
But it's at a different scale of time.

1226
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:05,200
Change the scale of time, I'm going to change the form of affordance.

1227
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:13,200
So, as I noted, back to where we started,

1228
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,200
aging is a rapid event.

1229
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,200
If I take it as a rapid event,

1230
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:22,200
let's say that little Joe there is growing right in front of my eyes.

1231
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:27,200
So the same law is employed to guide the modulation of the hand

1232
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,200
if I wanted to grasp a transforming head,

1233
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,200
the strain on the cardioid.

1234
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,200
That's the information that would be getting into the action systems

1235
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:39,200
to guide my grabbing that head as it transforms

1236
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,200
at a very rapid rate.

1237
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:44,200
Just a little aspect of the nature,

1238
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,200
just the criticality of invariance laws.

1239
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:53,200
So, I noted Gibson was for direct perception.

1240
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,200
To him, the environment is directly specified

1241
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,200
via all this information.

1242
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:01,200
The brain is resonating to this time extended information.

1243
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,200
Another way to put it here in my little box,

1244
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:07,200
the brain is resonating to the invariance in the external event.

1245
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:10,200
And it's directly specifying the image out there.

1246
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:13,200
There's no image in the brain.

1247
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,200
That's Gibson.

1248
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,200
No one can understand it.

1249
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:21,200
Purvis and Lotto, great perception theorist recently.

1250
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,200
There's our little book.

1251
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:27,200
Well, Gibson is now perceived as mystical.

1252
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:31,200
Stephen Leihar, who's the only perception theorist, goes through Gibson.

1253
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,200
I've looked at Gibson.

1254
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:37,200
I have no clue how direct perception can possibly be true.

1255
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:41,200
Because for all these people, somehow the image is in the brain

1256
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:46,200
or in that perceptual space, that cloud I had up there.

1257
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:49,200
Again, to make sense, Gibson's direct perception

1258
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,200
must be placed within Berkson's holographic

1259
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:54,200
brain as a reconstructive wave framework.

1260
01:23:54,200 --> 01:24:02,200
And as we're going to see, it's a notion of time.

1261
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,200
And into this, because notion of time.

1262
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:10,200
Another aspect of what implicit aspect, we're specifying the past.

1263
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,200
Okay?

1264
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,200
The specification is to the past,

1265
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:19,200
to the past extent of the transformation of the holographic field.

1266
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:22,200
The wing beats of that fly.

1267
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:27,200
By the time they get into the brain, they're processed a long gone.

1268
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,200
Just 200 wing beats per second.

1269
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,200
They're long gone.

1270
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,200
So how are we seeing the past?

1271
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:42,200
How is this past specification possible?

1272
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,200
Well, what's the barrier to that?

1273
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:48,200
The barrier is this conception of space and time that we have.

1274
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:53,200
I call it the classic metaphysical space and time.

1275
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:57,200
And we're going to compare that to ultimately the temporal metaphysics

1276
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:03,200
of Berkson, which allows the specification of the past.

1277
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:07,200
So the classic metaphysics, in essence, is an abstract space.

1278
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:11,200
It's a three-dimensional continuum of points positions.

1279
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,200
I'm showing a two-dimensional continuum of points and positions there.

1280
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,200
My little points and positions.

1281
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,200
Ultimately, it's a three-dimensional.

1282
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:22,200
We're moving the cup through a three-dimensional continuum of points and positions.

1283
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,200
Because it's a space, it's instantly divisible.

1284
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:31,200
In fact, as Berkson calls it, it's a principle of infinite divisibility.

1285
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:38,200
He called it, in essence, a mental diagram, the meshes of which we can contract at will,

1286
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:44,200
that we place beneath the extensity, the true concrete extensity of the concrete world.

1287
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,200
We'll talk about extensity a little bit later.

1288
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:52,200
But just imagine it's the concrete world and we place this abstract mental diagram of meshes

1289
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:55,200
that we can make smaller and smaller.

1290
01:25:55,200 --> 01:26:02,200
So when we look at motion in this framework, it's taken, as I move that cup from nearer to far

1291
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:08,200
across the continuum, it's taken as a series of, that motion is taken as a series of points

1292
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,200
on a line, which, again, is a space.

1293
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,200
In that line, the inner space is infinitely divisible.

1294
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,200
I can divide it into this little point after point after point.

1295
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:24,200
But between each pair of points, I can imagine there's another line of points.

1296
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,200
Again, infinitely divisible.

1297
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:31,200
And so what we end up with is this is an infinite regress.

1298
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,200
I can keep dividing.

1299
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:35,200
Between each pair of points, I can do another line.

1300
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:40,200
It's an absurdity because motion is now being reduced to a series of immobilities.

1301
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:43,200
How do you get motion out of a series of immobile points?

1302
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:51,200
And I should add, it's precisely the source of Zeno's paradoxes where I'm taking that line

1303
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:55,200
and I'm having it successively into smaller and smaller hands.

1304
01:26:55,200 --> 01:27:01,200
But Achilles never reaches the tortoise because it's infinitely divisible.

1305
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:04,200
I can never quit the process of infinite division.

1306
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:11,200
I can do it with a mathematical convention, but that's a magical mathematical convention

1307
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,200
like taking a limit.

1308
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:20,200
But that's a mythology that mathematical convention has actually solved the problem.

1309
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:28,200
Whitehead tried that solution, but it's just a mythology because infinity is infinity.

1310
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:36,200
And the mathematical convention is simply conveniently stopping the infinite division.

1311
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:41,200
Now time is interesting because now it's simply the fourth dimension of this abstract space.

1312
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:44,200
So we really have a four-dimensional abstract space.

1313
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,200
It's this series of instants.

1314
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:51,200
So each point along that moving cup is taken as an instant, shall we say.

1315
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:57,200
And so each instant corresponds to a position of the moving cup.

1316
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:04,200
And each instant can be taken as across the whole universe, as though the whole universe

1317
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:08,200
at that point, at instant in time, is a cube of space.

1318
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:17,200
For each cube, the time extent of each cube is a mathematical point equivalent to the mathematical

1319
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,200
point on the line.

1320
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:24,200
But as such, each of those blocks is frozen, is static.

1321
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:30,200
You can't move from one block to another.

1322
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,200
I jumped ahead of myself here.

1323
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:35,200
But each block, then, is completely homogeneous.

1324
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:42,200
There's zero qualities, especially emotion, because you can't get a block or a series of such blocks

1325
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:46,200
because remember, each block disappears as the next one arrives.

1326
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:49,200
So all you ever have is one block, then the next, and the next, and the next.

1327
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:56,200
So you're not going to get the quality of motion like Valerie Hardcastle's list in the context of a symphony.

1328
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,200
The patrons shift in their seats.

1329
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,200
The musicians concentrate.

1330
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:03,200
The curtains ever so gently waving.

1331
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:09,200
Those are qualities of motion, which I've never talked about, by the way, the problem of quality.

1332
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:12,200
But these qualities of motion.

1333
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:23,200
So the car, looking at this, in order to reintroduce motion in this metaphysics, actually thought that you had to have,

1334
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:30,200
this is where you needed God because God would have to create each block, then the next block, then the next block,

1335
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,200
and the next block.

1336
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,200
That's the only way you could get the universe to evolve.

1337
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:37,200
So once you've frozen it, it's a static block.

1338
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:41,200
You're not going to get the next block.

1339
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:51,200
Again, this is precisely the metaphysics underlying the turbine machine and all of computation.

1340
01:29:51,200 --> 01:30:03,200
It's why intrinsically, inherently intrinsically, the computer metaphor is not going to be able to deal with what we need for Berkson's framework,

1341
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:06,200
shall we say, and mind.

1342
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,200
So let's go to that.

1343
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:12,200
The temporal metaphysics of Berkson.

1344
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:20,200
Berkson, that transformation of the universal field, or motion itself, is indivisible.

1345
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:23,200
It is not a series of discrete states.

1346
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:30,200
Rather, each instant penetrates, permeates the next, like the notes of a melody.

1347
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:33,200
Each note penetrates, permeates the next.

1348
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:37,200
It's a melodic transformation, an organic continuity.

1349
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:51,200
Also, the matter field, and this is characterized by extensity, as I noted.

1350
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:56,200
There's a nice lake there.

1351
01:30:56,200 --> 01:31:00,200
That's the concrete material field.

1352
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:07,200
The abstract space placed over it at continual points in positions is not the same thing.

1353
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:13,200
It's the ideal limit of this extensity, but it has never reached it.

1354
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,200
It cannot be reached.

1355
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:20,200
It's simply an ideal mathematical limit.

1356
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:29,200
This is why you can't exalt the abstract space into a reality

1357
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:34,200
and make it your starting point for building a model of mind, as does AI.

1358
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:39,200
The brain simply does not dwell in the world of the classic metaphysics.

1359
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:43,200
It deals with the classic metaphysics, that abstract space.

1360
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:48,200
It's created or derived by the brain in its development.

1361
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:56,200
Piaget spends a great deal of time explaining, all the way from 8.0 to 8.7,

1362
01:31:56,200 --> 01:32:01,200
it takes to truly construct that abstract space.

1363
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,200
Okay.

1364
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,200
How's that all?

1365
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:05,200
One point, Steve.

1366
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:10,200
The top two points here.

1367
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:19,200
I'm sure people disagree, but the current consensus in modern physics

1368
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:23,200
is that space and time is discreet.

1369
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,200
Yes.

1370
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,200
They would break it down in terms of the plank.

1371
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:31,200
Of course, we don't experience it this way because it's so miniscule,

1372
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:37,200
but you have the plank length, plank time.

1373
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:44,200
If you had to discreetize space and time, you could possibly do it that way,

1374
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,200
but this model is different.

1375
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,200
Is that accurate?

1376
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,200
Yes.

1377
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:56,200
The problem is all of mathematics is based in the classic metaphysics.

1378
01:32:56,200 --> 01:33:07,200
And even the wave equation is based in this classic metaphysics

1379
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:15,200
and ultimately involves this process of taking limits,

1380
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:20,200
such that I can arbitrarily stop in infinity.

1381
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:21,200
Okay.

1382
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:26,200
The basis of the wave equation is Euler's identity.

1383
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:34,200
Or Euler's identity is Euler's description of the wave,

1384
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:37,200
but in order to make that identity work,

1385
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:44,200
eventually you take a limit to stop the basically Euler's identity.

1386
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:49,200
You've got sort of a rotating cosine wave,

1387
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,200
but it always comes back to zero.

1388
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:54,200
In order to make it come back to zero, that's Euler's identity,

1389
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,200
E to the i pi equals zero,

1390
01:33:56,200 --> 01:34:01,200
you have to take a limit of that relation, E to the i pi,

1391
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,200
our arbitrary mathematical limit,

1392
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,200
but that sits at the heart of the wave equation.

1393
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:12,200
And you're exalting that abstraction into the reality from which you're trying to start all theory.

1394
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:17,200
Everything's inverted in our current theoretical world.

1395
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,200
That's the problem.

1396
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:32,200
So, yeah, I did a, speaking of quantum, I mean, I did a YouTube on Schroediger.

1397
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:37,200
I think it's number 60 on quantum jumps.

1398
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:44,200
Schroediger did a paper in 1952 where he utterly destroyed the whole notion of quantum jumps.

1399
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:46,200
He destroyed it, logically destroyed it.

1400
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:49,200
People don't realize this.

1401
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:59,200
And so, you know, that's, but again, that comes back to the fundamental nature of the mathematics underneath it.

1402
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:04,200
So, let's see.

1403
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,200
As I said, this is important.

1404
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:11,200
The brain dwells or is embedded in dynamically transforming,

1405
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:16,200
indivisibly transforming a holographic field or the world of temporal metaphysics.

1406
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:22,200
It derives the spatial metaphysics, the classic metaphysics, the abstract space.

1407
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:27,200
This is just completely foundational if you're going to follow Bergson.

1408
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,200
Okay.

1409
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:33,200
So, let's find the past to bring it back.

1410
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:37,200
The indivisible transformation of the field where there are no incidents falling into the past.

1411
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:44,200
You don't have this model of instant after instant falling into the past,

1412
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:47,200
which is the symbol of non-existence.

1413
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:55,200
Rather, you've got this indivisible flow, each instant permeating the next organic continuity.

1414
01:35:55,200 --> 01:36:02,200
Well, that in effect forms a primary memory, still in the term from William James.

1415
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:06,200
The field is already, in essence, got its own memory.

1416
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:11,200
It's not falling into the past, into non-existence.

1417
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:18,200
So, then when you're specifying the holographic field,

1418
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:23,200
the specifications to a past extent of this holographic field.

1419
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:27,200
Now, this is interesting aspects of things that I haven't totally worked out,

1420
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:32,200
because you're going to have to have the resonance field represented by that brain,

1421
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:37,200
the wave there is only lasting for a certain period of time,

1422
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:43,200
relative to an extent of the past of the field, of the buzzing fly.

1423
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:46,200
Again, as in, the wing beats are long gone.

1424
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:52,200
So, this allows a past extent of the transformation to be specified.

1425
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:56,200
You don't need short-term storage areas in the brain,

1426
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:59,200
which is a concept filled with logical problems.

1427
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:03,200
Because right now, if you think about when I said, for Berkson,

1428
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:07,200
the essence of the problem of consciousness was his memory stored in the brain.

1429
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:12,200
Well, when your perception is already the problem,

1430
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:16,200
you're looking at that spoon stirring and the fly buzzing.

1431
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:20,200
Well, are you storing each instant of that in the brain,

1432
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:24,200
sliced by, like, snapshot by snapshot by snapshot,

1433
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:28,200
then trying to reconstruct the motion?

1434
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,200
How are you doing that?

1435
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:34,200
Who reconstructs the motion, some internal scanner?

1436
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:36,200
We'll talk about that in a second,

1437
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:43,200
but you can see that the very fundamentals of perception itself,

1438
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:46,200
of seeing that coffee cup already involves the problem is,

1439
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,200
well, his memory actually being stored in the brain,

1440
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:51,200
his experience being stored in the brain.

1441
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:57,200
And the answer is, no, it can't be.

1442
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,200
And something else we can see there, but I lost it.

1443
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:03,200
So, but if I go back to Gibson for a second,

1444
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:06,200
you'll see what he's saying the same thing.

1445
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,200
Notice this.

1446
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,200
This is back to the classic metaphysics.

1447
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:13,200
He says, the idea that space is perceived,

1448
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:16,200
and time, as you remember, looks at the back of our thinking.

1449
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:21,200
But these abstractions, space and time, the classic metaphysics,

1450
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:26,200
borrowed from physics are not appropriate to psychology.

1451
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:29,200
And this is adjacent to order and successive order,

1452
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:31,200
but are abstractions, and these are not found separate.

1453
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:34,200
Oops, I can spell our other.

1454
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:38,200
This is physical events that conform with relation before and after,

1455
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:40,200
and not to the contrast of past and future.

1456
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:43,200
Well, again, you've got to visualize that line of points,

1457
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:45,200
where one point is the present,

1458
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:47,200
points before that are all past,

1459
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,200
which have fallen away,

1460
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:52,200
and the points coming later are future.

1461
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:55,200
That's what he's saying is that's the classic metaphysics.

1462
01:38:55,200 --> 01:39:01,200
When you take the classic metaphysics down to its logical conclusion,

1463
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:07,200
and the brain itself only exists for one of those infinitely small points,

1464
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:11,200
a point of mathematical extent and time.

1465
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:14,200
That's just not applicable.

1466
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:18,200
Unfortunately, the Gibsonians are not paying attention to that quote.

1467
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:22,200
I mean, even my brilliant advisor, Bob Schaage,

1468
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:28,200
the paper's trying to model the whole of the Gibsonian ecological theory

1469
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:33,200
on the wave equation with its inherent problem.

1470
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:36,200
So, just an aside.

1471
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:41,200
Here's another thing that Gibson notes,

1472
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,200
the traveling moment of present time,

1473
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:49,200
that infinitely tiny point that's called the present

1474
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:52,200
between the past and the future,

1475
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,200
the dispacious present,

1476
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:57,200
that mathematical point that would be the dispacious present.

1477
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:59,200
Again, Berks and Gibson notes,

1478
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:02,200
well, no one can say where perception leaves off when memory begins.

1479
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:05,200
In fact, I failed to put the quote there,

1480
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,200
but when we're looking at the past,

1481
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,200
the specification of the past,

1482
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:14,200
it's really an essence of Berkson said is the case.

1483
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:18,200
Perception is already a memory.

1484
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:21,200
All of perception is memory already.

1485
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:26,200
So, no one can say where perception leaves off,

1486
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:29,200
memory begins, it's difficult, it's an old one,

1487
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:32,200
and notice he says in the blue,

1488
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:34,200
there are animals of man perceived motions,

1489
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,200
events, episodes, and whole sequences.

1490
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:39,200
They don't see point after point,

1491
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:42,200
it's an after incident on a line

1492
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:44,200
for the classic metaphysics.

1493
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:47,200
And he says the doctrine of sensation-based perception

1494
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:50,200
requires the assumption that the succession of items can be grasped,

1495
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:53,200
only if the earlier ones are held over,

1496
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:57,200
so as to be combined with later ones in a single composite.

1497
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:00,200
He says this can be pushed into absurdity.

1498
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:03,200
Well, notice I've got up there,

1499
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:07,200
Barcelona's theory of how you would store a biting transformation.

1500
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:10,200
I'd store it there, I'm inviting a carrot,

1501
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:13,200
there's three schematic states,

1502
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:16,200
mouth closed, mouth open, mouth closed back on the carrot.

1503
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,200
And so we store that in the brain, three schematic states.

1504
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:22,200
Equivalent to storing, putting three snapshots

1505
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:25,200
on photographs on a table.

1506
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:28,200
Okay, the question is, well, how do I restore the motion?

1507
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:33,200
How do I reconstruct the motion by some sort of internal scanner?

1508
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:36,200
Okay, but then I've got an infinite regress,

1509
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:39,200
I've now got to explain how the scanner, internal scanner,

1510
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,200
registers the motion.

1511
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:45,200
See, I'm doing there exactly in that picture what Gibson's saying,

1512
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:47,200
a succession of items can be grasped,

1513
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:49,200
only if the earlier ones are held over,

1514
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:52,200
like on the table, successively one after the other,

1515
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:55,200
to be combined with later ones into a single composite.

1516
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:57,200
It can be pushed into absurdity.

1517
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:59,200
Yes, it can.

1518
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:04,200
Biting is actually a facial flow field.

1519
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:07,200
There's Homer there, biting, or, you know,

1520
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:10,200
look at the facial flow fields on these biting.

1521
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,200
There we go.

1522
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,200
Here's an actual, you know, biting a carrot.

1523
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,200
Okay.

1524
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:18,200
It's hard to store.

1525
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:20,200
Well, I screwed up.

1526
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,200
We got to go back.

1527
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:24,200
Sorry about that.

1528
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:29,200
It's hard to store as the coffee stirrer into the rotating queue.

1529
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:32,200
See, again, notice.

1530
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:35,200
Do you see anyone in memory theory,

1531
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:37,200
I'm just rhetorical questions as far as your concern,

1532
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:41,200
addressing how you would store that coffee stirrer

1533
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:43,200
with all those invariance laws that define it,

1534
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:45,200
which define only over time.

1535
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:48,200
The invariant radio flow field, the inertial tensors,

1536
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,200
how do you store that?

1537
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:53,200
And, you know, as a series of three-dimensional snapshots

1538
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:56,200
in the brain, good luck.

1539
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:02,200
And then how do you restore it as reconstructed as motion?

1540
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:06,200
Hence, you know, again, Gibson is relying on Berks.

1541
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:11,200
Which brings us to the last thing I got here.

1542
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:15,200
That good old original question, the problem of subject and object.

1543
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:18,200
What is going on there?

1544
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:22,200
Because we need to remove the viewer.

1545
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:26,200
Somebody looking, see, remember the hologram plate is the brain.

1546
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:32,200
And we have to review who's looking at that image out there.

1547
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:36,200
Or, equivalently, we need to remove the homunculus,

1548
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:41,200
looking at the image, whether it's in the perceptual space

1549
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:47,200
or out there, or somehow.

1550
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:50,200
So we're back to our coin.

1551
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:52,200
Questions related to subject and object.

1552
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:54,200
The distinction in the union is you put in terms of time

1553
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,200
rather than space.

1554
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,200
My original coin.

1555
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:04,200
So, here's the deal.

1556
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:08,200
Defined over the dynamically transforming holographic field,

1557
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:12,200
we've got an elementary awareness at the null scale of time.

1558
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:16,200
When I say null scale, I mean the most infinitely small scale

1559
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,200
of time you can imagine.

1560
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:20,200
Things are still always changing,

1561
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:24,200
but think of that change in the tiniest interval you can imagine.

1562
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:28,200
Again, each point or event in that field reflects

1563
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:32,200
the state of all of the points.

1564
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:36,200
So, in essence, you've got elementary awareness there.

1565
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:40,200
At every point, every point is sort of elementary for,

1566
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:43,200
not truly elementary, of all the other points,

1567
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:47,200
taken at this infinitely small scale of time.

1568
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:50,200
And you've got elementary memory

1569
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:54,200
because of the indivisible transformation,

1570
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,200
where there are no instants falling into the past,

1571
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:59,200
that primary memory.

1572
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:04,200
So, as I've noted, if you take our fly

1573
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:08,200
and take it at that null scale,

1574
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,200
at a very tiny scale of time,

1575
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:14,200
where it's almost a cloud of electrons,

1576
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:17,200
it's not going to have the distinct outlines

1577
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:20,200
of the rest of the field, the rest of the whole erratic field,

1578
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:23,200
to include any distinct outlines from our body.

1579
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,200
Our body is going to be the same thing.

1580
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:28,200
In other words, the objects that we think are nice and separate,

1581
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:30,200
like the cup and the spoon and the body,

1582
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:33,200
don't actually have the distinct outlines.

1583
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:36,200
They're all meshed into the field, ultimately.

1584
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:39,200
It's a big spatial unity.

1585
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:45,200
So, if I start lowering the energy state of that brain,

1586
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:48,200
I'm going to lower it now,

1587
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:53,200
because I'm going to go from this very small scale to a bigger scale.

1588
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:56,200
I'll get my hair in like fly.

1589
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:59,200
And if I lower it still more,

1590
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:02,200
I'll get my normal scale, a buzzing like fly.

1591
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:06,200
So, we're starting to have subject differentiating from object,

1592
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:10,200
not in terms of space, but of time.

1593
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:15,200
The unity of the two,

1594
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:18,200
the body and the fly there, is not broken.

1595
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:20,200
Spatial unity.

1596
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:23,200
Remember, there's no distinct outlines

1597
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:26,200
or borders between these objects.

1598
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:31,200
But as I impose the scale of time,

1599
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:34,200
I start getting this nice separate object,

1600
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:37,200
the buzzing fly and the coffee cup from my body.

1601
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:42,200
And, you know, in terms of time,

1602
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:47,200
and then I think we have to add a bit more with the Piagetian development,

1603
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:55,200
where ultimately, he describes this whole evolution

1604
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:58,200
of the child's conception of object,

1605
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:01,200
where he starts to realize that he's a separate object

1606
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:03,200
from the coffee cup and the fly.

1607
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:07,200
Can I tell you a quick anecdote that this reminds me of?

1608
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:09,200
Do you mind?

1609
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:10,200
Say what?

1610
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:12,200
I just have a quick anecdote on that.

1611
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:13,200
You just mentioned child.

1612
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:15,200
And this is reminding me.

1613
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:18,200
I have a niece and two nephews.

1614
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:21,200
And this is just recalling something my nephew said to me years ago

1615
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:23,200
when he was a little younger.

1616
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:25,200
I think he was five or six years old.

1617
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:28,200
And we were just playing, hanging out.

1618
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:31,200
And he said something to me that we were separated.

1619
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:34,200
He was standing on the, he was standing, you know,

1620
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:36,200
I was standing separate from him.

1621
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:41,200
And he goes, I'm touching you right now.

1622
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:42,200
I was like, what do you mean?

1623
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,200
He's like, well, I'm standing on the floor

1624
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:45,200
and the floor is touching you.

1625
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:47,200
You're touching the floor.

1626
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:49,200
And I was like, huh?

1627
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:50,200
And he said, yeah, it even,

1628
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,200
I'm touching the house across the street.

1629
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:53,200
I'm touching that.

1630
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:56,200
And his conception, I think it has something to do with,

1631
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:57,200
I think about this a lot with kids.

1632
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:58,200
Like, what are they perceiving?

1633
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:00,200
What are they seeing?

1634
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:04,200
What is their kind, like the difference in terms of,

1635
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,200
and obviously as they grow up,

1636
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:11,200
they reach some critical period where they come into agreement

1637
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:15,200
with society, the people around them as to the nature of things

1638
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:16,200
and what's actually happening, right?

1639
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,200
Or as we perceive it.

1640
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:20,200
Yeah, they start to need to be one.

1641
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:21,200
Yeah.

1642
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:23,200
But the interesting thing is like,

1643
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:26,200
if you look at it in terms of a slice of time, let's say,

1644
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:31,200
and I hope this is, it follows with what you're saying.

1645
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:35,200
If you were able to just take a slice of time, one plank time,

1646
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:40,200
let's say, you know, just one snapshot,

1647
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:43,200
everything would be the same object.

1648
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:45,200
Is that accurate?

1649
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,200
Yeah.

1650
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,200
Yeah.

1651
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:50,200
Once you, because it's all, it's one big field.

1652
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:54,200
And yeah, almost, yeah.

1653
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:55,200
I'd say yes.

1654
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:57,200
I'd go for that.

1655
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:58,200
Something like that.

1656
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:01,200
Obviously language is tough because we're trying to put

1657
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:05,200
to words these very complex things and it might not even be

1658
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:08,200
possible in our vocabulary to get there,

1659
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:13,200
but we can kind of analyze and get around it sort of.

1660
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:14,200
True.

1661
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:15,200
Okay.

1662
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:16,200
I think I may be one more thing.

1663
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:20,200
So this is where it's kind of interesting because really there is,

1664
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:23,200
the essence is there's no one seeing.

1665
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:26,200
This is where it gets Zen.

1666
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:31,200
The specification is to a time scale form of that elementary

1667
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:34,200
awareness that we're talking about elementary memory to find

1668
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:37,200
over the transforming holographic field.

1669
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:40,200
And so, I mean, this is the kind of the essence of the Zen

1670
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:45,200
Satori where all of a sudden you've been concentrated on your

1671
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:46,200
Koan.

1672
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,200
Who is it that sees?

1673
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:49,200
All right.

1674
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:52,200
And all of a sudden there's this Satori or Ken show where you,

1675
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,200
you are the field.

1676
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:58,200
You know, there's a famous book by Douglas E. Harding that I having

1677
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:02,200
on having no head where all of a sudden you realize there's just

1678
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:07,200
this, there's no, there's, there's no, you're, you're that,

1679
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:10,200
that you're, you know, there's no separate being.

1680
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:13,200
You're, you're his context.

1681
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:18,200
He became the Himalayas, you know, after time, but this,

1682
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:23,200
this is the essence of the Zen Satori.

1683
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:28,200
I spent some time on YouTube discussing, I know you said you

1684
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:30,200
watched the Zen experience.

1685
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:33,200
I think those are my favorites.

1686
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:34,200
Right.

1687
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:36,200
This is why Berkson is so Zen.

1688
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:38,200
I'm not sure what I got left here now.

1689
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:42,200
Well, like I said, so, well, I have a lot of questions even when

1690
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:45,200
you're, I have a lot of questions even when we complete the slide

1691
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:47,200
share, but

1692
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:54,200
so notice this is Berkson's unique panpsychism over on the

1693
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:55,200
left.

1694
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:59,200
It's, it's a panpsychic model because that field is conscious in

1695
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:00,200
essence.

1696
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:03,200
It's got elementary awareness and elementary memory, but it's not

1697
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:08,200
the consciousness of stirring spoons on that experience of the

1698
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:11,200
coffee cup and stirring spoon or if you're a frog, the fly buzzing

1699
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:12,200
or anything like that.

1700
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:17,200
It's, it's not yet the consciousness of frogs or humans or ants or

1701
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:22,200
anything, but it's panpsychic, but there is no aggregation

1702
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:23,200
problem.

1703
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:26,200
We're not trying to, this is Chalmers famous problem.

1704
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:30,200
We're not trying to aggregate or combine the consciousness of all

1705
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:34,200
the little tiny particles into the field and explain how we end up

1706
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:36,200
with the experience of coffee stirring.

1707
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:39,200
You know, how do you get coffee stirring on a bunch of little

1708
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:41,200
conscious particles?

1709
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:46,200
Well, or to make it even worse for Chalmers, how would you explain

1710
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:50,200
how you now get the time scale of the buzzing fly as opposed to the

1711
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:54,200
hearing like fly as opposed to the electron cloud fly out of your

1712
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:56,200
conscious particles too, right?

1713
01:51:56,200 --> 01:52:01,200
Of course, time scale is never a problem for any quality of

1714
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:03,200
consciousness there's ever seen in my life yet.

1715
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:07,200
So they just don't comprehend that one.

1716
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:13,200
So the deal is the reconstructive wave specification dynamics

1717
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,200
takes care of this.

1718
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:19,200
I'm specifying this field as a coffee cup and a buzzing fly.

1719
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:22,200
I don't know, in other words, I now have a dynamics.

1720
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:26,200
I have a mechanism to explain the conscious experience of the

1721
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:31,200
external world in this panpsychic field that panpsychism in and

1722
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:32,200
of itself does not have.

1723
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:33,200
It has no such thing.

1724
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:37,200
It fails miserably and drops dead on that.

1725
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:43,200
So that's my panpsychic.

1726
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:47,200
The only other thing I had that was, I just, I think it's worth

1727
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:51,200
mentioning is this.

1728
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:59,200
In this model, experience is not in solely within the brain.

1729
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:02,200
Therefore, it cannot be stored solely in the brain.

1730
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:10,200
Yes, the brain, the brain also as a reconstructive wave can resonate

1731
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:16,200
in the same invariance law pattern as the coffee cup we saw,

1732
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:17,200
as the coffee stirring.

1733
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:23,200
And we can reconstruct or reintegrate in the old terminology

1734
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:25,200
that experience.

1735
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:29,200
So if you wreck the brain as a modulating device, it's going to

1736
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:33,200
look like the memory is gone.

1737
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:37,200
A memory stored in the brain is destroyed, but all you've done is

1738
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:43,200
wreck the brain's ability to assume the complex modulation pattern

1739
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:48,200
that is involved in perception of that coffee cup as we've been

1740
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,200
discussing.

1741
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:54,200
Now, obviously then, in other words, what we really are,

1742
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:58,200
and if you took Berkson's theory of the temporal metaphysics,

1743
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:00,200
we're four dimensional beings.

1744
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:05,200
And we're elongated being of four dimensions in which all of that

1745
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:09,200
experience, all the coffee stirrings you've ever seen,

1746
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:12,200
are stored in detail.

1747
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:19,200
Not in that image form necessarily, but it's all there.

1748
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:23,200
And I can reconstruct it by re-assuming the right modulation

1749
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:26,200
or resonance pattern.

1750
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:31,200
And so obviously you've got a whole different theory of memory

1751
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:32,200
implied.

1752
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:35,200
I've done a lot of talking about, but also a whole different

1753
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:41,200
theory of cognition, because we're using our experience,

1754
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:44,200
our experience of coffee cups, our experience of cubes,

1755
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:50,200
of rotating cubes, et cetera, to do cognition, to think.

1756
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:55,200
And this is where Penrose went when he was talking about why

1757
01:54:55,200 --> 01:55:01,200
computers can't deal with consciousness.

1758
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:04,200
And he started up, obviously, with the Gettle's proof as being

1759
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:09,200
an indication or the problem basically showing this.

1760
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:13,200
But along the way, in the shadows of the mind,

1761
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:16,200
he started talking about what he saw as non-computational

1762
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:17,200
thought.

1763
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:20,200
And here's a little example I've got here of his non-computational

1764
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:21,200
thought.

1765
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:26,200
This would be a proof, a visual proof that he tried out of a

1766
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,200
computation that does not stop.

1767
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:30,200
It's called the halting problem.

1768
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:33,200
How can I show that a computation does not stop?

1769
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:37,200
It goes on infinitely and always ends up with the next logical

1770
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:38,200
result?

1771
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:44,200
Well, in this case, what he's doing is showing that a hexagonal

1772
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:48,200
number and added to a previous hexagonal number always makes a

1773
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:49,200
circle number.

1774
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:51,200
And that never stops.

1775
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:58,200
And so what he does is an example there.

1776
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:01,200
You've got the number 19, which is a hexagonal number,

1777
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:04,200
and he folds that into a three-sided cube.

1778
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:09,200
And then he stacks that three-sided cube over the previous

1779
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:14,200
cube, which was an 8, 2 by 2 by 2, a 2 by 2 by 2 cube.

1780
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:18,200
And now he's got a 3 by 3 by 3 cube of 27.

1781
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:22,200
He's going to go on and take another cubicle number, which is

1782
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:31,200
37, fold it in three sides, stack it over the 3 by 3 by 3

1783
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:35,200
cube, 4 by 4 by 4 cube, and now he's 64.

1784
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:38,200
And obviously this can go on and on and on.

1785
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:41,200
So notice what he's doing.

1786
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:42,200
It's very visual.

1787
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:47,200
He's folding each hexagonal number into a three-sided cube.

1788
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:52,200
He's stacking the cube always over the next to make an ever,

1789
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:54,200
ever larger cube.

1790
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:57,200
So this is a dynamic transformation.

1791
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:59,200
Hope I don't lose my slide.

1792
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:00,200
Yeah, over time.

1793
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:05,200
It requires a mind that's in indivisible flow, not state after

1794
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:08,200
state after state, where each previous state disappears as the

1795
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:11,200
next one comes, which is the essence of the computer model.

1796
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:14,200
You have to have this invisible flow or continuity else the

1797
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:20,200
globality of this transformation of continuous folding and

1798
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:22,200
stacking cannot be perceived.

1799
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:26,200
And the invariance across this transformation, namely always a

1800
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:30,200
three-sided cube, always ultimately a stacked cube,

1801
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:33,200
the variance can't be registered.

1802
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:38,200
So Penrose was really pointing to the essence of invariance laws

1803
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:40,200
as being the essence of proofs.

1804
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:48,200
And I need this continuous, indivisible transformation.

1805
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:52,200
Him being a complete mathematician and totally stuck in the

1806
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:55,200
classic metaphysics didn't realize what he's saying.

1807
01:57:55,200 --> 01:58:01,200
He never has grasped the implications of non-competitional

1808
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:02,200
thought.

1809
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:06,200
And of course he was trashed heavily in behavioral and brain

1810
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:09,200
sciences journal when he did a process of this book.

1811
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:10,200
They couldn't stand it.

1812
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:13,200
But this is what he was pointing to.

1813
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:16,200
This is the essence of true cognition.

1814
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:18,200
This is what you have to have.

1815
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:23,200
And this is why a computer and AI is never going to equal human

1816
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:24,200
thought.

1817
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:29,200
Because again, the intrinsic model of time is the classic

1818
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:30,200
metaphysics.

1819
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:32,200
The discrete instant state of time.

1820
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:37,200
No matter how concrete you look at the computer itself with all

1821
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:44,200
of its electrical flows and wires, et cetera, the essence of the

1822
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:46,200
machine is an abstraction.

1823
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:48,200
It's a logical model.

1824
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:53,200
It can be carried out on an abacus or a registered machine with

1825
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:56,200
beans and shoeboxes as long as you're carrying out the abstract

1826
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:57,200
operations.

1827
01:58:57,200 --> 01:59:01,200
And the abstract operations are state after state after state

1828
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:02,200
in discrete time.

1829
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:08,200
So inherently, intrinsically, it cannot do this type of thought.

1830
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:11,200
And you're never going to get AI.

1831
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:16,200
And if you notice, this is actually already simply a special

1832
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:20,200
case of the problem of common sense of knowledge, which AI

1833
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:22,200
can't deal with either.

1834
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:24,200
It's his bet noir, common sense.

1835
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:29,200
Yes, there's working on Lacrune trying heavily to solve it in

1836
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:32,200
terms of neural net architecture.

1837
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:37,200
But neural nets are, again, simply instantiations of

1838
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:39,200
Turing machines.

1839
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:41,200
So they're faced with this problem.

1840
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:44,200
This is just another common sense of knowledge problem.

1841
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:48,200
I mean, you can imagine myself, I'm going to build a mousetrap or

1842
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:51,200
even a lawn mower, and I got to stack a whole bunch of stuff on

1843
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:54,200
top of each other and make a big cube.

1844
01:59:55,200 --> 02:00:00,200
So I think that's the main thing I wanted to say.

1845
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:03,200
Yeah, notice I have a little note here.

1846
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:07,200
Penrose identified this thought as demanding consciousness.

1847
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:12,200
But again, in other words, he's stuck in a classic metaphysics

1848
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:15,200
and doesn't understand that consciousness and pleasantness

1849
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:20,200
will flow as time at primary memory.

1850
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:26,200
This is just an example of the same thing.

1851
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:30,200
Piaget is just replete with this.

1852
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:34,200
I mean, if Penrose actually understood the literature of

1853
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:37,200
developmental psychology and cognitive psychology that Piaget

1854
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:40,200
represents, he would probably be ashamed to do what he had said.

1855
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:44,200
But here's another simple example.

1856
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:48,200
Piaget is taking children age three to seven.

1857
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:49,200
He's got a tunnel there.

1858
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:52,200
He moves those little colored beads into the tunnel,

1859
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,200
and then he rotates the tunnel.

1860
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:56,200
There's a halter, and then he asks the child,

1861
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:58,200
well, what order will it come out now?

1862
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:02,200
And you can see if I do a semi-rotation, 180 degrees,

1863
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:04,200
the order is going to be reversed.

1864
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:08,200
I'm going to go in as ABC, but I'm going to come out as CBA.

1865
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:12,200
If I do a full rotation, I'm going to keep the order the same, right?

1866
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:15,200
I'm going to come out again as ABC.

1867
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:20,200
But three times, three half turns, I'm going to invert the order.

1868
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:25,200
And if I ask seven times, what's the order going to be?

1869
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:30,200
Well, if I know the rule by this time that the order changes,

1870
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:32,200
odd number of turns, the order reverses.

1871
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:36,200
Even number of turns, the order is going to be the same as it went in.

1872
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:38,200
I can always tell you, 19.

1873
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:42,200
Okay, well, it's going to be, the order is going to reverse, right?

1874
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:47,200
It takes the children three to seven years to figure this out,

1875
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:49,200
this odd even rule.

1876
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:54,200
And in the course of it, what they do is they visualize,

1877
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:56,200
just like Penrose and his cubes,

1878
02:01:56,200 --> 02:02:00,200
they visualize one half rotation, one semi-rotation.

1879
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:01,200
What will happen then?

1880
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:02,200
What if I do it again?

1881
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:04,200
What if I do it three times?

1882
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:07,200
Okay, it's going to reverse.

1883
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:12,200
And they'll get to a point where they can maybe visualize four semi-rotations,

1884
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:16,200
but ask, well, what will happen on number five?

1885
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:17,200
They can't.

1886
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:19,200
They flake out.

1887
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:20,200
They can't visualize it.

1888
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:25,200
They can't keep the train of visualization going anymore.

1889
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:28,200
So ultimately they come to a point where they can say,

1890
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:30,200
what's body seven?

1891
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:33,200
Oh, yeah.

1892
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:35,200
Odd number of turns, it's going to reverse.

1893
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:40,200
And this all comes down to what he describes as concrete operations,

1894
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:42,200
which develop over three to seven years.

1895
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:44,200
And here's this interesting quote.

1896
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:46,200
He says, well, operations, one might say,

1897
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:48,200
are nothing more than articulated intuitions,

1898
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:51,200
when they're adaptable and completely reversible,

1899
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:53,200
since they are emptied of their visual content

1900
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:56,200
and survive as pure intention.

1901
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:59,200
In other words, operations come into being in their pure state

1902
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:02,200
when there's skimethization.

1903
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:04,200
So notice that.

1904
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:11,200
In essence, the imagery, the dynamic transformation of imagery

1905
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:14,200
is absolutely essential in the course of development,

1906
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:17,200
exactly like Penrose was pointing to.

1907
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:20,200
It's just that as you do it enough,

1908
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:26,200
the images almost disappear in terms of very schematized form.

1909
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:29,200
And so he says, instead of demanding an actual representation,

1910
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:32,200
each inversion will be conceived as a potential representation,

1911
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:35,200
like the outline for an experiment to be performed,

1912
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:37,200
which is not useful to follow to the letter,

1913
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:39,200
even in the form of performing it mentally.

1914
02:03:39,200 --> 02:03:44,200
So this is really the essence of Piaget's concrete operations

1915
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:48,200
or non-computational thought to put it in Penrose's term,

1916
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:51,200
which he didn't under the novel Piaget.

1917
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:54,200
In other words, you need Berkson's device

1918
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:56,200
to support this kind of thought.

1919
02:03:56,200 --> 02:04:01,200
Again, this is just a common sense knowledge problem.

1920
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:06,200
I mean, this is a specific problem,

1921
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:12,200
but is this an example of the kind of, I mean,

1922
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:16,200
called a thought process, the kind of problem solving

1923
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:20,200
that a computer would find difficult to do at this point?

1924
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:22,200
Yeah.

1925
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:29,200
Common sense knowledge is the essence of the problem.

1926
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:34,200
I mean, they've tried to simulate this stuff with neural nets,

1927
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:38,200
the developmental series, but people have looked at it

1928
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:41,200
and says, well, what's going on in the neural net weight,

1929
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:44,200
how the weight changes, nothing to do with how children

1930
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:46,200
actually develop.

1931
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:50,200
But when I say common sense knowledge problems,

1932
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:57,200
my metaphor, my example I like is creating a mousetrap

1933
02:04:57,200 --> 02:05:00,200
out of arbitrary components.

1934
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:04,200
Where I should have put my picture in here.

1935
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:07,200
But you imagine you have a little cardboard box

1936
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:10,200
and you have a pencil and rubber bands and paper clips

1937
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:13,200
and a piece of cheese and some strings and some toothpicks.

1938
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:18,200
And I actually ran across this when I was in my teens,

1939
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:20,200
it was in Reader's Digest.

1940
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:22,200
It was a creativity test for engineers.

1941
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:25,200
Well, here's this pile of stuff, can you make a mousetrap?

1942
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:26,200
OK.

1943
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:29,200
And you can visualize making a mousetrap with a,

1944
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:33,200
imagine a box with, you got the pencil drawn back.

1945
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:36,200
You've got rubber band outside the box

1946
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:38,200
and you have a little hole.

1947
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:40,200
The pencil goes through and you can draw the pencil back

1948
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:44,200
and maybe you put the toothpick lodged in a little groove

1949
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:48,200
in the pencil so that the pencil sticks there.

1950
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:53,200
The pencil would be in the inside of the box,

1951
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:57,200
holding the pencil and there's a string to the cheese

1952
02:05:57,200 --> 02:05:59,200
and the mouse pulls the string, pulls the pencil out

1953
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:01,200
and sticks himself with the pencil.

1954
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:02,200
OK.

1955
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:04,200
The pencil flies and hits the mouse.

1956
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:06,200
In other words, it's a crossbow trap.

1957
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:08,200
It's analogous to a crossbow.

1958
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:09,200
OK.

1959
02:06:09,200 --> 02:06:10,200
Get the picture.

1960
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:12,200
I could make, if I got a razor blade,

1961
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:14,200
I stick the razor blade into the pencil

1962
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:17,200
and I prop the razor blade up in a corner

1963
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:20,200
and prop it up with a pencil and maybe rubber bands

1964
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:21,200
pulling it down.

1965
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:25,200
Give myself some staples to work with.

1966
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:29,200
So there's force on the pencil.

1967
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:31,200
The mouse has got to be a fairly strong mouse

1968
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:35,200
with that trap to pull the razor.

1969
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:37,200
It all depends.

1970
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:41,200
People whip up these traps all the time.

1971
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:42,200
Gotcha.

1972
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:44,200
So if you're, yeah.

1973
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:47,200
Maybe you have the stapler falling on the mouse.

1974
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:48,200
I don't know.

1975
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:50,200
This is the common.

1976
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:51,200
OK.

1977
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:56,200
The problem is that there's no finite set of features

1978
02:06:56,200 --> 02:07:00,200
that you could put in the database that a machine could use

1979
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:05,200
because the features are emerging with the transformation.

1980
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:08,200
The rigidity of the pencil and the sharpness and the fact

1981
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:11,200
or the fact that I could lodge it in the box corner.

1982
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:16,200
The box corner is a nice place to lodge a pencil for the axe.

1983
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:19,200
All these things are all these features of the pencil

1984
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:23,200
or the functions emerge with the transformation

1985
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:27,200
that you're the analogy transformation.

1986
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:28,200
You're sort of visualizing.

1987
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:31,200
I can make it into a crossbow or I could make it

1988
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:35,200
into a giant boulder trap like that destroys Wiley Coyote

1989
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:37,200
or something like that.

1990
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:40,200
OK.

1991
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:47,200
So it becomes a massive problem of representation,

1992
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:49,200
excuse me, of the features of objects

1993
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:53,200
because there's no finite list, excuse me,

1994
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:57,200
all the transformations that are necessary, et cetera.

1995
02:07:57,200 --> 02:07:59,200
That's the common sense knowledge problem.

1996
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:01,200
And you can see why I'm saying, well, just

1997
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:06,200
tunnel rotation or stacking cubes of one another

1998
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:10,200
is just part of the same kind of problem, the same thought

1999
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:11,200
process.

2000
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:12,200
Cool.

2001
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:13,200
And yes.

2002
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:15,200
This is your last slide, right?

2003
02:08:15,200 --> 02:08:16,200
Yeah.

2004
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:17,200
I do believe.

2005
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:19,200
If you have time, I have one more.

2006
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:20,200
Oh, one more.

2007
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:21,200
Yeah.

2008
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:26,200
But I thought that would be the one we, part two,

2009
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:29,200
if we ever do one, we'll go into relativity

2010
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:35,200
because that's another piece of the story of, excuse me,

2011
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:37,200
getting hit in the horse.

2012
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:43,200
This is another piece of the story that was interesting

2013
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:46,200
because I remember Berkson's argument

2014
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:48,200
with Einstein and relativity.

2015
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:54,200
And in that time I had with Shaw,

2016
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:59,200
I was trying to reconcile Berkson to relativity

2017
02:08:59,200 --> 02:09:01,200
because Berkson believes in becoming,

2018
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:03,200
the dynamic transformation of the universe

2019
02:09:03,200 --> 02:09:05,200
is always evolving and coming.

2020
02:09:05,200 --> 02:09:09,200
But you have that static block model of space time

2021
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:12,200
where everything's laid out in one big block

2022
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:14,200
because supposedly there's no simultaneity.

2023
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:19,200
Therefore, there's no plane that you can take through that block

2024
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:24,200
that represents a universal present across the entire block,

2025
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:29,200
a present instance that then grows as the block grows.

2026
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:34,200
Because I've destroyed simultaneity, supposedly.

2027
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:37,200
And I was trying to reconcile that

2028
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:40,200
and I found this article by Millik Kapek

2029
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:47,200
where he tries to show that the Minkowski formula

2030
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:53,200
for the space time manifold or matrix,

2031
02:09:53,200 --> 02:09:58,200
the Minkowski space time, actually preserves becoming.

2032
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:02,200
And I thought that was cool and I wrote this paper up

2033
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:06,200
because then it seemed like, okay, Berkson's got to be coming

2034
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:09,200
and this interpretation says there's at least some becoming

2035
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:14,200
in the static block universe, there's got to be some becoming.

2036
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:17,200
And that seems to be the point of reconciliation.

2037
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:20,200
Shaw thought that was cool and he gave it to Gibson

2038
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:22,200
who was there at the time.

2039
02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:27,200
And Gibson read the article and said,

2040
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:30,200
well, yeah, scribbled on the top half.

2041
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:33,200
Yeah, it's good to take big thoughts, big questions,

2042
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:35,200
but you should look at other things.

2043
02:10:35,200 --> 02:10:39,200
He said, okay, he doesn't like that resolution.

2044
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:43,200
And the next day he was giving his talk at the University of Minnesota

2045
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:48,200
and he comes up with a statement out of the blue,

2046
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:51,200
to anyone there other than someone who happened

2047
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:54,200
to have written that particular paper, namely me.

2048
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:57,200
So I'm sitting there and I'm probably the only one who knew what he was saying,

2049
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:59,200
but this is the quote, he says,

2050
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:02,200
physicists must lead us when they say there is no simultaneity.

2051
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:05,200
When the camera pans to the hero and tied to the rails

2052
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:09,200
and then to the hero rushing to the rescue on his horse,

2053
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:12,200
these events are simultaneous.

2054
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:16,200
I guess we should add the train in to speed into the hero.

2055
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:22,200
So, and I recognized right away another one of those,

2056
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:26,200
I know this is, he's siding with Berkson.

2057
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:30,200
He's siding with Berkson against Berkson's argument against Einstein,

2058
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:32,200
because these are multiple, what's called multiple,

2059
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:39,200
I call multiple simultaneous flows that cannot be relativized.

2060
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:41,200
And that's another whole topic.

2061
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:43,200
I don't know if you want to share that.

2062
02:11:43,200 --> 02:11:45,200
I think it would be interesting to go into, you know,

2063
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:50,200
where this absolutely destroys Einstein

2064
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:53,200
and very concretely and very easily.

2065
02:11:53,200 --> 02:12:02,200
And why relativity in its current interpreted form,

2066
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:04,200
interpreted interpretational form,

2067
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:07,200
that is where the twin paradox is held to be true,

2068
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:09,200
it's got to be ditched.

2069
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:11,200
And so, but that's another.

2070
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:12,200
Okay, yeah.

2071
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:13,200
That's another topic.

2072
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:15,200
Already a lot we've covered so far.

2073
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:18,200
Can you, this is, this one's your last one, right?

2074
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:22,200
I hope so.

2075
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:24,200
I have a number of questions.

2076
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:27,200
I'd love if, if you still have time,

2077
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:30,200
I'd love to just cover up on a couple of things.

2078
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:32,200
I guess the first thing,

2079
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:36,200
I'm going to tackle this from different perspectives,

2080
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:41,200
but taking a step back and thinking about Berkson a little bit.

2081
02:12:41,200 --> 02:12:47,200
One of the things I think is interesting is,

2082
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:53,200
and I'm trying to make a comparison here with,

2083
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:57,200
I think a lot about ancient symbols and semiotics generally,

2084
02:12:57,200 --> 02:13:02,200
but are you familiar with the Yin Yang symbol, the Tai Chi two?

2085
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:04,200
Are you familiar with that symbol?

2086
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:08,200
It's like two, a white half and a black half.

2087
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:09,200
Oh yeah.

2088
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:11,200
And the pace, the pace is in between.

2089
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:14,200
Well, one thing I think is very interesting about Berkson is,

2090
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:21,200
he's spoken about as like a poetic philosopher oftentimes.

2091
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:25,200
And of course the debate we just talked at the beginning about

2092
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:30,200
between him and Einstein seems to be if there are two halves

2093
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:32,200
of the same coin, let's say,

2094
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:38,200
Berkson would be the intuitive Einstein representing rationality.

2095
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:41,200
Would you say that's a fair kind of,

2096
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:45,200
that's a very broad kind of statement, but that is where they kind of...

2097
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:51,200
Well, the other way, equivalently the classic metaphysics,

2098
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:55,200
classic spatial metaphysical space and time versus the temporal metaphysics.

2099
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:58,200
Sure, yeah, you can split it both ways.

2100
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:02,200
Which incorporates the latter incorporating intuition,

2101
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:04,200
which is another whole topic.

2102
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:06,200
Yeah, intuition was a big,

2103
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:10,200
intuition was a huge part of Berkson's framework

2104
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:11,200
and ideology.

2105
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:15,200
But so I bring up the Yang-Yang symbol because the way I perceive it's quite interesting

2106
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:18,200
because Berkson's usually portrayed as this poet.

2107
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:21,200
And that's part of the reason why he spoke, you know,

2108
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:26,200
he spoke and wrote in sort of beautiful language, flowery language.

2109
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:34,200
It was kind of tough sometimes, I think, to sort of provide boundaries

2110
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:39,200
or like specify exactly where he stood on certain issues perhaps.

2111
02:14:39,200 --> 02:14:42,200
For other people, for other people that read Berkson.

2112
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:45,200
I bring up the Yang-Yang symbol because it's funny,

2113
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:49,200
because like within Berkson, that intuitive sense,

2114
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:53,200
what you've brought here is a very technical framework.

2115
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:59,200
And it's almost like you're bringing in the rationality within Berkson's poetry.

2116
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:01,200
Does that make any sense?

2117
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:07,200
Does that congeal it all to your, the way you see it?

2118
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:18,200
I could see it in a certain way, but I tend to look at it as,

2119
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:22,200
I'm just getting even more visual and more concrete than Berkson did.

2120
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:24,200
No, I mean, I agree.

2121
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:30,200
I think you are getting more concrete because Berkson was, you know, it's funny.

2122
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:32,200
He didn't have the language.

2123
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:34,200
He didn't have any particular stuff earlier.

2124
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:38,200
I'm doing this in a PowerPoint medium with all kinds of stuff.

2125
02:15:38,200 --> 02:15:43,200
I mean, he, I mean, one of the, one of the reasons it kind of,

2126
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:48,200
I ended up doing this, whatever number I'm at, 75 or whatever of these things is,

2127
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:51,200
I mean, I published a lot in academic world,

2128
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:55,200
but you can't express all the stuff there is,

2129
02:15:55,200 --> 02:16:01,200
and as dynamically and as neatly in articles as you can in this medium.

2130
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:10,200
It's, I mean, I think this was incredibly freeing up powerful medium.

2131
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:14,200
I mean, obviously, I'm, you know, I'm sure people look at me and think I'm,

2132
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:17,200
I'm in a stone age on it, but because, you know, even,

2133
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:23,200
I know even compared to you, I'm in a stone age, but, but, but it's,

2134
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:27,200
so some of that, some of it is this medium.

2135
02:16:27,200 --> 02:16:32,200
When, when you, I guess if you looked at my academic articles,

2136
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:37,200
I would appear a little, I probably wouldn't be quite as,

2137
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:45,200
obviously you're going only put so many pictures in an academic article,

2138
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:50,200
and you have to, well, and I tend to get a little more concrete than Brugton

2139
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:54,200
and those things, but there sure seems to be a whole lot of people

2140
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:55,200
that you don't understand me.

2141
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:59,200
So I don't, I don't, like I said, it's very, it's very Zen.

2142
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:08,200
It's very, you have to have a certain intuition of soul in my mind to resonate to this stuff.

2143
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:10,200
Yeah.

2144
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:12,200
And I agree.

2145
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:19,200
I mean, the, and it actually speaks to perhaps a sub point of what Berkson was getting at

2146
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:23,200
in terms of duration with, and this is something I do.

2147
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:28,200
If you're, if we're going to talk about both creators of content on, on YouTube

2148
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:32,200
and another, you're another place, of course, you're, you're written work.

2149
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:40,200
I've always found showing things in motion to be, to have things,

2150
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:43,200
to explain things better than static imagery.

2151
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:48,200
So it's funny when you're showing your off your GIFs or GIFs on these slides

2152
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:50,200
and you show the stirring coffee cup.

2153
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:56,200
And you can kind of, I think, understand where Berkson was coming from,

2154
02:17:57,200 --> 02:18:04,200
because would it be fair to say he'd argue most of science, the cutting edge physics,

2155
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:12,200
let's say, focuses a lot on the spatial component and doesn't give the temporal dimension,

2156
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:14,200
it's fair to do or it's fair emphasis.

2157
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:19,200
And actually, as far as the limited physics, I know it's funny.

2158
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:28,200
Many, most, not probably not all equations can be are agnostic to the direction of time

2159
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:31,200
can be done backwards and forwards.

2160
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:34,200
That's the bare minimum.

2161
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:35,200
I know.

2162
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:36,200
I think, I think that's the case.

2163
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:46,200
But of course, the temporal component is probably underappreciated or not.

2164
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:50,200
Oh, it's just absolutely, yeah.

2165
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:57,200
There's so many, like, there's so many subject matters where the temporal,

2166
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:02,200
the problem of time is just simply just not grass.

2167
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:07,200
I mean, like I said, when you look at the whole literature on the hard problem,

2168
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:14,200
you just don't see any understanding of the problem of time, period.

2169
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:21,200
You know, like just as I noted, all the examples of qualia are probably like the redness of the sunset,

2170
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:23,200
the taste of the qualifier.

2171
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:27,200
So it's all fairly stacked, you know, qualities of motion,

2172
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:33,200
like the gently waving curtains of ballet hardcasts or the patients shifting slowly.

2173
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:38,200
And there seems to look, okay, that's just not even grasped or understood.

2174
02:19:38,200 --> 02:19:39,200
And notice that it's all,

2175
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:43,200
if I made the field make this point,

2176
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:52,200
there's all dynamically changing qualities of form that say, hey, the whole image is form.

2177
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:58,200
And so your problem is how do you see the external image,

2178
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:01,200
the world, the image of the world out there externally,

2179
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:07,200
the coffee cup and changing with this in front of this gently waving curtains.

2180
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:09,200
That's the problem.

2181
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:17,200
See, it's because of that failure of the grasp of the time and all of all these dynamic forms and change

2182
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:23,200
that when you say, oh, I've got a, I've got a model of how you see the image of the world out there.

2183
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:26,200
They don't even know that that's a solution to the hard problem.

2184
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:30,200
They don't even, it doesn't even dawn on them that that's a solution.

2185
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:34,200
But physics, same problem.

2186
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:42,200
The fact that they think that they can get away with

2187
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:50,200
a completely discreet state model of time and capture what's actually going on

2188
02:20:50,200 --> 02:20:55,200
in this, in the dynamically transforming matter of field is endemic to them.

2189
02:20:55,200 --> 02:21:00,200
And on nice examples of it aren't coming to mind at this point.

2190
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:01,200
That's fine.

2191
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:02,200
Yeah.

2192
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:04,200
But they're, how do you think this model?

2193
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:05,200
Sure.

2194
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:07,200
How do you think, how do you think this model?

2195
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:08,200
Oh, sorry.

2196
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:09,200
Yeah.

2197
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:16,200
The, and also just to be clear for the audience, I don't believe Berkson, he didn't, he didn't

2198
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:19,200
create the term holographic theory of mind, right?

2199
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:20,200
You are.

2200
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:21,200
No.

2201
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:22,200
Yeah.

2202
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:24,200
Like I said, he was interpreting Berkson.

2203
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:26,200
It wasn't until 1947.

2204
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:28,200
So yeah, I guess it was after his death.

2205
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:29,200
I represent this.

2206
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:34,200
Let's take Berkson and, and upgrade him into the, how, how he probably would have talked

2207
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:36,200
that he knew about photography.

2208
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:37,200
Yeah.

2209
02:21:37,200 --> 02:21:45,200
Can you intuit how, how does this model help explain qualia?

2210
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:57,200
Well, as I said, the transformation of the field is indivisible.

2211
02:21:57,200 --> 02:21:59,200
Each instant permeates the next.

2212
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:02,200
It's already a qualitative transformation.

2213
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:10,200
So when you're specifying the brain is specifying the gently waving curtains, it's specifying

2214
02:22:10,200 --> 02:22:17,200
the qualitative transformation of that field at a certain scale of time.

2215
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:23,200
Color itself is, is, is a time phenomenon.

2216
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:29,200
It's a, it's a, it's a certain vibration, vibration of a magnet electromagnetic field

2217
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:30,200
over time.

2218
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:36,200
That again, you're putting this, like Berkson noted, you know, if you take one second of

2219
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:44,200
red light and spread it out wave by wave by wave, such just that you could count in the

2220
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:48,200
normal amount of time people can distinguish events, you know, you've got 25,000 years

2221
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:54,200
that would require to count each wave of one second of red light for 400 billions of vibrations.

2222
02:22:54,200 --> 02:23:01,200
But in essence, we're compressing the, you know, now notice when you spread it all out,

2223
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:07,200
it's almost, almost back to my, my cubes of space.

2224
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:14,200
It's almost one giant big pile of cubes homogeneous, you know, no quality.

2225
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:21,200
But now when you're specifying that color, it's compressed into a, you know, one second

2226
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:23,200
of red light is now, you know, that's what we see.

2227
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:25,200
We don't see 25,000 waves.

2228
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:30,200
You see this, you know, glob of color of pulsating red.

2229
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:31,200
Okay.

2230
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:37,200
It's, it's, it's this, it's this huge amount of time being compressed by our perception

2231
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:39,200
and by the brain processes.

2232
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:47,200
So it's not, now it's becoming more, it's, it's now obviously more qualitative, you know,

2233
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:52,200
perceptually than that huge spread out field as it would look at virtually what I call

2234
02:23:52,200 --> 02:23:55,200
the null scale of time.

2235
02:23:55,200 --> 02:24:01,200
But it's, but that, but again, the null scale of time is, it's an abstract limit.

2236
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:08,200
It never becomes the homogeneous space instant after instant of the classic metaphysics.

2237
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:16,200
So all quality, all qualia is a function of time and motion.

2238
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:23,200
And at a scale where there's buzzing flies, Aaron flies, brown flies versus red flies

2239
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:29,200
versus white flies versus gently waving curtains versus violently waving curtains.

2240
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:30,200
Sure.

2241
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:38,200
And I'm going to jump around a lot here, but if we're thinking about the, say the double

2242
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:45,200
slit experiment, does this, well, I mean, this is a theory of every sort of a theory

2243
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:51,200
of everything or theory, at least our state, our perception of things.

2244
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:54,200
Does this relate to the double slit experiment in some way?

2245
02:24:54,200 --> 02:25:01,200
And if so, how?

2246
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:09,200
I'm sure it does, but I, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't even know how to answer

2247
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:10,200
that question.

2248
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:14,200
I know it's a very broad question, but I make, I make connections here between,

2249
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:20,200
obviously the double slit is, you know, particles.

2250
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:22,200
Oh, sorry.

2251
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:28,200
There seems to be a connection between at least the wave particle duality, the observation

2252
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:29,200
of that.

2253
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:32,200
So our measurement of that.

2254
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:38,200
And then it's, it's a resultant effect on, you know, the pattern that's found on the

2255
02:25:38,200 --> 02:25:39,200
screen, right?

2256
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:47,200
So this seemingly, you know, so this theory would have to at least incorporate that, or

2257
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:52,200
at least I don't have to explain it per se, but it has to be at least perhaps consistent

2258
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:57,200
with that observation.

2259
02:25:57,200 --> 02:26:02,200
Yeah, I'm drawing.

2260
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:07,200
It's like, it's a giant disc loaded to my head that I can't do it right now.

2261
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:11,200
Yeah, we just, this is a long conversation.

2262
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:18,200
But I think that there is probably a connection here if you were trying to make the case.

2263
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:19,200
Yeah.

2264
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:20,200
Yeah.

2265
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:26,200
I, you know, and I don't think, I mean, I've looked a lot at the quantum theory of them.

2266
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:33,200
I've done stuff at it, you know, videos on it, like I noted, you know, about, but I,

2267
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:40,200
you know, I would say that making that final link that you're asked actually asking for

2268
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:48,200
that resolution, that's kind of a physics problem, more so than my problem.

2269
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:51,200
I can't, I can't, I can't do it.

2270
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:53,200
But yeah, sure.

2271
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:57,200
It's a good question, but yeah, don't don't get the answer for me.

2272
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:58,200
No, absolutely.

2273
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:00,200
I understand that's something to consider for the future.

2274
02:27:00,200 --> 02:27:07,200
The other thing I'd say or question I have is it's sort of coming back full circle to

2275
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:11,200
well, sort of the top of our conversation.

2276
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:17,200
And some of my favorite videos of yours on your channel actually were the Zen related

2277
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:20,200
Zen Buddhism and how it relates to this theory.

2278
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:25,200
I think you have two, maybe more related.

2279
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:33,200
I did one on Zen number 24 and I did one on Zen and the art of mule cycle maintenance.

2280
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:37,200
Yes, I think those are, those are my, those are some of my favorite videos of yours.

2281
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:46,200
So I wonder if, and this is, you know, speculative or let's say thinking out loud kind of territory.

2282
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:57,200
Do you think there's any relationship between the mind and meditation and perhaps the process

2283
02:27:57,200 --> 02:28:05,200
of quieting those potential say waves or that modulated reconstructive wave as you put it.

2284
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:14,200
Is there some perhaps relationship between that and the, the sense of say oneness, say

2285
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:19,200
with the world or the outside, what's outside the brain?

2286
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:26,200
Yeah, when you go, I think, I think I kind of get the Zen Satori experience.

2287
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:33,200
When you go to the, in the context of Berkson framework, but when you go to meditation.

2288
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:42,200
Yeah, that's just another whole subject matter what's actually going on there.

2289
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:52,200
Obviously the, the Berkson framework, which that says we're a four dimensional being to be were embedded in this

2290
02:28:52,200 --> 02:29:02,200
holographic field in which we have no actual difference distinction from lays a framework for lots of things that can happen in meditation.

2291
02:29:02,200 --> 02:29:15,200
You know, but I just haven't really gone into that whole subject of how meditation or the brain waves and how it's operating.

2292
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:18,200
And I don't, I just haven't gotten into it.

2293
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:23,200
Actually, I don't think there's all that much understood really to go into it.

2294
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:36,200
I mean, I know you have people like, you know, the biology of beef and these kinds of books that are written, but no, I'm, I'm just not.

2295
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:43,200
I'm just not, it's just, it's just a bridge too far for me to walk over.

2296
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:44,200
Yep.

2297
02:29:45,200 --> 02:30:02,200
I'll say also, I'm jumping around a lot here, but one of the, one of the interesting videos on your channel as well deals with the holographic theory of mind and how it relates to a holographic principle more broadly.

2298
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:10,200
And what I was surprised by was how those two things are actually, in your opinion, not compatible.

2299
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:11,200
Right.

2300
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:16,200
Yeah. Can you, can you talk about that a little bit?

2301
02:30:16,200 --> 02:30:17,200
Hmm.

2302
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:20,200
I can.

2303
02:30:20,200 --> 02:30:22,200
Probably wouldn't, wouldn't.

2304
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:24,200
Pictures would have been good, but.

2305
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:25,200
What's up?

2306
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:39,200
See, Susskin, I mean, I looked at Susskin's stuff on it and, you know, they're, they're trying to

2307
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:52,200
describe the hologram as being on a two-dimensional surface, some, somewhere, basically digital, like bits.

2308
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:53,200
Okay.

2309
02:30:53,200 --> 02:31:05,200
So volume, you know, and they're expressing, we can express all the information of the, in the universe, volume wise, in terms of bits on a two-dimensional surface.

2310
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:06,200
Right.

2311
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:24,200
First of all, I have major problem with their bits because, as I noted to you before, bits are a massive abstraction that don't exist except over some sort of concrete embodiment.

2312
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:31,200
It's like, you know, to represent a bit, it takes tons of transistors on a breadboard.

2313
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:35,200
It takes magnetic cores and more stone age philosophy.

2314
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:44,200
Something is very concretely, you know, doing voltage changes or whatever to represent those.

2315
02:31:44,200 --> 02:31:47,200
And we're looking at it and say, ah, that's a bit.

2316
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:53,200
Well, what is that on a surface of a black hole for God's sakes?

2317
02:31:53,200 --> 02:32:02,200
What is, what is, what is your bit other than highly imaginary piece of information stuck mentally on your black hole?

2318
02:32:02,200 --> 02:32:06,200
I mean, you know, it's, it's not a breadboard.

2319
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:13,200
It's not a, it's, it's not a, oh, we can see even worse if you look at Cubis.

2320
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:15,200
It's even worse.

2321
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:25,200
You know, now you have LC circuits that are, you know, with resistors and capacitors that are representing the qubit.

2322
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:30,200
I mean, like with Joseph, Joseph, Josephus and junctions.

2323
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:33,200
I mean, come on, you know, that's your bit.

2324
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:34,200
That's your qubit.

2325
02:32:34,200 --> 02:32:35,200
It's on a black hole.

2326
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:39,200
What, you know, not that there's all kinds of instantiations of Cubis, but they're all worse.

2327
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:41,200
But that's number one.

2328
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:46,200
Number two, what, what the heck is the reconstructive wave?

2329
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:55,200
What is the source of the reconstructive wave that's beaming through your two-dimensional surface to project the three-dimensional world?

2330
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:56,200
Okay.

2331
02:32:56,200 --> 02:33:07,200
Four, and then problem C, where, how do you introduce time into this thing when you have a whole series of flashes of your reconstructive wave?

2332
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:12,200
Do you have projection after projection after projection to create the coffee stirring?

2333
02:33:12,200 --> 02:33:19,200
Oh, how is these bits, how are they suddenly becoming concrete coffee cups with liquid in them?

2334
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:21,200
Stirring, rotating.

2335
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:22,200
Come on.

2336
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:27,200
I mean, you know, when you, when you look at the conception, it's ludicrous.

2337
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:34,200
So it does, it is not Bergson's conception of a holographic field.

2338
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:39,200
Suskins 2D hologram.

2339
02:33:39,200 --> 02:33:41,200
Sorry, but not the same thing.

2340
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:46,200
Not even, and not even worth looking at.

2341
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:48,200
See, you got me in my head.

2342
02:33:48,200 --> 02:33:50,200
No, that's okay.

2343
02:33:50,200 --> 02:33:51,200
I mean, you're passionate about it.

2344
02:33:51,200 --> 02:33:52,200
I get it.

2345
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:59,200
It's something that I have to do a lot more research on and try to understand better myself.

2346
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:10,200
So the idea that they're going to use the holographic principle is somehow, somehow it's got something to do with mind and consciousness and holographic theory is just, just insane.

2347
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:12,200
Gotcha.

2348
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:14,200
I just lost my, my light.

2349
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:16,200
So we're coming up on time.

2350
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:27,200
The question, like what question I would say, one of the last questions I want to ask you is, how is this, this theory Bergson in general?

2351
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:32,200
I mean, you've been a fan of Bergson's for decades now.

2352
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:35,200
How is this conception?

2353
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:44,200
How does this influence your day to day life or your moment to moment existence, if it does at all?

2354
02:34:44,200 --> 02:35:13,200
Well, if I were to say spiritually, it would, it would, it would say, hey, I for one think that science, physics, psychology, cognitive science, given Bergson's framework absolutely backs the spiritual vision of man.

2355
02:35:14,200 --> 02:35:24,200
The Zen vision, if nothing more, but probably also the Hindu vision of what our actual capabilities are.

2356
02:35:24,200 --> 02:35:42,200
I mean, when I say Hindu vision, I'm thinking of people like saints like Ananda Maima, you know, or Yogananda that could read anyone's thoughts or, or could.

2357
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:51,200
You know, Ananda Maima supposedly stopped the train engine with a wheel spinning on a train platform.

2358
02:35:51,200 --> 02:36:11,200
But that's another, in other words, I think that there's no conflict between science and this whole notion that's permeating people's minds right now that neuroscience says we're just human robot forms with no spiritual component whatsoever.

2359
02:36:12,200 --> 02:36:26,200
It is utterly destroyed by Bergson and gives us a very solid grounding in science and our own mystical experience that supports it.

2360
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:33,200
So I guess bottom line from, from that perspective, Bergson is a great comfort.

2361
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:49,200
And if people want to shed the transhumanist vision of where they were, where they were, the idea where we're all getting nice bunch of chips, because it's just all we really are anyhow, and just become enhanced robots.

2362
02:36:49,200 --> 02:37:07,200
And also there is no, there's no God, there's no karmic laws and etc. etc. that they'll get into Bergson and you can, and you'll see quickly how just shallow and superficial and ununderstanding they, you know, they actually are.

2363
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:24,200
They don't include people like Sam Harris or Daniel Dennett, etc. These are, these people are in my mind are extremely badly misled because they extremely do not understand the problem of consciousness and time.

2364
02:37:24,200 --> 02:37:42,200
That's one thing. After that, it's been a giant pain because, because I never thought that after 50, what are we 50 years that this particular conception would be so buried yet.

2365
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:54,200
It's, it's buried in cognitive science that no one wants to look at. It's, it's buried in memory theories, buried in perception theory. It's buried by the Gessonians for Christ's sakes. They won't even look at it.

2366
02:37:54,200 --> 02:38:09,200
It's buried by the Bergsonians for that matter. Even, even Bergsonian philosophers, who can't deal with it. I guess, feel it. They don't want to deal with it. Oh, it's too, too much. Can't deal with that.

2367
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:21,200
Well, it's become, it's become a frustrating pain. And I feel like my life's mission has been a bust. So I feel right now, I'm just telling you that's true. It's been a good, it was a good try.

2368
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:30,200
Maybe someone later will come along and take it. Because right now, to me, it's, it's, it's completely being ignored.

2369
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:47,200
Yeah. Well, I'm glad I, you know, it's your life's passion or part of your life's passion. And you've, you've picked up the torch. It sounds, it seems like from Bergson on this, and try to keep his ideas alive. So

2370
02:38:48,200 --> 02:39:00,200
Yeah, well, you know, I'm a little different from Bergson in that respect. I mean, he, he watched himself be buried, you know. Along came Skinner and his, and his rats.

2371
02:39:00,200 --> 02:39:01,200
Sure.

2372
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:22,200
And after that, the computer model of mine, I mean, the complete antithesis, the absolute computer being the absolute embodiment of the classic metaphysics, the realization almost the wet dream realization of how we can instantiate the classic metaphysics as quote mind.

2373
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:36,200
I mean, he, he, he watched that. He didn't see the computer thing coming, I'm sure, but I got to live through that one. Yeah, it's still there.

2374
02:39:36,200 --> 02:39:48,200
All right, Steve, is there anything else? Anything you want to leave us on? Tie this thing up in a bow? Where can our viewers, how can people learn more about you and your work in Bergson?

2375
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:49,200
Well, yeah.

2376
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:56,200
My I have a little website. It's Steven E Robbins.com STPHN.

2377
02:39:56,200 --> 02:39:58,200
I'll put it below. Yeah.

2378
02:39:58,200 --> 02:40:25,200
That's all it's got all my articles on it. It's got a link to the, the videos, the videos I think is the same channel, I think, Steven, Steven, Steven, Steven E Robbins, I'd have to flip out and look at it, but

2379
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:33,200
Yeah, so yeah, I'm, I have stuff there that people can look at.

2380
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:34,200
Yes, you do. You have your website.

2381
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:40,200
It's probably like 20, it's probably like 20 academic articles, you know, yeah, academic journals.

2382
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:54,200
They're all it's all linkable. I'll link in the description below your website, your YouTube channel. And I, I think I might parse out a couple of my favorite of your favorite videos of yours to share with with my audience.

2383
02:40:54,200 --> 02:40:57,200
So Steve, I want to say thank you so much for your time.

2384
02:40:57,200 --> 02:41:11,200
It's been great energy. This has been fun is so much to think about and kind of let's steal in my brain to try to make this all congeal. But thanks again, and this has been a wonderful time, wonderful conversation.

2385
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:16,200
Oh, it was great fun, Carl, isn't it? I do hope people get something out of it. Enjoy it.

2386
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:18,200
I'm sure they will.

2387
02:41:18,200 --> 02:41:19,200
All right.

2388
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:20,200
Thanks, Steve. See you.

2389
02:41:20,200 --> 02:41:21,200
See you later.
