0	2960	You know, you take it as something like the free energy principle, you try to think,
2960	4800	okay, what's even more fundamental than that?
4800	5680	What's behind that?
5680	6960	What's below that?
6960	8240	What kind of feeds into that?
8240	14080	I have to say, also, you won't get more fundamental or simple than the free energy principle.
14080	20080	When you realize that your environment is composed of other things very much like you,
20720	27520	right, when you're young, your mom or as your own or your colleagues and your friends and your
27520	30880	family, I think that's interesting because now we're getting to a much more symmetrical
32160	36880	sort of relationship between me and the environment and certainly in this context,
36880	39680	you know, most of my universe is basically you and me.
39680	46400	So now there's a certain kind of symmetry in play, whereas you are my environment and I am
46400	51680	your environment and yet we both have gelatine models of our environments, which basically means
51680	55760	I have a gelatine model of you and you have a gelatine model of me, but the best way to minimize
55760	64640	surprise when I surprising signal that generated by things like me, namely you, is to ensure that
64640	68640	I was much like you as possible so that I can predict what you're going to do next,
68640	70160	because that's what I was going to do next.
70160	72640	And exactly symmetric is so for you.
72640	76080	So that basically means that we come to share a gelatine model,
76080	80880	a shared narrative we're seeing from the same PIM sheet and everything becomes mutually predictable.
80880	84480	What it doesn't describe though is the going back to your
84480	89280	firelight zone and the man in the nice hell, the epistemic hell.
89280	93360	So if it was the case that we could become completely mutually predictable and just keep
93360	99120	on singing the same song together for hour after hour after hour, that will become boring.
99120	103920	And at this point, I think you're now into sort of social neuroscience and joint free energy
103920	111760	minimization that can sometimes lead to quite paradoxical results or
111760	117600	understandings of the way that we search for information or engage with people.
117600	122000	On the one hand, I want to make my world as predictable as possible, so I don't get any
122000	123200	nasty surprises.
123200	127200	So I'm going to go to those kinds of news channels, I've talked to this kind of person,
128080	132480	because I think that we have a lined frame of reference, we have common grounds,
132480	133760	we speak the same language.
134640	140160	On the other hand, I'm going to be compelled to be slightly curious about other ways of thinking.
141520	145600	It's not, you know, we're not all going to merge into one massive community and we are
145600	148960	one massive hive mind, one massive collective intelligence.
148960	154480	It's not going to work because we are compelled to, you know, what would happen if I looked at it
154480	157360	this way? Or what's that kind of person like? What's this culture like?
158320	163040	So, you know, I haven't got any answers, but there's a really, really interesting
163040	167760	field of information in sort of social neuroscience.
167760	171840	Professor Carl Friston is a world-renowned neuroscientist and researcher.
171840	176720	He is best known for his work in developing groundbreaking statistical methods and mathematical
176720	181680	models to understand the workings of the brain and how it gives rise to complex behaviors.
181680	186000	Our discussion mainly tackles his free energy principle, which states that the brain is
186000	189920	constantly working to minimize the amount of free energy in its system.
189920	194160	According to this principle, the brain is a predictive engine that is constantly trying
194160	198720	to make accurate predictions about the world in order to minimize its own uncertainty.
198720	203360	If you got this far, please subscribe and I hope you enjoy our conversation.
203360	204960	Professor Friston, thank you for coming up.
205600	206640	Thank you for inviting me.
207200	212640	Yes, it is a pleasure. For the folks watching this on YouTube, I just want to say they should
212640	217440	know that you are one of the most cited scientists in the world and have made, you know,
217440	219920	monumental impacts on the field of neuroscience.
219920	224160	So, it is the highest honor, honestly, to be speaking with you today.
224160	225440	And thank you so much for coming on.
226160	227920	It's very gracious for you. Thank you.
227920	230720	Yeah. And, you know, your time is very valuable.
230720	232480	So, I do want to jump right into it.
233040	237120	And as we discussed over email, the primary focus of the conversation
237120	238960	will be on your free energy principle.
239520	242080	So, I think it will be awesome as it is discover.
243280	245760	Let's maybe set the table, so to speak.
245760	250560	Could you provide a high level, sort of simple description of the free energy principle?
250560	253360	And then I have a number of specifics to ask you about it.
254640	259760	Right. So, when confronted with that challenge, I normally say there are two ways you can
259760	269200	know description. So, there's a sort of intuitive low road approach, which I'll describe first.
269200	273840	And then there's the appreciation of the principle from them through the lens of a
273840	276720	physicist to understand self-organization.
276720	285360	But from the point of view of a psychologist or a neuroscientist, we're talking about a very
285360	293680	longstanding way of formulating our capacity to make sense of our world in terms of being able
293680	300960	to predict. So, these ideas go all the way back to Plato and probably Kantian in nature,
300960	305200	but probably best articulated by Helmholtz in the 19th century.
306240	310800	In the sense that perception is a constructive act.
311680	318320	It is, in the words of people like Richard Gregory, it is the brain actively constructing
318320	323600	explanations, hypotheses, fantasies for what might have caused my sensations.
324160	331040	So, this is very much, as Andy Clark would say, an inside-out process that you're creating a fantasy,
332400	338800	an explanation for what I would have seen if this was the right explanation.
338800	347840	And then you're using the actual sensations to correct, update, revise your internal hypothesis,
347840	353440	your internal fantasies. On that view, you could regard the brain as literally a fantastic organ.
353440	360560	It's a purveyor of fantasies that are trying to make sense of the lived world, or at least the
360560	370160	sensed world. And if you cast that in terms of inference mathematically, abductive reasoning,
371120	379680	and write down the rules that would have to obtain if we were in the game of inferring the
379680	385760	causes of our sensations, then you get to a formalism that can be described in terms of
385760	391680	optimizing a quantity called variational free energy. And this quantity is quite ubiquitous in
391680	398160	statistics and machine learning, also known as an evidence lower bound. And it simply scores the
398160	408080	surprise that is inherent in any sensory evidence or any sensation. And we use that surprise, if you
408080	416480	like, to revise our beliefs. And that mathematically can be written down as minimizing free energy.
416480	423360	So all that you can think of in terms of what constitutes a good brain, and possibly a good
423360	430160	mind, can thereby be described as trying to minimize free energy or minimizing surprise.
431360	436080	You can understand that in terms of the average surprise, which would be uncertainty.
436080	441600	So all of this is really saying, it's a mathematical statement, that self organizing
441600	448800	sentient system, look as if they are trying to minimize uncertainty, trying to find the most
449840	454720	the best guess, if you like, the best hypothesis for the causes of their sensation.
455680	461360	You can understand this in a very generalized sense. You don't have to think of it in terms
461360	464960	of sentience, you could understand this is just a kind of homeostasis.
465840	471280	Both your body and my body is in the same game of trying to minimize surprising deviations from
471280	478160	states of being. And we do so, certainly at the level of physiology, by trying to keep ourselves
478160	487520	within prior ranges of states, a temperature or blood sugar and the like, that would be very
487600	491760	surprising if we found ourselves outside those regimes under very, very cold or
493200	499200	in some kind of physical extremists. So that would be, if you like, a sort of biological
499200	506080	perspective of the energy, the physicist would come along and say, okay, there are certain,
506080	512960	or possibly quite remarkable systems in my universe that seem to restrict themselves to
512960	519200	certain characteristic states of being. They have a peculiar capacity to resist
520000	524800	the second law of thermodynamics, which I should say just applies to some closed systems, but
526960	531680	I think it's a useful concept here in relation to this notion of homeostasis.
532240	539040	So what characteristics must these systems possess in order to keep themselves within
539040	543600	characteristic states, technically, mathematically, of course, a pullback attractor,
543600	549520	is it just states of being that look as if they're attracting certain systems so that
549520	554720	they gather themselves up and keep themselves within these characteristic states. And it turns
554720	563680	out if you write down the equations for the dynamics of these kinds of systems, then you can
564240	570160	explain or you can describe these in terms of a variational principle of least action that just
570160	577120	says you're always trying to flow down gradients established by these surprises, these prediction
577120	584080	errors that's quantified by the free energy. And that's a really nice, or that has a very nice
584080	593680	interpretation. Because mathematically, this surprise is the negative of what statisticians
593680	601120	would call log evidence. It is a quantity that measures the goodness of your model,
601680	607440	of the negative of this goodness of your model, which is simply the probability of my sensations
608320	615200	given a model of how I think those sensations were generated. So this is exactly the same kind
615200	620400	of generative model you'd find in generative AI or say large language models and the like.
622400	631280	So that sort of gives you a theological gloss on this free energy minimizing process.
631280	636880	There's just a way of describing self-organizing systems that have this particular capacity
636960	642560	to organize themselves and resist this entropic dissipation on dissolution, decay and death.
643840	649600	And you can describe this as effectively looking as if they're trying to maximize the evidence
649600	658000	for their models of the world. So this can either be read as basically gathering evidence from my
658000	666160	own existence if I am a model of my lived world, also in philosophy by nicely denoted
666160	671680	self-evidencing. So it's a special kind of self-organization that can be read
671680	677280	as self-evidencing in the sense of gathering evidence from the way I think my world works
677280	683200	and how I operate within that world. So those would be two sort of perspectives on the same
683200	688880	phenomenon. Yeah, it's wonderful. Thank you. That's a great summation. And we're going to dive
688880	693440	into this and we're going to slice this up in many different ways. But one thing that I haven't
693440	698640	heard and I've listened to many of your podcast interviews and watched some of your presentations
698640	703840	and read your papers. What I haven't heard yet is what is the origin story of the free energy
703840	710720	principle? How did this all come together for you? I know you have a long history in the field,
710720	718640	but was there an aha moment or a eureka moment at some point? When did this kind of all start to
718640	725600	come together? What was the origin of this idea? Well, I think the first thing to say
725600	731920	in response to that question is that this idea has been around for, if not millennia, certainly centuries
732960	740480	and has been increasingly formalized and simplified. So there could be many starting
740480	746000	points to this story and each will have their precedent. So this is a legacy and a legacy of
746000	752960	what? Well, you could argue it's a legacy of ideas proposed by Helmholtz and refined by psychologists
752960	760640	like Richard Gregory, notions of analysis by synthesis and all sorts of the brain as a
760640	765600	constructive organ, statistical organ and trying to make sense of its world that you'll find in
765600	770800	the 20th century. Ideas which were taken up to great effect in machine learning by people like
770800	778000	Jeffrey Hinton and Peter Diane, they actually invented a Helmholtz machine that had this sort of
778880	788160	this Bayesian mechanics under the hood, borrowing from another legacy left by Richard Feynman,
788160	794000	which was the technical, resolving the technical differences of doing this kind of
794720	798720	this kind of inference, hence the variation of free energy that he brought to the table
800160	807840	in the context of quantum electrodynamics. Personally, it all started to make a lot more
807840	816800	sense when reading the work of people like Raj Rao and Dana Ballard. That story was a
816800	822800	predictive coding story, but it transpired that this was just another way of telling the same
822800	827120	story, but you are using a slightly different rhetoric. So the prediction errors in predictive
827120	835920	coding just are a measure of free energy under certain simplifying assumptions. But the key insight
837520	843680	in the late 90s was that exactly the same objective function could be used to describe
844320	850080	both perception in the spirit of predictive processing as championed by people like Andy
850160	858880	Clark and predictive coding, but also the learning, the updates to connection strengths
858880	864400	of the kind that you'd find in machine learning, but also you find natural intelligence and
865120	873200	experience dependency in the brain. The thing that I found particularly intriguing was that
873200	877760	if you just stood back and I repeat, so looked at this through the lens of a physicist,
878640	884240	you could also explain all of action through minimizing exactly the same quantity.
884880	893440	So bit by bit, everything that needed to be explained sort of fell into the camp of
893440	898640	it's just minimizing free energy. And everywhere you looked, everything could suddenly be very
898640	906000	simply explained in terms of minimizing free energy, attention, and even in the past few years,
906400	912160	your natural selection is just another free energy minimizing process. So this is,
912960	916160	I haven't really answered your question in this period which we've asked because
916160	924720	there was no one moment. But every few years, I certainly get a nice aha, oh, it's just another
924720	933120	instance of minimizing free energy. And then you write a paper usually using numerical simulations
933120	937600	with a bit of analysis to say, well, this is another way of looking at it. And it looks very
937600	943840	much like this kind of thing. Because it's all, if you like, a reflection of the same fundamental
943840	950720	process of self-organization. Can you give us a sense of, I guess, the scope of this discovery?
950720	957040	So as far as I understand it, it explains, you know, process of dynamic happening in the brain,
957040	962800	which is the most complex object that we know of in the universe. What is the simplest scale?
962800	970960	What is the smallest, say, dynamic or thing that would adhere to this principle? Does that make
970960	975840	sense? Like, basically, what is this principle start? Yeah. Yeah, no, I just wanted to interrupt
975840	981680	to congratulate you on the question because that's the second focus of many colleagues
983280	988800	in vertical biology and physics. So I'm thinking here, people like Mike Levin and Chris Fields
988800	996800	and Jim Glazebrook. So that is, that's absolutely key, I think, that notion. It does this apply
996800	1001360	to a particular thing? Or does it apply to everything? And if it applies to everything,
1001360	1006560	what scale does it apply? And does it apply at every scale? And the answer should be,
1006560	1013040	it's scale invariant, and it applies to everything, literally. And that sort of
1014000	1021120	perspective is being championed, I repeat, by my colleagues, Mike, Jim, and Chris,
1021120	1025840	in the context of quantum information theory, on the one side, on the point of view of physics.
1025840	1032480	But on the other side, there's this story, which I think is very nicely articulated by Chris Fields,
1034800	1039200	it is time to remove the bright lines between physics, biology and psychology. They're all
1039280	1044000	just the same thing. And you get this notion of basal cognition, which is something I think Mike
1044000	1051440	Levin has brought to the table, that all self-organization can be read as this kind of basic
1051440	1057920	sentence, this sort of basal cognition, that is just a reflection of the existence of things.
1058480	1064640	And this may sound a little bit like an overstatement, but the interpretation
1064720	1071520	of self-organization, in terms of the interpretation of self-organization as self-evident thing,
1072160	1079360	is a relatively straightforward consequence of the individuation of anything from the rest
1079360	1088800	of the universe. And this separation appeals to what is now a little literature on Markov
1089360	1094080	Blankets, in this particular context. So the Markov Blanket is just a definition of
1094080	1099760	thingness, where you start with the notion, okay, I want to explain the states of something.
1099760	1105440	And then you ask, well, what's a thing? Now, maybe you have to appeal to
1106080	1111920	scrolling and formulation of boundaries. Can you explain what goes on within the boundaries
1111920	1116880	of living things? And of course, as soon as you say that, you realize it's the boundary that's
1116880	1123520	the important structure that allows you to individuate something from everything else or no thing.
1125600	1132640	And indeed, if you just then look back with that view on what you learned at school,
1132640	1136000	in terms of physics, you suddenly realize how important that boundary is,
1136000	1144480	let's say the heat path in physics, for example. So wherever you look, there's this crucial notion
1144480	1153280	of a separation, an individuation, and simply by thinking carefully and articulating formally
1154000	1159360	how you would define that boundary. There is, if you like, a partial separation from
1160320	1163600	states on the inside of something and states on the outside of something.
1164400	1170400	But there's a two-way traffic across this blanket or this boundary, this Markov boundary.
1171200	1177120	And this two-way traffic enables you now to describe the internal dynamics or dynamics on the
1177120	1185040	inside as holding beliefs about probabilistic subpersonal beliefs about the outside. And it is
1185040	1192720	that that enables you then to assign this free energy functional to belief structures in the brain.
1193840	1199680	And you can do this for anything. You can do this for a droplet of oil. You can do it for a virus.
1199680	1205520	You can do it for a person. You can do it. In fact, I've just signed off on a wonderful paper
1206960	1215280	by my colleagues, Saugir and Lanceter Costa, where they've actually applied it to the biosphere.
1215280	1221920	So the same maths unfolds. Once you've identified the separation of something from anything else,
1221920	1230320	you just apply this mechanics as Bayesian mechanics. And then you can interpret the
1230320	1237120	self-organisation in terms of sense-making and self-evidencing and an implicit or a description
1237120	1244240	of that sense-making in terms of belief updating by minimising this surprise or maximising this
1244320	1253360	Bayesian model evidence. So it can be applied to single cells or it can be applied to the biosphere.
1253360	1257120	So it should apply to everything. And Saugir, that's what Chris Fields would say,
1257120	1262880	at what level of analysis then it comes to quantum information theoretic applications of the emission.
1263760	1268080	Yeah, that's fascinating. I'm familiar with Chris Fields' work. I've read some of his research
1268080	1272960	and actually spoke with Michael Levin a few weeks ago. I interviewed him. Yeah, we actually covered,
1273040	1278000	I mean, in great detail, one of his papers, I think it was 2019 paper called the Computational
1278000	1284000	Boundary of the Self. I don't know if you happen to see that, but he has this visual cognitive
1284000	1291760	light cones, sort of the boundary, the assumed boundary of nested cells, let's say, all going
1291760	1297520	all the way down to the cell. Say the cell, then you have ants, then ant colony, and it sort of,
1298240	1302160	he brings up just fascinating ideas around collective intelligence. All intelligence is
1302160	1306320	being collective and stuff like that. So yeah, a little bit, those things I'm quite a little
1306320	1312480	bit familiar with. So it's great that you could call them out. Can you define, one thing would be
1312480	1319600	great to get some definitions down. Can you define free energy? So I believe in a thermodynamic sense,
1319600	1326320	it's the amount of available energy for a system to do work, because a simpler, perhaps one of the
1326320	1331040	simpler definitions for it, is that applied in the same way in your free energy principle?
1332480	1342000	Yeah, again, an excellent question. Yes and no. So the functional form of the variational free energy,
1342000	1346560	and that's why I tend to say the variational free energy, so that we do not misinterpret it as a
1346560	1353520	thermodynamic free energy. The functional forms are identical, and they inherit from the same kind
1353600	1362400	of physics and probability institute dynamics. However, thermodynamic free energy is, I think,
1362400	1370720	a very particular application of this kind of mechanics to certain systems. So it is, you know,
1370720	1377600	I think, from the point of view of, you know, so somebody is not a physicist, I think it's
1377600	1384960	important to say that the variational free energy is an information theoretic measure. It has no
1384960	1391440	commitments to joules or Boltzmann's constants or anything of that nature. So it's very much like
1392320	1400640	a statistical measure, like you're a variance or an average or an entropy. So the free energy has
1401440	1409280	a free energy is just defined effectively in terms of a relative entropy, or sometimes known as a
1409280	1420080	KL divergence, and a constraint or an internal energy. So the variational free energy is talking
1420080	1425680	about probability distributions, it's talking about information, and crucially it's talking about
1426400	1434080	information about things. And then we come back to the central foundations of the Markov blanket,
1434080	1439040	and separating the inside from the outside. So the whole point of the free energy principle
1439680	1446720	is that you can interpret the inside states as holding information or probabilistic beliefs
1446720	1451920	about outside states. So this is, if you like, something quite fundamentally different from
1452240	1456720	Shannon information on the surprise of finding the brain in this state. So the brain will have
1456720	1465280	two kinds of free energy, it'll have a variational free energy, which is a comment about its goodness
1465280	1472000	of fit or its beliefs about what's going on outside, which a statistician would understand,
1472000	1480320	but it will also have a dynamic free energy in terms of the actual metabolism and electrochemical
1480320	1489520	signalling, and the metabolic states of the world that requires a further commitment to, I repeat,
1489520	1497920	sort of interpreting certain quantities, you know, for the amplitude of random fluctuations in terms
1497920	1504640	of thermal constructs, and applying things like Boltzmann's constant to it. So there is a difference,
1505200	1513840	you know, between the two. Having said that, I think that difference is specious on two counts.
1513840	1521760	First of all, you know, taking again a Feynman-esque point of view, information is energy and energy
1521760	1528720	is information. And at the level of analysis that we're talking about, you know, a thermodynamic
1528720	1533280	interpretation is just another interpretation. You don't need to start self-organization
1534240	1538480	if you wanted to talk to a sort of business system, the 19th or 20th century will be useful,
1538480	1548640	but it's not necessary. Another, the other point is if you did talk to that kind of thermodynamic
1549600	1556800	person, then you would find that there is a, that these free energies share the same minimum.
1557360	1567520	There is a necessary thermodynamic cost to any variational free energy minimization or
1567520	1573040	belief updating by things like that was principle. So there is a physics which really binds these
1573040	1581040	two things together. The final point of contact, or perhaps the final, you know, some of your
1581280	1586320	more technical viewers, the free energy principle that we're talking about can be
1586320	1593040	regarded as dual to James's maximum entropy principle. So James's maximum entropy principle
1593920	1601520	basically says that the universe or anything in the game of measuring anything else
1602960	1610800	will conform to the principle of a maximum entropy and the constraints. And those constraints
1611120	1616880	are what are supplied by the generative model that generates the predictions that are necessary to
1616880	1625440	provide the surprise. So the surprise part, the internal energy part of the free energy principle
1626080	1631840	is that which rests upon or is defined in terms of our world models, our generative models.
1632480	1637200	So we come back to this notion of what is a free energy? Well, it's an internal energy
1637200	1641920	minus an entropy. So where you want to minimize your free energy, you're going to maximize your
1641920	1645680	entropy in a chord which changes its maximum entropy principle, but under constraints that
1645680	1649840	you're trying to minimize the internal energy. And that internal energy just is a surprise that
1649840	1658240	we were talking about before. So on that view, I think there's a deep connection between
1659360	1665760	a certain kind of free energy in physics, but it would have to be a Jamesian kind of free energy.
1666000	1669760	What is the kind of free energy you did at school when you boiled in water, like?
1670320	1676320	Sure, yes. Okay, it's so interesting. And actually, you bring up William James' maximum entropy
1676320	1680240	principle, something that I learned about listening to one of your lectures, because I believe you
1680240	1686000	said, I think it's a quote, if I have no preferences at all, then my best bet is to keep options open.
1686640	1692160	So it's a bit of, so that's like the non-technical kind of layman's way to look at it,
1693040	1696480	which I hadn't thought of before. And I was actually thinking, and it's one of the questions that I
1698720	1702800	have for you, and it's something that I think is really interesting about this principle is that,
1704160	1710160	please correct me if I'm wrong or fill in here, the preferences are built into the
1710800	1719840	Bayesian beliefs. Is that correct? Yes, you've immediately gone into a much more glorious world
1719840	1724400	of preferences and purpose and plan of intentions. Yeah, I'm sorry, we can go there later if you
1724400	1731280	want, because it's a great place to be. But just at the moment, we've just been talking about
1731280	1741920	self-organization, self-evidencing, but what you've done is really speak to the active part of this.
1742880	1750960	So you're just to set the scene. When you look at certain kinds of systems, and specifically
1751600	1757520	systems that have very precise internal dynamics, so the random fluctuations are suppressed, or at
1757520	1762960	least at the scale of observation that you might want to apply, that all the random fluctuations
1762960	1770320	are averaged away. But these kinds of systems, basically systems like you and me, but not
1771280	1775920	systems that are very, very small and very, very hot thermodynamically, that would have
1775920	1779840	lots of random fluctuations. But if you get a big enough system like you and me,
1781360	1790640	then it is the case that the solution or the variational principles that have to be in play
1791280	1802640	in order for this separation to persist, separation of self from non-self to be in play,
1804160	1812080	and you apply it to the way that you act upon the world, then you can describe this in terms of
1812080	1818320	minimizing the free energy that you would expect if you pursued this course of action.
1818720	1825040	It's at that point, I think you get notions of preferences and how you could interpret
1825040	1832640	this expected surprise. Very much as we said before, the one way of reading expected surprise
1832640	1840720	just is in terms of entropy. But there's another way of avoiding surprises, which is just to avoid
1840800	1849440	surprising outcomes, which means complying with the constraints that were implicit in
1849440	1856160	James's constraint maximum principle. The complement of avoiding surprising outcomes
1856160	1862960	is that it looks as if I am always acting in a way that convinces preferred outcomes,
1862960	1869040	outcomes that just are the characteristic states that define the kind of states that you'd find
1869040	1876480	the inner. I think you're absolutely right that these prior preferences are just a way of articulating
1877040	1889520	the typical or characteristic states that define who I am. You can either put a teleology on that
1889520	1894320	and say, oh, this thing is behaving as if it prefers to be in these states. It's actively
1894320	1903920	choosing these causes of action, these paths into the future. The result that those consequences
1903920	1908720	are that you end up in your preferred states. On the physicist's point of view,
1912880	1918320	you start off with a system that seems to be able to occupy these preferred characteristic states
1919040	1925280	and then you work out what dynamics must these systems have. That's the deflation part of the
1925280	1930480	free energy principle. It's just a description of things that have preferred states effectively,
1930480	1935840	and these preferred states are literally the attracting set that constitutes the pullback
1935840	1942000	attractor that was mentioned before. You're absolutely right in one sense that these
1942000	1948960	preferences are part of Bayesian beliefs, but that does, if you like, commit you to a
1948960	1952880	rather teleological interpretation of the energy principle. You don't have to do that.
1952880	1958560	You can't do that. You don't have to do that. Please forgive my ignorance here, because I might
1960080	1964800	shrug my hand a little bit here, but is the brain trying to minimize free energy
1965840	1970880	because it's trying to use as much of it as possible? I know it's trying to minimize surprise
1971440	1980400	uncertainty, but I imagine something like a resourceful, greedy brain. Is the minimization
1980400	1988960	of free energy sort of like the byproduct? Is this a downstream effect, or is it the real pump
1988960	1995760	that's moving the water along? Does that make sense? It makes sense. In a sense, it's exactly the
1995760	2002320	question which I try to intimate. There are two completely contradictory answers to, so if you're
2002320	2012640	talking to a physicist, I know there's no sort of pump here. There's no aspirations to deploy my
2012640	2018000	free energy in the most efficient way. It's just that's what systems do. Systems just settle down
2018000	2024320	to a free energy minimum. That's another way. Those systems that settle down to an attractor
2024320	2029600	set them to their free energy minimum, that is their definitional attribute, the stipulation,
2029600	2038240	that is what things are. So it is no surprise that when you describe their dynamics, they'll
2038240	2042400	look as if they're trying to minimize their free energy, because that's what defines them.
2042400	2048400	But if you now talk to a biologist or a psychologist, then your description is perfectly
2048400	2055600	out. It will look as if these systems, particularly systems like you and me,
2056800	2066000	are actively trying to minimize a surprise in a resourceful way. I would actually frame that more
2066000	2074720	in terms of in a very efficient way. So if you go to Wikipedia and you say, well, free energy is
2074720	2079840	the amount of energy available to do work, I mean, that's a thermodynamic interpretation.
2083760	2089680	I don't think it's quite necessary to put that out of all the size things in quite a
2091840	2093760	but it certainly, I think, would be
2094400	2105360	you would be perfectly licensed just to interpret various parts or decompose
2105360	2111520	variation of free energy. And as for what would it look like if we just focused on this particular
2111520	2117760	part or that particular part? I think one really interesting decomposition of
2118560	2123600	variation of free energy is that which a statistician would usually appeal to. And that's
2123600	2134320	basically accuracy minus complexity, where accuracy is effectively how accurate your
2134320	2139360	predictions of the world are, how good is your explanation of these sensory data, or if you're
2140880	2144400	a statistician, sort of your empirical data that they're trying to make sense of.
2144640	2152000	The other thing, the complexity, I think, is even more interesting. So in the same way you were
2152000	2156640	talking about before, keeping your options open and maximizing your entropy in accord with James's
2156640	2163920	maximum entropy principle, the same sort of Occam's like principle emerges in terms of this
2164560	2171120	complexity term. So the complexity is just a way of lumping together part of the internal energy
2171120	2176560	with the entropy to give you this relative entropy or this KL divergence. And then to put
2176560	2185840	this very simply, what it measures is effectively the degree to which some sensory data or some
2185840	2192240	sensations or some sensory evidence changes your mind. So if you're trying to describe this as a
2192240	2199600	statistician, this is the degree to which you move from your state of privilies to your state of
2199600	2206480	posterior beliefs. So it's degrees of freedom you're using up in terms of providing an accurate
2206480	2215520	account of your data. And it is this that is minimized. Remember, free energy equals accuracy
2215520	2219920	minus complexity. So, well, actually it's going to be around negative free energy is equal to
2220640	2226320	accuracy minus complexity. So as you're minimizing the free energy, you're also, you're trying to
2226320	2231200	maximize the accuracy, but at the same time you minimize the complexity. So this is where
2231840	2238880	I think you get what you're alluding to. You're trying to accurately navigate the world
2240320	2246560	in the most efficient way possible using up the least resources. But why do I say resource as well?
2246560	2253760	Because of this link between the information and energy, you're afforded by things like
2253760	2260880	the Jinsky equality and the Handao's principle. It costs energy to change your mind. It costs energy
2260880	2268160	to create and well, to destroy information. So that complexity is also a cost. Technically,
2268160	2275600	it's also an information game, but it's also a complexity cost. So what it looks as if
2276320	2283360	a brain of this kind would be in the game of updating itself, changing its biophysical
2283360	2292000	state in a way to make predictions that are as accurate as possible, whilst at the same time
2292000	2298240	complying with complexity constraints. So do it in the most parsimonious way that it can. So hence
2298240	2307680	Occam's principle. So that would also translate into the most energetically efficient way of
2307680	2317680	making sense of the world. And if you sort of unpack that principle in terms of computation
2317680	2324960	in silico, then what that tells you is that the good computers are those computers that work on
2324960	2330800	the edge very cheaply with small amounts of electricity. They're doing it very in the simplest
2330800	2340400	way possible with a cool head, literally. So these are really interpretations of, if you like,
2340400	2347040	unpacking the terms that go into a variational free energy and making sense of them. And I think
2348080	2352480	that's exactly what should be done. It's a wonderful game. And you could also repeat that
2352480	2359520	game in terms of the expected free energy. So now you have expected accuracy and expected complexity.
2359600	2364480	And when you look at the functional forms of these terms, you suddenly see things that people have
2364480	2372640	been dealing with and optimizing for nearly a century. So for example, the expected accuracy
2373760	2382320	or the negative expected accuracy is just the ambiguity or the negative precision
2382960	2390640	that would be used to explain an efficient sampling of the world of the kind that you might find in
2390640	2396880	the visual cortex and the organization of the visual brain. The expected complexity becomes risk
2397440	2405920	of the kind you'd find in economics. It is basically the distance I move from my prior beliefs
2405920	2410000	if I pursued this course of action. And of course, we've just said that the prior beliefs
2410080	2415840	about the consequences of action are our preferences. They describe our attracting
2415840	2423680	set of preferred states. So now the expected complexity, the risk, is just scoring the degree
2423680	2430720	to which I expect to be displaced from my third states of being probabilistically speaking.
2430720	2435920	We just measure that with the KL divergence on the relative entropy. So that's, you know, that's
2436880	2444080	bread and butter for many economists. Another way of, if you're like unpacking or rearranging the
2444080	2458000	terms is in terms of what is referred to as expected information gain and expected cost. So
2458720	2468720	those two components are exactly those things that you find in the two aspects of being base
2468720	2476640	optimal. So there are two ways of being base optimal. One way is to minimize your expected cost
2476640	2483120	or maximize your expected utility or valuable log preferences. And that's the kind of base
2483120	2487840	option you'd find in Bayesian decision theory. And you can look at that as grandfathering things
2487840	2494080	like reinforcement learning and utility theory. On the other hand, though, you've got this sort of
2494080	2499760	again, this sort of, it's not ambiguity, it's ambiguity with bells on, which is the expected
2499760	2506480	information gain. And that was exactly the objective function devised at the inception
2506480	2511680	of the principles of optimum Bayesian design. So if you have the problem of designing an experiment
2512240	2518880	that's going to yield some data, and you now ask yourself the question, what's the best kind of
2518880	2525040	experiment I could possibly design that will give me the kind of information that's going to resolve
2525040	2531040	the most uncertainty about hypothesis? What's going to maximize the expected information gain?
2531040	2538000	And it is exactly that quantity, that part, that epistemic value, this measure of the resolution
2538080	2543680	of uncertainty that defines Bayes' optimality in the context of experimental design.
2543680	2549280	That may seem a little bit sort of unconnected to you and me in conversation or just walking down
2549280	2554960	the road. But of course, we are experiment, we are actively experimenting all the time,
2554960	2561360	just by looking around. The way that we move our eyes, the category every 250 milliseconds,
2561360	2566720	every little act of this kind is an experiment. So we come back now to the notion of Richard
2566720	2572800	Gregory, that perception just is hypothesis testing. What's the experimentation? It's just
2572800	2578080	palpating the world in the right kind of way to get that kind of information that's going to resolve
2578080	2584800	the most expected surprise or the most uncertainty. And you can have that at the level of
2585760	2594000	visual palpation every four times a second, or the news channels that you would afford epistemic
2594000	2603280	trust, which is probably quite a hot issue. Or the kind of, whether you've got a Wikipedia,
2605680	2615760	who would you consult? We make choices all the time in terms of what's the best way to act,
2616800	2623120	and what are the, what this notion of expected free energy brings to the table is that there are
2623840	2632480	the imperatives of a dual aspect, this pragmatic aspect that is formally this expected cost,
2632480	2638720	where the cost of the negative or the surprise in relation to my preferred states of being.
2639680	2644640	But also, to my mind, even more important is this epistemic part, this sort of expected
2644640	2649280	information gain that actually makes us all little scientists of one sort or another.
2649440	2654400	Yeah, that's incredible. I'm glad I'm recording this conversation, because I'm going to have to
2654400	2659680	listen to that a few times over to fully pull together all the pieces, because there's so much
2659680	2664320	there. I actually found this when I was doing research on the free energy principle that I was
2664320	2669520	going off and finding definitions for things, because to bring it all together is, well,
2669520	2674560	it's amazing that it incorporates so many different ideas from different disciplines.
2674560	2677920	I mean, you have your neuroscience, but you also have information theory. I mean, it's
2678720	2681600	physics, you know, you have all these different things that you're pulling together
2682560	2685600	and finding these deep truths that I think are fascinating.
2686880	2690720	Well, it's nice you said that, because that's exactly what Chris Fields wants. He wants to
2690720	2696640	sort of physics, psychology, biology, they're all the same thing. And again, you know,
2696640	2701360	when I was trying to answer your question, when was the harm moment? There really wasn't one, but
2701920	2709120	every few months you say, oh, that's just one of those. So to my mind, in a sense,
2710480	2717760	it is that capacity to accommodate very gracefully things that definitely have worked in the past,
2718480	2723680	that haven't been framed in this sort of simplifying, sort of unifying framework. It's that
2723680	2730480	capacity which lends the free energy principle of a veracity and a utility that you continually
2730480	2734880	impresses me, that when you were able to articulate something that's endured for
2735440	2740640	centuries or at least decades, that we all use in work, and that in terms of our understanding,
2740640	2748240	and suddenly fits in with the free energy principle, that to my mind is a reflection
2748240	2754320	of the utility of the free energy principle, but also interestingly, it means that the free
2754320	2759200	energy principle is conforming to itself. So if you remember, the whole point of the free energy
2759520	2765120	principle is finding accurate explanations as simple as possible. So it should provide a simple
2765120	2776800	explanation for everything. That's its foundational premise. So you shouldn't really be surprised
2776800	2783840	that you can do economics and move forward with learning. Yeah, one of your my favorite papers
2783840	2789840	is yours. I think it's the free energy principle made as simple as possible, but no simpler,
2789840	2793360	I think is the title, or it's close. I'll link to that in the description for folks who want to
2794400	2797760	read that. I may have butchered that title, sorry, but it's close.
2799360	2802400	It was Einstein's famous quote. Yes, it's from Einstein, yeah.
2803280	2807520	I even found that I didn't know this, but there's a great little article in Wikipedia called
2808240	2814640	the principle of simplicity. So there's actually people like Nick Chaitre and colleagues
2815600	2822080	have found this formalization of what comes principle. I think the free energy principle
2822080	2828480	could also be read as a dual to that kind of imperative to find the simple minimally complex
2828480	2835520	explanations for stuff. So I'd love to, I'll just focus somewhere in time on surprise,
2835600	2843120	the idea of surprise. It's central to this theory. And correct me if I'm wrong. So we're
2843120	2847360	trying to minimize surprise or slash uncertainty, right? Does the system want
2849040	2853680	zero surprise, precisely zero surprise? Or that might be, I imagine that might be impossible,
2853680	2860640	actually. So is it trying to approach zero? Is that optimally, is that better? Does that make
2860640	2867440	sense? It does, but again, you're, you're, you're asking as a, as a biologist, not a physicist.
2868160	2869520	I'll keep mixing that too, sorry.
2873680	2880960	But there is a lovely paradox here. The notice we've been saying in the past exchange that we are
2880960	2888400	compelled if we exist as certain kinds of things that have these very precise internal dynamics
2888560	2896880	to maximize information gain. So we are compelled to seek out novel novelty. We are compelled to
2896880	2906320	seek out surprising informative, informative outcomes, which needs to be contrasted with
2906320	2911520	what you've just brought to the table, which is the underlying, the underlying imperative really
2911520	2918400	is that of homeostasis to minimize surprise. So you've got this interesting dialectic here,
2918400	2926160	which just falls out of the maths, that in the service of trying to minimize my surprise to
2926160	2933360	maintain my homeostatic to keep myself within these, within these attracting sets that have a
2933360	2938800	low entropy. Remember that the entropy is just the average surprise. So if I spend my life minimizing
2938800	2946160	surprise, I am by definition, when averaged over time, minimizing my entropy, this minimizing
2946160	2952720	that's the other number of surprising physiological and mental and emotional states that I experience
2952720	2961360	during that period of time. But to do that, I have to actually go and minimize, maximize my
2961360	2968400	expensive information gain. So I'm going to look as if I'm actually very curious. So part of keeping
2968800	2976240	my home, keeping myself out of unfulfilled states and minimizing surprise, which you can
2976240	2983040	read as like this prediction error, for example, part of underwriting my capacity to minimize my
2983040	2990480	prediction error is actually to go and seek out surprising or apparently surprising outcomes.
2990480	2995280	So I will, I will be quintessentially curious, I will be sensation seeking,
2995280	3000880	I will be wanting to answer, it'll look as if I'm going to want to answer the question,
3000880	3009760	what would happen if I did that? So it is, you know, when you say we all want to minimize surprise,
3009760	3017760	we certainly want to avoid surprising sensations. Yes, you know, no deception underwrites our,
3018720	3024000	you know, beliefs about being in pain, for example, being very cold, being very poor,
3024000	3030480	being very unloved, being dead. You know, these are all very surprising states of being,
3030480	3036240	which we will in the moment avoid. But that does not mean to say that we will not seek out
3037520	3045280	those outcomes that can have, have information. So we're still very, very curious. And I say that
3045280	3049760	at length, because there was an interesting philosophical paradox called the dark room
3049760	3054880	paradox that was brought to the table around the inception of the free energy principle
3054880	3059760	in neurophilosophy. And it went along the following, well, perhaps you know this,
3059760	3062960	you probably know this better than I do, do you want to tell, tell your viewers what it was?
3063840	3066080	No, I wish I did, I'm sorry, I don't know about it.
3068000	3072960	It's a very commonsensical argument, but if it's the case, you want to minimize surprise,
3072960	3077440	why don't you just go into a dark room, turn off the lights, lie down, stay there forever.
3077760	3082000	Okay, that's kind of an idea, question ahead, why not just jump off a cliff, right? That's,
3082000	3087280	you'll know, the surprise will be over and then that'll, yeah, for extreme, but.
3088480	3094560	Yes, it's interesting that. So why don't we do that? And yet we go bungee jumping.
3095360	3103440	This is interesting. Yeah, let's go. Jumping off cliffs and bungee jumping are, you know,
3103440	3108560	they should be explainable under the free energy principle. And of course there's a crucial,
3108560	3113600	there's a crucial difference between the bungee jump and the jumping over a cliff.
3114320	3120720	But to come out to the dark room problem, I repeat, it's just the paradox that why don't surprise
3120720	3129920	minimizing machines or artifacts or systems basically sequester themselves from their environment
3129920	3135440	and close their eyes or turn the lights off and remove themselves from any particularly
3135440	3141440	surprising sensations. And the answer to that, well, there are a number of different answers
3141440	3146640	depending upon how seriously you take the question. Well, less serious answer is, well,
3146640	3151680	that's exactly what I do every day when I go to bed. So it's not quite that surprising.
3151680	3154160	Interesting. Yeah, that's a good counter. Yeah.
3155120	3161040	But, you know, ignoring the fact that we do need some downtime. And there are good reasons for
3161040	3166880	that, which come back to this separation of free energy into accuracy and complexity.
3167760	3172640	But more importantly, the first thing I do when I go into a dark room, imagine, you know,
3172640	3177520	you're at a conference and you go back to your hotel room and the lights don't work in your hotel
3177520	3183200	room because you can't find the switch. So, you know, what tells you first of all, the first thing
3183280	3188880	you do, you and I would do as free energy minimising creatures in the future, minimising the expected
3188880	3195120	free energy, maximising my expected information gain, it's a turn on the light. That's the first
3195120	3203280	thing that any free energy minimising system would do. And the second thing that that little
3203280	3209440	analogy tells you is that if you can't find the light, you just kind of feel your way around.
3209440	3217600	So, again, this is exploration, this curiosity that is coming to the imperative to resolve uncertainty.
3218560	3224000	Remembering that uncertainty is average surprise. So, in resolving uncertainty, you are minimising
3224000	3231280	your expected surprise. But this is about outcomes in the future that are not yet witnessed. So,
3231360	3242240	again, when you talk about things I do, then you are now talking about the imperatives that
3242240	3248640	underlie action upon the world and the consequences that live in the future. And in those instances,
3248640	3255280	it's all about minimising uncertainty. When you're talking about things, you know,
3255280	3260560	my states of being, surprise, it's just a measure of my state of being, it's just a likelihood of
3260560	3270720	these sensations given my model, my predictions of the sensations at this point in time. So,
3270720	3276160	they're fundamentally different ways of using the notion of surprise. I hope that makes sense. It's
3276160	3281920	probably a little bit over answered. I've over shared. No, no, it's great. That was useful. I mean,
3281920	3288000	it is something that I think that's why I wanted to remain at this, on this topic, on this level,
3288000	3293120	because it is, I think, the area where I still still have the hardest time
3294000	3301680	intuiting the difference between information gain and minimising surprise. Those two things,
3301680	3308400	they seem counter, or they seem like, you know, you can't have both, right? But I think it's
3308400	3315280	partly perhaps a problem of language in terms of like assigning a positive or negative valence
3315280	3321280	to the term surprise. So, something like, like an example, so I was thinking about this the other
3321280	3325360	day, if you won the lottery, if you had a winning lottery ticket, right, you won $100 million,
3326960	3333360	that's extremely surprising, and also very good, right? But it seemed to be counter to
3333360	3339520	minimising surprise, right? So, but I think it's a difference of scale, perhaps, like,
3339520	3347600	it's like the difference between perhaps the overall model and a particular event within
3347600	3352720	that model, you know, you know, perhaps using that example, could you possibly help
3354000	3359200	help me into it, sort of the difference in where, or these tensions kind of resolve?
3361760	3365520	Well, I think you've identified, well actually, it's a wonderful, let's talk about winning the
3365520	3369760	lottery, which is very surprising. Yes, I left you some day.
3373360	3380880	But also, I think just to reiterate what you implicitly just said, that, you know,
3380880	3388800	the word surprise is applied to many different constructs, sometimes more anthropomorphic and
3388800	3397360	sometimes less. So, when surprise is used in the context of the free energy principle or
3399120	3404960	and mathematically, it has a very specific and very deflationary meaning, it's just the
3405680	3414480	negative log probability of some data given your model of how those data were caused. So,
3414480	3421920	it's a measure of the implausibility of getting these data given a particular commitment to how
3421920	3426240	you think these data were generated. So, I repeat, it's probably best thought of as a
3426240	3433200	prediction error, you know, I've got some outcome, and I had a prediction of that outcome,
3433200	3438560	and the surprise is just the measure of the mismatch or the distinction, discrepancy between
3438560	3447760	my prediction and what I actually observed. This is also known as the prival, a l, an information
3447760	3455920	theory, a term coined by Tribus. More formally, more generically, it's also called self-information.
3455920	3463600	It's just a negative log probability of an event conditioned upon the model or the context in which
3463680	3471840	that event occurred. So, I think that's, if I was talking to, you know, students of
3471840	3476400	physics or information theory, I wouldn't use the word surprise, I'd use self-information because
3476400	3484320	immediately they know that the expected self-information is entropy of a Shannon sort.
3484320	3491280	So, when I talk about minimizing self-information, I'm using that as a shorthand that's saying,
3491280	3500320	I'm trying to describe systems that resist a tendency to dispersion of their states. So,
3500880	3507200	notice that this is, again, because it can be very confusing, again, this is, if you like,
3507200	3511600	almost the opposite of James's maximum entropy principle, and there's a reason for that because
3511600	3518400	what we're talking about here is the entropy, the average self-information or the average surprise
3519360	3531120	of actual outcomes, of real deterministic variables that constitute technically the
3531120	3537840	sensory states of my Markov blanket, the way that the world impresses itself upon me.
3538560	3542800	So, this has nothing to do with beliefs or probability distributions. It's the surprise
3542800	3548160	afforded this outcome, and I want to, you know, being a good homeostat to you,
3549040	3555520	cybernetics notion, I'm going to want to make sure that everything that the world impresses
3555520	3561520	upon me is within the bounds of, you know, that something like me can take, and this is just
3561520	3568480	a statement basis again. So, that kind of entropy, we're trying to minimize. So, remember before,
3568480	3573280	we were talking about James's maximum entropy principle, but the entropy was about the beliefs
3573280	3578240	about the causes. It wasn't about the actual outcomes. So, this is, again, if you like,
3579520	3583920	a dialectic or a paradox. On the one hand, they're trying to minimize the surprise or the
3583920	3595360	self-information of my, of the actual outcomes that the world impresses upon me, but when it comes to
3595680	3604240	the Occam's principle view of free energy minimization, I'm now going to try to maximize
3604240	3610400	the entropy of my beliefs about the causes of that. So, it is complicated, and perhaps I
3610400	3619520	won't should apologize for that. It's a little bit, it's a same kind of like dialectic that you get
3619600	3625600	into if you commit to James's maximum entropy principle as the right way of measuring things
3625600	3631440	and understanding things. Then you have to say, well, hang on a second. I thought the whole point
3631440	3638720	of biological self-organization was to resist the natural tendency to an increase in entropy.
3638720	3644720	I thought the whole point of Schrodinger's formulation of life was to minimize entropy. So,
3644720	3650160	who's right? Schrodinger or James? Well, they're both right. It's just that the entropy of the
3650160	3656800	things I talk about are completely different. James and the free energy principle are talking
3656800	3666400	about the entropy of measurements and beliefs. Schrodinger and homeostasis and syllogetics,
3666400	3677520	for example, are talking about the entropy of outcomes, of measurements, of the data that you
3677520	3687520	use to make your inferences and build your beliefs and update your beliefs. So, it's a fascinating
3687520	3695200	sort of yin and yang, and it really forces you to think about the nature of these mathematical
3695200	3701120	descriptions and to what they pertain. So, things like entropy and surprise and self-information
3701120	3707600	are just attributes of probability distributions. So, you have to say, of what? Is it the outcomes
3707600	3713520	or is it your beliefs about things? And with that sort of in mind, weighing the lottery,
3713520	3720640	is that surprising? Well, if you imagine the probability of it happening to you being surprising,
3720640	3728400	I can see that you might think, oh, that's highly implausible. So, it's not. It is very surprising.
3729040	3736000	On the other hand, if you believe that you are the kind of lucky chap that good things happen to,
3736000	3741200	which you have to believe in order to actually self-evidence your way, predict your way into
3741200	3745360	being a happy chap and that good things happen to you, winning a lottery is not that surprising.
3745360	3749200	That's the kind of thing that happens to people like me. I'm a successful New Yorker.
3749600	3754160	And I wouldn't be that surprised because that's consistent. It's egocintonic.
3755120	3762320	Winning the lottery is not going to put me in a truly surprising state that if I had a car accident
3762320	3769360	or I had a stroke or my partner let me, these are truly surprising things. Winning the lottery
3769360	3774080	is not surprising because it doesn't take me out of my comfort zone, my attracting center,
3774160	3780160	my callback attractor. Furthermore, I'm not sure that this example works so well,
3780160	3789600	in practice, but certainly you can now, if you win the lottery, if you did actually win the lottery,
3789600	3794800	that actually reduces a lot of surprise in terms of what you're going to do next.
3796080	3803440	So, that puts you in a certain position with a certain attitude of ways forward and ways of
3803440	3810240	behaving, which actually resolves uncertainty about whether you're going to be able to pay these
3810240	3814880	bills, whether you're going to be able to support an elderly relative, whether you're going to be
3814880	3819600	able to pay for your children to go to college. All of these uncertainties are exactly what
3819600	3825280	you're trying to actively resolve, but if you're very rich, a lot of those uncertainties resolve
3825280	3831040	themselves. So, that kind of, if you like, expected surprise, which is all about the surprise that
3831040	3835200	attends the things that you're going to do, is actually resolved by winning the lottery.
3836000	3842880	So, winning the lottery is both good of that simple level of analysis. I'm sure if you actually
3842880	3846320	speak to people that actually won the lottery, you probably get a very different impression,
3846320	3852240	but at least at this level of analysis, it's both good and surprise minimizing.
3854000	3858400	That's interesting. Right, it depends on the frame, almost the frame of reference,
3859040	3864160	which state are you looking at it at. Are you familiar? Just came to mind the other day,
3864160	3868160	as I was thinking about this principle. Do you ever watch The Twilight Zone?
3868800	3869440	Yes.
3869440	3875760	From back in the day, there's an episode called A Nice Place to Visit and Spoiler Alert for anyone
3875760	3881680	watching, but it's an old show, so if you haven't seen it by now. But basically, in the episode,
3881760	3888160	a thief, a robber dies and it goes to heaven, and they're a gambler. They like to gamble. So,
3888160	3894560	in a casino, basically, the way it works is they win every game at the casino. They're playing
3894560	3900400	craps, they're playing blackjack, and every time they win, right? And the robber is happy. You
3900400	3904800	know, he's like, oh my god, this is amazing. Everything I play, it's so great. And then,
3905600	3910000	please stop me if you've seen this episode already, but for folks watching, he's happy at first,
3910000	3914720	but then it goes a month later and he's sitting at the table and he's bored out of his mind,
3914720	3920560	right? He's winning every time and he's just like, oh, I won again. Like, oh, why even play, right?
3921360	3925760	And maybe you think about this, I mean, maybe this is completely off, but in the fact that
3925760	3931120	there's no more surprise in the games that he's playing, right? So he's lost all of the will,
3931120	3935040	basically, to go on. And of course, at the end, you find out he's not in heaven, he's in hell,
3935040	3940320	right? He's got everything that he wanted, but it wasn't the right thing that he wanted,
3940320	3944960	sort of, you know, the lesson in the story, I guess. But maybe think about this a little bit,
3944960	3952720	because basically, the surprise is zero. And actually, all the veil, it's only a negative
3952720	3958480	outcome, really, for him. You know, he hasn't realized that the folly of his actions, you know,
3958480	3964240	there's no more hypothesis testing happening here. Every time it's the same thing and what a dull life
3964240	3968480	to live. And maybe think about this a little bit, and please tell me if that's anywhere close to
3969520	3972480	this idea. I know it's art. I know it's different. It's television, but...
3973920	3979520	No, I think that's spot on. I hadn't seen that episode. That's a marvelous, marvelous story.
3979520	3988480	I know you're absolutely right. So this is, you know, not only do you see this in psychology,
3988480	3994160	but when you start to simulate, you know, little animals minimizing their sanity, you see exactly
3994160	4002640	this kind of behavior. And as you say, it's just the fact that the expected surprise entails
4005360	4014400	the motivation to do those things that resolve uncertainty. And if you're denied the opportunity,
4014400	4019920	because there is no more uncertainty to resolve, there's no more curiosity out there. There's no
4019920	4025680	more epistemic importance. There's no more expected information gain that you expect because you know
4025680	4031440	everything. And this keeps happening the same again and again and again and again. That would be awful.
4032480	4040640	You know, when you actually simulate it, you actually can simulate little artifacts who just
4040640	4047040	get so bored. They do nothing. And certainly if you have, you know, once they attain their preferred
4047040	4054640	state, so they're maximized their expected utility or minimized their expected cost,
4055440	4060000	because there's nothing to shape their behavior, because there's no now reducible uncertainty
4060000	4065440	out there. There's no more, there's no more epistemic affordance. There's nothing to do.
4066400	4071280	They just sit there and do absolutely nothing. And that must be an awful situation to be in.
4071920	4079680	And I say that because, you know, 99% of your life is not chasing, you know, if you are a mouse,
4079680	4084720	cheese, it's not putting yourself in a position where you're going to win the lottery. It's actually
4084720	4092880	indulging in your curiosity. The very fact you're doing these podcasts, having this exchange,
4092880	4098880	is just an expression of the fact you are compelled to be a curious creature. So this
4098880	4104160	is part of our makeup. And if we didn't do this, then, you know, at least from a mathematical
4104160	4111120	perspective, it's highly unlikely that we would exist over an appreciable period of time. So,
4111120	4116720	yes, I hadn't seen that episode, but I love the twist that you end up in.
4117680	4122400	Yeah, he was a thief, so he deserved it.
4125040	4129600	So about the, let's see here, I'm trying to figure out where we're going to go.
4130640	4133280	I believe there's two ways, right, to minimize prediction error.
4134800	4140240	They were change the model to better fit sensory input, and or change the world,
4140240	4144320	act on the world in order to better fit the prediction. But I wasn't sure, are these two
4144320	4148640	mutually exclusive? I mean, do you have to choose between the two? And if so, how does
4148640	4155360	the system decide which one to do? Right, so we're now at a sort of more elemental
4156080	4161520	application of the energy principle, just to understand the fundamental, you know,
4161520	4166480	the fundamental drives to both perception and action, and you face up beautifully. So,
4167440	4175520	if we now simplify things, and then just read surprise and free energy in the moment
4175520	4180320	as prediction error, then there are two ways, as you say, that I can minimize my prediction error.
4180320	4185680	I can either change my mind, so my prediction error has become more like the sensory data at hand,
4185680	4192320	or I can act upon the world to solicit some more or a different set of sensory input that are
4192320	4198240	closer to my predictions. So what would that look like? It would look as if I am basically
4198240	4202480	acting to fulfill my predictions, which is what I meant before, is that if you weren't
4202480	4210400	optimistic, successful New Yorker, if you didn't have that prior, that optimism, that sort of
4212160	4219440	optimism bias, then you wouldn't be able to act in a base optimal way, because you need
4219440	4225680	to fulfill your own predictions to survive. There's something quite fundamental about that,
4225680	4233040	but at the level I think we're talking, the kind of self-fulfilling purposes we're talking about
4233040	4240240	are very sub-personal. So all we're talking about, basically, is effectively reflexes. So,
4240800	4248320	when we move, when we talk or move our eyes, what's happening is that we're sending predictions
4248320	4257680	down to the Pontine nuclear to the spinal cord about the kind of signals we're getting from
4257680	4265360	the state of our body. Technically, it's called proprioception. And if I predict that I'm going
4265360	4270560	to be moving in a particular way, I would expect to get these signals from my muscles.
4271920	4277600	And if I don't get them, there's a prediction error. So by acting, all I mean or all that one
4277600	4282880	means in this setting is that you send these prediction errors back to the muscle so that
4282880	4287920	it contracts to the right length. So it sends the signals that you predicted. So this is just
4287920	4299280	like a thermostat. It's just like feedback control that we find in many, many devices.
4299280	4304880	All you need to supply is the set point, the temperature you want or the length of the muscle
4304880	4311120	you predict will happen. And then the body does the rest. So this is how a very sort of elemental
4311120	4319760	level of just moving around. You can understand action, motor action, motor being the use of
4319760	4325040	particular kinds of muscles as minimizing prediction error or minimizing free energy.
4325040	4334640	So it's not quite this more deliberative kind of action. It's not how do I imagine myself
4334640	4340960	behaving tomorrow or generally unfolding in this conversation. We're talking about action in the
4340960	4346880	moment as basically eliminating prediction errors, reflexes very, very, very quickly.
4346880	4351200	So in answer to your question, how do we decide which to do? And are they
4353600	4357440	mutually exclusive? They're certainly not mutually exclusive in the sense that the whole point
4358240	4363360	of this explanation of action and perception and the action perception cycle
4364080	4370240	is that there is a common theme. It's just all driven by minimizing prediction error
4370800	4377440	or minimizing free energy in a more general context. However, in practice, I think you're
4377440	4384080	absolutely right that we do seem to be built to switch between the two. So in principle,
4384080	4387920	you could do them both at the same time. In principle, you could dynamically adjust your set
4387920	4394640	points and your reflexes could try to fulfill those set points or those predictions and the
4394640	4400800	two could go hand in hand contemporaneously. But in fact, in practice, it looks as if there was
4400800	4409360	actually a turn taking. And it looks as if certainly sort of larger mammals have a very
4409360	4414480	particular schedule of turn taking. I mean, this may sound very specific, but I think it's really
4414480	4421440	interesting that it speaks to the cognitive moment. So it looks as if if we just take say vision,
4423200	4431760	then our vision, certainly active vision, where sometimes it's kind of active sensing,
4432880	4439600	where we actually have to go and palpate and select little parts of the visual scene,
4439600	4443920	bearing in mind, we can only actually see a very, very small part of the visual scene
4444480	4450080	without, you know, with high resolution in our familial representations. So basically,
4451120	4454800	although we think we can see everything, we're not, we just see little patches and we're knitting
4454800	4461120	it together in our heads. It's fantasy that I can see everything. That's not true. You could see
4461120	4465680	something if you looked over there. And that gives you the illusion that you can see everything.
4466320	4471680	In fact, you can't. So this is part of this sort of debate as a fantastic organ, having a fantasy
4471680	4479280	you can see all around me. You can't, you have to go and get the most epistemically rich,
4479280	4485680	maximize the expected information gain, arts of the visual field to knit together and to
4485680	4491760	accumulate the right kind of information that builds your hypothesis about the scene that
4491760	4497200	I'm currently constructing in my head. But this process happens very, very quickly. So we move
4497200	4504480	our eyes about four times a second. Interestingly, well, yeah, he's amazing. But it's also, well,
4504480	4509040	I've had even more amazing is that everything seems to be about four times a second. And by
4509040	4512640	everything I made, if you were a mouse, you wouldn't really be using your eyes so much,
4512640	4519360	you'd be using your whiskers as your burrows in the field. And you whisk about four times a second.
4519840	4527280	If you are talking, you produce little chunks of information called phonemes about four times
4527280	4532480	per second. When you're listening, you're listening about four times per second. When you sniff,
4533680	4538960	you sniff it about four times per second. The way that we sample, the way that we sort of
4540320	4546160	gather our information from the world, seems to have this very saltatory aspect that you're
4546240	4550880	roughly at four hertz, technically a theta rhythm. We seem to be going to sample in the
4550880	4558400	information. But even more interestingly, during the action, during the actual movement itself,
4559520	4567600	the way that you adjudicate between changing your mind and updating your, allowing your brain to
4568640	4572400	revise its beliefs by changing its neural activity to provide better predictions.
4572640	4581440	During movement, you actually attenuate the consequences of that movement to enable you to
4581440	4585680	act. So this is a really interesting phenomenon called sensory attenuation.
4587440	4593680	But simply, if I had the prior belief that I was going to lift my arm,
4594640	4600240	and I didn't ignore or attenuate the prediction errors that were coming from my arm,
4600240	4606240	telling me my arm is not moving, then I wouldn't be able to lift my arm because those predictors
4606240	4613680	would come and revise my beliefs. Oh, no, my arm's not moving. But if I can ignore the sensations
4613680	4620160	that I am going to generate, then I can use my reflexes to fulfill my predictions that my arm
4620160	4627760	is actually raising. So in order to move, I have to attenuate the prediction errors that are,
4627760	4632560	if you like, undermining my predictions. And this is called sensory attenuation.
4632560	4640160	And it's beautifully exemplified in eye movements. So if you now look at this finger,
4640160	4646640	and then it's the card to this finger, whilst you were moving,
4646640	4649680	saccading and moving your eyes from one finger to the other finger,
4650880	4657280	you were suppressing and attenuating all the prediction errors. I know that because you didn't
4657360	4663680	see the massive optic flow, the shift of the world induced by moving your eyes.
4663680	4669200	You can actually see it, if you press your eye, this is Helmholtz's famous experiment,
4669200	4674800	if you just gently nudge the outer edge of your eye, you'll see the world shift around.
4675680	4681760	Huh. I don't want to push it too hard. I like being quite careful of the viewers at home,
4681760	4690080	don't poke your eye out. Okay. Yep. Can you see the world just jump around a little bit?
4690080	4696480	It does, yeah. So that's because your eyes weren't causing the motion,
4697520	4702800	and you were able to actually register and attend to that visual motion, that visual,
4702800	4707360	if you like, retinal slip. Exactly the same signals were being generated when you were
4707360	4713520	moving your eyes with your eye muscles. You didn't see that. You didn't see the world jump.
4714240	4720800	All you saw was my finger, and my finger again in a different position, the world had not moved.
4720800	4727200	So you were actually attenuating your sensory prediction errors, your visual prediction errors
4727200	4733440	during the movement. That's called saccadic suppression. It's a remarkable capacity of the
4733440	4740400	brain to temporarily suspend attention to self, the consequences of self-generated
4742480	4749040	sensations. And this happens everywhere. It's a wonderful explanation for the phenomena
4750800	4756000	when you've got two children in the back of the car, and he hit me hard, and I hit him,
4756000	4761040	and the escalation and the argument came out absolutely right, because when they're hitting,
4761840	4767440	they attenuate the sensory information from the reports, how hard they're hitting.
4768160	4775760	So they actually feel being hit as more intense than they feel they're doing the hitting.
4775760	4781280	So they're just like a little arms race, they just ratchet up, and this is due to sensory
4781280	4786080	attenuation. You could actually use that metaphor for a political excitation.
4786080	4790080	Sure. Is that related to, I know if you've ever heard this, I actually don't know if it's technically
4790080	4794400	true. I think it is. I've tested it out. I've asked people to test this out. How you can't tickle
4794400	4802560	yourself. Yep. Yep. The same kind of. That's a brilliant observation. So that example comes from
4802560	4808000	people like Daniel Wolpert, who I think is now actually in New York, and Sarah Jane Blakemore,
4809200	4817840	and trying to understand the remarkable, first of all, it is remarkable you can't tickle yourself
4817840	4823520	because you're attenuating the consequences of self-generated behavior. So in a sense,
4824160	4830080	the fact you can't induce visual motion by moving your own eyes with your eye muscles
4830080	4835840	is an example of that. But you can circumvent that by tickling your eye, by using something you're
4835840	4841760	not used to, which is your finger. So it is exactly that notion. You can't tickle yourself,
4842720	4849200	which explains this little experiment. It's actually devised by hell health, so you can
4849200	4854640	perform on yourself. The interesting thing is that what Sarah and colleagues and Chris
4854640	4862320	Frith were pursuing was that people with schizophrenia have great difficulty
4864080	4870400	in this kind of sensory attenuation in another paradigm called the force-matching paradigm,
4870560	4881840	which means that people, there may be certain psychopathologies that interfere with your
4881840	4889120	ability to suspend attention to the consequences of your own actions. So for example, if you had
4889120	4895840	inner speech and you heard yourself because you were not attenuating the consequences of your
4895840	4903200	inner speech, you might then try to explain away these unattainuated auditory or pseudo auditory
4903200	4909840	inputs as if somebody else was speaking. So this is the notion that Chris Frith bought the table
4909840	4918240	as an explanation for auditory hallucinations. If you were able to sense your own movements
4919040	4926960	and were not, if you moved and you were not able to attenuate the sensations of movement,
4928640	4932560	it might feel as if somebody had caused your movement. So you've got this phenomenon made
4932560	4939280	acts. So there are all sorts of very quite frightening experiences that would ensue if you
4939280	4945280	failed to have this sort of turn-taking between action and perception, especially at this very,
4946240	4953760	very fast time scale. And some of these frightening consequences, one could argue,
4953760	4959600	are seen quite frequently in many guises in psychiatry and in the neurology. For example,
4959600	4967280	Parkinson's disease, an abnormality of dopaminergic neurotransmission, where dopamine in this context
4967920	4977200	is thought to affect the capacity to do this kind of sensory attenuation at a particular level
4977200	4983680	in the motor system, and therefore subverting your capacity to realise your intentions to move.
4983680	4987520	So what would that look like? Or it would look like somebody who can't initiate an act.
4989040	4992480	And that, of course, is one of the common symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
4992560	4998640	So this adjudication between acting and perceiving, quickly going out there,
4998640	5002640	moving actively, ignoring the consequences of that movement until you get there,
5002640	5008560	and then fixating, not moving, getting the information, sorting it out, doing your processing,
5008560	5012560	and then starting again, the cycle of action perception, where you have actually got the
5012560	5020320	separation in play, at least from a biological perspective, seems to be a sort of ubiquitous
5020800	5027360	way that we actively sense our world, or actively make sense of our world, and is very,
5027360	5034880	very reliant upon this notion of selective attention, sensory attenuation, to get that dance
5034880	5042080	between action and perception exactly right. Sure. That reminds me, if I tell you just a
5042080	5046960	personal anecdote from last summer, it was a random day, I was out on my fire escape
5047600	5054240	eating smoke meal, and, you know, I do this in some days, and all of a sudden,
5055040	5062560	there was, I live on a one-way street, but coming the opposite way was a police chase.
5062560	5070960	There was a dark SUV being chased by a cop car. And I remember the first, second, or two,
5071680	5079280	where I was looking over at what was happening, I didn't quite see the vehicles.
5080000	5089840	I saw what I can describe as like a fuzzy black cloud. It took a second or two for my brain to
5089840	5096800	catch up to what was happening, and to construct a car being chased by another car. It was very
5096880	5101280	bizarre, because I mean, it was highly unexpected, right? It just doesn't happen every day.
5102000	5107760	And I'm not sure if that's a common thing with people who see things that are extremely uncommon,
5107760	5115200	but I did have that, and perhaps I was just getting into sort of the perceptual science
5115200	5119760	literature and reading about the stuff, so perhaps it's hard to disentangle that from
5119760	5127280	expectations, let's say, but I mean, it really stuck with me as, you know, one, confirming,
5127280	5131600	although it's well-confirmed, obviously, in the science, but that this is what our brain is doing,
5131600	5137200	is constructing, you know, correcting for errors, because that's a, you know, highly uncertain,
5137200	5142720	or really surprising thing to happen, and my brain in real time took a second or two to
5143440	5146800	cohere and make that a solid, those solid objects.
5147360	5154320	Yes, well, that's a wonderful story. And, you know, as you say, I mean, it really speaks to the,
5154320	5162480	you know, the brain as a constructive organ, as an organ that really is trying to actively
5162480	5168720	make sense of what's going on, and sometimes in a bigger situation, that can take many,
5168720	5175760	many seconds. So you would also, I think you may be able to rediscover that remarkable,
5177920	5181760	if you like, suspension of the fantasy that we can perceive immediately,
5183280	5189840	sort of see yourself seeing using things like ambiguous figures. So psychophysicists have
5189840	5194400	a whole range of really beautiful experiments, you know, using ambiguous figures and different
5194400	5202560	kinds of illusions that deliberately put you on the edge, so that you can experience
5202560	5207120	the sense making and all the sort of settling down a option or another option, you know,
5207120	5213120	resolving the fuzzy cloud into, ah, yes, that's the percept that makes the most sense in this
5213120	5218000	instance. And sometimes it's, you know, when you're looking at ambiguous figures, for example,
5218560	5223360	sometimes it stops making sense, and you cannot voluntarily stop yourself
5223360	5231120	seeing the other interpretation. So, you know, famous two faces or a vase example. So, you know,
5231120	5235920	I think these kinds of experiments, that kind of experience really do speak very powerfully
5237200	5242960	to the kind of experiments you can do at home to convince yourself you've got a very
5242960	5250080	fantastic organ, but it takes time to construct the fantasies in situations which you're not
5250080	5258000	used to. And either you'll wait until you experience a police car chase, or you can go and look at some
5258800	5265040	sort of illusory stimuli devised by psychophysicists. I should just add though, if my
5266000	5271040	erstwhile colleague Alan Hobson was here, he'd just remind you that, you know,
5272000	5278000	if you want evidence that your brain constructs all your percepts, just think about dreaming.
5280240	5287120	That is such clear evidence that our vision is actually something we built from the inside.
5288000	5294320	And it's just gently constrained by, in the form of prediction errors, the actual sensations.
5295040	5302240	Then just think about your visual experiences, you know, during dreaming.
5302800	5306400	So, I want to ask you about that. While you're dreaming, let's say having a
5307440	5310400	standard dream. I don't know what a standard dream is, but you know, let's say having a
5310400	5315200	typical dream where you're in it and you're non-lucid, let's say, and you're out and you're on the
5315200	5321680	beach or something. Is there, and so while you're in the dream, you're experiencing it,
5321680	5325120	you're not realizing it's a dream, you're not realizing that you're constructing the
5325120	5333920	environment, the beach. So, is there, in a sense, a Markov blanket between your personal,
5333920	5340560	your first-person experience in that dream and the dream world? Or is that making it
5340560	5347680	like, am I getting fuzzy here? I mean, is there technically the same thing or is it different?
5347840	5357920	I think, technically, it is the same thing. It's just, you know, you introduced a really
5357920	5363520	challenging issue there, that you know that you are dreaming or not. I mean, sometimes you do
5363520	5368720	know you're dreaming, certainly as you're moving into lucid phases or sort of only working, making
5368720	5374320	up. So, I'm just thinking, you know, a proper answer to your question would have to accommodate the
5374320	5385520	fact that you perceive and you act in this world, and yet you're not aware that you are actually
5385520	5390880	dreaming. And that must, as you say, induce a whole series of Markov blankets. First of all,
5390880	5397200	you're sequestered from the sensorium. So, you know, the biological state of dreaming
5397200	5402240	rests upon a particular kind of sensory attenuation, which is very enduring, unless for many hours,
5402240	5406800	if you're sleeping halfway. But it's mediated by the same neurochemical, the same modulated
5406800	5411200	neurotransmitters that we were talking about before in relation to Parkinson's disease,
5411200	5417040	different kinds, but basically the same kind of functional role. So, basically, you're switching
5417040	5426320	off sensory import from the periphery upon the body. So, you're now letting your brain free wheel
5426320	5435680	in terms of generating predictions and resolving, in a hierarchical context, where you're resolving
5436320	5442960	the self-generated predictions by other parts of the brain, trying to explain them away. So,
5442960	5449280	effectively, you're rehearsing your prior beliefs about the narratives that you usually
5449840	5456000	are certainly constrained by the experiences you've had the previous day. And yet, as you say,
5456000	5461120	you're not aware that you are dreaming. So, there are certain very high levels of this hierarchical
5461120	5467120	construct, or say, deep levels, if we think of centripetal like hierarchy or heterarchy,
5468480	5477680	that have dissolved that sense of presence and Belford, or no, sorry, that is associated with
5477680	5486640	the reality monitoring. So, yes, not only is there a Markov blanket established that separated you
5486640	5490960	from the sensorium, but there's possibly another higher one that separated your normal
5492560	5499920	reality checking and self-modeling from certain parts of the brain that are engaged in
5499920	5505840	rehearsing particular fantasies that you are experienced as dreams. One of the things I
5505840	5514160	was thinking about with your model, with the principle, is I can understand what the system
5514160	5521200	is doing a bit in terms of like having its own internal states. Can we think of the environment
5521200	5527840	as doing anything with surprise, or are we staying agnostic on what the environment is doing?
5528000	5543280	Right. So, again, a very leading question. So, I'm just, there's a whole other
5544080	5550000	sort of podcast under the hood. Possibly, I'm not the best person to have that conversation. There
5550000	5555840	are people who speak, I think, in an informed and very fluent way about this perspective. But
5556720	5564880	what you are suggesting is that one can appeal to the mathematical symmetry of this
5565760	5569280	way of partitioning the inside and the outside of the Markov blanket,
5570080	5577920	which has an exact symmetry. So, technically, certainly at the level of sort of basic
5577920	5585440	sentience and sense-making of the kind we were discussing earlier on, it is mathematically
5585440	5593440	true that you can also interpret the environment as inferring your internal states, because you've
5593440	5600080	got this generalized synchrony, which is another manifestation of self-information or surprise
5600080	5606720	or surprise minimization when the surprise of the measure of your sensory impressions. So,
5607120	5619040	on that view, the environment now is acted upon by you in the way that, from the environment's
5619040	5625040	perspective, render your actions sensory inputs, and the way that the environment acts upon you
5625680	5632080	is by providing you with sensory impressions. But, yes, mathematically speaking, the environment
5632160	5644080	should certainly be modeling you. There are various flavors of that truism that you could pursue.
5644800	5652720	One would fully acknowledge that there is clearly a vast asymmetry between you and your environment.
5652720	5658960	The environment is usually making it bigger. It doesn't always have the same delicate structures
5659040	5663760	or the precise mechanics that would require the sort of planning that we're talking about in terms
5663760	5670160	of the expected free energy. So, we're not saying the environment plans, but in terms of still trying
5670160	5675760	to minimize prediction errors and doing the right kind of learning about you, I think there is good
5675760	5681040	evidence. Well, you can certainly read certain aspects of the environment as doing exactly that.
5681040	5687920	So, the favorite example is the elephant path of a desire path, the shortcut that is worn by repeated
5687920	5695440	use across a grassy lawn when you're getting to what the cutter corner to walking through the park
5695440	5703520	or to your favorite coffee cafe. So, one way of looking at this is something I've done
5704720	5710240	to my environment, and I've done it with my conspecifics, and I've created a little path to
5711040	5715760	my favorite place, or the place that is the favorite of me and my conspecifics,
5715760	5722640	from the environment's point of view, it's learned a lot about the behavior of its inhabitances,
5722640	5730240	of its denizens. So, you think you are impressing yourself from the environment's point of view,
5730240	5734880	it's just a bit of plasticity, an experience-dependent kind of learning,
5734880	5740880	where it's remembering things about you. And you can take that argument right through to
5741520	5747200	those kinds of parts of the environment that are actually constructed by conspecifics,
5748240	5754000	by traffic lights, by signs that have a semiotics and sort of deontic value.
5755920	5763040	So, you could say that the lived environment you would express if you walked out onto the street,
5763600	5770800	it's all man-made, and it's all built to maximize expected information gain. I mean,
5770800	5776960	what is a sign? It is there to create an environment that states our curiosity in terms of making it
5776960	5784800	easy to respond to epistemic affordances that you're underwrite our curiosity or our plans
5784800	5789760	to maximize expected information gain. But we build that. So, then you go into the role of
5790480	5795920	into the game of cultural niche construction, the notion of the designer environment from Andy
5796240	5804480	Carr, for example. So, all of these, I'm just summarizing conversations you could have,
5804480	5810560	probably with other people who I want to. The final kind of conversation you might have is that
5810560	5816640	when you realize that your environment is composed of other things very much like you.
5818720	5823760	When you're young, your mum, or as you're older, or your colleagues, and your friends,
5823760	5831440	and your family, and your specifics on the street. I think that's interesting because now we're
5831440	5837280	getting to a much more symmetrical sort of relationship between me and the environment.
5837280	5843680	And certainly in this context, most of my universe is basically you and me. So, now there's a certain
5843680	5850400	kind of symmetry in play, whereas you are my environment, and I am your environment. And yet
5850400	5855200	we both have gelatine models of our environments, which basically means I have a gelatine model of
5855200	5859760	you and you have a gelatine model of me. Minimizing the surprise in the exchange
5860560	5869760	is one description of, can be understood as leading to a generalized synchrony,
5869760	5876560	literally a meeting of minds, a mutual predictability. The rest of all certain things, such as
5876640	5881600	communication and language, and certain common frames of reference, common ground.
5881600	5887440	But you could actually argue that in this setting, it is an inevitable consequence
5888160	5894560	of joint free energy or surprise minimization. When we put two of the things that are sufficiently
5894560	5903440	similar together, that this would be inevitable. The best way to minimize surprise, when I
5904000	5911440	surprising signal that generated by things like me, namely you, is to ensure that I was much like
5911440	5915280	you as possible, so that I can predict what you're going to do next, because that's what I was going
5915280	5921040	to do next. And exactly symmetrically so for you. So that basically means that we come to share a
5921040	5925600	gelatine model, a shared narrative, we're seen from the same hymn sheet, and everything becomes
5925600	5931520	mutually predictable. And that would be what explanation for the kind of in-group formation
5931520	5938400	and the kind of, you know, the mechanisms you might find in evolutionary psychology,
5939680	5946640	could be described in terms of niche construction. What it doesn't describe though, is the going
5946640	5953280	back to your twilight zone, and the man in the nice hell, the epistemic hell. So if it was
5953280	5957600	the case that we could become completely mutually predictable and just keep on singing the same song
5957600	5963920	together for hour after hour after hour, that would become boring. So now we come back to,
5965040	5970560	you know, what would this kind of mechanics and this way of understanding self-organization look
5970560	5977440	like when I'm packed in societies and in exchanges between different kinds of conspecifics. And you
5977440	5983040	get to really interesting questions about polarization in-group, out-group, the spread of
5983040	5989760	ideas and the spread of memes that can be simulated. At this point, I think you're now into sort of
5989760	5997520	social neuroscience and joint free energy minimization that can sometimes lead to quite
5997520	6005680	paradoxical results or understandings of the way that we search for information or engage with
6005680	6010640	people. On the one hand, I want to make my world as predictable as possible, so I don't get any
6010640	6015840	nasty surprises. So I'm going to go to those kinds of news channels. I've talked to this kind of person
6016720	6021280	because I think that, you know, we have a lined frame of reference. We have common grounds. We
6021280	6027360	speak the same language. On the other hand, I'm going to be compelled to be slightly curious
6027360	6032720	about other ways of thinking. It's not, you know, we're not all going to merge into one
6032720	6037680	massive community, you know, one massive hive mind, one massive collective intelligence. It's
6037680	6042880	that's not going to work because we are compelled to, you know, what would happen if I looked at it
6042880	6048640	this way? Well, what's that kind of person like? What's this culture like? So, you know, I haven't
6048640	6055120	got any answers, but there's a really, really interesting field of information in the social
6055120	6062960	neuroscience. Sure. It reminds me a bit about, I think you've spoken to it a bit, the Explore,
6063040	6072960	Exploit, TradeOff, EETO, a little bit because it's sort of this balance between exploiting sort of the
6074320	6081680	linearist, say, most accessible forms of energy or, say, news content, but then also having this
6081680	6087920	balance between doing that and exploring, say, other modes of thought or, you know, exploring
6087920	6093200	what else is out there and that balance, that getting that balance right. And I think you said
6093200	6098880	something to the effect once about the free energy principle that it gets, was it solves it in the
6098880	6106160	right order? Something to that effect? I think it's in the way I perceived it was or viewed it was
6106160	6110480	in order to know what's surprising, you have to know what's possible, kind of, does that make any
6110480	6117120	sense? Is that performing it? Absolutely. So, yeah, I probably said it sort of dissolves the
6117120	6121280	exploitation, exploration dilemma, but you're absolutely right, it does so in a particular way.
6122400	6130080	And it does matter in terms of the order in exactly the way you say. So, if I go to this
6130080	6140000	gambler's heaven, there's an enormous opportunity for me to resolve uncertainty and to indulge my
6140000	6146800	curiosity, to respond to epistemic affordances, which is the expected information part of the
6146800	6152320	expected surprise and the expected free energy. So, I'm going to, first of all, explore all
6152320	6157360	possibilities. What is possible in this particular new environment? I moved to a new city or I put
6157360	6163440	a new device in the kitchen. So, the first thing I'm going to do is explore by becoming a little
6163440	6170480	scientist and trying out this and that and going there and seeing what happens until I have resolved
6170480	6176560	sufficient uncertainty that there's no more irreducible uncertainty there. At that point,
6177280	6185200	the component, the expected information gain will fall below the expected costs or the expected
6185200	6194320	utility. So, I'll have innate preferences that put constraints on my exploration. So,
6195280	6203840	at the point where you literally, your epistemic expected information gain falls below the expected
6204720	6209840	value, then the expected value will take over and I will switch deterministically to exploitative
6209840	6216240	behavior. So, that means the first thing I'm going to do is explore and then, so there is no
6217200	6224080	uncertainty left to resolve and then I will exploit. So, exactly, secure the possibilities
6224080	6231920	and then just act in a way that is predominantly dictated by my prior preferences or my constraints.
6232640	6234000	Another way of looking at that is,
6234320	6246560	we are primarily surprise minimizing or uncertainty minimizing creatures, but we do
6246560	6252160	so in the constraints. The constraints are provided by our prior preferences or by our,
6253760	6259360	the constraints afforded by the fact that I would be in this state would be very, very surprising.
6259360	6270000	So, one way of looking at this resolution of the exploration dilemma is that it's not a dilemma.
6270000	6277440	In any sense, we are quintessentially exploration machines, exploration curious artifacts,
6278000	6284880	but we have constraints that we can't become dead or disabled or dehydrated or dissipated.
6285520	6292160	We can't allow ourselves to be damaged, but under those constraints, our primary
6292880	6299680	imperative is to explore. Unless, of course, there's nothing left to explore and then we get bored.
6300560	6307360	Yeah, sure. It's the train off. Are you familiar at all with, I believe it's called a number of
6307360	6311120	different things, but it's like a game theory question. So, they're called like the marriage
6311120	6317680	problem or the secretary problem. Have you ever heard this before? Yeah, so, would you like to
6317680	6323600	hear it? I don't know. Yeah, so basically the way the game works is you're looking for a partner,
6323600	6330560	a life partner, and the question is how many partners, how many people should you date
6331200	6339760	before settling on one person? How do you know the available options? I guess, how do you know when
6339760	6342960	to stop looking is kind of the question. It's also called the secretary problem. It can be called
6342960	6347920	the hiring problem because sort of like the question of, you see one applicant, you have to
6347920	6352240	say yes or no to that one applicant, and if you say no, you can't go back to them, right?
6353280	6357520	The jilted x, let's say. You can't ever go back to, apparently, what's optimal is,
6357520	6362000	and you have to know, what's interesting is you have to know kind of how long you're willing
6362560	6366400	to date. How many partners are you willing to sort of to suss out?
6369840	6377360	The answer is you basically date and you say no to the first 37% of potential partners,
6377360	6382720	or potential applicants, let's say it's for a job, and then after that point, you say yes to
6383920	6387040	the first person who's better than all the options you saw already.
6388720	6392880	It's kind of how it works, right? So it's like you have to date around, you have to kind of explore,
6392880	6397440	but even if you find someone that's incredible by this model, you're not supposed to say yes to
6397440	6403280	anybody until you've seen a little more than a third of the whole people that you're trying to
6403280	6408640	observe, and that just makes you think about EETO a little bit because it requires a certain amount
6408640	6413840	of exploration. Obviously, there's certain parameters here that are more firmly set than
6413840	6418400	you'll find for most system environment dynamics, but that there is actually technically a
6418400	6424240	mathematically precise sort of strategy that works across the board, so I just thought I'd share that.
6424640	6432480	No, I haven't heard that. That's brilliant. It reminds me of sort of evolutionary game theory,
6432480	6437520	having sort of stay wins, or tip-a-tap, like different strategies and which super things
6437520	6443840	that an evolutionist has done as well. The free energy principle. How it reacts to or how it's
6443840	6450240	related to Hamilton's principle of least action. Can you possibly make that help make that link?
6451200	6458000	Yeah, well, so the free energy principle, as we were discussing earlier on, can be regarded either
6458000	6463760	as a variational principle of least action or a constrained maximum entry principle, just depending
6463760	6472080	upon your favourite way of understanding the maths. So the variational principle of least
6472080	6478560	action just is an instance of how it's this principle of least action. Technically, both
6479200	6485280	when applying Hamilton's principle of least action, say to mechanics or movement of massive
6485280	6494560	objects, for example, what these principles prescribe is a prescription of the trajectory
6494560	6501840	or path that something will take. So you could apply Hamilton's principle of least action to
6501840	6508320	the trajectory of a ball if thrown at a particular angle with a particular velocity
6508400	6515040	from this point. And it would be the case that the trajectory caused out by that ball
6515040	6522880	would be a path of least action. It would be the path that minimised a certain energy
6523520	6531040	when averaged along that path. So this is a path integral, meaning sort of adding things up.
6531600	6536640	So the path of least action, the path of least at least resistance, if you like,
6537200	6543360	where the resistance scores the expenditure of energy because it deviates from the path,
6544960	6549680	is prescribed by the principle of least action. And you can use that principle then to predict
6549680	6557440	or to describe the most likely path that anything will take. And indeed, that sort of path integral
6557440	6563120	view is exactly where free energy, the variational free energy comes from. But here we're talking
6563120	6568880	about sort of Feynman trying to work out the probability of various paths of small particles
6568880	6576640	or electrons. So a very difficult mathematical problem that was finessed by introducing this
6576640	6584640	notion of a variational bound on the probability of a particular path in his pathological formulation
6584640	6589840	quantum electrodynamics. The math is identical to the free energy principle. And it just says that
6589840	6598560	there is a particular path through a space of beliefs that is the most likely. And in the same
6598560	6604080	way that there is a particular path, if I throw a ball, that is conforms to Hampton's principle
6604080	6614400	least action. And the space through which we're talking about how traveling now is the space
6614400	6620160	of probabilistic beliefs encoded by the internal states of something. So slightly more abstract,
6620160	6628000	it's more about the measurement thing, more like the sort of James in use of the word entropy,
6628000	6637600	or the way that James would apply his entropy to belief structures. But the mathematics,
6637600	6645280	the variational calculus is exactly the same. It just tells you, given a particular initial
6645280	6655600	condition and some sensory input, for example, I can tell you the most likely trajectory of
6655600	6662320	beliefs that would be described in terms of belief updating, for example, that will ensue
6663040	6668320	using this variational principle of least action, which is the free energy principle. It's exactly
6668320	6677440	the same math. I'm just trying to think of even more intuitive ways of describing it. It's a path
6677440	6684480	of least effort. It's just a mathematical way of describing the path of least path into the
6684480	6691920	future or the past of least effort, where the effort is effectively scored by the amount of
6691920	6704480	surprise I can avoid. Are you familiar with Jeremy England's work with dissipative adaptation?
6706320	6713920	Yes, well, I was about four years ago pre-COVID. Yes, I haven't read what he's been up to recently.
6713920	6718880	So he moved recently. He moved to Georgia, I think. Oh, really? Oh, I didn't realize he moved. Yeah,
6719760	6724560	but it's far more of it. I know it's more of a thermodynamic. It's solely, I think,
6724560	6733040	a thermodynamic, but it makes me, because one of my general interests or one of the things I try to
6733040	6738000	get to is, you take something like the free energy principle, you try to think, okay,
6738000	6742000	what's even more fundamental than that? You keep trying to cut away and say, okay, well,
6742000	6748240	how do you make this even, what's behind that? What's below that? What kind of feeds into that?
6748880	6757440	And I don't, I mean, to be completely transparent, I don't fully understand how
6757440	6761200	dissipative adaptation works. I think that's something to do with the environment,
6762560	6768480	adjusting itself to best accept the energy that's flowing through it, something like that.
6768480	6773920	But of course, it's very technical. Is that, at least, I know it's maybe been a few years since
6773920	6780160	you follow the, follow the idea, but does that, does it conform? Well, I guess it would have to,
6780160	6785760	but does this play into the free energy principle at all, or is this a dynamic that kind of works?
6787920	6792640	No, I mean, it's fascinating work. And you may also want to invite Suzanne Still
6793440	6797280	to one of these conversations who's been doing very similar work from the point of view of
6797280	6801520	sort of predictive information theory. And recently, she's also been looking at this sort of
6802480	6812880	remarkable capacity of systems to, again, resist the second law, and, you know, use their free
6812880	6819520	energy thermodynamically, but she would frame it in terms of information theory, to, if I could,
6819520	6825680	extract order from, from else. And you know, common to a lot of these notions, there's a notion of a
6825680	6834080	ratchet, that you, you, you, you, you, you can make little random jumps, but you, you, you maintain them.
6835280	6842400	And each jump is maintained. If it's heading in the right direction, you know, if they are
6842400	6848800	minimizing sort of free energy at the expense of something else. However, I have to say,
6849360	6857440	it's not really addressing the same kinds of issues that the free energy principle is addressing.
6857440	6864400	I have to say, also, you won't get more fundamental or simpler than the free energy principle. So,
6864400	6869600	I look at thermodynamics as one particular domain of application of that kind of mechanics.
6870720	6874720	The only difference between thermodynamics and the free energy principle is that the free energy
6874720	6880400	principle actually commits to a thickness, it commits to a Markov blanket. So, it's now got a
6880400	6887280	partition of states where you can start to talk about beliefs in a non-trivial sense, in the sense that
6888240	6896160	there is a morphism from the internal states of a physical system to the states beyond the heat
6896160	6900080	path or beyond, beyond the blanket. And all the more interesting questions really about
6900160	6904480	maintenance of that blanket or the heat path. It's not about the equilibrium physics of things on
6904480	6913200	the inside. Most of them are just rather uninteresting descriptions of ensembles of things on the
6913200	6918560	inside that have some particular exchangeability criteria. And then you can apply classical
6918560	6924000	equilibrium physics to that. That's not terribly interesting from the point of view of people
6924000	6929280	looking at non-equilibrium physics. And even less interesting from the point of view of people
6929280	6934960	looking at real randomly dynamical couple systems because these systems are not exchangeable.
6934960	6942400	You mentioned before that Mike Levin's description of sort of cells of cells of cells of cells of
6942400	6946720	cells are boundaries of boundaries of boundaries of boundaries. Markov blankets of blankets of
6946720	6952800	blankets of blankets. There's a heterogeneity to implicit in that scale invariant description
6952800	6960240	of actual systems that will not allow you I think to apply to adopt the assumptions that we
6960240	6967200	would have to commit to if you wanted to apply thermodynamics. So I have a missing attitude
6967200	6978160	to thermodynamics. So in that sense, trying to understand the thermodynamics of
6978240	6982720	self-organization, I think it's possibly misguided because you have to make too many
6982720	6987680	commitments to the kind of systems, particularly the exchangeability of ensembles
6989120	6995200	to make it really interesting. On the other hand, the the the questions that people like Jeremy
6995200	7001920	England and Suzanne Still more recently have been addressing are I think deeply interesting
7001920	7005520	and are not really addressed by the free energy principle. I think what you're talking about here
7005520	7012720	is the sort of the complexification that seems to be an inevitable property certainly
7012720	7017120	of biotic self-organization. You could argue other kinds of self-organization but certainly
7017120	7023760	biotic self-organization are far from equilibrium systems that have this kind of stale freeness and
7023760	7033200	implicit heterogeneity in them. I think that there has yet to be a simple story to explain why we
7033200	7042320	are becoming increasingly more sophisticated increasingly, but if we are organized. I think
7042320	7049120	that's a fascinating issue. I don't have a clear answer and I will repeat. The free energy principle
7049120	7053920	itself does not properly address that because the free energy principle starts by saying,
7053920	7060480	let's assume something has self-organized its house and attracting set. That's where it starts
7060480	7066800	and that's really where it finishes. I think if you want to think about how these attracting
7066800	7071600	sets evolve and contextualize each other, I think you're going to be in a slightly more
7072560	7076960	challenging frame which lots of people are addressing. It's a really interesting question.
7076960	7082880	I'm not sure thermodynamics is the right toolkit to address that to be honest. I think you need
7082880	7088880	to look at more fundamental maths probably quantum information theory at different scales and think
7088880	7095520	about that through the lens of say theoretical biology and evolutionary thinking. I'm so glad
7095520	7098720	you brought up quantum information theory because that's where I wanted to go next.
7102320	7107920	I was wondering if the free energy principle lends any credence to the idea or has any
7107920	7114640	relationship to, I'm not sure if you're familiar with some theories about the universe being
7114640	7119840	like a quantum air correcting code. If you're familiar at all with that landscape,
7121360	7127120	basically it's a speculative idea but looks like there's some evidence to support it that the
7127120	7133200	fabric of space-time itself is actually like a quantum air correcting code. When I hear that
7133200	7140080	and I think about the free energy system trying to minimize uncertainty, it's trying to close to
7140080	7145120	air correction or it seems kind of similar too. I wonder if there is a potential link there and
7146560	7151680	if you have any comments about that or if that's something that's come across your desk.
7152720	7157600	Well no, it literally came across my desk about three or four weeks ago so suddenly
7157600	7164560	sent me this paper on the universe being an air correcting code. I'm delighted and if I remember
7164560	7170400	the sentiment of the email was it would be great to get this chaps or this woman's take
7170400	7176800	on this in relation to free energy, theoretic formulation because it seemed as if there was
7176800	7183440	a very very close connection as you have spotted. I think the best person to comment on that would
7183440	7192400	be Chris Fields. I did quantum physics as a young man but that was 40 years ago.
7192400	7203840	I usually defer to Chris when he comes to quantum information theory. He has a beautifully rounded
7203840	7207120	perspective on these things and will probably be able to give you quite a definitive answer. He'll
7207120	7211280	probably say yes it's the same thing but then try to explain why it's the same thing. Yeah,
7211280	7219520	it's hard to link to. I can't do that. Again, I will be surprised if all of these things weren't
7219520	7226800	entirely conciliant and I probably ultimately, you know, you probably aren't going to fall back
7226800	7232400	on something like James' maximum entropy principle, certainly if you're in the quantum
7232400	7240720	information theory. You will probably find an equivalent description of the kind we've already
7240720	7246640	mentioned in terms of variational principles of least action but you may also find similar
7247440	7252240	explanations in gauge theory and ultimately category theory but they should all, I think,
7252240	7257120	be internally consistent. You should be able to sort of morph from one to the other without doing
7257120	7262160	too much damage to your governments and anyone, your favourite way of framing them. I'm sure the
7262160	7268240	other directing universe is one example of this. Yeah, this is very well could be. It reminds me
7268240	7273760	too of Chris Fields, a frequent collaborator of his is a cognitive scientist, Donald Hoffman.
7274240	7278560	I'm not sure if you're familiar with his work. I've interviewed him a couple of times on this
7278560	7284400	channel as well but one thing that you said that stood out to me and it's something that
7285360	7290080	he said as well or something similar is that we don't need to know the truth. We just need to
7290080	7294080	minimize prediction error. You know, it's like this very separate thing and I don't know if you
7294720	7300080	are familiar with it. He's got a few different theories. I mean, one of which is fitness beats
7300080	7307760	truth theorem that we've evolved in order to basically maximize fitness instead of to see
7307760	7313360	what's vertically actually there in the environment. So much of what we see is or all of what we see
7313360	7319040	is an illusion. We can never, he posits that we can never actually get to the base reality, the
7319040	7325680	base truth. And I'm sure if you have any thoughts about that or if it's something that you've come
7325680	7333040	across or if you've spoken with Don. No, I think that's absolutely right. And it sort of leads you
7333040	7338480	to interesting discussions. Should you want to go there in terms of skepticism versus realism,
7338480	7344160	internalism versus externalism and the like with philosophers, but certainly from the point of view
7344160	7354240	of the maths, the physics of this kind of sentence, it is all about making, forming or
7354240	7363280	understanding internal dynamics as encoding subpersonal probabilistic Bayesian belief about
7363280	7368640	stuff which is fundamentally hidden beyond your mark of blood, beyond your sensory veil.
7369360	7374640	It is inaccessible. It is unknowable. And I think that probably Chris Fields would frame this in
7374640	7380160	terms of holographic streams, sort of appealing to the holographic principle that, you know,
7381120	7385760	classical exchange of information across your sensory veil or your mark of blanket
7385760	7390640	can be construed as a holographic stream from the point of view of quantum information theory.
7390640	7397200	But that's the only way you can entangle a couple, two systems, you know, with classical information.
7397200	7403920	So, you know, again, we come back to this fundamental separation between the inside and the
7404000	7411040	outside, which, you know, read in terms of your conversations would be exactly,
7411040	7417040	you can never know what's out there. We don't need to. If you can keep your prediction errors
7417040	7422800	very, very small for as long as you live, job done. I mean, that's perfectly, that's perfectly
7422800	7429440	okay. It does raise the interesting issue, though, is there an outside, which would involve
7429440	7434400	philosophical issue. So both Chris and I, I think, would have to commit to the fact that probably
7434400	7440800	is an outside in order to help to actually be able to read and write to your holographic screen,
7440800	7447600	or to be able to transact with an environment, you know, in terms of in both directions over
7447600	7452320	your mark of blanket. So the free energy principle puts you in a slightly ambiguous position when
7452320	7458320	it comes to philosophy. So on the one hand, you can be entirely skeptical, everything that needs to
7458960	7466480	be done is beneath your mark of blanket within the skull bound brain. There is nothing else.
7468000	7473440	On the other hand, you're making sense of signals that are provided by something
7473440	7479840	out there. So you have to commit to at least a mathematical description of stuff being out there.
7480480	7485200	What the something is, sure. I'm just really looking at the time and I realize we've gone way
7485200	7492400	over what we had sort of planned out to go. I hope you've enjoyed this discussion. I mean,
7492400	7498960	I've gotten so much out of it, Professor, and thank you so much. Anything else you want to?
7500000	7503920	I mean, I literally have so many questions I could continue to ask you, but I do want to be
7503920	7508800	mindful of your time and energy as well. So please let me know if, you know, if you have a few extra
7508800	7512720	minutes, I can ask you a couple more. But if, you know, if you've reached your limit, please let me
7512720	7519600	know also. Please ask me two more questions and then I'm going to go and have a nice cigarette.
7520160	7525920	Okay. Oh, that sounds nice. That sounds lovely. Yeah, one of those once in a while isn't so bad.
7527280	7531680	I think, okay, okay, two questions. So now I have to really narrow it down here. But
7534640	7540640	we'll see it's a little bit. Well, one, one I'll ask you is, and I'm surprised we actually haven't
7540640	7547280	touched on it, active inference, which honestly for, I mean, maybe the first couple of weeks I
7547280	7551360	was looking into the free energy principle, I actually thought they were the same thing. I
7551360	7556000	actually think it's written in other places, I think Wikipedia maybe kind of writes them as
7556000	7561200	equivalent. And I believe active inference is a subset of the free energy principle or it's like,
7562160	7566000	well, perhaps, I mean, you could probably, you could definitely do the best job. Can you help
7566720	7571200	separate the two or help us make a distinction between free energy principle and what active
7571200	7577040	inference is? I think you could be forgiven by by using them synonymously. And so, you know,
7577840	7583680	that's how it was portrayed, I think, in the in the Wikipedia links. Having said that,
7585360	7593440	you know, in the world of philosophy, one's got to be a little bit more rigorous in the way that you
7594160	7602320	you frame various offerings. So nowadays, I mean, I am, and then one of my friends
7603280	7608080	in the philosophy are also very careful to distinguish between the free energy principle,
7608080	7612080	which is just a method. So very much like we were talking about Hamilton's principle of
7612080	7618960	least action as a method for determining the path of least action or least effort.
7619360	7625600	But the free energy principle is just what that what it is, it's just a method. It's a tool
7626240	7632160	for describing the most likely kind of active sense making or belief updating,
7634720	7642400	or, as you say, active inference. So it's not falsifiable. It's not a theory. This is a principle.
7642400	7649280	This is a tool. It's a method. If you apply that to purposeful behavior,
7649280	7653840	then you have active inference. So active inference, I think, is an application of the free energy
7653840	7663440	principle to usually simulate or predict or emulate or to model purposeful section behavior,
7663440	7669280	basically. So I've given you a long winded technical answer, but so you you can you can
7670160	7674160	so free energy principle is usually for sort of physicists and philosophers that
7674160	7678240	the fossils like to shout about it. The physicists think it's probably quite trivial.
7679520	7685120	The active inference is more an application that you might want to actually apply if you're
7688160	7693680	a psychologist or artificial intelligence researcher wanting to emulate this kind of behavior
7693680	7700560	or understand, say, given subjects behavior by fitting an active inference model to that
7700560	7705040	subjects behavior using the much more practical way. I mean, you can regard the free energy
7705040	7713760	principle as only having utility in that ability to simulate active inference. Just technically,
7715760	7720080	the only thing you get from the free energy principle is really a way of writing down the
7720080	7728240	dynamics of self organization as a gradient flow on the on the generative model on those prior
7728240	7733280	preferences on the probabilistic description of those attracting sense, which means instead of
7733280	7739840	just just looking at the way a system behaves, given its dynamics and trying to reverse engineer
7739840	7747040	its Lagrangian. What you could do is actually write down the Lagrangian as a Jamesian constraint
7747040	7751760	as a set of prior preferences and then just apply the rules of the free energy principle
7751760	7758240	to simulate the behavior of a system that self organizes to that set of attracting states on
7758240	7764320	that particular set of preferred states. That's basically what we do in computational neuroscience
7764320	7769360	and machine learning research. Okay. Thank you very much. That helps. The distinction is super
7769360	7775200	helpful. Great. Now, last question. I had to kind of a bunch of different ones. I'm like,
7775200	7780480	oh, I forgot to ask them about attractor landscapes and strange loopiness, but I will
7780480	7785360	instead ask you if you, this is more of a metaphor, this is a personal question, but
7786000	7790720	if you could give your 20 year old, 20 year old self one piece of advice, what would it be? So if
7790720	7813440	you go back. I think it would. No, I'm trying to be too clever about this. Probably to go
7813440	7824320	to the dentist more often, to be honest, if you're much less trivial answer. I think it would be
7827360	7832320	nice to do a couple of years of philosophy. I always say when people, when my children and
7832320	7837600	when my students and when other people ask me what's good career advice is keeping your options
7837600	7840880	open. You've used that phrase earlier on today. I think there's something quite fundamental about
7840880	7847280	that. As broad a foundation as possible, bearing in mind that we are all quintessentially curious
7847280	7852400	creatures. And therefore, if you omitted your academic career, you are indulging that. But
7852400	7859040	the best way to explore is to have a very broad foundation. And I managed to do that to a certain
7859040	7866080	extent. I didn't, I didn't miss out a lot of history and a lot of philosophy. And I remember
7866080	7871440	one of my mentors, Jerry Edelman, used to refer to me. I won't say fondly. He just used to refer
7871440	7881600	to me as an intellectual thug because of my lack of scholarly understanding and very little finesse
7881600	7887920	when it comes to sort of mechanical or history. So it would have been nice. I don't know what would
7887920	7892000	have happened if I had spent time doing that, but it would have been nice just to involve myself
7892000	7896560	with what somebody is and not trying to try. Sure to have that base. But there's still time.
7896560	7900880	I mean, it's not like, you know, I mean, I'm sure you're busy, so you don't have too much free time,
7900880	7908160	but you know, it's always available. Well, Professor Friston, thank you so much. This has been,
7908960	7914880	I mean, this has been amazing speaking with you. And I'm so honored, so blessed that you
7914880	7919680	take the time to speak with me. And I'm sure the audience will appreciate everything here.
7919680	7923600	And I'll include links in the description of this video for people who want to learn more,
7923600	7926160	who want to read your papers, I'll link to some of your papers and some of your
7927440	7931600	some of your presentations. And thanks again. It's a treat.
7932720	7936560	Well, thank you. I really enjoyed talking to you. And I'm going to find out how long we've been
7936560	7940800	talking. I deliberately haven't looked. I shouldn't have said anything. I wish I had
7940800	7944480	said anything now because I'm going to ask you about attractor landscapes. But no, yeah,
7944480	7947600	it has been a while and I appreciate so appreciate you going over.
7948480	7954720	Right, I shall go away thinking about attractor landscapes and what I should have advised myself
7954720	7958960	to do when I was 20 years of age. That's a great question. Bye.
