By the end of this video, you'll understand this. A Hopf vibration. You may have heard

00:07.640 --> 00:13.760
mathematician Eric Weinstein comment on Joe Rogan. Hopf. And this is going to be H-O-P-F.

00:13.760 --> 00:20.480
H-O-P-F. You are looking at the most important object in the universe. What?

00:20.480 --> 00:27.360
Discovered by Heinz Hopf in 1931, Hopf fiber bundles hop up in at least eight different

00:27.360 --> 00:34.280
physics situations. So what you are seeing is, as legendary physicist Roger Penrose put it,

00:34.280 --> 00:40.840
an element of the architecture of our world. We'll build to an understanding of the Hopf

00:40.840 --> 00:46.200
vibration and the fewest steps necessary. If you're not yet familiar with higher dimensional

00:46.200 --> 00:53.080
shapes, you might want to first watch my video explaining a 4D hypercube known as the Tesseract,

00:53.080 --> 01:00.200
linked above and below. In my opinion, hypercubes are easier to understand than hyperspheres,

01:00.200 --> 01:05.440
and that video more gradually builds from the 0th to the 4th dimension.

01:05.440 --> 01:14.640
So what's the simplest definition of a Hopf vibration? It's just a map from a hypersphere

01:14.640 --> 01:24.240
in 4D onto a sphere in 3D. How is it mapped? A sphere is fully covered by points. Each

01:24.240 --> 01:31.080
point is mapped to a circle from the hypersphere. The circles are the fibers that compose the

01:31.080 --> 01:43.240
hypersphere. We'll unpack this in a bit, but first we need

01:43.240 --> 01:49.120
to briefly cover the concept of stereographic projection, which is the process of mapping

01:49.120 --> 01:56.560
a sphere onto a plane. First, imagine a light source at the north pole of this circle in

01:56.560 --> 02:02.000
2D. As this light beam passes through the circumference, you can see there is projection

02:02.000 --> 02:09.040
of a purple point on the x-axis in 1D. Now here we have the light source at the north

02:09.040 --> 02:14.720
pole of the sphere in 3D. As the light passes through the boundary, you can see a circle

02:14.720 --> 02:21.400
is projected onto the 2D plane. Note how the circle is larger closer to the north pole.

02:21.400 --> 02:29.240
Next, we inflate a polyhedron with four colored faces. We project in all directions from a

02:29.240 --> 02:34.800
fixed point on the north pole. You can see how the faces on the sphere are projected

02:34.800 --> 02:42.360
onto the two-dimensional plane below. We are demonstrating how a circle or sphere

02:42.360 --> 02:48.440
appears in lower dimensions, so we can build intuition of how a hypersphere projects into

02:48.440 --> 02:56.760
one lower dimension, the third dimension. The top row is the view of a circle or sphere

02:56.760 --> 03:03.160
in what you might call their traditional space, 2D for the circle and 3D for the sphere. The

03:03.160 --> 03:09.280
bottom row is how that is projected onto a lower-dimensional plane. Before we explain

03:09.280 --> 03:15.440
the hop-fibration, it's important to note I'm skimming over imaginary numbers, quaternions,

03:15.440 --> 03:20.680
and the complex plane to keep this as straightforward as possible. But if you wish to dive into

03:20.680 --> 03:28.040
the nitty-gritty math, there are links in the description.

03:28.040 --> 03:33.920
In our first example, we are stereographically projecting from the north pole of a sphere.

03:33.920 --> 03:44.040
As we rotate around the circle, you can see how this one point corresponds to one circle.

03:44.040 --> 03:58.160
If we view this continuously, all of the circles fill up the hypersphere.

03:58.160 --> 04:04.120
Let's track just one point as it moves from north to south. We'll start at the equator.

04:04.120 --> 04:09.200
The red point on the sphere relates to the red circle within the hypersphere. The white

04:09.200 --> 04:18.600
torus or doughnut corresponds to connected points around an axis.

04:18.600 --> 04:23.120
As the point spins southward, you can see the circle getting smaller and tighter around

04:23.120 --> 04:28.720
the center, until it's a non-skewed circle through the south pole. As the point moves

04:28.720 --> 04:35.080
north, the corresponding circle gets much larger until, when it goes to true north,

04:35.080 --> 04:40.600
it appears as a straight line. It's hard to imagine, but this is actually a circle

04:40.600 --> 04:47.240
through infinity. This is how the circles would appear around a single axis, say the

04:47.240 --> 04:53.760
equator. It's easy to see this interaction if we look at just two complex points and

04:53.760 --> 05:00.600
their complementary circles.

05:00.600 --> 05:07.640
As you view them move around an axis, you can see how they are linked like a chain.

05:07.640 --> 05:18.220
A third linked circle joins the dance. And we can keep on adding circles to fit the

05:18.220 --> 05:26.240
entire hypersphere. Algebraic topology professor Niles Johnson at Ohio State University created

05:26.240 --> 05:31.800
this excellent visualization of the hopf vibration with its corresponding points on

05:31.800 --> 05:41.040
a sphere. Some hopf vibration facts. None of the circles intersect. Each circle links

05:41.040 --> 05:48.960
to every other circle exactly once. True south, in 3D, is a circle at the core of the hopf

05:48.960 --> 05:55.880
vibration. Visualize this as the tightest circle in the center of the torus or doughnut.

05:55.880 --> 06:02.240
True north, in 3D, is that circle through infinity. Remember, this is the stereographic

06:02.240 --> 06:10.120
projection of the hypersphere in our familiar three dimensions.

06:10.120 --> 06:15.200
While this is running, two plugs. First, if you're enjoying this video, please subscribe

06:15.200 --> 06:22.520
to my channel. And second, I highly recommend a similar visualizer and interactive tool

06:22.520 --> 06:28.880
created by Nico Belmonte. It allows you to draw your own circles within the hopf vibration

06:28.880 --> 06:35.640
and rotate the structure as well. This awesome learning tool is linked below in the description.

06:35.640 --> 06:41.200
And now we stereographically project these villarso circles on a few latitudes on the

06:41.200 --> 06:49.680
sphere. As this runs, I need to recommend the excellent resource dimensions-math.org and

06:49.680 --> 06:55.840
the corresponding Joe Slay's YouTube channel. Joe's and a team of brilliant minds created

06:55.840 --> 07:01.240
an amazing nine-part series on dimensions, which you should check out. Many of the visuals

07:01.240 --> 07:06.240
in this video come from that series, which they so graciously distributed under a Creative

07:06.240 --> 07:13.280
Commons license. Everything is linked below in the description. We then rotate around

07:13.280 --> 07:15.400
for the space.

07:43.920 --> 07:49.800
I also want to share some still images of the hopf vibration from another angle, which

07:49.800 --> 07:56.840
I think better illustrates the fiber-bundledness of the structure. While we're here, why not

07:56.840 --> 08:03.280
take a ride inside a hopf vibration? You can see all the circles which look like lines

08:03.280 --> 08:11.120
are made up of zero-dimensional points, which kind of look like spheres. As we mentioned

08:11.120 --> 08:19.680
earlier, the hopf vibration is a fundamental element across a range of physics applications.

08:19.680 --> 08:25.120
Even if you'll never understand these advanced physics concepts, I hope you gained an intuitive

08:25.120 --> 08:29.880
understanding of an essential feature of our universe, the hopf vibration.
