0	12160	Welcome back to ScienceClick, today our force is real.
12160	17040	A force is an action that changes the movement of an object.
17040	24360	Usually an object tends to conserve its motion, in particular its direction and speed.
24360	28920	Sometimes however, it happens to change direction or speed.
28920	36960	Everything happens changing its movement and we say that it experiences a force.
36960	43600	At first glance we can classify all forces in the universe into three categories.
43600	48480	First we can think of the force that pulls us back when a car accelerates, or the central
48480	53080	fugal force that pushes us to one side when it turns.
53080	58400	These kinds of forces are called inertial forces, they most often appear inside a vehicle
58400	62840	when it changes speed or direction.
62840	67560	Secondly we can think of forces that act at a distance.
67560	74000	The two main ones being gravity which attract massive objects together, and electromagnetism
74000	78600	which attracts or repels charges and magnets.
78600	83600	Finally the third category groups all contact forces.
83600	91320	These are the forces of pressure, traction, torsion and deformation, or even friction.
91320	96280	All these forces have the property of acting locally through a physical contact between
96280	100640	two objects.
100640	106240	These three categories are enough to account for all forces in the universe, but are these
106240	108280	forces real?
108280	114840	Do they exist fundamentally, or are they rather consequences of other phenomena?
114840	121960	To answer this question we'll look at each category one by one.
121960	126120	First let's start with inertial forces.
126120	132280	As an example we can imagine a passenger inside a car.
132280	137400	When the car starts to move an inertial force appears pushing the passenger back into his
137400	139180	seat.
139180	144960	From his point of view when the car accelerates a force appears and pulls all objects to the
144960	148200	rear.
148200	153600	At first glance for the passenger this force exists, it has to be accounted for in order
153600	159520	to understand why objects are drawn backwards.
159520	164320	But if he looks out the window the passenger realises he's not the only one to experience
164320	166560	this force.
166560	172000	When the car starts all objects in the universe seem to move backwards all together, as this
172000	175960	same force applies everywhere.
175960	179280	When we think about it this situation is absurd.
179280	183320	How could the car influence our whole universe instantly?
183320	187520	We would never expect to star at the other end of the cosmos to be influenced by the
187520	193680	movement of a car, and even less so instantaneously.
193680	198440	To resolve this paradox we actually just need to change the point of view.
198440	203560	Instead of saying that all objects are drawn backwards except the car we rather observe
203560	208920	from the outside and say that it's the car which undergoes a forward force while the
208920	213120	rest of the universe stays still.
213120	218240	The passenger thinks there is a force because he is observing from inside the car which is
218240	226440	itself subject to a force, the friction of the wheels against the ground.
226440	232520	This way of thinking is very general and applies to all inertial forces.
232520	238740	All these forces seem ubiquitous, they seem to act everywhere instantaneously.
238740	244160	From this we deduce that they cannot be real forces, they are only illusions fictitious
244160	253800	forces which appear because we locate ourselves in a frame which itself is subject to a force.
253800	258000	Having said that we realise that inertial forces are not the only ones that seem to
258000	260720	act everywhere at the same time.
260720	268600	This also applies to the second category, actions at a distance.
268600	271840	First let's consider gravity.
271840	277360	When we drop an apple, the apple is accelerated towards the ground and we say that it undergoes
277360	280840	a downward force, the pull of the earth.
280840	285880	As long as the apple has not touched the ground it seems constantly attracted by the earth
285880	288160	at a distance.
288160	293040	But the apple is not the only thing affected, all objects in the universe also seem to be
293040	298880	attracted by the earth as if the planet were inflicting the same force universally to all
298880	302080	bodies that exist.
302080	306560	Like the previous example, we can ask ourselves how reasonable it is to think that the earth
306560	310060	could influence the entire universe.
310060	314840	After all, as with the car, it would be simpler to say that the universe is not influenced
314840	320640	by the earth, that it is not the objects that all fall downwards, but simply the ground
320640	323520	that rises upwards.
323520	328800	Like the inertial force in the car, the force of gravity would only be an illusion, it would
328800	339400	appear when we observe from the ground, whereas it is precisely the ground which accelerates.
339400	342920	At first, this vision seems more elegant.
342920	347400	Instead of inventing a mysterious force, gravity, it suffices to say that it is the
347400	349600	ground that rises.
349600	354160	Objects seem to come closer to the ground, not because they fall, but because the surface
354160	359400	accelerates upwards.
359400	364160	Having said that, it's easy to see that this explanation alone is flawed.
364160	371160	Indeed, if it were the ground which accelerated, why wouldn't the planet grow bigger over
371160	372160	time?
372160	376760	If the ground indeed moves outwards, we should observe that the earth expands and it would
376760	380200	eventually blow up.
380200	384600	Yet earth has not changed size for billions of years, and objects continue to fall at
384600	387600	its surface.
387600	392320	The answer to this problem is very subtle, and constitutes one of the most shocking discoveries
392320	395200	in modern physics.
395200	401240	The ground does rise, its surface is constantly accelerating outwards, because it is pushed
401240	406040	by the pressure of the materials that make the earth.
406040	411840	If the planet does not grow, it is because the space all around it, the fabric in which
411840	420160	it is contained, shrinks in the opposite direction.
420160	424120	This phenomenon is called space-time curvature.
424120	428960	The earth does not directly influence objects in the universe, the planet is only growing
428960	432280	outwards because of its pressure.
432280	437640	But as it is very massive, the earth also compresses the fabric of the universe in the
437640	439720	opposite direction.
439720	448200	The planet grows into a space that contracts and the two effects balance each other.
448200	452600	This way of understanding the universe is called general relativity.
452600	458320	We introduce the fact that space-time gets curved to get rid of gravity.
458320	463680	Much like the inertial force inside the car, gravity is an illusion.
463680	468920	We observe that the apple falls downwards, while it is in reality the surface which is
468920	478480	subject to a force, the pressure of the planet, that prevents it from collapsing in on itself.
478480	484440	We now understand that gravity is merely another inertial force, and we are left with two categories
484440	485440	only.
485440	492520	Actions at a distance, including electromagnetic forces and contact forces.
492520	497600	But if we think about it, contact forces are only approximations.
497600	502640	In reality, the matter that makes up objects is made up of atoms.
502640	507960	When we observe a contact force at our scale, it is really an interaction between the atoms
507960	511840	of each of the two objects.
511840	517560	When we push an object, for example, the contact force does not really exist, it is only the
517560	523480	sum at our scale of all the electromagnetic forces in play that repel electrons and therefore
523480	527560	atoms between our hand and the object.
527560	533560	Ultimately, contact forces are nothing more than the manifestation at our scale of the
533560	536440	electromagnetic force.
537440	542920	Therefore, apart from inertial forces, which are illusions, the only real forces in the
542920	548800	universe seem to be the fundamental interactions that occur at the scale of particles.
548800	552240	In our universe, we identify three of these.
552240	557040	The electromagnetic interaction, which explains why electrons repel each other, and which
557040	559800	explains all contact forces.
559800	565720	The strong interaction, which explains the cohesion of protons and neutrons within atoms.
565720	571000	And finally, the weak interaction, from which radioactivity arises.
571000	580680	Alone, these three fundamental interactions describe the forces that act upon all particles.
580680	583160	Yet one last problem remains.
583160	587680	Although we have successfully identified the three fundamental forces in the universe,
587680	591120	they still seem to act at a distance.
591120	596040	When we approach two electrons, for example, they repel each other at a distance, as if
596040	600640	the electrons could communicate without coming into contact.
600640	604480	Again, this situation seems absurd.
604480	612120	How could two electrons interact when they are separated by some distance?
612120	619920	In reality, all goes as if the electrons were two people playing catch.
619920	625200	When one electron throws the ball at the other, the symmetry of the situation forces the electron
625200	630440	to move back in the opposite direction.
630440	635680	To understand, if we consider that the electron and the ball form a single object, and that
635680	641560	this object has no reason to move over time, when the ball is thrown towards the right,
641560	646600	the electron is forced to move towards the left to compensate.
646600	651320	While giving a movement to the ball, the electron has also acquired a movement in the opposite
651320	657920	direction, and this is precisely what we call a force.
657920	664280	This way of understanding fundamental interactions come from what we call quantum field theory.
664280	671480	Along with general relativity, these are the two theories at the basis of all modern physics.
671480	676440	Quantum field theory tells us that particles are constantly exchanging messages, which
676440	680600	we call virtual particles.
680600	686920	These are photons for the electromagnetic force, gluons for the strong interaction, and
686920	691600	z and w bosons for the weak interaction.
691600	698360	By symmetry, all these exchanges of virtual particles gradually change the motion of objects,
698360	703840	and it is this recoil effect when a particle emits or absorbs a virtual particle that we
703840	713640	interpret at our scale as a force.
713640	718120	To conclude, it would be wrong to say that forces do not exist.
718120	724840	Ultimately, inside a moving car, objects are well described by an inertial force.
724840	730000	But this force is just a tool, a mathematical description that works in the car's frame
730000	732640	of reference.
732640	737000	Physical forces like the centrifugal force, the Coriolis force, and even the force of
737000	742080	gravity are in the end all mere illusions that disappear when we take an appropriate
742080	746880	point of view.
746880	752160	Having said that, there still seems to be a multitude of real physical forces, called
752160	755280	contact forces.
755280	760400	Forces of pressure, tension or friction, all these forces allow us to describe the interaction
760400	764720	between bodies at our scale.
764720	770080	But when we dive into matter, we realise that these contact forces are only large scale
770080	771920	approximations.
771920	778160	In reality, they emerge from simply three fundamental forces, which alone explain the evolution
778160	781080	of all particles.
781080	787000	With that being said, these three basic forces are not themselves really fundamental, as they
787000	793160	ultimately emerge from much simpler, purer and more natural notion inherent to the geometry
793160	800320	and structure of the universe itself, which we often refer to as action-reaction.
800320	802040	This is the notion of symmetry.
