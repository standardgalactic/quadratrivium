00:00.000 --> 00:12.160
Welcome back to ScienceClick, today our force is real.

00:12.160 --> 00:17.040
A force is an action that changes the movement of an object.

00:17.040 --> 00:24.360
Usually an object tends to conserve its motion, in particular its direction and speed.

00:24.360 --> 00:28.920
Sometimes however, it happens to change direction or speed.

00:28.920 --> 00:36.960
Everything happens changing its movement and we say that it experiences a force.

00:36.960 --> 00:43.600
At first glance we can classify all forces in the universe into three categories.

00:43.600 --> 00:48.480
First we can think of the force that pulls us back when a car accelerates, or the central

00:48.480 --> 00:53.080
fugal force that pushes us to one side when it turns.

00:53.080 --> 00:58.400
These kinds of forces are called inertial forces, they most often appear inside a vehicle

00:58.400 --> 01:02.840
when it changes speed or direction.

01:02.840 --> 01:07.560
Secondly we can think of forces that act at a distance.

01:07.560 --> 01:14.000
The two main ones being gravity which attract massive objects together, and electromagnetism

01:14.000 --> 01:18.600
which attracts or repels charges and magnets.

01:18.600 --> 01:23.600
Finally the third category groups all contact forces.

01:23.600 --> 01:31.320
These are the forces of pressure, traction, torsion and deformation, or even friction.

01:31.320 --> 01:36.280
All these forces have the property of acting locally through a physical contact between

01:36.280 --> 01:40.640
two objects.

01:40.640 --> 01:46.240
These three categories are enough to account for all forces in the universe, but are these

01:46.240 --> 01:48.280
forces real?

01:48.280 --> 01:54.840
Do they exist fundamentally, or are they rather consequences of other phenomena?

01:54.840 --> 02:01.960
To answer this question we'll look at each category one by one.

02:01.960 --> 02:06.120
First let's start with inertial forces.

02:06.120 --> 02:12.280
As an example we can imagine a passenger inside a car.

02:12.280 --> 02:17.400
When the car starts to move an inertial force appears pushing the passenger back into his

02:17.400 --> 02:19.180
seat.

02:19.180 --> 02:24.960
From his point of view when the car accelerates a force appears and pulls all objects to the

02:24.960 --> 02:28.200
rear.

02:28.200 --> 02:33.600
At first glance for the passenger this force exists, it has to be accounted for in order

02:33.600 --> 02:39.520
to understand why objects are drawn backwards.

02:39.520 --> 02:44.320
But if he looks out the window the passenger realises he's not the only one to experience

02:44.320 --> 02:46.560
this force.

02:46.560 --> 02:52.000
When the car starts all objects in the universe seem to move backwards all together, as this

02:52.000 --> 02:55.960
same force applies everywhere.

02:55.960 --> 02:59.280
When we think about it this situation is absurd.

02:59.280 --> 03:03.320
How could the car influence our whole universe instantly?

03:03.320 --> 03:07.520
We would never expect to star at the other end of the cosmos to be influenced by the

03:07.520 --> 03:13.680
movement of a car, and even less so instantaneously.

03:13.680 --> 03:18.440
To resolve this paradox we actually just need to change the point of view.

03:18.440 --> 03:23.560
Instead of saying that all objects are drawn backwards except the car we rather observe

03:23.560 --> 03:28.920
from the outside and say that it's the car which undergoes a forward force while the

03:28.920 --> 03:33.120
rest of the universe stays still.

03:33.120 --> 03:38.240
The passenger thinks there is a force because he is observing from inside the car which is

03:38.240 --> 03:46.440
itself subject to a force, the friction of the wheels against the ground.

03:46.440 --> 03:52.520
This way of thinking is very general and applies to all inertial forces.

03:52.520 --> 03:58.740
All these forces seem ubiquitous, they seem to act everywhere instantaneously.

03:58.740 --> 04:04.160
From this we deduce that they cannot be real forces, they are only illusions fictitious

04:04.160 --> 04:13.800
forces which appear because we locate ourselves in a frame which itself is subject to a force.

04:13.800 --> 04:18.000
Having said that we realise that inertial forces are not the only ones that seem to

04:18.000 --> 04:20.720
act everywhere at the same time.

04:20.720 --> 04:28.600
This also applies to the second category, actions at a distance.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.840
First let's consider gravity.

04:31.840 --> 04:37.360
When we drop an apple, the apple is accelerated towards the ground and we say that it undergoes

04:37.360 --> 04:40.840
a downward force, the pull of the earth.

04:40.840 --> 04:45.880
As long as the apple has not touched the ground it seems constantly attracted by the earth

04:45.880 --> 04:48.160
at a distance.

04:48.160 --> 04:53.040
But the apple is not the only thing affected, all objects in the universe also seem to be

04:53.040 --> 04:58.880
attracted by the earth as if the planet were inflicting the same force universally to all

04:58.880 --> 05:02.080
bodies that exist.

05:02.080 --> 05:06.560
Like the previous example, we can ask ourselves how reasonable it is to think that the earth

05:06.560 --> 05:10.060
could influence the entire universe.

05:10.060 --> 05:14.840
After all, as with the car, it would be simpler to say that the universe is not influenced

05:14.840 --> 05:20.640
by the earth, that it is not the objects that all fall downwards, but simply the ground

05:20.640 --> 05:23.520
that rises upwards.

05:23.520 --> 05:28.800
Like the inertial force in the car, the force of gravity would only be an illusion, it would

05:28.800 --> 05:39.400
appear when we observe from the ground, whereas it is precisely the ground which accelerates.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.920
At first, this vision seems more elegant.

05:42.920 --> 05:47.400
Instead of inventing a mysterious force, gravity, it suffices to say that it is the

05:47.400 --> 05:49.600
ground that rises.

05:49.600 --> 05:54.160
Objects seem to come closer to the ground, not because they fall, but because the surface

05:54.160 --> 05:59.400
accelerates upwards.

05:59.400 --> 06:04.160
Having said that, it's easy to see that this explanation alone is flawed.

06:04.160 --> 06:11.160
Indeed, if it were the ground which accelerated, why wouldn't the planet grow bigger over

06:11.160 --> 06:12.160
time?

06:12.160 --> 06:16.760
If the ground indeed moves outwards, we should observe that the earth expands and it would

06:16.760 --> 06:20.200
eventually blow up.

06:20.200 --> 06:24.600
Yet earth has not changed size for billions of years, and objects continue to fall at

06:24.600 --> 06:27.600
its surface.

06:27.600 --> 06:32.320
The answer to this problem is very subtle, and constitutes one of the most shocking discoveries

06:32.320 --> 06:35.200
in modern physics.

06:35.200 --> 06:41.240
The ground does rise, its surface is constantly accelerating outwards, because it is pushed

06:41.240 --> 06:46.040
by the pressure of the materials that make the earth.

06:46.040 --> 06:51.840
If the planet does not grow, it is because the space all around it, the fabric in which

06:51.840 --> 07:00.160
it is contained, shrinks in the opposite direction.

07:00.160 --> 07:04.120
This phenomenon is called space-time curvature.

07:04.120 --> 07:08.960
The earth does not directly influence objects in the universe, the planet is only growing

07:08.960 --> 07:12.280
outwards because of its pressure.

07:12.280 --> 07:17.640
But as it is very massive, the earth also compresses the fabric of the universe in the

07:17.640 --> 07:19.720
opposite direction.

07:19.720 --> 07:28.200
The planet grows into a space that contracts and the two effects balance each other.

07:28.200 --> 07:32.600
This way of understanding the universe is called general relativity.

07:32.600 --> 07:38.320
We introduce the fact that space-time gets curved to get rid of gravity.

07:38.320 --> 07:43.680
Much like the inertial force inside the car, gravity is an illusion.

07:43.680 --> 07:48.920
We observe that the apple falls downwards, while it is in reality the surface which is

07:48.920 --> 07:58.480
subject to a force, the pressure of the planet, that prevents it from collapsing in on itself.

07:58.480 --> 08:04.440
We now understand that gravity is merely another inertial force, and we are left with two categories

08:04.440 --> 08:05.440
only.

08:05.440 --> 08:12.520
Actions at a distance, including electromagnetic forces and contact forces.

08:12.520 --> 08:17.600
But if we think about it, contact forces are only approximations.

08:17.600 --> 08:22.640
In reality, the matter that makes up objects is made up of atoms.

08:22.640 --> 08:27.960
When we observe a contact force at our scale, it is really an interaction between the atoms

08:27.960 --> 08:31.840
of each of the two objects.

08:31.840 --> 08:37.560
When we push an object, for example, the contact force does not really exist, it is only the

08:37.560 --> 08:43.480
sum at our scale of all the electromagnetic forces in play that repel electrons and therefore

08:43.480 --> 08:47.560
atoms between our hand and the object.

08:47.560 --> 08:53.560
Ultimately, contact forces are nothing more than the manifestation at our scale of the

08:53.560 --> 08:56.440
electromagnetic force.

08:57.440 --> 09:02.920
Therefore, apart from inertial forces, which are illusions, the only real forces in the

09:02.920 --> 09:08.800
universe seem to be the fundamental interactions that occur at the scale of particles.

09:08.800 --> 09:12.240
In our universe, we identify three of these.

09:12.240 --> 09:17.040
The electromagnetic interaction, which explains why electrons repel each other, and which

09:17.040 --> 09:19.800
explains all contact forces.

09:19.800 --> 09:25.720
The strong interaction, which explains the cohesion of protons and neutrons within atoms.

09:25.720 --> 09:31.000
And finally, the weak interaction, from which radioactivity arises.

09:31.000 --> 09:40.680
Alone, these three fundamental interactions describe the forces that act upon all particles.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.160
Yet one last problem remains.

09:43.160 --> 09:47.680
Although we have successfully identified the three fundamental forces in the universe,

09:47.680 --> 09:51.120
they still seem to act at a distance.

09:51.120 --> 09:56.040
When we approach two electrons, for example, they repel each other at a distance, as if

09:56.040 --> 10:00.640
the electrons could communicate without coming into contact.

10:00.640 --> 10:04.480
Again, this situation seems absurd.

10:04.480 --> 10:12.120
How could two electrons interact when they are separated by some distance?

10:12.120 --> 10:19.920
In reality, all goes as if the electrons were two people playing catch.

10:19.920 --> 10:25.200
When one electron throws the ball at the other, the symmetry of the situation forces the electron

10:25.200 --> 10:30.440
to move back in the opposite direction.

10:30.440 --> 10:35.680
To understand, if we consider that the electron and the ball form a single object, and that

10:35.680 --> 10:41.560
this object has no reason to move over time, when the ball is thrown towards the right,

10:41.560 --> 10:46.600
the electron is forced to move towards the left to compensate.

10:46.600 --> 10:51.320
While giving a movement to the ball, the electron has also acquired a movement in the opposite

10:51.320 --> 10:57.920
direction, and this is precisely what we call a force.

10:57.920 --> 11:04.280
This way of understanding fundamental interactions come from what we call quantum field theory.

11:04.280 --> 11:11.480
Along with general relativity, these are the two theories at the basis of all modern physics.

11:11.480 --> 11:16.440
Quantum field theory tells us that particles are constantly exchanging messages, which

11:16.440 --> 11:20.600
we call virtual particles.

11:20.600 --> 11:26.920
These are photons for the electromagnetic force, gluons for the strong interaction, and

11:26.920 --> 11:31.600
z and w bosons for the weak interaction.

11:31.600 --> 11:38.360
By symmetry, all these exchanges of virtual particles gradually change the motion of objects,

11:38.360 --> 11:43.840
and it is this recoil effect when a particle emits or absorbs a virtual particle that we

11:43.840 --> 11:53.640
interpret at our scale as a force.

11:53.640 --> 11:58.120
To conclude, it would be wrong to say that forces do not exist.

11:58.120 --> 12:04.840
Ultimately, inside a moving car, objects are well described by an inertial force.

12:04.840 --> 12:10.000
But this force is just a tool, a mathematical description that works in the car's frame

12:10.000 --> 12:12.640
of reference.

12:12.640 --> 12:17.000
Physical forces like the centrifugal force, the Coriolis force, and even the force of

12:17.000 --> 12:22.080
gravity are in the end all mere illusions that disappear when we take an appropriate

12:22.080 --> 12:26.880
point of view.

12:26.880 --> 12:32.160
Having said that, there still seems to be a multitude of real physical forces, called

12:32.160 --> 12:35.280
contact forces.

12:35.280 --> 12:40.400
Forces of pressure, tension or friction, all these forces allow us to describe the interaction

12:40.400 --> 12:44.720
between bodies at our scale.

12:44.720 --> 12:50.080
But when we dive into matter, we realise that these contact forces are only large scale

12:50.080 --> 12:51.920
approximations.

12:51.920 --> 12:58.160
In reality, they emerge from simply three fundamental forces, which alone explain the evolution

12:58.160 --> 13:01.080
of all particles.

13:01.080 --> 13:07.000
With that being said, these three basic forces are not themselves really fundamental, as they

13:07.000 --> 13:13.160
ultimately emerge from much simpler, purer and more natural notion inherent to the geometry

13:13.160 --> 13:20.320
and structure of the universe itself, which we often refer to as action-reaction.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.040
This is the notion of symmetry.
