00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,160
Welcome back to ScienceClick, today our force is real.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,040
A force is an action that changes the movement of an object.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:24,360
Usually an object tends to conserve its motion, in particular its direction and speed.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,920
Sometimes however, it happens to change direction or speed.

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,960
Everything happens changing its movement and we say that it experiences a force.

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,600
At first glance we can classify all forces in the universe into three categories.

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,480
First we can think of the force that pulls us back when a car accelerates, or the central

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,080
fugal force that pushes us to one side when it turns.

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,400
These kinds of forces are called inertial forces, they most often appear inside a vehicle

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,840
when it changes speed or direction.

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,560
Secondly we can think of forces that act at a distance.

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,000
The two main ones being gravity which attract massive objects together, and electromagnetism

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,600
which attracts or repels charges and magnets.

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Finally the third category groups all contact forces.

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:31,320
These are the forces of pressure, traction, torsion and deformation, or even friction.

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,280
All these forces have the property of acting locally through a physical contact between

17
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,640
two objects.

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,240
These three categories are enough to account for all forces in the universe, but are these

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,280
forces real?

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,840
Do they exist fundamentally, or are they rather consequences of other phenomena?

21
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,960
To answer this question we'll look at each category one by one.

22
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,120
First let's start with inertial forces.

23
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:12,280
As an example we can imagine a passenger inside a car.

24
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,400
When the car starts to move an inertial force appears pushing the passenger back into his

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,180
seat.

26
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,960
From his point of view when the car accelerates a force appears and pulls all objects to the

27
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,200
rear.

28
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,600
At first glance for the passenger this force exists, it has to be accounted for in order

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,520
to understand why objects are drawn backwards.

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,320
But if he looks out the window the passenger realises he's not the only one to experience

31
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,560
this force.

32
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,000
When the car starts all objects in the universe seem to move backwards all together, as this

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,960
same force applies everywhere.

34
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,280
When we think about it this situation is absurd.

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,320
How could the car influence our whole universe instantly?

36
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,520
We would never expect to star at the other end of the cosmos to be influenced by the

37
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,680
movement of a car, and even less so instantaneously.

38
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,440
To resolve this paradox we actually just need to change the point of view.

39
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,560
Instead of saying that all objects are drawn backwards except the car we rather observe

40
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,920
from the outside and say that it's the car which undergoes a forward force while the

41
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,120
rest of the universe stays still.

42
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,240
The passenger thinks there is a force because he is observing from inside the car which is

43
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:46,440
itself subject to a force, the friction of the wheels against the ground.

44
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,520
This way of thinking is very general and applies to all inertial forces.

45
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:58,740
All these forces seem ubiquitous, they seem to act everywhere instantaneously.

46
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:04,160
From this we deduce that they cannot be real forces, they are only illusions fictitious

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:13,800
forces which appear because we locate ourselves in a frame which itself is subject to a force.

48
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,000
Having said that we realise that inertial forces are not the only ones that seem to

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,720
act everywhere at the same time.

50
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:28,600
This also applies to the second category, actions at a distance.

51
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,840
First let's consider gravity.

52
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,360
When we drop an apple, the apple is accelerated towards the ground and we say that it undergoes

53
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,840
a downward force, the pull of the earth.

54
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,880
As long as the apple has not touched the ground it seems constantly attracted by the earth

55
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,160
at a distance.

56
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,040
But the apple is not the only thing affected, all objects in the universe also seem to be

57
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,880
attracted by the earth as if the planet were inflicting the same force universally to all

58
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,080
bodies that exist.

59
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,560
Like the previous example, we can ask ourselves how reasonable it is to think that the earth

60
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,060
could influence the entire universe.

61
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,840
After all, as with the car, it would be simpler to say that the universe is not influenced

62
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,640
by the earth, that it is not the objects that all fall downwards, but simply the ground

63
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,520
that rises upwards.

64
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,800
Like the inertial force in the car, the force of gravity would only be an illusion, it would

65
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:39,400
appear when we observe from the ground, whereas it is precisely the ground which accelerates.

66
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,920
At first, this vision seems more elegant.

67
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,400
Instead of inventing a mysterious force, gravity, it suffices to say that it is the

68
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,600
ground that rises.

69
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,160
Objects seem to come closer to the ground, not because they fall, but because the surface

70
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,400
accelerates upwards.

71
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,160
Having said that, it's easy to see that this explanation alone is flawed.

72
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:11,160
Indeed, if it were the ground which accelerated, why wouldn't the planet grow bigger over

73
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
time?

74
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,760
If the ground indeed moves outwards, we should observe that the earth expands and it would

75
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,200
eventually blow up.

76
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,600
Yet earth has not changed size for billions of years, and objects continue to fall at

77
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
its surface.

78
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,320
The answer to this problem is very subtle, and constitutes one of the most shocking discoveries

79
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,200
in modern physics.

80
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:41,240
The ground does rise, its surface is constantly accelerating outwards, because it is pushed

81
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,040
by the pressure of the materials that make the earth.

82
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,840
If the planet does not grow, it is because the space all around it, the fabric in which

83
00:06:51,840 --> 00:07:00,160
it is contained, shrinks in the opposite direction.

84
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,120
This phenomenon is called space-time curvature.

85
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,960
The earth does not directly influence objects in the universe, the planet is only growing

86
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,280
outwards because of its pressure.

87
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,640
But as it is very massive, the earth also compresses the fabric of the universe in the

88
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,720
opposite direction.

89
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:28,200
The planet grows into a space that contracts and the two effects balance each other.

90
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,600
This way of understanding the universe is called general relativity.

91
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,320
We introduce the fact that space-time gets curved to get rid of gravity.

92
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,680
Much like the inertial force inside the car, gravity is an illusion.

93
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,920
We observe that the apple falls downwards, while it is in reality the surface which is

94
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:58,480
subject to a force, the pressure of the planet, that prevents it from collapsing in on itself.

95
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,440
We now understand that gravity is merely another inertial force, and we are left with two categories

96
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
only.

97
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,520
Actions at a distance, including electromagnetic forces and contact forces.

98
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,600
But if we think about it, contact forces are only approximations.

99
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,640
In reality, the matter that makes up objects is made up of atoms.

100
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,960
When we observe a contact force at our scale, it is really an interaction between the atoms

101
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,840
of each of the two objects.

102
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,560
When we push an object, for example, the contact force does not really exist, it is only the

103
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,480
sum at our scale of all the electromagnetic forces in play that repel electrons and therefore

104
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,560
atoms between our hand and the object.

105
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,560
Ultimately, contact forces are nothing more than the manifestation at our scale of the

106
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,440
electromagnetic force.

107
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,920
Therefore, apart from inertial forces, which are illusions, the only real forces in the

108
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,800
universe seem to be the fundamental interactions that occur at the scale of particles.

109
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,240
In our universe, we identify three of these.

110
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,040
The electromagnetic interaction, which explains why electrons repel each other, and which

111
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,800
explains all contact forces.

112
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,720
The strong interaction, which explains the cohesion of protons and neutrons within atoms.

113
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,000
And finally, the weak interaction, from which radioactivity arises.

114
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,680
Alone, these three fundamental interactions describe the forces that act upon all particles.

115
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,160
Yet one last problem remains.

116
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,680
Although we have successfully identified the three fundamental forces in the universe,

117
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,120
they still seem to act at a distance.

118
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,040
When we approach two electrons, for example, they repel each other at a distance, as if

119
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,640
the electrons could communicate without coming into contact.

120
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,480
Again, this situation seems absurd.

121
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:12,120
How could two electrons interact when they are separated by some distance?

122
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:19,920
In reality, all goes as if the electrons were two people playing catch.

123
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,200
When one electron throws the ball at the other, the symmetry of the situation forces the electron

124
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,440
to move back in the opposite direction.

125
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,680
To understand, if we consider that the electron and the ball form a single object, and that

126
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,560
this object has no reason to move over time, when the ball is thrown towards the right,

127
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,600
the electron is forced to move towards the left to compensate.

128
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,320
While giving a movement to the ball, the electron has also acquired a movement in the opposite

129
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,920
direction, and this is precisely what we call a force.

130
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,280
This way of understanding fundamental interactions come from what we call quantum field theory.

131
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:11,480
Along with general relativity, these are the two theories at the basis of all modern physics.

132
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,440
Quantum field theory tells us that particles are constantly exchanging messages, which

133
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,600
we call virtual particles.

134
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,920
These are photons for the electromagnetic force, gluons for the strong interaction, and

135
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,600
z and w bosons for the weak interaction.

136
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,360
By symmetry, all these exchanges of virtual particles gradually change the motion of objects,

137
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,840
and it is this recoil effect when a particle emits or absorbs a virtual particle that we

138
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:53,640
interpret at our scale as a force.

139
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,120
To conclude, it would be wrong to say that forces do not exist.

140
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:04,840
Ultimately, inside a moving car, objects are well described by an inertial force.

141
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:10,000
But this force is just a tool, a mathematical description that works in the car's frame

142
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,640
of reference.

143
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,000
Physical forces like the centrifugal force, the Coriolis force, and even the force of

144
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,080
gravity are in the end all mere illusions that disappear when we take an appropriate

145
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,880
point of view.

146
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,160
Having said that, there still seems to be a multitude of real physical forces, called

147
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,280
contact forces.

148
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,400
Forces of pressure, tension or friction, all these forces allow us to describe the interaction

149
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,720
between bodies at our scale.

150
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,080
But when we dive into matter, we realise that these contact forces are only large scale

151
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,920
approximations.

152
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,160
In reality, they emerge from simply three fundamental forces, which alone explain the evolution

153
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,080
of all particles.

154
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:07,000
With that being said, these three basic forces are not themselves really fundamental, as they

155
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,160
ultimately emerge from much simpler, purer and more natural notion inherent to the geometry

156
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:20,320
and structure of the universe itself, which we often refer to as action-reaction.

157
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,040
This is the notion of symmetry.
