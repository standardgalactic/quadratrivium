1. **Illusions of Forces**: In modern physics, forces like inertial force (including centrifugal and Coriolis forces) within a moving frame of reference, such as a car, are considered illusions. They are mathematical constructs that simplify descriptions within the frame's context but do not represent fundamental interactions.

2. **Gravity**: Gravity is also reinterpreted as an inertial force. It is not a separate entity but a manifestation of the pressure of a planet or celestial body that prevents it from collapsing under its own mass.

3. **Contact Forces**: These forces, which include pressure, tension, and friction, are approximations at our scale. They are actually the result of underlying electromagnetic interactions between atoms and molecules.

4. **Fundamental Forces**: The universe is described by three fundamental forces:
   - **Electromagnetic Force**: Responsible for all contact forces, it describes the repulsion of like electric charges and the attraction of opposite charges.
   - **Strong Nuclear Force**: This force holds protons and neutrons together within atomic nuclei.
   - **Weak Nuclear Force**: It is responsible for radioactivity and certain nuclear reactions.

5. **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**: QFT explains how these fundamental forces work at the quantum level through the exchange of virtual particles:
   - **Photons** for electromagnetic interactions.
   - **Gluons** for strong interactions.
   - **W and Z bosons** for weak interactions.

6. **Symmetry and Action-Reaction**: The concept of symmetry underpins the fundamental forces, where particles exchange virtual particles, leading to observable forces at macroscopic scales. This is a manifestation of the action-reaction principle inherent in the universe's geometry and structure.

In summary, forces as we commonly understand them (like pressure or friction) are not truly fundamental but emerge from three basic forces: electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear interactions. These interactions are described by quantum field theory, which relies on the principle of symmetry and the exchange of virtual particles to explain how forces manifest at different scales in the universe.
