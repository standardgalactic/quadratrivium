00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
Welcome to another edition of This Fucking Guy,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,640
the series where we pick one fucking guy

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,760
who's making America worse and explore why they suck.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,080
I'm Erin Ryan, host of Crooked Media's Hysteria podcast,

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,440
and I'm Alyssa Mastromonico,

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,360
the other host of Crooked Media's Hysteria podcast.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,840
And as you can probably see by our setup,

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,280
we are in person today.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,080
The most special of treats.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,720
Alyssa, today we're going to dive into one

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,880
of the best embodiments of the internet adage,

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,120
nothing that only straight men like is cool.

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,080
We will be looking into the life and times

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,120
of the worst thing to come from South Africa since apartheid.

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,480
A man who despite growing evidence that he's, shall we say,

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,560
not in the headspace to control space exploration,

17
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,280
electric vehicle manufacturing, communications,

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,440
or the biotech industry is still being trusted

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,320
with billions in government contracts

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,640
and essentially being allowed to man the levers

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,240
of the financial markets,

22
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,360
all while rage tweeting fringe conspiracy theories

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,080
and cozying up to extremists.

24
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,960
Of course, this is Elon.

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,360
I never bought into the hype around Elon Musk.

26
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,240
He always struck me as a weirdo who was more full of shit

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,720
than porta-potties at the end of the New York City marathon.

28
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,920
That's pretty full of shit.

29
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,800
Elon Musk became one of the richest people in the world

30
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,880
by convincing enough people with power that he's a genius.

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,720
But there's no there there.

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,080
He's not a genius.

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,320
He's not a scientist.

34
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,840
He's not an engineer.

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,040
He's not an innovator.

36
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,280
He's a bullshitter.

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,720
There are so many instances of Elon exaggerating

38
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,440
or flat out spinning tall tales about his own prowess,

39
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,720
but that was hard to not turn this video

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,240
into a sprawling limited series a la Shogun.

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,440
But we love a good scam.

42
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,960
So let's learn about the self-perpetuating scam

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,280
that is Elon.

44
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,360
Strap in, Alyssa.

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,200
I'm ready.

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,680
Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28th, 1971,

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,440
to a wealthy family of fucking weirdos in South Africa.

48
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,680
His mother was a Canadian dietitian and model

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,840
who has appeared on cereal boxes

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,720
in the cover of Sports Illustrated.

51
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,040
He has a brother, Kimball,

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,920
who was once set up with one of Jeffrey Epstein's

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,120
ex-girlfriends by Jeffrey Epstein himself.

54
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,840
He's got a sister and a handful of half siblings.

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,280
Elon's father, Errol, a millionaire engineer

56
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,280
who claims he's killed a few people,

57
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,920
was half owner of a Zambian emerald mine in the 1980s,

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,120
he says, and eventually fathered two children

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,400
with his own stepdaughter, Jana,

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,360
thus making him his own stepfather-in-law, I think.

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,640
I'm sorry, what?

62
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,520
Yes, that's right, an emerald mine.

63
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,840
Elon hates this story because he really wants people

64
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,960
to believe that he's a self-made guy

65
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,560
and not some Lego-headed lord

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,840
who grew up in one of the biggest houses in Pretoria.

67
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,800
No, no, no, no, no.

68
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
Erin, I meant the thing about a stepdaughter.

69
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,720
Oh yeah, right, I assumed you meant mine.

70
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,880
Yeah, in 1979, Elon's dad divorced Elon's mom, May,

71
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,680
and later married a woman who had two children of her own.

72
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,240
Errol helped raise them, had two kids with her,

73
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,480
and then had two kids with one of the stepchildren

74
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,720
when she was of age and he was old as fuck.

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,600
Errol once told an interviewer, quote,

76
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,480
the only thing we're on this earth for is to reproduce.

77
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,240
I can see where Elon gets his creepy reproduction fetish.

78
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,720
Oh, we will get to that.

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,680
Although to his credit,

80
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,320
according to Elon biographer Walter Isaacson,

81
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,840
Elon noticed and disapproved

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,520
of the suspicious amount of attention

83
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,760
his father was paying Jana, again,

84
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,400
his own stepdaughter when she was 15 years old

85
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,160
and Errol was 56.

86
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,960
Errol insists that he was equally interested

87
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,240
in all of his children and stepchildren.

88
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,200
This video has already accomplished the impossible, Aaron,

89
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,480
making me feel a little bit bad for Elon Musk.

90
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,080
Elon was reportedly a mediocre student in high school,

91
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,880
but somehow got high enough grades

92
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,240
to get into college in Canada,

93
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,800
where his mom lived at the time,

94
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,080
and while he was there,

95
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,880
he somehow did well enough to transfer

96
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,800
to an Ivy League university in the United States.

97
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,480
As Musk tells it, he received degrees in physics

98
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,520
and economics from U Penn in 1995

99
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,880
and then moved to California

100
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,560
because he got into Stanford's PhD program,

101
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,280
but dropped out after two days

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,400
to be a full-time business boy genius.

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
When the legend of Elon purports

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,280
that he was the mental heft behind PayPal, Tesla and SpaceX,

105
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,560
people just kind of go along with it

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,080
because the belief that Silicon Valley

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,280
is teeming with prodigies and visionaries

108
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,520
and not just a bunch of assholes

109
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,000
screwing each other over like bankers and sweatpants

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,240
is central to justifying the tech sector's very existence.

111
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,840
First, let's get to Elon and PayPal.

112
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,960
He did not co-found PayPal.

113
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,480
He started his first company with some help from daddy,

114
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,040
sold that company to Compact, remember Compact?

115
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,040
No, don't remember it all.

116
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,880
Took the money he made from selling it

117
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,480
and started a business called x.com.

118
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,000
Surely you can't mean the social media website

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,880
formerly known as Twitter

120
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,720
or an early version of Tesla's Model X car

121
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,040
or the company SpaceX

122
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,360
or a site devoted to documenting the lives

123
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,360
of one of his multiple children to whom he gave X names.

124
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,240
Boy, he loves the letter X.

125
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,040
Yeah, it's his favorite letter.

126
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,760
No, this was an even earlier company called x.

127
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,920
Can you guess from the name what it did?

128
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,360
Sell erectile dysfunction medicines

129
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,840
to impotent men in red states?

130
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,920
No, good guess.

131
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,840
It was an online bank that somehow offered a product

132
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,200
that was less good than PayPal,

133
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,640
which I have to admit is an achievement

134
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,840
because PayPal sucks.

135
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,720
Point is he named a bank after it

136
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,360
because nothing conveys a sense of aboveboard safety

137
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,960
and seriousness like a letter often used

138
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,920
to denote the presence of a full bush

139
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,760
in a film from the 1970s.

140
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,480
You know they call the inner circle of early PayPal

141
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,800
the PayPal mafia.

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,960
Was Elon really anything like a Tony Soprano

143
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,160
of online banking?

144
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,640
He was a Jackie junior at most.

145
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,600
Once PayPal and x.com merged and x.com

146
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,880
like a dutiful wife took PayPal's name,

147
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,000
Musk became CEO because he had the most money.

148
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,360
But he was so annoying that eventually PayPal founder

149
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,720
in Silicon Valley, Supervillain Peter Thiel

150
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,040
found him too irritating to work with and so he quit.

151
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,920
Well, the board eventually took Thiel's side

152
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,040
and ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel.

153
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,000
Imagine being more off-putting than Peter Thiel.

154
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,920
I cannot imagine it.

155
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,800
Musk remained the largest shareholder in PayPal, however,

156
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,640
which ended up translating to a $165 million windfall

157
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,760
when eBay bought the site in 2002.

158
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,560
He used that money to start a company called SpaceX.

159
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,320
Sounds like a souvenir boner pill sold in gas stations

160
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,160
in Roswell, New Mexico.

161
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,200
From what I can tell, it started with a desire

162
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,240
to send people to Mars.

163
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,520
Elon has always dreamed of sending people to Mars.

164
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,920
Elon and early space ally, Michael Griffin,

165
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,320
traveled to Russia together to try to convince some Russians

166
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,760
to sell them some ICBMs so that Musk could pretend

167
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,960
to invent rockets.

168
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,680
But the Russians weren't interested

169
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,640
because Elon was not an astronaut,

170
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,480
nor did he possess any particular expertise about space.

171
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,840
He was just a guy who liked space a lot.

172
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,200
Undaunted, Musk used his PayPal money

173
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,680
to hire a bunch of people,

174
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,160
did know what they were doing space-wise,

175
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,080
and the company SpaceX blasted off.

176
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,520
Michael Griffin, that name sounds familiar.

177
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,960
That's because Griffin would go on to be a BFD at NASA.

178
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,880
Overseeing private partnership programs,

179
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,960
including something called

180
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,800
the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services,

181
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,120
were COTS program.

182
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,040
The program was designed to enlist private companies

183
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,080
in transporting people and supplies

184
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,320
to and from the International Space Station.

185
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,680
Under Griffin, only two private companies

186
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,520
were selected for the program.

187
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,880
One of them was SpaceX.

188
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,920
And thus began a long and fruitful career of SpaceX

189
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,400
feeding from the prolific teat of Uncle Sam.

190
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,880
In 2006, SpaceX was awarded a $396 million contract

191
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,960
from NASA.

192
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,760
Meanwhile, SpaceX didn't even have a rocket that worked.

193
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,920
Its Falcon 1 program was sucking ass

194
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,520
unless you think a rocket that explodes

195
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,400
can still be counted as a success.

196
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,960
Its first three launches between 2006 and 2008 failed,

197
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,000
putting the company on the brink of bankruptcy

198
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,280
at the same time as Tesla and Musk himself in late 2008.

199
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,360
But then SpaceX got it on the fourth try,

200
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,160
and as a prize for his company's one successful launch,

201
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,600
Elon was given a $1.6 billion NASA contract that December.

202
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,280
And it all blew up from there,

203
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,720
both literally and figuratively.

204
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,480
Erin, I think that when a SpaceX rocket explodes,

205
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,320
it's called a rapid unscheduled disassembly

206
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,040
when conscious uncoupling goes to space.

207
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,560
And we shouldn't downplay the fact

208
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,600
that the company has seen some success.

209
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,400
And progress in space exploration is by definition messy.

210
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,280
But Elon is not making the rockets.

211
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,840
He's not an engineer.

212
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,120
He's simply the guy who benefits the most financially

213
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,960
from the work of people who are building the rockets

214
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,840
and satellites while rage tweeting

215
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,040
about how NPR shouldn't get government money.

216
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,800
Since 2020, at least five of SpaceX's attempts

217
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,400
to launch its Starship into space

218
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,560
have ended with the experimental aircraft blowing up.

219
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,000
SpaceX is now worth more than $36 billion, though,

220
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
having received $15.3 billion in government contracts.

221
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
All this time, Elon won't stop yammering

222
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,280
about sending people to Mars,

223
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,720
but SpaceX has yet to demonstrate

224
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,680
that they're even capable of sending people to the moon,

225
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,000
which is a lot closer.

226
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,400
Easier.

227
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,200
NASA's plan has been to go back to the moon

228
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,480
by the end of 2025, but if SpaceX can't do it,

229
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,760
we can't do it.

230
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,840
Side note about Michael Griffin in 2018,

231
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,760
Griffin would go on to be appointed

232
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,600
under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering

233
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,960
under President Donald Trump.

234
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,040
One of his responsibilities was to award government contracts

235
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,680
to build low-orbit national security satellites.

236
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,560
Guess which company was one of two

237
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,360
to win government contracts to build these Starlink satellites?

238
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,680
I'ma say SpaceX.

239
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,520
Correct.

240
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,440
And we also have Starlink's, and by extension,

241
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,600
Musk's involvement in the Ukrainian defense

242
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,720
against the Russian invasion launched in early 2022.

243
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,480
Initially, SpaceX was awarded a government contract

244
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,720
by the Department of Defense

245
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,800
to provide satellite support for communications

246
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,680
for Ukrainian civilians and military entities

247
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,480
in their own self-defense.

248
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,480
But multiple reports have indicated that Musk himself

249
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,960
has been monkeying around with the satellites,

250
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,400
interrupting communications,

251
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,640
and thwarting attacks the Ukrainian military

252
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,400
was attempting to carry out on Russian targets.

253
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,560
The DoDs basically had to throw their hands up

254
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,160
and be like, well, they're a private company,

255
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,120
what can you do?

256
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,440
I don't know, stop giving them contracts,

257
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,480
let somebody else build the satellites?

258
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,680
SpaceX's entire reason to exist

259
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,240
is to guzzle government money.

260
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,680
Think of the SpaceX part of his fortune,

261
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,360
like a GoFundMe designed to make the worst person you know,

262
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,720
even richer, and you cannot opt out of it.

263
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,920
It's time to talk about Tesla.

264
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,840
Tesla, the preferred car of some of the biggest assholes

265
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,680
you know.

266
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,600
The company was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard

267
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,800
and Mark Tarpening, two actual engineers.

268
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,080
Elon invested $6.5 million into early Tesla

269
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,920
and became chairman of the company's board.

270
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,760
And immediately started taking credit for things.

271
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,880
Eberhard and Tarpening came up with the ideas,

272
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,200
designed the actual cars,

273
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,600
got all the company's ducks in a row

274
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,360
to revolutionize the electric car market,

275
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,280
and then, as thanks, in 2007, Musk ran both of them

276
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,520
out of the company and started calling himself

277
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,920
the founder of Tesla.

278
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,040
Kind of like an invasive species bird

279
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,400
who pushes the eggs out of other birds' nests

280
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,360
to lay their own.

281
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Indeed, and then says you invented eggs.

282
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,880
Eggs, they're mine, I did it.

283
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,200
In 2008, Musk was forced to step down

284
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,640
as chairman of the board of Tesla

285
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,640
after falsely promising, via Tweet Natch,

286
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,640
that he had funding secured to take Tesla private

287
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,280
at $420 per share, thus artificially inflating

288
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,680
the share value in a way a teenage boy might.

289
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,760
He was fined $20 million by the SEC over the stunt,

290
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,760
and he agreed to have a social media minder

291
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,480
approve his tweets before sending them.

292
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,560
How'd that go?

293
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,000
Elon had a wild summer.

294
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,120
That July, Elon had offered to help the cave rescue

295
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,880
of a trapped youth soccer team in Thailand

296
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,000
with a submarine he invented.

297
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,440
Let me remind you, Elon Musk is not an engineer,

298
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,360
nor had his companies made anything

299
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,560
designed to operate underwater.

300
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,240
The actual guy who saved the kids, Vernon Unsworth,

301
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
insulted Musk's silly little idea,

302
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,800
saying in a TV interview that Musk

303
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,400
could stick his imaginary submarine up his ass.

304
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,640
Musk responded by tweeting that Unsworth, who again,

305
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,520
just saved a kid's soccer team from cave death,

306
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,840
was a pedo guy.

307
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,680
Pedo guy.

308
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,320
Musk got sued.

309
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,280
During the trial, he claimed that pedo guy

310
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,040
was a common insult in the English-speaking world.

311
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,720
Literally never heard that one before.

312
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,480
Me neither.

313
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,120
Musk ended up prevailing in that suit,

314
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,400
but not before wasting a bunch of his time and hours,

315
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,440
but back to Tesla.

316
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,600
The company has been in the news

317
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,560
for its biggest layoffs ever.

318
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,960
14,000 people, or 10% of its workforce,

319
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,600
were unceremoniously let go over email in mid-April.

320
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,360
But whispers around the industry indicate

321
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,960
that the layoff might actually be much bigger than 10%,

322
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,200
perhaps even closer to 20%.

323
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,600
The stock price is absolutely tanking.

324
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,120
Tesla's total valuation was once a ridiculous $1.3 trillion.

325
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,400
Today, that value is down to less than half a billion dollars

326
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,520
and dropping.

327
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,480
That's a stupid amount of money.

328
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,280
Isn't General Motors only worth like 50 billion?

329
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,960
Yeah, if Tesla is an auto manufacturer,

330
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,600
its value has a long way to fall

331
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,480
before it's in line with other auto manufacturers.

332
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,040
But it also doesn't make sense

333
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,000
that the stock price has stayed so high

334
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,320
amid all of the company's controversies.

335
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,600
Multiple lawsuits over much of the company's history

336
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,080
have accused the company of lying

337
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,280
about how much money it's making

338
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
in order to inflate its stock price.

339
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,880
Tesla has received hundreds of millions of dollars

340
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,240
from the government for a battery swap technology

341
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,360
that was never made available to the public

342
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,600
and turned out to be a giant scam.

343
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,120
It's no secret Tesla's shitty to its workers,

344
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,040
fighting unionization efforts here and overseas.

345
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,720
He's even threatened his own employees on Twitter

346
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,440
when he should be being CEO.

347
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,160
How do you find the time, my dude?

348
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,840
There have been tens of thousands of reports

349
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,080
of Tesla's being shitty from things as minor

350
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,720
as poor quality builds to serious issues

351
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,480
like sudden uncontrollable acceleration.

352
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,800
Don't want that in a car.

353
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,720
Faulty braking, that's not good either.

354
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,240
Range issues that the company itself has suppressed.

355
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,840
An operating system that can be hacked

356
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,960
and controlled by outside entities.

357
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,440
Batteries that spontaneously light on fire.

358
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,960
The suspension suddenly collapsing

359
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,720
leading to something called Wampi Wheels,

360
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,440
which sounds like a carnival ride,

361
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,800
to one tragic story of a Tesla reversing

362
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,360
into a retaining pond with its driver trapped inside

363
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,200
and first responders unable to break in as the woman drowned.

364
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,920
That woman, by the way, was Mitch McConnell's sister-in-law

365
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,680
and that just happened this year.

366
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Jesus Christ.

367
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,560
Just, you don't want a car to do that.

368
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,120
No, it sounds like they're put together

369
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,480
like carnival rides.

370
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,200
Now I've been saying that Elon isn't the one

371
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,280
who's actually making the cars

372
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,600
because he's not a real engineer and that's true.

373
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,520
But Tesla, more than most companies,

374
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,120
lives and dies by public perception of Elon.

375
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,120
The company is trapped by the innovator cosplay

376
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,160
Elon insists on dressing himself in.

377
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,880
Which is why Elon's public image impacts

378
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,800
the price of the company's stock so much.

379
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,760
Exactly.

380
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,240
The stock market is mostly fueled

381
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,280
by wishes and hopes and dreams.

382
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,640
And if people don't believe in Elon,

383
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,280
they don't believe in Tesla.

384
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,520
If Elon is a scam, then Tesla is a scam.

385
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,880
And Elon is real scammy.

386
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,720
Scammy.

387
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,960
As all this stuff is happening,

388
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,120
a series of embarrassing public disasters

389
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,520
continue to make Teslas look more and more like clown cars.

390
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,640
Back in December, 2023, Tesla issued a recall

391
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,640
for an eye-watering 2,031,220 vehicles

392
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,280
after a National Highway Traffic Safety

393
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,200
Administration investigation found

394
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,760
that the auto steer function wasn't safe.

395
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,480
Cybertruck, long cheerleaded by Musk,

396
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,400
is an ugly, clunky embarrassment

397
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,680
that has publicly face planted.

398
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,560
Yeah.

399
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,000
Sure?

400
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,840
Yeah.

401
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,560
Oh my God, Elon.

402
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,680
Well, maybe that was a little too hard.

403
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,960
Should we try it one more?

404
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,800
Try it?

405
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,640
Yeah.

406
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,800
What?

407
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,640
Yeah.

408
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,480
It didn't go through.

409
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
So that's a plus side.

410
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,800
Let's try the right one.

411
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,640
Try that one, really?

412
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,480
Okay.

413
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,320
Sure.

414
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,440
Oh, man.

415
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
It didn't go through.

416
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,280
Yeah.

417
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,200
Yeah.

418
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,040
All right.

419
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,760
What?

420
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,760
That'll be bad.

421
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,840
Things only went downhill for the Cybertruck from there,

422
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,480
and it's a good thing too, because if it's muddy,

423
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,400
downhill is the only direction a Cybertruck

424
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,560
can go without getting stuck.

425
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Fuck.

426
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,600
The Cybertruck, like many Tesla offerings,

427
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,440
has experienced delivery delays, systemic failures,

428
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,240
safety issues, quality issues, and also can't haul shit.

429
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,600
Its battery doesn't last as long

430
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,280
as Tesla's sales material promised it would,

431
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,480
especially in cold weather.

432
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,160
Some observers have pointed out that it seems like Tesla

433
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,560
is making consumers pay for and beta test a product

434
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,440
that isn't actually ready for market.

435
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,320
The Cybertruck is what you might call a gender-affirming car

436
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,880
for men who want to prove to the world

437
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,320
that they have $100,000 to throw away

438
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,480
on the world's shittiest vehicle.

439
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,560
Tesla recently announced that their halting production

440
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,320
of the electric Ford Pinto of our times.

441
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,880
Good night, sweet prince.

442
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,400
And even at its newest and shiniest,

443
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,080
it still looks like the Armadillos

444
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,800
that Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck drove on the asteroid

445
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,040
in Armageddon, a movie from 1998, just saying.

446
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,520
Meanwhile, other automakers are getting into the EV game.

447
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,000
And some of them are bringing cars

448
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,120
to market that are more attractive, affordable,

449
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,000
and have less PR nightmare CEOs than Tesla does.

450
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,640
All of this has meant that Tesla's market share has diminished,

451
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,400
and its share price is tanked, as its sales and production

452
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,440
outlook has dimmed.

453
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,880
Musk is betting that his company will

454
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,520
be able to get out ahead of the autonomous taxi market,

455
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,800
something that nobody outside of like 500 people in Palo Alto

456
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
fucking want.

457
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,600
Plus, a fully self-driving car technology

458
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,160
doesn't exist, right?

459
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,360
It doesn't.

460
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,640
The technology used to be called fully self-driving or FSD,

461
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,880
but they got in trouble with regulators

462
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,200
because the technology does not actually work.

463
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,320
Now the tech is being referred to as FSD with supervision.

464
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,080
Still, Musk is all in on the tech,

465
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,360
claiming that Tesla owners for the low, low price of $99

466
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,080
per month will one day be able to install the software

467
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,720
on their cars, which can then work as autonomous taxis when

468
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,880
the owners aren't using them.

469
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,400
Your car can be your robot slave.

470
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,080
I am not kidding.

471
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,640
That's part of his business plan, Alyssa.

472
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,560
OK, so if you have FSD on your Tesla,

473
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,400
you still have to pay a subscription to use it?

474
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Fuck that.

475
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,160
No.

476
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,200
The thing about fully autonomous vehicles

477
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,560
is that they're another musky and fairy tale.

478
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,000
Elon has been promising that the fully self-driving technology

479
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,600
is right around the corner for so long,

480
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,960
except if you try to get around that proverbial corner

481
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,040
in a Tesla, the car never makes the turn,

482
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,160
the steering malfunctions.

483
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,800
Next thing you know it, you've run head

484
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,520
on into the broad side of a pizzeria.

485
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,600
So it also seems like a terribly stupid idea

486
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,240
to reorganize city infrastructure around a massive fleet

487
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,480
of robo taxis when the roads are already congested.

488
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,840
And by the way, public transportation already exists.

489
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,360
Couldn't we just use all that money

490
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,360
that Elon wants to pocket and improve what we already have?

491
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,800
One would think.

492
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,400
Actually, Elon has headed out for public transportation

493
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,600
for a long time.

494
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,640
Do you remember the Hyperloop?

495
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,680
A stupider, more expensive version of trains?

496
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,880
The Hyperloop is such a moronic idea

497
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,680
that it almost pains me to say it out loud.

498
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,800
Back when Elon was king shit of fuck mountain,

499
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,440
a.k.a. before he developed whatever condition it is

500
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,960
that makes it impossible for him to not run his big, fat mouth

501
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,160
all the time, Elon, quote, invented, unquote,

502
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,600
a mass transit system that moves large numbers of passengers

503
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,360
through low pressure tubes.

504
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,280
You mean like the plastic chutes at the drive-through bank?

505
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,520
Sort of.

506
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,560
I like that vintage reference.

507
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,840
Except bigger, more expensive with magnets

508
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,200
and of course requiring massive amounts of money

509
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,400
to be funneled to one of Elon Musk's companies.

510
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,400
And once again, so many people fell for it.

511
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,000
The boring company started as a subsidiary of SpaceX

512
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,720
with the stated aim of digging holes

513
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
for this stupid idea all over the place.

514
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,920
MIT was investigating getting involved.

515
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,080
There was talk of building one connecting LA and San Francisco

516
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,360
basically under the five, if you know California,

517
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,200
even though we could have just used that money to build

518
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,240
a high-speed rail between LA and San Francisco,

519
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,280
which is something that people in both cities

520
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,440
have wanted for decades, I don't understand.

521
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,560
Elon never really wanted to build

522
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,400
ultra-fast, large-scale mass transportation.

523
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
He simply wanted to derail discussions

524
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,140
of actual high-speed rail that actually worked

525
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,800
because he owns a car company

526
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,360
that depends on people not having

527
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,160
comfortable, affordable mass transit options available.

528
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,760
So this whole plan was just to stop

529
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,000
public transportation from getting better

530
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,200
so he could sell more cars,

531
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,320
like the bad guy from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

532
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,360
Exactly like that bad guy.

533
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,520
Now, a little over a decade after Hyperloop Mania

534
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,000
took Silicon Valley by storm,

535
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,800
all we have to show for it is a puny little tunnel

536
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,840
that connects part of the Las Vegas Convention Center

537
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,560
and some plans in other cities

538
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,480
that will likely soon quietly disappear from the internet.

539
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,800
So you dread the annual physical

540
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,360
with the guilt-tripping lectures like I do?

541
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,880
More greens, choose organic,

542
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,560
eat five cups of fruits and vegetables a day.

543
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,000
I admit I could eat better, but I don't have time.

544
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,880
That's why I started taking Field of Greens

545
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,200
by Brickhouse Nutrition.

546
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,440
Field of Greens is whole organic fruits and vegetables.

547
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,840
Real food, not extracts.

548
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,520
Each fruit and vegetable in Field of Greens

549
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,280
was medically chosen for a specific health benefit.

550
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,840
Some support vital organs like heart, liver, and kidneys,

551
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,760
while others give your metabolism and immune system a boost.

552
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,240
I'm so busy and I don't always eat like I should.

553
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,960
The powerhouse blend in Field of Greens fills the gap

554
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,200
so I stay energetic, focused, and healthy.

555
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,760
And if you don't feel the incredible difference like I did,

556
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,840
you can return it for a full refund.

557
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,400
Let me get you started with 15% off and free shipping.

558
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,360
Visit fieldofgreens.com and use promo code TFG.

559
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,080
That's promo code TFG at fieldofgreens.com.

560
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,240
Now that he's done his part to fill the highways

561
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,800
and atmosphere with vehicles that sometimes explode

562
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,720
and digs subterranean tunnels to nowhere,

563
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
Musk has moved on to technology.

564
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,680
Meant to be installed directly into the human body.

565
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,160
If I wouldn't get into one of his driverless taxis,

566
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,320
why on earth would I let one of his companies

567
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,400
install a chip into my brain?

568
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
The trillion dollar question.

569
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,120
In 2016, along with a handful of actual scientists,

570
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,640
Musk co-founded Neuralink after buying the trademark

571
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,960
from the two neuroscientists

572
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,680
who had actually founded Neuralink the year prior.

573
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,840
The company's aim is to produce technology

574
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,680
that can be implanted into the human brain.

575
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,920
Neuralink has been under fire

576
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,600
for killing an awful lot of the primates

577
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,200
that's been testing on, but nevertheless,

578
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,480
its chip was approved for human trials in 2023.

579
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,200
Earlier this year, Musk claimed

580
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,720
that a successful human trial had been conducted.

581
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,220
I have yet to see a single piece of reported media

582
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,960
that confirms this claim by somebody who isn't Musk himself

583
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,680
or someone Musk is paying,

584
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,600
but Elon girlbossed a little too hard when he bought Twitter.

585
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,200
It really has been something to watch the whole world

586
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,800
get wise to his bullshit at the same time.

587
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,920
Enough ink has been spilled

588
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,200
about Musk's disastrous takeover of Twitter

589
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,640
once a flawed but functional town square,

590
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,520
now the social media equivalent of an abandoned blockbuster

591
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,520
video that has been taken over by flea-infested raccoons.

592
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,360
So let's not get bogged down by the details.

593
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,600
What's most important is that thanks to his pathological

594
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,000
desire to force people to like him,

595
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,200
Elon's ineptitude has been on full display,

596
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,040
calling into question his genius and business acumen

597
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,520
in the rest of his portfolio.

598
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,720
The acquisition of Twitter was characterized

599
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,840
by drama and erratic behavior by Musk.

600
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,520
In 2022, he first tried a hostile takeover

601
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,160
of the company before winning the board's approval.

602
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,640
But then when he realized that $44 billion he'd offered

603
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,520
to pay was way too much for a company

604
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,640
that wasn't great at making money, he tried to back out.

605
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,080
The board threatened to sue but Musk relented

606
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,160
and the shotgun wedding between Elon and Twitter

607
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,340
happened in October, 2022.

608
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,800
Elon financed the deal with some creative leveraging

609
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,600
that ended up resulting in him having to sell

610
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,920
a bunch of Tesla stock, driving the share price down,

611
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,760
and thus his overall wealth down.

612
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,240
Elon, it turns out, is not good at running Twitter.

613
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,160
He fired or chased away 80% of the staff,

614
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,880
likely violating several labor laws and doing so.

615
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,080
He reinstated several accounts that have been banned

616
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,440
for hate speech, relaxed rules around anti-trans speech,

617
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,400
and COVID-19 misinformation,

618
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,520
gave a handful of doofus reporters access

619
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,800
to internal Twitter files, plopped his cottage cheese ass

620
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,960
into a dust chair, and tweeted as hard as he possibly could.

621
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,160
And who can forget the blue check mark fiasco?

622
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,800
Blue verification check marks were long viewed

623
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,700
as a class signifier in old Twitter,

624
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,120
which made a lot of people wearing wrap-around sunglasses

625
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,800
and their user picture angry.

626
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,720
So Elon got rid of the blue checks.

627
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,800
The problem is that the checks also verified

628
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,360
that people on the site were who they said they were

629
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,720
and that so-called official accounts were not imposters.

630
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,080
And so, in the first days of the program's elimination,

631
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,060
somebody pretending to be the official account

632
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,800
of drugmaker Eli Lilly declared that insulin was now free

633
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,840
among other imposter shenanigans.

634
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,880
That was actually quite funny.

635
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,800
That was really, it was one of the best days

636
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,640
in Twitter history.

637
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,480
It was great.

638
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,480
Bleeding money, Elon tried to get Twitter users

639
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,240
to pay $8 for the check marks.

640
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,640
And people were like, fuck that you clown.

641
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
So the only people who had blue checks

642
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,240
were suspiciously Elon fanboys and conservative super tweeters

643
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,920
who would hassle anybody who complained

644
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
about the new verification system

645
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,200
by accusing them of being too poor or stingy

646
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,920
to fork over $8 to one of the world's richest men.

647
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,760
I am shocked, shocked that trying to use bullying

648
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,200
as a chief sales technique

649
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,920
for Twitter's verification program was ineffective.

650
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,880
In April of this year,

651
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,800
Twitter quietly restored blue check marks

652
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,600
to several journalists and public figures

653
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,480
without charging them $8.

654
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,080
When several prominent Twitter users started swapping tips

655
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,040
on how to hide the dreaded blue check of shame

656
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,200
next to their names,

657
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,740
Twitter removed their ability to hide the check.

658
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,100
Researchers found that under Musk,

659
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,480
hate speech increased dramatically on the platform,

660
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,920
anti-Semitic speech increased,

661
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,760
as did propaganda originating from the Islamic State.

662
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,160
Great job, Elon.

663
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,400
Some of the hate speech, by the way,

664
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,360
was amplified by Musk himself,

665
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
like the time he publicly agreed with a tweet

666
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,320
alleging that Jewish people hate white people.

667
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,320
Musk responded by revoking access to Twitter's API,

668
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,240
so now nobody has any idea

669
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,360
just how bad things have gotten quantitatively.

670
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,760
However, Alyssa, there is a workaround.

671
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,040
You can still tell how bad Twitter has gotten

672
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,920
by simply looking at it.

673
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,940
Yes.

674
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,680
And it turns out platforming unbridled free speech

675
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,160
with virtually no moderation

676
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,520
has meant that since Elon fired or chased out

677
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,160
most of Twitter's legacy employees,

678
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,320
the site has also become a haven

679
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,680
for misinformation and child pornography.

680
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,520
In early April,

681
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,140
the Brazilian Supreme Court announced

682
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,320
that they were investigating him

683
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,680
for, quote, flagrant obstruction of Brazilian justice, unquote.

684
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,240
The chickens have to come home to roost eventually, right?

685
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,600
Yeah, and I would watch a show called Brazilian justice.

686
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,960
It sounds like a lot of fun.

687
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,040
Twitter put on display how desperate Elon was

688
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,360
to have people like him,

689
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,640
despite his fundamental unlikeability.

690
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,960
In February, 2023,

691
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,800
Elon got upset that not enough people

692
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,320
were engaging with his tweets

693
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,040
and had some of his internal engineers

694
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,280
investigate what was wrong.

695
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,400
This story makes me so embarrassed.

696
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
So sad for him.

697
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,980
One of his engineers suggested

698
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,560
that perhaps public interest in Musk himself was waning,

699
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,600
and so Musk fired him.

700
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,440
A few days later,

701
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,040
when President Joe Biden's tweets about the Super Bowl

702
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,240
got more engagement than Elon's,

703
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,320
Elon demanded the engineers fix it or be fired.

704
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,760
So they changed the Twitter algorithm

705
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,720
so that regular users would be spammed with Elon's tweets,

706
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,400
magnifying the automatic reach of Elon's tweets 1,000 times.

707
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,440
That is the saddest shit I have ever heard.

708
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,880
In 2023 via Twitter,

709
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,600
he accused a young Jewish man named Ben Brody

710
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,760
of participating in a neo-Nazi brawl

711
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,000
as an Antifa member of a false flag operation.

712
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,760
Brody wasn't even in the state where the brawl occurred.

713
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,960
His family claims that Musk's amplification

714
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,360
of the fringe conspiracy theory, based on nothing,

715
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,680
had led to massive amounts of harassment and threats

716
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,800
and sued Musk for a million dollars.

717
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,080
Musk was deposed in March and it went poorly.

718
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,120
In the deposition which Musk's lawyers

719
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,920
unsuccessfully fought to seal,

720
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,240
Musk at one point does not seem to understand

721
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,760
what a lawyer does.

722
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,360
Daren, what about the people who stayed on Twitter

723
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,320
even after Elon turned it into a haunted shopping mall?

724
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,000
Well, Elon has tried to turn Twitter

725
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,320
into a landing pad for media personalities

726
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,560
who had been canceled or, in normal English,

727
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,200
faced consequences as a result of fucking up.

728
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,080
He snatched up Tucker Carlson after Tucker's ouster

729
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,760
from Fox News with promises that Tucker could create

730
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,440
Twitter exclusive content.

731
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,120
But the site didn't have the technology

732
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,080
to support the sort of thing Tucker wanted to make.

733
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,240
Sounds familiar.

734
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,280
And former CNN anchor Don Lemon

735
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,320
was also invited to Elon's Tiki Torch rally

736
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,880
only to have his contract canceled

737
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,560
days before Lemon's show was supposed to debut

738
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,280
after an interview Lemon conducted

739
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,320
with Musk went off the rails.

740
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,040
Musk keeps claiming he loves free speech,

741
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,600
but he doesn't like it when people talk shit about him.

742
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,080
Under Musk's flop sweat soaked innovation,

743
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,920
the value of Twitter at NowX.com, the old chestnut,

744
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,640
has fallen an estimated 65%.

745
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,680
Elon's Twitter foibles have exposed him

746
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,520
as an emotionally unstable, deeply weird, clueless phony

747
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,960
who believes that acting like an asshole

748
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,880
is the same thing as coming up with an idea.

749
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,560
He's a business bridezilla with an unlimited budget

750
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,120
and his employees are just the hapless wedding coordinators

751
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,160
trying to figure out how to bend reality

752
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,040
to bring his ridiculous plans to fruition.

753
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,520
And when he's confronted on his bullshit,

754
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,560
he throws a fit.

755
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,760
Who can forget this infamous public appearance?

756
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,960
If somebody's gonna try to blackmail me with advertising,

757
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,880
blackmail me with money, go f*** yourself.

758
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,920
Go f*** yourself.

759
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,960
Is that clear?

760
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,800
It's funny.

761
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,680
He didn't used to seem as unhinged as he does now.

762
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,000
I know, I kind of wonder what it is,

763
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,880
but there is a working theory out there.

764
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,720
Failing?

765
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,320
That theory is, it's the drugs.

766
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,840
According to a Wall Street Journal report from January,

767
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,520
Elon has been known to dabble in such substances

768
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,480
as cocaine, mushrooms, LSD, ecstasy, and ketamine.

769
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,000
But last I checked, most people who go into a K-hole

770
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,800
don't come out the other side of megalomaniac baby.

771
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,600
And to prove he's cool and tough,

772
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,520
he smoked weed on the Joe Rogan podcast.

773
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,480
Speaking of babies, doesn't he have like a million kids?

774
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,000
Yes, Elon Musk has 11 children by three different women.

775
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,840
Woo!

776
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,400
He had six children with his first wife, Justine Wilson,

777
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,840
including one set of twins and one set of triplets,

778
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,680
which were conceived via IVF.

779
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,000
He has three children with the singer Grimes,

780
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,640
who you may most recently remember for turning in

781
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,320
one of the worst performances in Coachella history.

782
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,160
Elon also has twins with an executive

783
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,800
from his monkey-murdering enterprise Neuralink,

784
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,400
a fact that came to light through a piece

785
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,480
in Time Magazine by Walter Isaacson.

786
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,240
News of the twins with the Canadian Neuralink

787
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,440
executive broke just days before news

788
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,360
that he'd had his third baby with Grimes broke.

789
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,560
Boy, that was awkward.

790
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,480
I've got questions about what's been going on,

791
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,560
and I don't know for sure that I want the answers.

792
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,400
In response, Elon made a weird joke

793
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,760
about doing his part to repopulate the world,

794
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,600
but he's long been weirdly obsessed with the birthrate

795
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,520
because he said that he's worried

796
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,600
there won't be enough people to move to his Mars colony.

797
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,920
Musk has reportedly given $10 million

798
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,680
to a population research project in Texas

799
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,520
that aims to look into ways to increase the birthrate.

800
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,400
So Elon wants there to be more people

801
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,040
so that he can send them to Mars.

802
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,080
Fine, fine, go.

803
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,400
Problem that Musk's advice

804
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,160
that everybody should father as many children as possible

805
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,080
is that like his father who came before him,

806
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,040
Musk kind of sucks at being a dad.

807
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,440
He is currently being sued over parental rights

808
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,560
by his ex, Grimes, and one of his two oldest children

809
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,120
who came out as trans at age 16

810
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,600
openly hates her dad's guts for very understandable reasons.

811
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,120
He once claimed that the word cisgender was a slur

812
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,280
and urged all of his followers on Twitter

813
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,080
to watch the Daily Wire documentary,

814
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,320
What is a Woman, hosted by human skidmark Matt Walsh.

815
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,400
But maybe the shittiest thing Elon did

816
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,640
in the fatherhood arena was change some key details

817
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,960
about a tragedy to make himself sound like a hero.

818
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,480
Elon's oldest son named Nevada died tragically

819
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,240
from sudden infant death syndrome

820
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,040
when he was only 10 weeks old.

821
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,520
Many years later in 2022 via tweet, of course,

822
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,480
Elon later claimed that the baby had, quote,

823
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,560
died in his arms and that he, quote,

824
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,280
felt his last heartbeat.

825
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,680
Nevada's mother, his ex-wife, Justine disagreed,

826
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,480
tweeting, not that it matters to anyone except me

827
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,080
because it is one of the most sacred

828
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,680
and defining moments of my life,

829
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,560
but I was the one who was holding him.

830
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,440
That he would claim that is just tragically deranged.

831
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,960
It is absolutely deranged.

832
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,360
It's like some of the sickest shit ever.

833
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,840
And while a year prior, Justine had written

834
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,800
a glamour magazine piece called

835
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,320
I was a starter wife inside America's messiest divorce

836
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,840
that like many firsthand accounts of Elon Musk

837
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,120
make him sound like a total fucking dick.

838
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,360
In that article, she wrote,

839
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,360
Elon had called her open grief over Nevada's death,

840
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,040
emotionally manipulative.

841
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,280
Emotionally manipulative.

842
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,520
Your child's eyes, her baby died.

843
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,800
No wonder that marriage,

844
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,920
like the hyperloop, fully self-driving technology,

845
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,920
the cyber truck and his version of Twitter failed.

846
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,120
Whew, well, that's as good a note to end on as any.

847
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,160
What's extra crazy to me is that we can laugh

848
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,840
at his awkward dancing and make fun of how unfunny he is.

849
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,720
Thanks to the fact that government gives his company

850
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,360
so much money and Tesla stock is such a huge part of the S&P,

851
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,080
we all kinda own a stake in his clownery.

852
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,840
Nobody should have as much money as Elon Musk has

853
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,200
and nobody should have their fingers knuckle deep

854
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,800
in that many industries so important to things

855
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,320
like communication, transportation and national security.

856
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,720
Alyssa, I haven't even gotten to the cherry on top.

857
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,720
In April, the same week that Tesla announced record layoffs,

858
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,720
Elon once again asked the company board to approve

859
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,160
a $56 billion pay package for himself

860
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,200
that had been rejected by a judge in Delaware

861
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,640
over the fact that its exorbitant size

862
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,840
represented negligence of his fiduciary duties as CEO.

863
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,200
Sounds reasonable.

864
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Can you imagine, can you imagine asking for $56 billion

865
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,000
after sending so many people out into the street?

866
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,960
Evil as shit, absolutely not.

867
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,200
Evil shit.

868
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,280
The only way that Elon Musk is a true innovator

869
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,400
is in his astonishing ability to oversell and under deliver.

870
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,480
His career is a series of fanciful, unkeepable promises

871
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,560
which a gullible media takes at his word,

872
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,600
but maybe, just maybe, the jigs finally up.

873
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,280
Wow, Elon, I feel like we barely scratched the surface.

874
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,920
So on a scale of one to five weasels.

875
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,840
Ooh, where's Elon?

876
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,640
Oh, he's gotta be a hard five weasel for so many reasons.

877
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,080
One, he's getting rich off our tax money.

878
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,000
He's getting rich off our tax money,

879
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,760
not doing shit with it, being mean to his kids

880
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,080
and not even getting to the moon.

881
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,900
Yeah.

882
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,080
Give me my money back.

883
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,440
Any ruined Twitter.

884
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,920
Yes, I'm gonna agree with you.

885
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,560
Okay, five, oh, we're in sync this week.

886
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,280
I say a hard five weasels for Elon Musk

887
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,320
just because he has so much power and he amassed it

888
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,240
in a way that I feel like everyone is like,

889
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,760
oh, whoa, this guy's in charge of a lot of stuff.

890
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,240
