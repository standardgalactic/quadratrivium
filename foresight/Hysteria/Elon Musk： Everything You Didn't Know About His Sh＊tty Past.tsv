0	2840	Welcome to another edition of This Fucking Guy,
2840	4640	the series where we pick one fucking guy
4640	7760	who's making America worse and explore why they suck.
7760	11080	I'm Erin Ryan, host of Crooked Media's Hysteria podcast,
11080	12440	and I'm Alyssa Mastromonico,
12440	15360	the other host of Crooked Media's Hysteria podcast.
15360	17840	And as you can probably see by our setup,
17840	19280	we are in person today.
19280	21080	The most special of treats.
21080	23720	Alyssa, today we're going to dive into one
23720	25880	of the best embodiments of the internet adage,
25880	28120	nothing that only straight men like is cool.
28120	30080	We will be looking into the life and times
30080	33120	of the worst thing to come from South Africa since apartheid.
33120	36480	A man who despite growing evidence that he's, shall we say,
36480	39560	not in the headspace to control space exploration,
39560	42280	electric vehicle manufacturing, communications,
42280	45440	or the biotech industry is still being trusted
45440	47320	with billions in government contracts
47320	49640	and essentially being allowed to man the levers
49640	51240	of the financial markets,
51240	54360	all while rage tweeting fringe conspiracy theories
54360	56080	and cozying up to extremists.
56080	57960	Of course, this is Elon.
57960	60360	I never bought into the hype around Elon Musk.
60360	63240	He always struck me as a weirdo who was more full of shit
63240	65720	than porta-potties at the end of the New York City marathon.
65720	66920	That's pretty full of shit.
66920	69800	Elon Musk became one of the richest people in the world
69800	72880	by convincing enough people with power that he's a genius.
72880	74720	But there's no there there.
74720	76080	He's not a genius.
76080	77320	He's not a scientist.
77320	78840	He's not an engineer.
78840	80040	He's not an innovator.
80040	81280	He's a bullshitter.
81280	83720	There are so many instances of Elon exaggerating
83720	86440	or flat out spinning tall tales about his own prowess,
86440	88720	but that was hard to not turn this video
88720	92240	into a sprawling limited series a la Shogun.
92240	94440	But we love a good scam.
94440	96960	So let's learn about the self-perpetuating scam
96960	98280	that is Elon.
98280	99360	Strap in, Alyssa.
99360	100200	I'm ready.
100200	103680	Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28th, 1971,
103680	107440	to a wealthy family of fucking weirdos in South Africa.
107440	109680	His mother was a Canadian dietitian and model
109680	111840	who has appeared on cereal boxes
111840	113720	in the cover of Sports Illustrated.
113720	115040	He has a brother, Kimball,
115040	117920	who was once set up with one of Jeffrey Epstein's
117920	121120	ex-girlfriends by Jeffrey Epstein himself.
121120	123840	He's got a sister and a handful of half siblings.
123840	126280	Elon's father, Errol, a millionaire engineer
126280	128280	who claims he's killed a few people,
128280	131920	was half owner of a Zambian emerald mine in the 1980s,
131920	135120	he says, and eventually fathered two children
135120	137400	with his own stepdaughter, Jana,
137400	141360	thus making him his own stepfather-in-law, I think.
141360	142640	I'm sorry, what?
142640	144520	Yes, that's right, an emerald mine.
144520	146840	Elon hates this story because he really wants people
146840	148960	to believe that he's a self-made guy
148960	150560	and not some Lego-headed lord
150560	152840	who grew up in one of the biggest houses in Pretoria.
152840	153800	No, no, no, no, no.
153800	155600	Erin, I meant the thing about a stepdaughter.
155600	157720	Oh yeah, right, I assumed you meant mine.
157720	161880	Yeah, in 1979, Elon's dad divorced Elon's mom, May,
161880	164680	and later married a woman who had two children of her own.
164680	167240	Errol helped raise them, had two kids with her,
167240	170480	and then had two kids with one of the stepchildren
170480	173720	when she was of age and he was old as fuck.
173760	175600	Errol once told an interviewer, quote,
175600	179480	the only thing we're on this earth for is to reproduce.
179480	183240	I can see where Elon gets his creepy reproduction fetish.
183240	184720	Oh, we will get to that.
184720	185680	Although to his credit,
185680	188320	according to Elon biographer Walter Isaacson,
188320	189840	Elon noticed and disapproved
189840	191520	of the suspicious amount of attention
191520	193760	his father was paying Jana, again,
193760	196400	his own stepdaughter when she was 15 years old
196400	198160	and Errol was 56.
198160	200960	Errol insists that he was equally interested
200960	203240	in all of his children and stepchildren.
203240	206200	This video has already accomplished the impossible, Aaron,
206200	208480	making me feel a little bit bad for Elon Musk.
208480	211080	Elon was reportedly a mediocre student in high school,
211080	212880	but somehow got high enough grades
212880	214240	to get into college in Canada,
214240	215800	where his mom lived at the time,
215800	217080	and while he was there,
217080	218880	he somehow did well enough to transfer
218880	221800	to an Ivy League university in the United States.
221800	224480	As Musk tells it, he received degrees in physics
224480	227520	and economics from U Penn in 1995
227520	228880	and then moved to California
228880	231560	because he got into Stanford's PhD program,
231560	233280	but dropped out after two days
233280	236400	to be a full-time business boy genius.
236400	238000	When the legend of Elon purports
238000	241280	that he was the mental heft behind PayPal, Tesla and SpaceX,
241280	242560	people just kind of go along with it
242560	244080	because the belief that Silicon Valley
244080	246280	is teeming with prodigies and visionaries
246280	247520	and not just a bunch of assholes
247520	250000	screwing each other over like bankers and sweatpants
250000	253240	is central to justifying the tech sector's very existence.
253240	254840	First, let's get to Elon and PayPal.
254840	256960	He did not co-found PayPal.
256960	259480	He started his first company with some help from daddy,
259520	262040	sold that company to Compact, remember Compact?
262040	264040	No, don't remember it all.
264040	265880	Took the money he made from selling it
265880	269480	and started a business called x.com.
269480	272000	Surely you can't mean the social media website
272000	273880	formerly known as Twitter
273880	276720	or an early version of Tesla's Model X car
276720	279040	or the company SpaceX
279040	281360	or a site devoted to documenting the lives
281360	284360	of one of his multiple children to whom he gave X names.
284360	286240	Boy, he loves the letter X.
286240	288040	Yeah, it's his favorite letter.
288040	290760	No, this was an even earlier company called x.
290760	292920	Can you guess from the name what it did?
292920	295360	Sell erectile dysfunction medicines
295360	296840	to impotent men in red states?
296840	297920	No, good guess.
297920	300840	It was an online bank that somehow offered a product
300840	302200	that was less good than PayPal,
302200	303640	which I have to admit is an achievement
303640	305840	because PayPal sucks.
305840	307720	Point is he named a bank after it
307720	310360	because nothing conveys a sense of aboveboard safety
310360	312960	and seriousness like a letter often used
312960	314920	to denote the presence of a full bush
314920	316760	in a film from the 1970s.
316760	319480	You know they call the inner circle of early PayPal
319480	320800	the PayPal mafia.
320800	323960	Was Elon really anything like a Tony Soprano
323960	325160	of online banking?
325160	328640	He was a Jackie junior at most.
328640	331600	Once PayPal and x.com merged and x.com
331600	333880	like a dutiful wife took PayPal's name,
333880	337000	Musk became CEO because he had the most money.
337000	339360	But he was so annoying that eventually PayPal founder
339360	341720	in Silicon Valley, Supervillain Peter Thiel
341720	345040	found him too irritating to work with and so he quit.
345040	346920	Well, the board eventually took Thiel's side
346920	350040	and ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel.
350040	353000	Imagine being more off-putting than Peter Thiel.
353000	354920	I cannot imagine it.
354920	357800	Musk remained the largest shareholder in PayPal, however,
357800	362640	which ended up translating to a $165 million windfall
362640	364760	when eBay bought the site in 2002.
364760	368560	He used that money to start a company called SpaceX.
368560	371320	Sounds like a souvenir boner pill sold in gas stations
371320	373160	in Roswell, New Mexico.
373160	375200	From what I can tell, it started with a desire
375200	377240	to send people to Mars.
377240	379520	Elon has always dreamed of sending people to Mars.
379520	381920	Elon and early space ally, Michael Griffin,
381920	385320	traveled to Russia together to try to convince some Russians
385320	388760	to sell them some ICBMs so that Musk could pretend
388760	389960	to invent rockets.
389960	391680	But the Russians weren't interested
391680	393640	because Elon was not an astronaut,
393640	396480	nor did he possess any particular expertise about space.
396480	399840	He was just a guy who liked space a lot.
399840	402200	Undaunted, Musk used his PayPal money
402200	403680	to hire a bunch of people,
403680	406160	did know what they were doing space-wise,
406160	409080	and the company SpaceX blasted off.
409080	411520	Michael Griffin, that name sounds familiar.
411520	414960	That's because Griffin would go on to be a BFD at NASA.
414960	416880	Overseeing private partnership programs,
416880	417960	including something called
417960	420800	the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services,
420800	422120	were COTS program.
422120	425040	The program was designed to enlist private companies
425040	427080	in transporting people and supplies
427080	429320	to and from the International Space Station.
429320	431680	Under Griffin, only two private companies
431680	433520	were selected for the program.
433520	434880	One of them was SpaceX.
434880	437920	And thus began a long and fruitful career of SpaceX
437920	440400	feeding from the prolific teat of Uncle Sam.
440400	444880	In 2006, SpaceX was awarded a $396 million contract
444880	445960	from NASA.
445960	449760	Meanwhile, SpaceX didn't even have a rocket that worked.
449760	451920	Its Falcon 1 program was sucking ass
451920	453520	unless you think a rocket that explodes
453520	455400	can still be counted as a success.
455400	458960	Its first three launches between 2006 and 2008 failed,
458960	461000	putting the company on the brink of bankruptcy
461000	465280	at the same time as Tesla and Musk himself in late 2008.
465280	468360	But then SpaceX got it on the fourth try,
468360	472160	and as a prize for his company's one successful launch,
472160	476600	Elon was given a $1.6 billion NASA contract that December.
476600	478280	And it all blew up from there,
478280	480720	both literally and figuratively.
480720	484480	Erin, I think that when a SpaceX rocket explodes,
484480	488320	it's called a rapid unscheduled disassembly
488320	491040	when conscious uncoupling goes to space.
491040	492560	And we shouldn't downplay the fact
492560	494600	that the company has seen some success.
494600	498400	And progress in space exploration is by definition messy.
498400	500280	But Elon is not making the rockets.
500280	501840	He's not an engineer.
501840	504120	He's simply the guy who benefits the most financially
504120	505960	from the work of people who are building the rockets
505960	507840	and satellites while rage tweeting
507840	510040	about how NPR shouldn't get government money.
510040	512800	Since 2020, at least five of SpaceX's attempts
512800	514400	to launch its Starship into space
514400	517560	have ended with the experimental aircraft blowing up.
517560	521000	SpaceX is now worth more than $36 billion, though,
521000	525000	having received $15.3 billion in government contracts.
525000	527000	All this time, Elon won't stop yammering
527000	528280	about sending people to Mars,
528280	530720	but SpaceX has yet to demonstrate
530720	533680	that they're even capable of sending people to the moon,
533680	535000	which is a lot closer.
535000	536400	Easier.
536400	538200	NASA's plan has been to go back to the moon
538200	541480	by the end of 2025, but if SpaceX can't do it,
541480	542760	we can't do it.
542760	544840	Side note about Michael Griffin in 2018,
544840	546760	Griffin would go on to be appointed
546760	549600	under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering
549600	550960	under President Donald Trump.
550960	554040	One of his responsibilities was to award government contracts
554040	557680	to build low-orbit national security satellites.
557680	559560	Guess which company was one of two
559560	563360	to win government contracts to build these Starlink satellites?
563360	564680	I'ma say SpaceX.
564680	566520	Correct.
566520	568440	And we also have Starlink's, and by extension,
568440	570600	Musk's involvement in the Ukrainian defense
570600	573720	against the Russian invasion launched in early 2022.
573720	576480	Initially, SpaceX was awarded a government contract
576480	577720	by the Department of Defense
577720	579800	to provide satellite support for communications
579800	582680	for Ukrainian civilians and military entities
582680	584480	in their own self-defense.
584480	587480	But multiple reports have indicated that Musk himself
587480	589960	has been monkeying around with the satellites,
589960	591400	interrupting communications,
591400	593640	and thwarting attacks the Ukrainian military
593640	596400	was attempting to carry out on Russian targets.
596400	598560	The DoDs basically had to throw their hands up
598560	600160	and be like, well, they're a private company,
600160	601120	what can you do?
601120	603440	I don't know, stop giving them contracts,
603440	605480	let somebody else build the satellites?
605480	607680	SpaceX's entire reason to exist
607680	609240	is to guzzle government money.
609240	611680	Think of the SpaceX part of his fortune,
611680	615360	like a GoFundMe designed to make the worst person you know,
615360	617720	even richer, and you cannot opt out of it.
617720	618920	It's time to talk about Tesla.
618920	621840	Tesla, the preferred car of some of the biggest assholes
621840	622680	you know.
622680	626600	The company was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard
626600	629800	and Mark Tarpening, two actual engineers.
629800	633080	Elon invested $6.5 million into early Tesla
633080	634920	and became chairman of the company's board.
635040	637760	And immediately started taking credit for things.
637760	639880	Eberhard and Tarpening came up with the ideas,
639880	641200	designed the actual cars,
641200	642600	got all the company's ducks in a row
642600	644360	to revolutionize the electric car market,
644360	648280	and then, as thanks, in 2007, Musk ran both of them
648280	650520	out of the company and started calling himself
650520	651920	the founder of Tesla.
651920	654040	Kind of like an invasive species bird
654040	656400	who pushes the eggs out of other birds' nests
656400	657360	to lay their own.
657360	659360	Indeed, and then says you invented eggs.
659360	660880	Eggs, they're mine, I did it.
660880	663200	In 2008, Musk was forced to step down
663200	664640	as chairman of the board of Tesla
664640	667640	after falsely promising, via Tweet Natch,
667640	670640	that he had funding secured to take Tesla private
670640	674280	at $420 per share, thus artificially inflating
674280	676680	the share value in a way a teenage boy might.
676680	679760	He was fined $20 million by the SEC over the stunt,
679760	682760	and he agreed to have a social media minder
682760	684480	approve his tweets before sending them.
684480	685560	How'd that go?
685560	687000	Elon had a wild summer.
687960	691120	That July, Elon had offered to help the cave rescue
691120	693880	of a trapped youth soccer team in Thailand
693880	696000	with a submarine he invented.
696000	699440	Let me remind you, Elon Musk is not an engineer,
699440	701360	nor had his companies made anything
701360	703560	designed to operate underwater.
703560	706240	The actual guy who saved the kids, Vernon Unsworth,
706240	708240	insulted Musk's silly little idea,
708240	709800	saying in a TV interview that Musk
709800	712400	could stick his imaginary submarine up his ass.
712400	715640	Musk responded by tweeting that Unsworth, who again,
715640	718520	just saved a kid's soccer team from cave death,
718520	719840	was a pedo guy.
719840	720680	Pedo guy.
720680	722320	Musk got sued.
722320	724280	During the trial, he claimed that pedo guy
724280	727040	was a common insult in the English-speaking world.
727040	729720	Literally never heard that one before.
729720	731480	Me neither.
731480	733120	Musk ended up prevailing in that suit,
733120	736400	but not before wasting a bunch of his time and hours,
736400	737440	but back to Tesla.
737440	738600	The company has been in the news
738600	740560	for its biggest layoffs ever.
740560	743960	14,000 people, or 10% of its workforce,
743960	748600	were unceremoniously let go over email in mid-April.
748600	750360	But whispers around the industry indicate
750400	752960	that the layoff might actually be much bigger than 10%,
752960	755200	perhaps even closer to 20%.
755200	757600	The stock price is absolutely tanking.
757600	762120	Tesla's total valuation was once a ridiculous $1.3 trillion.
762120	765400	Today, that value is down to less than half a billion dollars
765400	766520	and dropping.
766520	768480	That's a stupid amount of money.
768480	771280	Isn't General Motors only worth like 50 billion?
771280	772960	Yeah, if Tesla is an auto manufacturer,
772960	774600	its value has a long way to fall
774600	777480	before it's in line with other auto manufacturers.
777480	779040	But it also doesn't make sense
779040	781000	that the stock price has stayed so high
781000	783320	amid all of the company's controversies.
783320	785600	Multiple lawsuits over much of the company's history
785600	787080	have accused the company of lying
787080	788280	about how much money it's making
788280	790280	in order to inflate its stock price.
790280	792880	Tesla has received hundreds of millions of dollars
792880	795240	from the government for a battery swap technology
795240	797360	that was never made available to the public
797360	799600	and turned out to be a giant scam.
799600	802120	It's no secret Tesla's shitty to its workers,
802120	805040	fighting unionization efforts here and overseas.
805040	808720	He's even threatened his own employees on Twitter
808720	810440	when he should be being CEO.
810440	812160	How do you find the time, my dude?
812160	813840	There have been tens of thousands of reports
813840	816080	of Tesla's being shitty from things as minor
816080	818720	as poor quality builds to serious issues
818720	821480	like sudden uncontrollable acceleration.
821480	822800	Don't want that in a car.
822800	824720	Faulty braking, that's not good either.
824720	827240	Range issues that the company itself has suppressed.
827240	829840	An operating system that can be hacked
829840	831960	and controlled by outside entities.
831960	834440	Batteries that spontaneously light on fire.
834440	835960	The suspension suddenly collapsing
835960	838720	leading to something called Wampi Wheels,
838720	840440	which sounds like a carnival ride,
840440	842800	to one tragic story of a Tesla reversing
842800	846360	into a retaining pond with its driver trapped inside
846360	851200	and first responders unable to break in as the woman drowned.
851200	853920	That woman, by the way, was Mitch McConnell's sister-in-law
853920	855680	and that just happened this year.
855680	857680	Jesus Christ.
857680	859560	Just, you don't want a car to do that.
859560	861120	No, it sounds like they're put together
861120	862480	like carnival rides.
862480	864200	Now I've been saying that Elon isn't the one
864200	865280	who's actually making the cars
865280	867600	because he's not a real engineer and that's true.
867600	869520	But Tesla, more than most companies,
869520	872120	lives and dies by public perception of Elon.
872120	875120	The company is trapped by the innovator cosplay
875120	877160	Elon insists on dressing himself in.
877160	879880	Which is why Elon's public image impacts
879880	881800	the price of the company's stock so much.
881800	882760	Exactly.
882760	884240	The stock market is mostly fueled
884240	886280	by wishes and hopes and dreams.
886280	887640	And if people don't believe in Elon,
887640	889280	they don't believe in Tesla.
889280	892520	If Elon is a scam, then Tesla is a scam.
892520	893880	And Elon is real scammy.
893880	894720	Scammy.
894720	895960	As all this stuff is happening,
895960	898120	a series of embarrassing public disasters
898120	901520	continue to make Teslas look more and more like clown cars.
901520	904640	Back in December, 2023, Tesla issued a recall
904640	909640	for an eye-watering 2,031,220 vehicles
910280	912280	after a National Highway Traffic Safety
912280	914200	Administration investigation found
914200	916760	that the auto steer function wasn't safe.
916760	919480	Cybertruck, long cheerleaded by Musk,
919480	921400	is an ugly, clunky embarrassment
921400	923680	that has publicly face planted.
924720	925560	Yeah.
930160	931000	Sure?
931000	931840	Yeah.
933840	935560	Oh my God, Elon.
935560	938680	Well, maybe that was a little too hard.
942160	943960	Should we try it one more?
943960	944800	Try it?
944800	945640	Yeah.
946920	947800	What?
947800	948640	Yeah.
948640	949480	It didn't go through.
949480	950480	So that's a plus side.
950480	951800	Let's try the right one.
951800	952640	Try that one, really?
952640	953480	Okay.
953480	954320	Sure.
955320	956440	Oh, man.
956440	957440	It didn't go through.
957440	958280	Yeah.
959360	960200	Yeah.
960200	961040	All right.
961920	962760	What?
963920	964760	That'll be bad.
964760	966840	Things only went downhill for the Cybertruck from there,
966840	968480	and it's a good thing too, because if it's muddy,
968480	970400	downhill is the only direction a Cybertruck
970400	971560	can go without getting stuck.
971560	972560	Fuck.
972560	974600	The Cybertruck, like many Tesla offerings,
974600	977440	has experienced delivery delays, systemic failures,
977440	981240	safety issues, quality issues, and also can't haul shit.
981240	982600	Its battery doesn't last as long
982600	985280	as Tesla's sales material promised it would,
985280	986480	especially in cold weather.
986480	989160	Some observers have pointed out that it seems like Tesla
989160	992560	is making consumers pay for and beta test a product
992560	994440	that isn't actually ready for market.
994440	997320	The Cybertruck is what you might call a gender-affirming car
997320	998880	for men who want to prove to the world
998880	1001320	that they have $100,000 to throw away
1001320	1003480	on the world's shittiest vehicle.
1003480	1006560	Tesla recently announced that their halting production
1006560	1009320	of the electric Ford Pinto of our times.
1009320	1010880	Good night, sweet prince.
1010880	1013400	And even at its newest and shiniest,
1013400	1015080	it still looks like the Armadillos
1015080	1017800	that Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck drove on the asteroid
1017800	1022040	in Armageddon, a movie from 1998, just saying.
1022040	1025520	Meanwhile, other automakers are getting into the EV game.
1025520	1027000	And some of them are bringing cars
1027000	1029120	to market that are more attractive, affordable,
1029120	1033000	and have less PR nightmare CEOs than Tesla does.
1033000	1035640	All of this has meant that Tesla's market share has diminished,
1035640	1038400	and its share price is tanked, as its sales and production
1038400	1039440	outlook has dimmed.
1039440	1040880	Musk is betting that his company will
1040880	1043520	be able to get out ahead of the autonomous taxi market,
1043520	1046800	something that nobody outside of like 500 people in Palo Alto
1046800	1047800	fucking want.
1047800	1050600	Plus, a fully self-driving car technology
1050600	1052160	doesn't exist, right?
1052160	1053360	It doesn't.
1053360	1056640	The technology used to be called fully self-driving or FSD,
1056640	1059880	but they got in trouble with regulators
1059880	1062200	because the technology does not actually work.
1062200	1065320	Now the tech is being referred to as FSD with supervision.
1065320	1068080	Still, Musk is all in on the tech,
1068080	1071360	claiming that Tesla owners for the low, low price of $99
1071360	1074080	per month will one day be able to install the software
1074080	1077720	on their cars, which can then work as autonomous taxis when
1077720	1078880	the owners aren't using them.
1078880	1080400	Your car can be your robot slave.
1080400	1081080	I am not kidding.
1081080	1082640	That's part of his business plan, Alyssa.
1082640	1085560	OK, so if you have FSD on your Tesla,
1085560	1089400	you still have to pay a subscription to use it?
1089400	1090400	Fuck that.
1090400	1091160	No.
1091160	1093200	The thing about fully autonomous vehicles
1093200	1095560	is that they're another musky and fairy tale.
1095560	1099000	Elon has been promising that the fully self-driving technology
1099000	1101600	is right around the corner for so long,
1101600	1103960	except if you try to get around that proverbial corner
1103960	1106040	in a Tesla, the car never makes the turn,
1106040	1107160	the steering malfunctions.
1107160	1108800	Next thing you know it, you've run head
1108800	1110520	on into the broad side of a pizzeria.
1110520	1112600	So it also seems like a terribly stupid idea
1112600	1116240	to reorganize city infrastructure around a massive fleet
1116240	1119480	of robo taxis when the roads are already congested.
1119480	1122840	And by the way, public transportation already exists.
1122840	1124360	Couldn't we just use all that money
1124360	1127360	that Elon wants to pocket and improve what we already have?
1127360	1128800	One would think.
1128800	1131400	Actually, Elon has headed out for public transportation
1131400	1132600	for a long time.
1132600	1133640	Do you remember the Hyperloop?
1133640	1136680	A stupider, more expensive version of trains?
1136680	1138880	The Hyperloop is such a moronic idea
1138880	1140680	that it almost pains me to say it out loud.
1140680	1142800	Back when Elon was king shit of fuck mountain,
1142800	1145440	a.k.a. before he developed whatever condition it is
1145440	1147960	that makes it impossible for him to not run his big, fat mouth
1147960	1151160	all the time, Elon, quote, invented, unquote,
1151160	1154600	a mass transit system that moves large numbers of passengers
1154600	1156360	through low pressure tubes.
1156360	1159280	You mean like the plastic chutes at the drive-through bank?
1159280	1160520	Sort of.
1160520	1163560	I like that vintage reference.
1163560	1165840	Except bigger, more expensive with magnets
1165840	1168200	and of course requiring massive amounts of money
1168200	1170400	to be funneled to one of Elon Musk's companies.
1170400	1173400	And once again, so many people fell for it.
1173400	1177000	The boring company started as a subsidiary of SpaceX
1177000	1178720	with the stated aim of digging holes
1178720	1180720	for this stupid idea all over the place.
1180760	1182920	MIT was investigating getting involved.
1182920	1186080	There was talk of building one connecting LA and San Francisco
1186080	1188360	basically under the five, if you know California,
1188360	1191200	even though we could have just used that money to build
1191200	1194240	a high-speed rail between LA and San Francisco,
1194240	1196280	which is something that people in both cities
1196280	1198440	have wanted for decades, I don't understand.
1198440	1200560	Elon never really wanted to build
1200560	1203400	ultra-fast, large-scale mass transportation.
1203400	1205400	He simply wanted to derail discussions
1205400	1208140	of actual high-speed rail that actually worked
1208140	1209800	because he owns a car company
1209800	1211360	that depends on people not having
1211360	1214160	comfortable, affordable mass transit options available.
1214160	1216760	So this whole plan was just to stop
1216760	1219000	public transportation from getting better
1219000	1221200	so he could sell more cars,
1221200	1223320	like the bad guy from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
1223320	1225360	Exactly like that bad guy.
1225360	1227520	Now, a little over a decade after Hyperloop Mania
1227520	1229000	took Silicon Valley by storm,
1229000	1231800	all we have to show for it is a puny little tunnel
1231800	1234840	that connects part of the Las Vegas Convention Center
1234840	1236560	and some plans in other cities
1236560	1239480	that will likely soon quietly disappear from the internet.
1239480	1240800	So you dread the annual physical
1240800	1243360	with the guilt-tripping lectures like I do?
1243360	1244880	More greens, choose organic,
1244880	1247560	eat five cups of fruits and vegetables a day.
1247560	1250000	I admit I could eat better, but I don't have time.
1250000	1251880	That's why I started taking Field of Greens
1251880	1253200	by Brickhouse Nutrition.
1253200	1256440	Field of Greens is whole organic fruits and vegetables.
1256440	1257840	Real food, not extracts.
1257840	1260520	Each fruit and vegetable in Field of Greens
1260520	1263280	was medically chosen for a specific health benefit.
1263280	1265840	Some support vital organs like heart, liver, and kidneys,
1265840	1268760	while others give your metabolism and immune system a boost.
1268760	1271240	I'm so busy and I don't always eat like I should.
1271240	1273960	The powerhouse blend in Field of Greens fills the gap
1273960	1276200	so I stay energetic, focused, and healthy.
1276200	1278760	And if you don't feel the incredible difference like I did,
1278760	1280840	you can return it for a full refund.

1290080	1292240	Now that he's done his part to fill the highways
1292240	1294800	and atmosphere with vehicles that sometimes explode
1294800	1296720	and digs subterranean tunnels to nowhere,
1296720	1298720	Musk has moved on to technology.
1298720	1301680	Meant to be installed directly into the human body.
1301680	1305160	If I wouldn't get into one of his driverless taxis,
1305160	1307320	why on earth would I let one of his companies
1307320	1309400	install a chip into my brain?
1309400	1311400	The trillion dollar question.
1311400	1314120	In 2016, along with a handful of actual scientists,
1314120	1317640	Musk co-founded Neuralink after buying the trademark
1317640	1318960	from the two neuroscientists
1318960	1321680	who had actually founded Neuralink the year prior.
1321680	1323840	The company's aim is to produce technology
1323840	1325680	that can be implanted into the human brain.
1325680	1326920	Neuralink has been under fire
1326920	1328600	for killing an awful lot of the primates
1328600	1331200	that's been testing on, but nevertheless,
1331200	1334480	its chip was approved for human trials in 2023.
1334480	1336200	Earlier this year, Musk claimed
1336200	1338720	that a successful human trial had been conducted.
1338720	1341220	I have yet to see a single piece of reported media
1341220	1344960	that confirms this claim by somebody who isn't Musk himself
1344960	1346680	or someone Musk is paying,
1346680	1349600	but Elon girlbossed a little too hard when he bought Twitter.
1349600	1352200	It really has been something to watch the whole world
1352200	1354800	get wise to his bullshit at the same time.
1354800	1355920	Enough ink has been spilled
1355920	1358200	about Musk's disastrous takeover of Twitter
1358200	1360640	once a flawed but functional town square,
1360640	1364520	now the social media equivalent of an abandoned blockbuster
1364520	1367520	video that has been taken over by flea-infested raccoons.
1367520	1369360	So let's not get bogged down by the details.
1369360	1371600	What's most important is that thanks to his pathological
1371600	1374000	desire to force people to like him,
1374000	1376200	Elon's ineptitude has been on full display,
1376200	1379040	calling into question his genius and business acumen
1379040	1380520	in the rest of his portfolio.
1380520	1382720	The acquisition of Twitter was characterized
1382720	1384840	by drama and erratic behavior by Musk.
1384840	1387520	In 2022, he first tried a hostile takeover
1387520	1390160	of the company before winning the board's approval.
1390160	1393640	But then when he realized that $44 billion he'd offered
1393640	1395520	to pay was way too much for a company
1395520	1398640	that wasn't great at making money, he tried to back out.
1398640	1401080	The board threatened to sue but Musk relented
1401080	1403160	and the shotgun wedding between Elon and Twitter
1403160	1405340	happened in October, 2022.
1405340	1407800	Elon financed the deal with some creative leveraging
1407800	1409600	that ended up resulting in him having to sell
1409600	1412920	a bunch of Tesla stock, driving the share price down,
1412920	1414760	and thus his overall wealth down.
1414760	1418240	Elon, it turns out, is not good at running Twitter.
1418240	1421160	He fired or chased away 80% of the staff,
1421160	1423880	likely violating several labor laws and doing so.
1423880	1426080	He reinstated several accounts that have been banned
1426080	1429440	for hate speech, relaxed rules around anti-trans speech,
1429440	1431400	and COVID-19 misinformation,
1431400	1433520	gave a handful of doofus reporters access
1433520	1436800	to internal Twitter files, plopped his cottage cheese ass
1436800	1439960	into a dust chair, and tweeted as hard as he possibly could.
1439960	1442160	And who can forget the blue check mark fiasco?
1442200	1444800	Blue verification check marks were long viewed
1444800	1446700	as a class signifier in old Twitter,
1446700	1449120	which made a lot of people wearing wrap-around sunglasses
1449120	1450800	and their user picture angry.
1450800	1452720	So Elon got rid of the blue checks.
1452720	1454800	The problem is that the checks also verified
1454800	1457360	that people on the site were who they said they were
1457360	1460720	and that so-called official accounts were not imposters.
1460720	1464080	And so, in the first days of the program's elimination,
1464080	1466060	somebody pretending to be the official account
1466060	1469800	of drugmaker Eli Lilly declared that insulin was now free
1469800	1471840	among other imposter shenanigans.
1471840	1472880	That was actually quite funny.
1472880	1474800	That was really, it was one of the best days
1474800	1475640	in Twitter history.
1475640	1476480	It was great.
1476480	1478480	Bleeding money, Elon tried to get Twitter users
1478480	1480240	to pay $8 for the check marks.
1480240	1482640	And people were like, fuck that you clown.
1482640	1484240	So the only people who had blue checks
1484240	1488240	were suspiciously Elon fanboys and conservative super tweeters
1488240	1489920	who would hassle anybody who complained
1489920	1491920	about the new verification system
1491920	1494200	by accusing them of being too poor or stingy
1494200	1497920	to fork over $8 to one of the world's richest men.
1497920	1501760	I am shocked, shocked that trying to use bullying
1501760	1503200	as a chief sales technique
1503200	1505920	for Twitter's verification program was ineffective.
1505920	1506880	In April of this year,
1506880	1508800	Twitter quietly restored blue check marks
1508800	1510600	to several journalists and public figures
1510600	1512480	without charging them $8.
1512480	1515080	When several prominent Twitter users started swapping tips
1515080	1517040	on how to hide the dreaded blue check of shame
1517040	1518200	next to their names,
1518200	1520740	Twitter removed their ability to hide the check.
1520740	1522100	Researchers found that under Musk,
1522100	1524480	hate speech increased dramatically on the platform,
1524480	1525920	anti-Semitic speech increased,
1525920	1528760	as did propaganda originating from the Islamic State.
1528760	1530160	Great job, Elon.
1530160	1531400	Some of the hate speech, by the way,
1531400	1533360	was amplified by Musk himself,
1533360	1535360	like the time he publicly agreed with a tweet
1535360	1538320	alleging that Jewish people hate white people.
1538320	1541320	Musk responded by revoking access to Twitter's API,
1541320	1543240	so now nobody has any idea
1543240	1546360	just how bad things have gotten quantitatively.
1546360	1548760	However, Alyssa, there is a workaround.
1548760	1551040	You can still tell how bad Twitter has gotten
1551040	1552920	by simply looking at it.
1552920	1553940	Yes.
1553940	1556680	And it turns out platforming unbridled free speech
1556680	1558160	with virtually no moderation
1558160	1560520	has meant that since Elon fired or chased out
1560520	1562160	most of Twitter's legacy employees,
1562160	1564320	the site has also become a haven
1564320	1567680	for misinformation and child pornography.
1567680	1568520	In early April,
1568520	1570140	the Brazilian Supreme Court announced
1570140	1571320	that they were investigating him
1571320	1575680	for, quote, flagrant obstruction of Brazilian justice, unquote.
1575680	1578240	The chickens have to come home to roost eventually, right?
1578240	1581600	Yeah, and I would watch a show called Brazilian justice.
1581600	1582960	It sounds like a lot of fun.
1582960	1585040	Twitter put on display how desperate Elon was
1585040	1586360	to have people like him,
1586360	1588640	despite his fundamental unlikeability.
1588640	1589960	In February, 2023,
1589960	1591800	Elon got upset that not enough people
1591800	1593320	were engaging with his tweets
1593320	1595040	and had some of his internal engineers
1595040	1596280	investigate what was wrong.
1596280	1598400	This story makes me so embarrassed.
1598400	1599400	So sad for him.
1599400	1600980	One of his engineers suggested
1600980	1604560	that perhaps public interest in Musk himself was waning,
1604560	1606600	and so Musk fired him.
1606600	1607440	A few days later,
1607440	1610040	when President Joe Biden's tweets about the Super Bowl
1610040	1612240	got more engagement than Elon's,
1612240	1615320	Elon demanded the engineers fix it or be fired.
1615360	1617760	So they changed the Twitter algorithm
1617760	1621720	so that regular users would be spammed with Elon's tweets,
1621720	1625400	magnifying the automatic reach of Elon's tweets 1,000 times.
1625400	1628440	That is the saddest shit I have ever heard.
1628440	1629880	In 2023 via Twitter,
1629880	1632600	he accused a young Jewish man named Ben Brody
1632600	1634760	of participating in a neo-Nazi brawl
1634760	1638000	as an Antifa member of a false flag operation.
1638000	1641760	Brody wasn't even in the state where the brawl occurred.
1641760	1643960	His family claims that Musk's amplification
1644000	1647360	of the fringe conspiracy theory, based on nothing,
1647360	1649680	had led to massive amounts of harassment and threats
1649680	1651800	and sued Musk for a million dollars.
1651800	1656080	Musk was deposed in March and it went poorly.
1656080	1658120	In the deposition which Musk's lawyers
1658120	1659920	unsuccessfully fought to seal,
1659920	1663240	Musk at one point does not seem to understand
1663240	1664760	what a lawyer does.
1664760	1667360	Daren, what about the people who stayed on Twitter
1667360	1670320	even after Elon turned it into a haunted shopping mall?
1670320	1672000	Well, Elon has tried to turn Twitter
1672000	1674320	into a landing pad for media personalities
1674320	1677560	who had been canceled or, in normal English,
1677560	1680200	faced consequences as a result of fucking up.
1680200	1683080	He snatched up Tucker Carlson after Tucker's ouster
1683080	1685760	from Fox News with promises that Tucker could create
1685760	1687440	Twitter exclusive content.
1687440	1689120	But the site didn't have the technology
1689120	1692080	to support the sort of thing Tucker wanted to make.
1692080	1693240	Sounds familiar.
1693240	1695280	And former CNN anchor Don Lemon
1695280	1698320	was also invited to Elon's Tiki Torch rally
1698320	1699880	only to have his contract canceled
1699880	1702560	days before Lemon's show was supposed to debut
1702560	1704280	after an interview Lemon conducted
1704280	1706320	with Musk went off the rails.
1706320	1709040	Musk keeps claiming he loves free speech,
1709040	1711600	but he doesn't like it when people talk shit about him.
1711600	1714080	Under Musk's flop sweat soaked innovation,
1714080	1717920	the value of Twitter at NowX.com, the old chestnut,
1717920	1720640	has fallen an estimated 65%.
1720640	1722680	Elon's Twitter foibles have exposed him
1722680	1725520	as an emotionally unstable, deeply weird, clueless phony
1725520	1726960	who believes that acting like an asshole
1726960	1728880	is the same thing as coming up with an idea.
1728880	1731560	He's a business bridezilla with an unlimited budget
1731560	1734120	and his employees are just the hapless wedding coordinators
1734120	1736160	trying to figure out how to bend reality
1736160	1738040	to bring his ridiculous plans to fruition.
1738040	1739520	And when he's confronted on his bullshit,
1739520	1740560	he throws a fit.
1740560	1743760	Who can forget this infamous public appearance?
1743760	1745960	If somebody's gonna try to blackmail me with advertising,
1745960	1748880	blackmail me with money, go f*** yourself.
1748880	1750920	Go f*** yourself.
1752120	1752960	Is that clear?
1752960	1753800	It's funny.
1753800	1756680	He didn't used to seem as unhinged as he does now.
1756680	1759000	I know, I kind of wonder what it is,
1759000	1760880	but there is a working theory out there.
1760880	1761720	Failing?
1761720	1764320	That theory is, it's the drugs.
1764320	1766840	According to a Wall Street Journal report from January,
1766840	1769520	Elon has been known to dabble in such substances
1769520	1773480	as cocaine, mushrooms, LSD, ecstasy, and ketamine.
1773480	1776000	But last I checked, most people who go into a K-hole
1776000	1778800	don't come out the other side of megalomaniac baby.
1778800	1780600	And to prove he's cool and tough,
1780600	1783520	he smoked weed on the Joe Rogan podcast.
1783520	1786480	Speaking of babies, doesn't he have like a million kids?
1786520	1791000	Yes, Elon Musk has 11 children by three different women.
1791000	1791840	Woo!
1791840	1794400	He had six children with his first wife, Justine Wilson,
1794400	1796840	including one set of twins and one set of triplets,
1796840	1798680	which were conceived via IVF.
1798680	1801000	He has three children with the singer Grimes,
1801000	1803640	who you may most recently remember for turning in
1803640	1806320	one of the worst performances in Coachella history.
1806320	1808160	Elon also has twins with an executive
1808160	1810800	from his monkey-murdering enterprise Neuralink,
1810800	1812400	a fact that came to light through a piece
1812400	1814480	in Time Magazine by Walter Isaacson.
1814480	1816240	News of the twins with the Canadian Neuralink
1816240	1818440	executive broke just days before news
1818440	1821360	that he'd had his third baby with Grimes broke.
1821360	1822560	Boy, that was awkward.
1823480	1826480	I've got questions about what's been going on,
1826480	1829560	and I don't know for sure that I want the answers.
1829560	1831400	In response, Elon made a weird joke
1831400	1833760	about doing his part to repopulate the world,
1833760	1836600	but he's long been weirdly obsessed with the birthrate
1836600	1838520	because he said that he's worried
1838520	1841600	there won't be enough people to move to his Mars colony.
1841600	1843920	Musk has reportedly given $10 million
1843920	1846680	to a population research project in Texas
1846680	1849520	that aims to look into ways to increase the birthrate.
1849520	1851400	So Elon wants there to be more people
1851400	1853040	so that he can send them to Mars.
1853040	1855080	Fine, fine, go.
1855080	1856400	Problem that Musk's advice
1856400	1859160	that everybody should father as many children as possible
1859160	1862080	is that like his father who came before him,
1862080	1864040	Musk kind of sucks at being a dad.
1864040	1866440	He is currently being sued over parental rights
1866440	1869560	by his ex, Grimes, and one of his two oldest children
1869560	1872120	who came out as trans at age 16
1872120	1875600	openly hates her dad's guts for very understandable reasons.
1875600	1878120	He once claimed that the word cisgender was a slur
1878120	1880280	and urged all of his followers on Twitter
1880280	1882080	to watch the Daily Wire documentary,
1882080	1885320	What is a Woman, hosted by human skidmark Matt Walsh.
1885320	1887400	But maybe the shittiest thing Elon did
1887400	1890640	in the fatherhood arena was change some key details
1890640	1893960	about a tragedy to make himself sound like a hero.
1893960	1896480	Elon's oldest son named Nevada died tragically
1896480	1898240	from sudden infant death syndrome
1898240	1900040	when he was only 10 weeks old.
1900040	1903520	Many years later in 2022 via tweet, of course,
1903520	1905480	Elon later claimed that the baby had, quote,
1905480	1907560	died in his arms and that he, quote,
1907560	1909280	felt his last heartbeat.
1909280	1911680	Nevada's mother, his ex-wife, Justine disagreed,
1911680	1914480	tweeting, not that it matters to anyone except me
1914480	1916080	because it is one of the most sacred
1916080	1917680	and defining moments of my life,
1917680	1919560	but I was the one who was holding him.
1919560	1922440	That he would claim that is just tragically deranged.
1922440	1923960	It is absolutely deranged.
1923960	1925360	It's like some of the sickest shit ever.
1925360	1927840	And while a year prior, Justine had written
1927880	1929800	a glamour magazine piece called
1929800	1932320	I was a starter wife inside America's messiest divorce
1932320	1934840	that like many firsthand accounts of Elon Musk
1934840	1937120	make him sound like a total fucking dick.
1937120	1938360	In that article, she wrote,
1938360	1941360	Elon had called her open grief over Nevada's death,
1941360	1943040	emotionally manipulative.
1943040	1944280	Emotionally manipulative.
1944280	1946520	Your child's eyes, her baby died.
1946520	1947800	No wonder that marriage,
1947800	1949920	like the hyperloop, fully self-driving technology,
1949920	1952920	the cyber truck and his version of Twitter failed.
1952920	1956120	Whew, well, that's as good a note to end on as any.
1956120	1958160	What's extra crazy to me is that we can laugh
1958160	1960840	at his awkward dancing and make fun of how unfunny he is.
1960840	1962720	Thanks to the fact that government gives his company
1962720	1966360	so much money and Tesla stock is such a huge part of the S&P,
1966360	1969080	we all kinda own a stake in his clownery.
1969080	1971840	Nobody should have as much money as Elon Musk has
1971840	1974200	and nobody should have their fingers knuckle deep
1974200	1976800	in that many industries so important to things
1976800	1980320	like communication, transportation and national security.
1980320	1982720	Alyssa, I haven't even gotten to the cherry on top.
1982720	1985720	In April, the same week that Tesla announced record layoffs,
1985720	1988720	Elon once again asked the company board to approve
1988720	1992160	a $56 billion pay package for himself
1992160	1994200	that had been rejected by a judge in Delaware
1994200	1996640	over the fact that its exorbitant size
1996640	1999840	represented negligence of his fiduciary duties as CEO.
1999840	2001200	Sounds reasonable.
2001200	2006200	Can you imagine, can you imagine asking for $56 billion
2006920	2010000	after sending so many people out into the street?
2010000	2011960	Evil as shit, absolutely not.
2011960	2013200	Evil shit.
2013200	2015280	The only way that Elon Musk is a true innovator
2015280	2018400	is in his astonishing ability to oversell and under deliver.
2018400	2021480	His career is a series of fanciful, unkeepable promises
2021480	2023560	which a gullible media takes at his word,
2023560	2027600	but maybe, just maybe, the jigs finally up.
2027600	2031280	Wow, Elon, I feel like we barely scratched the surface.
2031280	2032920	So on a scale of one to five weasels.
2032920	2034840	Ooh, where's Elon?
2034840	2037640	Oh, he's gotta be a hard five weasel for so many reasons.
2037640	2040080	One, he's getting rich off our tax money.
2040080	2042000	He's getting rich off our tax money,
2042000	2044760	not doing shit with it, being mean to his kids
2044760	2048080	and not even getting to the moon.
2048080	2048900	Yeah.
2048900	2050080	Give me my money back.
2050080	2051440	Any ruined Twitter.
2051440	2052920	Yes, I'm gonna agree with you.
2052920	2054560	Okay, five, oh, we're in sync this week.
2054560	2057280	I say a hard five weasels for Elon Musk
2057280	2060320	just because he has so much power and he amassed it
2060320	2062240	in a way that I feel like everyone is like,
2062240	2065760	oh, whoa, this guy's in charge of a lot of stuff.
2065760	2069240	I don't know if there's a world in which he is no longer
2069240	2072120	just like the crazy person driving the economy.
2072120	2074840	And that is deeply, deeply upsetting.
2074840	2076440	Aaron, that was a fun one.
