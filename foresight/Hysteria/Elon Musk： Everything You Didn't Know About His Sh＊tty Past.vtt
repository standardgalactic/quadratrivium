00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
Welcome to another edition of This Fucking Guy,

00:02.840 --> 00:04.640
the series where we pick one fucking guy

00:04.640 --> 00:07.760
who's making America worse and explore why they suck.

00:07.760 --> 00:11.080
I'm Erin Ryan, host of Crooked Media's Hysteria podcast,

00:11.080 --> 00:12.440
and I'm Alyssa Mastromonico,

00:12.440 --> 00:15.360
the other host of Crooked Media's Hysteria podcast.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.840
And as you can probably see by our setup,

00:17.840 --> 00:19.280
we are in person today.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.080
The most special of treats.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.720
Alyssa, today we're going to dive into one

00:23.720 --> 00:25.880
of the best embodiments of the internet adage,

00:25.880 --> 00:28.120
nothing that only straight men like is cool.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.080
We will be looking into the life and times

00:30.080 --> 00:33.120
of the worst thing to come from South Africa since apartheid.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.480
A man who despite growing evidence that he's, shall we say,

00:36.480 --> 00:39.560
not in the headspace to control space exploration,

00:39.560 --> 00:42.280
electric vehicle manufacturing, communications,

00:42.280 --> 00:45.440
or the biotech industry is still being trusted

00:45.440 --> 00:47.320
with billions in government contracts

00:47.320 --> 00:49.640
and essentially being allowed to man the levers

00:49.640 --> 00:51.240
of the financial markets,

00:51.240 --> 00:54.360
all while rage tweeting fringe conspiracy theories

00:54.360 --> 00:56.080
and cozying up to extremists.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.960
Of course, this is Elon.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.360
I never bought into the hype around Elon Musk.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.240
He always struck me as a weirdo who was more full of shit

01:03.240 --> 01:05.720
than porta-potties at the end of the New York City marathon.

01:05.720 --> 01:06.920
That's pretty full of shit.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.800
Elon Musk became one of the richest people in the world

01:09.800 --> 01:12.880
by convincing enough people with power that he's a genius.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.720
But there's no there there.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.080
He's not a genius.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.320
He's not a scientist.

01:17.320 --> 01:18.840
He's not an engineer.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.040
He's not an innovator.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.280
He's a bullshitter.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.720
There are so many instances of Elon exaggerating

01:23.720 --> 01:26.440
or flat out spinning tall tales about his own prowess,

01:26.440 --> 01:28.720
but that was hard to not turn this video

01:28.720 --> 01:32.240
into a sprawling limited series a la Shogun.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.440
But we love a good scam.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.960
So let's learn about the self-perpetuating scam

01:36.960 --> 01:38.280
that is Elon.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.360
Strap in, Alyssa.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.200
I'm ready.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.680
Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28th, 1971,

01:43.680 --> 01:47.440
to a wealthy family of fucking weirdos in South Africa.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.680
His mother was a Canadian dietitian and model

01:49.680 --> 01:51.840
who has appeared on cereal boxes

01:51.840 --> 01:53.720
in the cover of Sports Illustrated.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.040
He has a brother, Kimball,

01:55.040 --> 01:57.920
who was once set up with one of Jeffrey Epstein's

01:57.920 --> 02:01.120
ex-girlfriends by Jeffrey Epstein himself.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.840
He's got a sister and a handful of half siblings.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.280
Elon's father, Errol, a millionaire engineer

02:06.280 --> 02:08.280
who claims he's killed a few people,

02:08.280 --> 02:11.920
was half owner of a Zambian emerald mine in the 1980s,

02:11.920 --> 02:15.120
he says, and eventually fathered two children

02:15.120 --> 02:17.400
with his own stepdaughter, Jana,

02:17.400 --> 02:21.360
thus making him his own stepfather-in-law, I think.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.640
I'm sorry, what?

02:22.640 --> 02:24.520
Yes, that's right, an emerald mine.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.840
Elon hates this story because he really wants people

02:26.840 --> 02:28.960
to believe that he's a self-made guy

02:28.960 --> 02:30.560
and not some Lego-headed lord

02:30.560 --> 02:32.840
who grew up in one of the biggest houses in Pretoria.

02:32.840 --> 02:33.800
No, no, no, no, no.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.600
Erin, I meant the thing about a stepdaughter.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.720
Oh yeah, right, I assumed you meant mine.

02:37.720 --> 02:41.880
Yeah, in 1979, Elon's dad divorced Elon's mom, May,

02:41.880 --> 02:44.680
and later married a woman who had two children of her own.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.240
Errol helped raise them, had two kids with her,

02:47.240 --> 02:50.480
and then had two kids with one of the stepchildren

02:50.480 --> 02:53.720
when she was of age and he was old as fuck.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.600
Errol once told an interviewer, quote,

02:55.600 --> 02:59.480
the only thing we're on this earth for is to reproduce.

02:59.480 --> 03:03.240
I can see where Elon gets his creepy reproduction fetish.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.720
Oh, we will get to that.

03:04.720 --> 03:05.680
Although to his credit,

03:05.680 --> 03:08.320
according to Elon biographer Walter Isaacson,

03:08.320 --> 03:09.840
Elon noticed and disapproved

03:09.840 --> 03:11.520
of the suspicious amount of attention

03:11.520 --> 03:13.760
his father was paying Jana, again,

03:13.760 --> 03:16.400
his own stepdaughter when she was 15 years old

03:16.400 --> 03:18.160
and Errol was 56.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.960
Errol insists that he was equally interested

03:20.960 --> 03:23.240
in all of his children and stepchildren.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.200
This video has already accomplished the impossible, Aaron,

03:26.200 --> 03:28.480
making me feel a little bit bad for Elon Musk.

03:28.480 --> 03:31.080
Elon was reportedly a mediocre student in high school,

03:31.080 --> 03:32.880
but somehow got high enough grades

03:32.880 --> 03:34.240
to get into college in Canada,

03:34.240 --> 03:35.800
where his mom lived at the time,

03:35.800 --> 03:37.080
and while he was there,

03:37.080 --> 03:38.880
he somehow did well enough to transfer

03:38.880 --> 03:41.800
to an Ivy League university in the United States.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.480
As Musk tells it, he received degrees in physics

03:44.480 --> 03:47.520
and economics from U Penn in 1995

03:47.520 --> 03:48.880
and then moved to California

03:48.880 --> 03:51.560
because he got into Stanford's PhD program,

03:51.560 --> 03:53.280
but dropped out after two days

03:53.280 --> 03:56.400
to be a full-time business boy genius.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.000
When the legend of Elon purports

03:58.000 --> 04:01.280
that he was the mental heft behind PayPal, Tesla and SpaceX,

04:01.280 --> 04:02.560
people just kind of go along with it

04:02.560 --> 04:04.080
because the belief that Silicon Valley

04:04.080 --> 04:06.280
is teeming with prodigies and visionaries

04:06.280 --> 04:07.520
and not just a bunch of assholes

04:07.520 --> 04:10.000
screwing each other over like bankers and sweatpants

04:10.000 --> 04:13.240
is central to justifying the tech sector's very existence.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.840
First, let's get to Elon and PayPal.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.960
He did not co-found PayPal.

04:16.960 --> 04:19.480
He started his first company with some help from daddy,

04:19.520 --> 04:22.040
sold that company to Compact, remember Compact?

04:22.040 --> 04:24.040
No, don't remember it all.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.880
Took the money he made from selling it

04:25.880 --> 04:29.480
and started a business called x.com.

04:29.480 --> 04:32.000
Surely you can't mean the social media website

04:32.000 --> 04:33.880
formerly known as Twitter

04:33.880 --> 04:36.720
or an early version of Tesla's Model X car

04:36.720 --> 04:39.040
or the company SpaceX

04:39.040 --> 04:41.360
or a site devoted to documenting the lives

04:41.360 --> 04:44.360
of one of his multiple children to whom he gave X names.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.240
Boy, he loves the letter X.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.040
Yeah, it's his favorite letter.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.760
No, this was an even earlier company called x.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.920
Can you guess from the name what it did?

04:52.920 --> 04:55.360
Sell erectile dysfunction medicines

04:55.360 --> 04:56.840
to impotent men in red states?

04:56.840 --> 04:57.920
No, good guess.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.840
It was an online bank that somehow offered a product

05:00.840 --> 05:02.200
that was less good than PayPal,

05:02.200 --> 05:03.640
which I have to admit is an achievement

05:03.640 --> 05:05.840
because PayPal sucks.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.720
Point is he named a bank after it

05:07.720 --> 05:10.360
because nothing conveys a sense of aboveboard safety

05:10.360 --> 05:12.960
and seriousness like a letter often used

05:12.960 --> 05:14.920
to denote the presence of a full bush

05:14.920 --> 05:16.760
in a film from the 1970s.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.480
You know they call the inner circle of early PayPal

05:19.480 --> 05:20.800
the PayPal mafia.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.960
Was Elon really anything like a Tony Soprano

05:23.960 --> 05:25.160
of online banking?

05:25.160 --> 05:28.640
He was a Jackie junior at most.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.600
Once PayPal and x.com merged and x.com

05:31.600 --> 05:33.880
like a dutiful wife took PayPal's name,

05:33.880 --> 05:37.000
Musk became CEO because he had the most money.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.360
But he was so annoying that eventually PayPal founder

05:39.360 --> 05:41.720
in Silicon Valley, Supervillain Peter Thiel

05:41.720 --> 05:45.040
found him too irritating to work with and so he quit.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.920
Well, the board eventually took Thiel's side

05:46.920 --> 05:50.040
and ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel.

05:50.040 --> 05:53.000
Imagine being more off-putting than Peter Thiel.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.920
I cannot imagine it.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.800
Musk remained the largest shareholder in PayPal, however,

05:57.800 --> 06:02.640
which ended up translating to a $165 million windfall

06:02.640 --> 06:04.760
when eBay bought the site in 2002.

06:04.760 --> 06:08.560
He used that money to start a company called SpaceX.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.320
Sounds like a souvenir boner pill sold in gas stations

06:11.320 --> 06:13.160
in Roswell, New Mexico.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.200
From what I can tell, it started with a desire

06:15.200 --> 06:17.240
to send people to Mars.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.520
Elon has always dreamed of sending people to Mars.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.920
Elon and early space ally, Michael Griffin,

06:21.920 --> 06:25.320
traveled to Russia together to try to convince some Russians

06:25.320 --> 06:28.760
to sell them some ICBMs so that Musk could pretend

06:28.760 --> 06:29.960
to invent rockets.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.680
But the Russians weren't interested

06:31.680 --> 06:33.640
because Elon was not an astronaut,

06:33.640 --> 06:36.480
nor did he possess any particular expertise about space.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.840
He was just a guy who liked space a lot.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.200
Undaunted, Musk used his PayPal money

06:42.200 --> 06:43.680
to hire a bunch of people,

06:43.680 --> 06:46.160
did know what they were doing space-wise,

06:46.160 --> 06:49.080
and the company SpaceX blasted off.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.520
Michael Griffin, that name sounds familiar.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.960
That's because Griffin would go on to be a BFD at NASA.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.880
Overseeing private partnership programs,

06:56.880 --> 06:57.960
including something called

06:57.960 --> 07:00.800
the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services,

07:00.800 --> 07:02.120
were COTS program.

07:02.120 --> 07:05.040
The program was designed to enlist private companies

07:05.040 --> 07:07.080
in transporting people and supplies

07:07.080 --> 07:09.320
to and from the International Space Station.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.680
Under Griffin, only two private companies

07:11.680 --> 07:13.520
were selected for the program.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.880
One of them was SpaceX.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.920
And thus began a long and fruitful career of SpaceX

07:17.920 --> 07:20.400
feeding from the prolific teat of Uncle Sam.

07:20.400 --> 07:24.880
In 2006, SpaceX was awarded a $396 million contract

07:24.880 --> 07:25.960
from NASA.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.760
Meanwhile, SpaceX didn't even have a rocket that worked.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.920
Its Falcon 1 program was sucking ass

07:31.920 --> 07:33.520
unless you think a rocket that explodes

07:33.520 --> 07:35.400
can still be counted as a success.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.960
Its first three launches between 2006 and 2008 failed,

07:38.960 --> 07:41.000
putting the company on the brink of bankruptcy

07:41.000 --> 07:45.280
at the same time as Tesla and Musk himself in late 2008.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.360
But then SpaceX got it on the fourth try,

07:48.360 --> 07:52.160
and as a prize for his company's one successful launch,

07:52.160 --> 07:56.600
Elon was given a $1.6 billion NASA contract that December.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.280
And it all blew up from there,

07:58.280 --> 08:00.720
both literally and figuratively.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.480
Erin, I think that when a SpaceX rocket explodes,

08:04.480 --> 08:08.320
it's called a rapid unscheduled disassembly

08:08.320 --> 08:11.040
when conscious uncoupling goes to space.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.560
And we shouldn't downplay the fact

08:12.560 --> 08:14.600
that the company has seen some success.

08:14.600 --> 08:18.400
And progress in space exploration is by definition messy.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.280
But Elon is not making the rockets.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.840
He's not an engineer.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.120
He's simply the guy who benefits the most financially

08:24.120 --> 08:25.960
from the work of people who are building the rockets

08:25.960 --> 08:27.840
and satellites while rage tweeting

08:27.840 --> 08:30.040
about how NPR shouldn't get government money.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.800
Since 2020, at least five of SpaceX's attempts

08:32.800 --> 08:34.400
to launch its Starship into space

08:34.400 --> 08:37.560
have ended with the experimental aircraft blowing up.

08:37.560 --> 08:41.000
SpaceX is now worth more than $36 billion, though,

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
having received $15.3 billion in government contracts.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
All this time, Elon won't stop yammering

08:47.000 --> 08:48.280
about sending people to Mars,

08:48.280 --> 08:50.720
but SpaceX has yet to demonstrate

08:50.720 --> 08:53.680
that they're even capable of sending people to the moon,

08:53.680 --> 08:55.000
which is a lot closer.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.400
Easier.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.200
NASA's plan has been to go back to the moon

08:58.200 --> 09:01.480
by the end of 2025, but if SpaceX can't do it,

09:01.480 --> 09:02.760
we can't do it.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.840
Side note about Michael Griffin in 2018,

09:04.840 --> 09:06.760
Griffin would go on to be appointed

09:06.760 --> 09:09.600
under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering

09:09.600 --> 09:10.960
under President Donald Trump.

09:10.960 --> 09:14.040
One of his responsibilities was to award government contracts

09:14.040 --> 09:17.680
to build low-orbit national security satellites.

09:17.680 --> 09:19.560
Guess which company was one of two

09:19.560 --> 09:23.360
to win government contracts to build these Starlink satellites?

09:23.360 --> 09:24.680
I'ma say SpaceX.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.520
Correct.

09:26.520 --> 09:28.440
And we also have Starlink's, and by extension,

09:28.440 --> 09:30.600
Musk's involvement in the Ukrainian defense

09:30.600 --> 09:33.720
against the Russian invasion launched in early 2022.

09:33.720 --> 09:36.480
Initially, SpaceX was awarded a government contract

09:36.480 --> 09:37.720
by the Department of Defense

09:37.720 --> 09:39.800
to provide satellite support for communications

09:39.800 --> 09:42.680
for Ukrainian civilians and military entities

09:42.680 --> 09:44.480
in their own self-defense.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.480
But multiple reports have indicated that Musk himself

09:47.480 --> 09:49.960
has been monkeying around with the satellites,

09:49.960 --> 09:51.400
interrupting communications,

09:51.400 --> 09:53.640
and thwarting attacks the Ukrainian military

09:53.640 --> 09:56.400
was attempting to carry out on Russian targets.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.560
The DoDs basically had to throw their hands up

09:58.560 --> 10:00.160
and be like, well, they're a private company,

10:00.160 --> 10:01.120
what can you do?

10:01.120 --> 10:03.440
I don't know, stop giving them contracts,

10:03.440 --> 10:05.480
let somebody else build the satellites?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.680
SpaceX's entire reason to exist

10:07.680 --> 10:09.240
is to guzzle government money.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.680
Think of the SpaceX part of his fortune,

10:11.680 --> 10:15.360
like a GoFundMe designed to make the worst person you know,

10:15.360 --> 10:17.720
even richer, and you cannot opt out of it.

10:17.720 --> 10:18.920
It's time to talk about Tesla.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.840
Tesla, the preferred car of some of the biggest assholes

10:21.840 --> 10:22.680
you know.

10:22.680 --> 10:26.600
The company was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard

10:26.600 --> 10:29.800
and Mark Tarpening, two actual engineers.

10:29.800 --> 10:33.080
Elon invested $6.5 million into early Tesla

10:33.080 --> 10:34.920
and became chairman of the company's board.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.760
And immediately started taking credit for things.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.880
Eberhard and Tarpening came up with the ideas,

10:39.880 --> 10:41.200
designed the actual cars,

10:41.200 --> 10:42.600
got all the company's ducks in a row

10:42.600 --> 10:44.360
to revolutionize the electric car market,

10:44.360 --> 10:48.280
and then, as thanks, in 2007, Musk ran both of them

10:48.280 --> 10:50.520
out of the company and started calling himself

10:50.520 --> 10:51.920
the founder of Tesla.

10:51.920 --> 10:54.040
Kind of like an invasive species bird

10:54.040 --> 10:56.400
who pushes the eggs out of other birds' nests

10:56.400 --> 10:57.360
to lay their own.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.360
Indeed, and then says you invented eggs.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.880
Eggs, they're mine, I did it.

11:00.880 --> 11:03.200
In 2008, Musk was forced to step down

11:03.200 --> 11:04.640
as chairman of the board of Tesla

11:04.640 --> 11:07.640
after falsely promising, via Tweet Natch,

11:07.640 --> 11:10.640
that he had funding secured to take Tesla private

11:10.640 --> 11:14.280
at $420 per share, thus artificially inflating

11:14.280 --> 11:16.680
the share value in a way a teenage boy might.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.760
He was fined $20 million by the SEC over the stunt,

11:19.760 --> 11:22.760
and he agreed to have a social media minder

11:22.760 --> 11:24.480
approve his tweets before sending them.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.560
How'd that go?

11:25.560 --> 11:27.000
Elon had a wild summer.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.120
That July, Elon had offered to help the cave rescue

11:31.120 --> 11:33.880
of a trapped youth soccer team in Thailand

11:33.880 --> 11:36.000
with a submarine he invented.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.440
Let me remind you, Elon Musk is not an engineer,

11:39.440 --> 11:41.360
nor had his companies made anything

11:41.360 --> 11:43.560
designed to operate underwater.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.240
The actual guy who saved the kids, Vernon Unsworth,

11:46.240 --> 11:48.240
insulted Musk's silly little idea,

11:48.240 --> 11:49.800
saying in a TV interview that Musk

11:49.800 --> 11:52.400
could stick his imaginary submarine up his ass.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.640
Musk responded by tweeting that Unsworth, who again,

11:55.640 --> 11:58.520
just saved a kid's soccer team from cave death,

11:58.520 --> 11:59.840
was a pedo guy.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.680
Pedo guy.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.320
Musk got sued.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.280
During the trial, he claimed that pedo guy

12:04.280 --> 12:07.040
was a common insult in the English-speaking world.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.720
Literally never heard that one before.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.480
Me neither.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.120
Musk ended up prevailing in that suit,

12:13.120 --> 12:16.400
but not before wasting a bunch of his time and hours,

12:16.400 --> 12:17.440
but back to Tesla.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.600
The company has been in the news

12:18.600 --> 12:20.560
for its biggest layoffs ever.

12:20.560 --> 12:23.960
14,000 people, or 10% of its workforce,

12:23.960 --> 12:28.600
were unceremoniously let go over email in mid-April.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.360
But whispers around the industry indicate

12:30.400 --> 12:32.960
that the layoff might actually be much bigger than 10%,

12:32.960 --> 12:35.200
perhaps even closer to 20%.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.600
The stock price is absolutely tanking.

12:37.600 --> 12:42.120
Tesla's total valuation was once a ridiculous $1.3 trillion.

12:42.120 --> 12:45.400
Today, that value is down to less than half a billion dollars

12:45.400 --> 12:46.520
and dropping.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.480
That's a stupid amount of money.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.280
Isn't General Motors only worth like 50 billion?

12:51.280 --> 12:52.960
Yeah, if Tesla is an auto manufacturer,

12:52.960 --> 12:54.600
its value has a long way to fall

12:54.600 --> 12:57.480
before it's in line with other auto manufacturers.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.040
But it also doesn't make sense

12:59.040 --> 13:01.000
that the stock price has stayed so high

13:01.000 --> 13:03.320
amid all of the company's controversies.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.600
Multiple lawsuits over much of the company's history

13:05.600 --> 13:07.080
have accused the company of lying

13:07.080 --> 13:08.280
about how much money it's making

13:08.280 --> 13:10.280
in order to inflate its stock price.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.880
Tesla has received hundreds of millions of dollars

13:12.880 --> 13:15.240
from the government for a battery swap technology

13:15.240 --> 13:17.360
that was never made available to the public

13:17.360 --> 13:19.600
and turned out to be a giant scam.

13:19.600 --> 13:22.120
It's no secret Tesla's shitty to its workers,

13:22.120 --> 13:25.040
fighting unionization efforts here and overseas.

13:25.040 --> 13:28.720
He's even threatened his own employees on Twitter

13:28.720 --> 13:30.440
when he should be being CEO.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.160
How do you find the time, my dude?

13:32.160 --> 13:33.840
There have been tens of thousands of reports

13:33.840 --> 13:36.080
of Tesla's being shitty from things as minor

13:36.080 --> 13:38.720
as poor quality builds to serious issues

13:38.720 --> 13:41.480
like sudden uncontrollable acceleration.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.800
Don't want that in a car.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.720
Faulty braking, that's not good either.

13:44.720 --> 13:47.240
Range issues that the company itself has suppressed.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.840
An operating system that can be hacked

13:49.840 --> 13:51.960
and controlled by outside entities.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.440
Batteries that spontaneously light on fire.

13:54.440 --> 13:55.960
The suspension suddenly collapsing

13:55.960 --> 13:58.720
leading to something called Wampi Wheels,

13:58.720 --> 14:00.440
which sounds like a carnival ride,

14:00.440 --> 14:02.800
to one tragic story of a Tesla reversing

14:02.800 --> 14:06.360
into a retaining pond with its driver trapped inside

14:06.360 --> 14:11.200
and first responders unable to break in as the woman drowned.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.920
That woman, by the way, was Mitch McConnell's sister-in-law

14:13.920 --> 14:15.680
and that just happened this year.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.680
Jesus Christ.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.560
Just, you don't want a car to do that.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.120
No, it sounds like they're put together

14:21.120 --> 14:22.480
like carnival rides.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.200
Now I've been saying that Elon isn't the one

14:24.200 --> 14:25.280
who's actually making the cars

14:25.280 --> 14:27.600
because he's not a real engineer and that's true.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.520
But Tesla, more than most companies,

14:29.520 --> 14:32.120
lives and dies by public perception of Elon.

14:32.120 --> 14:35.120
The company is trapped by the innovator cosplay

14:35.120 --> 14:37.160
Elon insists on dressing himself in.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.880
Which is why Elon's public image impacts

14:39.880 --> 14:41.800
the price of the company's stock so much.

14:41.800 --> 14:42.760
Exactly.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.240
The stock market is mostly fueled

14:44.240 --> 14:46.280
by wishes and hopes and dreams.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.640
And if people don't believe in Elon,

14:47.640 --> 14:49.280
they don't believe in Tesla.

14:49.280 --> 14:52.520
If Elon is a scam, then Tesla is a scam.

14:52.520 --> 14:53.880
And Elon is real scammy.

14:53.880 --> 14:54.720
Scammy.

14:54.720 --> 14:55.960
As all this stuff is happening,

14:55.960 --> 14:58.120
a series of embarrassing public disasters

14:58.120 --> 15:01.520
continue to make Teslas look more and more like clown cars.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.640
Back in December, 2023, Tesla issued a recall

15:04.640 --> 15:09.640
for an eye-watering 2,031,220 vehicles

15:10.280 --> 15:12.280
after a National Highway Traffic Safety

15:12.280 --> 15:14.200
Administration investigation found

15:14.200 --> 15:16.760
that the auto steer function wasn't safe.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.480
Cybertruck, long cheerleaded by Musk,

15:19.480 --> 15:21.400
is an ugly, clunky embarrassment

15:21.400 --> 15:23.680
that has publicly face planted.

15:24.720 --> 15:25.560
Yeah.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.000
Sure?

15:31.000 --> 15:31.840
Yeah.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.560
Oh my God, Elon.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.680
Well, maybe that was a little too hard.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.960
Should we try it one more?

15:43.960 --> 15:44.800
Try it?

15:44.800 --> 15:45.640
Yeah.

15:46.920 --> 15:47.800
What?

15:47.800 --> 15:48.640
Yeah.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.480
It didn't go through.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.480
So that's a plus side.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.800
Let's try the right one.

15:51.800 --> 15:52.640
Try that one, really?

15:52.640 --> 15:53.480
Okay.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.320
Sure.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.440
Oh, man.

15:56.440 --> 15:57.440
It didn't go through.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.280
Yeah.

15:59.360 --> 16:00.200
Yeah.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.040
All right.

16:01.920 --> 16:02.760
What?

16:03.920 --> 16:04.760
That'll be bad.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.840
Things only went downhill for the Cybertruck from there,

16:06.840 --> 16:08.480
and it's a good thing too, because if it's muddy,

16:08.480 --> 16:10.400
downhill is the only direction a Cybertruck

16:10.400 --> 16:11.560
can go without getting stuck.

16:11.560 --> 16:12.560
Fuck.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.600
The Cybertruck, like many Tesla offerings,

16:14.600 --> 16:17.440
has experienced delivery delays, systemic failures,

16:17.440 --> 16:21.240
safety issues, quality issues, and also can't haul shit.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.600
Its battery doesn't last as long

16:22.600 --> 16:25.280
as Tesla's sales material promised it would,

16:25.280 --> 16:26.480
especially in cold weather.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.160
Some observers have pointed out that it seems like Tesla

16:29.160 --> 16:32.560
is making consumers pay for and beta test a product

16:32.560 --> 16:34.440
that isn't actually ready for market.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.320
The Cybertruck is what you might call a gender-affirming car

16:37.320 --> 16:38.880
for men who want to prove to the world

16:38.880 --> 16:41.320
that they have $100,000 to throw away

16:41.320 --> 16:43.480
on the world's shittiest vehicle.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.560
Tesla recently announced that their halting production

16:46.560 --> 16:49.320
of the electric Ford Pinto of our times.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.880
Good night, sweet prince.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.400
And even at its newest and shiniest,

16:53.400 --> 16:55.080
it still looks like the Armadillos

16:55.080 --> 16:57.800
that Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck drove on the asteroid

16:57.800 --> 17:02.040
in Armageddon, a movie from 1998, just saying.

17:02.040 --> 17:05.520
Meanwhile, other automakers are getting into the EV game.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.000
And some of them are bringing cars

17:07.000 --> 17:09.120
to market that are more attractive, affordable,

17:09.120 --> 17:13.000
and have less PR nightmare CEOs than Tesla does.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.640
All of this has meant that Tesla's market share has diminished,

17:15.640 --> 17:18.400
and its share price is tanked, as its sales and production

17:18.400 --> 17:19.440
outlook has dimmed.

17:19.440 --> 17:20.880
Musk is betting that his company will

17:20.880 --> 17:23.520
be able to get out ahead of the autonomous taxi market,

17:23.520 --> 17:26.800
something that nobody outside of like 500 people in Palo Alto

17:26.800 --> 17:27.800
fucking want.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.600
Plus, a fully self-driving car technology

17:30.600 --> 17:32.160
doesn't exist, right?

17:32.160 --> 17:33.360
It doesn't.

17:33.360 --> 17:36.640
The technology used to be called fully self-driving or FSD,

17:36.640 --> 17:39.880
but they got in trouble with regulators

17:39.880 --> 17:42.200
because the technology does not actually work.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.320
Now the tech is being referred to as FSD with supervision.

17:45.320 --> 17:48.080
Still, Musk is all in on the tech,

17:48.080 --> 17:51.360
claiming that Tesla owners for the low, low price of $99

17:51.360 --> 17:54.080
per month will one day be able to install the software

17:54.080 --> 17:57.720
on their cars, which can then work as autonomous taxis when

17:57.720 --> 17:58.880
the owners aren't using them.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.400
Your car can be your robot slave.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.080
I am not kidding.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.640
That's part of his business plan, Alyssa.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.560
OK, so if you have FSD on your Tesla,

18:05.560 --> 18:09.400
you still have to pay a subscription to use it?

18:09.400 --> 18:10.400
Fuck that.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.160
No.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.200
The thing about fully autonomous vehicles

18:13.200 --> 18:15.560
is that they're another musky and fairy tale.

18:15.560 --> 18:19.000
Elon has been promising that the fully self-driving technology

18:19.000 --> 18:21.600
is right around the corner for so long,

18:21.600 --> 18:23.960
except if you try to get around that proverbial corner

18:23.960 --> 18:26.040
in a Tesla, the car never makes the turn,

18:26.040 --> 18:27.160
the steering malfunctions.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.800
Next thing you know it, you've run head

18:28.800 --> 18:30.520
on into the broad side of a pizzeria.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.600
So it also seems like a terribly stupid idea

18:32.600 --> 18:36.240
to reorganize city infrastructure around a massive fleet

18:36.240 --> 18:39.480
of robo taxis when the roads are already congested.

18:39.480 --> 18:42.840
And by the way, public transportation already exists.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.360
Couldn't we just use all that money

18:44.360 --> 18:47.360
that Elon wants to pocket and improve what we already have?

18:47.360 --> 18:48.800
One would think.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.400
Actually, Elon has headed out for public transportation

18:51.400 --> 18:52.600
for a long time.

18:52.600 --> 18:53.640
Do you remember the Hyperloop?

18:53.640 --> 18:56.680
A stupider, more expensive version of trains?

18:56.680 --> 18:58.880
The Hyperloop is such a moronic idea

18:58.880 --> 19:00.680
that it almost pains me to say it out loud.

19:00.680 --> 19:02.800
Back when Elon was king shit of fuck mountain,

19:02.800 --> 19:05.440
a.k.a. before he developed whatever condition it is

19:05.440 --> 19:07.960
that makes it impossible for him to not run his big, fat mouth

19:07.960 --> 19:11.160
all the time, Elon, quote, invented, unquote,

19:11.160 --> 19:14.600
a mass transit system that moves large numbers of passengers

19:14.600 --> 19:16.360
through low pressure tubes.

19:16.360 --> 19:19.280
You mean like the plastic chutes at the drive-through bank?

19:19.280 --> 19:20.520
Sort of.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.560
I like that vintage reference.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.840
Except bigger, more expensive with magnets

19:25.840 --> 19:28.200
and of course requiring massive amounts of money

19:28.200 --> 19:30.400
to be funneled to one of Elon Musk's companies.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.400
And once again, so many people fell for it.

19:33.400 --> 19:37.000
The boring company started as a subsidiary of SpaceX

19:37.000 --> 19:38.720
with the stated aim of digging holes

19:38.720 --> 19:40.720
for this stupid idea all over the place.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.920
MIT was investigating getting involved.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.080
There was talk of building one connecting LA and San Francisco

19:46.080 --> 19:48.360
basically under the five, if you know California,

19:48.360 --> 19:51.200
even though we could have just used that money to build

19:51.200 --> 19:54.240
a high-speed rail between LA and San Francisco,

19:54.240 --> 19:56.280
which is something that people in both cities

19:56.280 --> 19:58.440
have wanted for decades, I don't understand.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.560
Elon never really wanted to build

20:00.560 --> 20:03.400
ultra-fast, large-scale mass transportation.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.400
He simply wanted to derail discussions

20:05.400 --> 20:08.140
of actual high-speed rail that actually worked

20:08.140 --> 20:09.800
because he owns a car company

20:09.800 --> 20:11.360
that depends on people not having

20:11.360 --> 20:14.160
comfortable, affordable mass transit options available.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.760
So this whole plan was just to stop

20:16.760 --> 20:19.000
public transportation from getting better

20:19.000 --> 20:21.200
so he could sell more cars,

20:21.200 --> 20:23.320
like the bad guy from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.360
Exactly like that bad guy.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.520
Now, a little over a decade after Hyperloop Mania

20:27.520 --> 20:29.000
took Silicon Valley by storm,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.800
all we have to show for it is a puny little tunnel

20:31.800 --> 20:34.840
that connects part of the Las Vegas Convention Center

20:34.840 --> 20:36.560
and some plans in other cities

20:36.560 --> 20:39.480
that will likely soon quietly disappear from the internet.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.800
So you dread the annual physical

20:40.800 --> 20:43.360
with the guilt-tripping lectures like I do?

20:43.360 --> 20:44.880
More greens, choose organic,

20:44.880 --> 20:47.560
eat five cups of fruits and vegetables a day.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.000
I admit I could eat better, but I don't have time.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.880
That's why I started taking Field of Greens

20:51.880 --> 20:53.200
by Brickhouse Nutrition.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.440
Field of Greens is whole organic fruits and vegetables.

20:56.440 --> 20:57.840
Real food, not extracts.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.520
Each fruit and vegetable in Field of Greens

21:00.520 --> 21:03.280
was medically chosen for a specific health benefit.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.840
Some support vital organs like heart, liver, and kidneys,

21:05.840 --> 21:08.760
while others give your metabolism and immune system a boost.

21:08.760 --> 21:11.240
I'm so busy and I don't always eat like I should.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.960
The powerhouse blend in Field of Greens fills the gap

21:13.960 --> 21:16.200
so I stay energetic, focused, and healthy.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.760
And if you don't feel the incredible difference like I did,

21:18.760 --> 21:20.840
you can return it for a full refund.

21:20.840 --> 21:23.400
Let me get you started with 15% off and free shipping.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.360
Visit fieldofgreens.com and use promo code TFG.

21:26.360 --> 21:30.080
That's promo code TFG at fieldofgreens.com.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.240
Now that he's done his part to fill the highways

21:32.240 --> 21:34.800
and atmosphere with vehicles that sometimes explode

21:34.800 --> 21:36.720
and digs subterranean tunnels to nowhere,

21:36.720 --> 21:38.720
Musk has moved on to technology.

21:38.720 --> 21:41.680
Meant to be installed directly into the human body.

21:41.680 --> 21:45.160
If I wouldn't get into one of his driverless taxis,

21:45.160 --> 21:47.320
why on earth would I let one of his companies

21:47.320 --> 21:49.400
install a chip into my brain?

21:49.400 --> 21:51.400
The trillion dollar question.

21:51.400 --> 21:54.120
In 2016, along with a handful of actual scientists,

21:54.120 --> 21:57.640
Musk co-founded Neuralink after buying the trademark

21:57.640 --> 21:58.960
from the two neuroscientists

21:58.960 --> 22:01.680
who had actually founded Neuralink the year prior.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.840
The company's aim is to produce technology

22:03.840 --> 22:05.680
that can be implanted into the human brain.

22:05.680 --> 22:06.920
Neuralink has been under fire

22:06.920 --> 22:08.600
for killing an awful lot of the primates

22:08.600 --> 22:11.200
that's been testing on, but nevertheless,

22:11.200 --> 22:14.480
its chip was approved for human trials in 2023.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.200
Earlier this year, Musk claimed

22:16.200 --> 22:18.720
that a successful human trial had been conducted.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.220
I have yet to see a single piece of reported media

22:21.220 --> 22:24.960
that confirms this claim by somebody who isn't Musk himself

22:24.960 --> 22:26.680
or someone Musk is paying,

22:26.680 --> 22:29.600
but Elon girlbossed a little too hard when he bought Twitter.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.200
It really has been something to watch the whole world

22:32.200 --> 22:34.800
get wise to his bullshit at the same time.

22:34.800 --> 22:35.920
Enough ink has been spilled

22:35.920 --> 22:38.200
about Musk's disastrous takeover of Twitter

22:38.200 --> 22:40.640
once a flawed but functional town square,

22:40.640 --> 22:44.520
now the social media equivalent of an abandoned blockbuster

22:44.520 --> 22:47.520
video that has been taken over by flea-infested raccoons.

22:47.520 --> 22:49.360
So let's not get bogged down by the details.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.600
What's most important is that thanks to his pathological

22:51.600 --> 22:54.000
desire to force people to like him,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.200
Elon's ineptitude has been on full display,

22:56.200 --> 22:59.040
calling into question his genius and business acumen

22:59.040 --> 23:00.520
in the rest of his portfolio.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.720
The acquisition of Twitter was characterized

23:02.720 --> 23:04.840
by drama and erratic behavior by Musk.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.520
In 2022, he first tried a hostile takeover

23:07.520 --> 23:10.160
of the company before winning the board's approval.

23:10.160 --> 23:13.640
But then when he realized that $44 billion he'd offered

23:13.640 --> 23:15.520
to pay was way too much for a company

23:15.520 --> 23:18.640
that wasn't great at making money, he tried to back out.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.080
The board threatened to sue but Musk relented

23:21.080 --> 23:23.160
and the shotgun wedding between Elon and Twitter

23:23.160 --> 23:25.340
happened in October, 2022.

23:25.340 --> 23:27.800
Elon financed the deal with some creative leveraging

23:27.800 --> 23:29.600
that ended up resulting in him having to sell

23:29.600 --> 23:32.920
a bunch of Tesla stock, driving the share price down,

23:32.920 --> 23:34.760
and thus his overall wealth down.

23:34.760 --> 23:38.240
Elon, it turns out, is not good at running Twitter.

23:38.240 --> 23:41.160
He fired or chased away 80% of the staff,

23:41.160 --> 23:43.880
likely violating several labor laws and doing so.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.080
He reinstated several accounts that have been banned

23:46.080 --> 23:49.440
for hate speech, relaxed rules around anti-trans speech,

23:49.440 --> 23:51.400
and COVID-19 misinformation,

23:51.400 --> 23:53.520
gave a handful of doofus reporters access

23:53.520 --> 23:56.800
to internal Twitter files, plopped his cottage cheese ass

23:56.800 --> 23:59.960
into a dust chair, and tweeted as hard as he possibly could.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.160
And who can forget the blue check mark fiasco?

24:02.200 --> 24:04.800
Blue verification check marks were long viewed

24:04.800 --> 24:06.700
as a class signifier in old Twitter,

24:06.700 --> 24:09.120
which made a lot of people wearing wrap-around sunglasses

24:09.120 --> 24:10.800
and their user picture angry.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.720
So Elon got rid of the blue checks.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.800
The problem is that the checks also verified

24:14.800 --> 24:17.360
that people on the site were who they said they were

24:17.360 --> 24:20.720
and that so-called official accounts were not imposters.

24:20.720 --> 24:24.080
And so, in the first days of the program's elimination,

24:24.080 --> 24:26.060
somebody pretending to be the official account

24:26.060 --> 24:29.800
of drugmaker Eli Lilly declared that insulin was now free

24:29.800 --> 24:31.840
among other imposter shenanigans.

24:31.840 --> 24:32.880
That was actually quite funny.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.800
That was really, it was one of the best days

24:34.800 --> 24:35.640
in Twitter history.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.480
It was great.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.480
Bleeding money, Elon tried to get Twitter users

24:38.480 --> 24:40.240
to pay $8 for the check marks.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.640
And people were like, fuck that you clown.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.240
So the only people who had blue checks

24:44.240 --> 24:48.240
were suspiciously Elon fanboys and conservative super tweeters

24:48.240 --> 24:49.920
who would hassle anybody who complained

24:49.920 --> 24:51.920
about the new verification system

24:51.920 --> 24:54.200
by accusing them of being too poor or stingy

24:54.200 --> 24:57.920
to fork over $8 to one of the world's richest men.

24:57.920 --> 25:01.760
I am shocked, shocked that trying to use bullying

25:01.760 --> 25:03.200
as a chief sales technique

25:03.200 --> 25:05.920
for Twitter's verification program was ineffective.

25:05.920 --> 25:06.880
In April of this year,

25:06.880 --> 25:08.800
Twitter quietly restored blue check marks

25:08.800 --> 25:10.600
to several journalists and public figures

25:10.600 --> 25:12.480
without charging them $8.

25:12.480 --> 25:15.080
When several prominent Twitter users started swapping tips

25:15.080 --> 25:17.040
on how to hide the dreaded blue check of shame

25:17.040 --> 25:18.200
next to their names,

25:18.200 --> 25:20.740
Twitter removed their ability to hide the check.

25:20.740 --> 25:22.100
Researchers found that under Musk,

25:22.100 --> 25:24.480
hate speech increased dramatically on the platform,

25:24.480 --> 25:25.920
anti-Semitic speech increased,

25:25.920 --> 25:28.760
as did propaganda originating from the Islamic State.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.160
Great job, Elon.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.400
Some of the hate speech, by the way,

25:31.400 --> 25:33.360
was amplified by Musk himself,

25:33.360 --> 25:35.360
like the time he publicly agreed with a tweet

25:35.360 --> 25:38.320
alleging that Jewish people hate white people.

25:38.320 --> 25:41.320
Musk responded by revoking access to Twitter's API,

25:41.320 --> 25:43.240
so now nobody has any idea

25:43.240 --> 25:46.360
just how bad things have gotten quantitatively.

25:46.360 --> 25:48.760
However, Alyssa, there is a workaround.

25:48.760 --> 25:51.040
You can still tell how bad Twitter has gotten

25:51.040 --> 25:52.920
by simply looking at it.

25:52.920 --> 25:53.940
Yes.

25:53.940 --> 25:56.680
And it turns out platforming unbridled free speech

25:56.680 --> 25:58.160
with virtually no moderation

25:58.160 --> 26:00.520
has meant that since Elon fired or chased out

26:00.520 --> 26:02.160
most of Twitter's legacy employees,

26:02.160 --> 26:04.320
the site has also become a haven

26:04.320 --> 26:07.680
for misinformation and child pornography.

26:07.680 --> 26:08.520
In early April,

26:08.520 --> 26:10.140
the Brazilian Supreme Court announced

26:10.140 --> 26:11.320
that they were investigating him

26:11.320 --> 26:15.680
for, quote, flagrant obstruction of Brazilian justice, unquote.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.240
The chickens have to come home to roost eventually, right?

26:18.240 --> 26:21.600
Yeah, and I would watch a show called Brazilian justice.

26:21.600 --> 26:22.960
It sounds like a lot of fun.

26:22.960 --> 26:25.040
Twitter put on display how desperate Elon was

26:25.040 --> 26:26.360
to have people like him,

26:26.360 --> 26:28.640
despite his fundamental unlikeability.

26:28.640 --> 26:29.960
In February, 2023,

26:29.960 --> 26:31.800
Elon got upset that not enough people

26:31.800 --> 26:33.320
were engaging with his tweets

26:33.320 --> 26:35.040
and had some of his internal engineers

26:35.040 --> 26:36.280
investigate what was wrong.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.400
This story makes me so embarrassed.

26:38.400 --> 26:39.400
So sad for him.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.980
One of his engineers suggested

26:40.980 --> 26:44.560
that perhaps public interest in Musk himself was waning,

26:44.560 --> 26:46.600
and so Musk fired him.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.440
A few days later,

26:47.440 --> 26:50.040
when President Joe Biden's tweets about the Super Bowl

26:50.040 --> 26:52.240
got more engagement than Elon's,

26:52.240 --> 26:55.320
Elon demanded the engineers fix it or be fired.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.760
So they changed the Twitter algorithm

26:57.760 --> 27:01.720
so that regular users would be spammed with Elon's tweets,

27:01.720 --> 27:05.400
magnifying the automatic reach of Elon's tweets 1,000 times.

27:05.400 --> 27:08.440
That is the saddest shit I have ever heard.

27:08.440 --> 27:09.880
In 2023 via Twitter,

27:09.880 --> 27:12.600
he accused a young Jewish man named Ben Brody

27:12.600 --> 27:14.760
of participating in a neo-Nazi brawl

27:14.760 --> 27:18.000
as an Antifa member of a false flag operation.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.760
Brody wasn't even in the state where the brawl occurred.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.960
His family claims that Musk's amplification

27:24.000 --> 27:27.360
of the fringe conspiracy theory, based on nothing,

27:27.360 --> 27:29.680
had led to massive amounts of harassment and threats

27:29.680 --> 27:31.800
and sued Musk for a million dollars.

27:31.800 --> 27:36.080
Musk was deposed in March and it went poorly.

27:36.080 --> 27:38.120
In the deposition which Musk's lawyers

27:38.120 --> 27:39.920
unsuccessfully fought to seal,

27:39.920 --> 27:43.240
Musk at one point does not seem to understand

27:43.240 --> 27:44.760
what a lawyer does.

27:44.760 --> 27:47.360
Daren, what about the people who stayed on Twitter

27:47.360 --> 27:50.320
even after Elon turned it into a haunted shopping mall?

27:50.320 --> 27:52.000
Well, Elon has tried to turn Twitter

27:52.000 --> 27:54.320
into a landing pad for media personalities

27:54.320 --> 27:57.560
who had been canceled or, in normal English,

27:57.560 --> 28:00.200
faced consequences as a result of fucking up.

28:00.200 --> 28:03.080
He snatched up Tucker Carlson after Tucker's ouster

28:03.080 --> 28:05.760
from Fox News with promises that Tucker could create

28:05.760 --> 28:07.440
Twitter exclusive content.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.120
But the site didn't have the technology

28:09.120 --> 28:12.080
to support the sort of thing Tucker wanted to make.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.240
Sounds familiar.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.280
And former CNN anchor Don Lemon

28:15.280 --> 28:18.320
was also invited to Elon's Tiki Torch rally

28:18.320 --> 28:19.880
only to have his contract canceled

28:19.880 --> 28:22.560
days before Lemon's show was supposed to debut

28:22.560 --> 28:24.280
after an interview Lemon conducted

28:24.280 --> 28:26.320
with Musk went off the rails.

28:26.320 --> 28:29.040
Musk keeps claiming he loves free speech,

28:29.040 --> 28:31.600
but he doesn't like it when people talk shit about him.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.080
Under Musk's flop sweat soaked innovation,

28:34.080 --> 28:37.920
the value of Twitter at NowX.com, the old chestnut,

28:37.920 --> 28:40.640
has fallen an estimated 65%.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.680
Elon's Twitter foibles have exposed him

28:42.680 --> 28:45.520
as an emotionally unstable, deeply weird, clueless phony

28:45.520 --> 28:46.960
who believes that acting like an asshole

28:46.960 --> 28:48.880
is the same thing as coming up with an idea.

28:48.880 --> 28:51.560
He's a business bridezilla with an unlimited budget

28:51.560 --> 28:54.120
and his employees are just the hapless wedding coordinators

28:54.120 --> 28:56.160
trying to figure out how to bend reality

28:56.160 --> 28:58.040
to bring his ridiculous plans to fruition.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.520
And when he's confronted on his bullshit,

28:59.520 --> 29:00.560
he throws a fit.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.760
Who can forget this infamous public appearance?

29:03.760 --> 29:05.960
If somebody's gonna try to blackmail me with advertising,

29:05.960 --> 29:08.880
blackmail me with money, go f*** yourself.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.920
Go f*** yourself.

29:12.120 --> 29:12.960
Is that clear?

29:12.960 --> 29:13.800
It's funny.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.680
He didn't used to seem as unhinged as he does now.

29:16.680 --> 29:19.000
I know, I kind of wonder what it is,

29:19.000 --> 29:20.880
but there is a working theory out there.

29:20.880 --> 29:21.720
Failing?

29:21.720 --> 29:24.320
That theory is, it's the drugs.

29:24.320 --> 29:26.840
According to a Wall Street Journal report from January,

29:26.840 --> 29:29.520
Elon has been known to dabble in such substances

29:29.520 --> 29:33.480
as cocaine, mushrooms, LSD, ecstasy, and ketamine.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.000
But last I checked, most people who go into a K-hole

29:36.000 --> 29:38.800
don't come out the other side of megalomaniac baby.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.600
And to prove he's cool and tough,

29:40.600 --> 29:43.520
he smoked weed on the Joe Rogan podcast.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.480
Speaking of babies, doesn't he have like a million kids?

29:46.520 --> 29:51.000
Yes, Elon Musk has 11 children by three different women.

29:51.000 --> 29:51.840
Woo!

29:51.840 --> 29:54.400
He had six children with his first wife, Justine Wilson,

29:54.400 --> 29:56.840
including one set of twins and one set of triplets,

29:56.840 --> 29:58.680
which were conceived via IVF.

29:58.680 --> 30:01.000
He has three children with the singer Grimes,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.640
who you may most recently remember for turning in

30:03.640 --> 30:06.320
one of the worst performances in Coachella history.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.160
Elon also has twins with an executive

30:08.160 --> 30:10.800
from his monkey-murdering enterprise Neuralink,

30:10.800 --> 30:12.400
a fact that came to light through a piece

30:12.400 --> 30:14.480
in Time Magazine by Walter Isaacson.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.240
News of the twins with the Canadian Neuralink

30:16.240 --> 30:18.440
executive broke just days before news

30:18.440 --> 30:21.360
that he'd had his third baby with Grimes broke.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.560
Boy, that was awkward.

30:23.480 --> 30:26.480
I've got questions about what's been going on,

30:26.480 --> 30:29.560
and I don't know for sure that I want the answers.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.400
In response, Elon made a weird joke

30:31.400 --> 30:33.760
about doing his part to repopulate the world,

30:33.760 --> 30:36.600
but he's long been weirdly obsessed with the birthrate

30:36.600 --> 30:38.520
because he said that he's worried

30:38.520 --> 30:41.600
there won't be enough people to move to his Mars colony.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.920
Musk has reportedly given $10 million

30:43.920 --> 30:46.680
to a population research project in Texas

30:46.680 --> 30:49.520
that aims to look into ways to increase the birthrate.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.400
So Elon wants there to be more people

30:51.400 --> 30:53.040
so that he can send them to Mars.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.080
Fine, fine, go.

30:55.080 --> 30:56.400
Problem that Musk's advice

30:56.400 --> 30:59.160
that everybody should father as many children as possible

30:59.160 --> 31:02.080
is that like his father who came before him,

31:02.080 --> 31:04.040
Musk kind of sucks at being a dad.

31:04.040 --> 31:06.440
He is currently being sued over parental rights

31:06.440 --> 31:09.560
by his ex, Grimes, and one of his two oldest children

31:09.560 --> 31:12.120
who came out as trans at age 16

31:12.120 --> 31:15.600
openly hates her dad's guts for very understandable reasons.

31:15.600 --> 31:18.120
He once claimed that the word cisgender was a slur

31:18.120 --> 31:20.280
and urged all of his followers on Twitter

31:20.280 --> 31:22.080
to watch the Daily Wire documentary,

31:22.080 --> 31:25.320
What is a Woman, hosted by human skidmark Matt Walsh.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.400
But maybe the shittiest thing Elon did

31:27.400 --> 31:30.640
in the fatherhood arena was change some key details

31:30.640 --> 31:33.960
about a tragedy to make himself sound like a hero.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.480
Elon's oldest son named Nevada died tragically

31:36.480 --> 31:38.240
from sudden infant death syndrome

31:38.240 --> 31:40.040
when he was only 10 weeks old.

31:40.040 --> 31:43.520
Many years later in 2022 via tweet, of course,

31:43.520 --> 31:45.480
Elon later claimed that the baby had, quote,

31:45.480 --> 31:47.560
died in his arms and that he, quote,

31:47.560 --> 31:49.280
felt his last heartbeat.

31:49.280 --> 31:51.680
Nevada's mother, his ex-wife, Justine disagreed,

31:51.680 --> 31:54.480
tweeting, not that it matters to anyone except me

31:54.480 --> 31:56.080
because it is one of the most sacred

31:56.080 --> 31:57.680
and defining moments of my life,

31:57.680 --> 31:59.560
but I was the one who was holding him.

31:59.560 --> 32:02.440
That he would claim that is just tragically deranged.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.960
It is absolutely deranged.

32:03.960 --> 32:05.360
It's like some of the sickest shit ever.

32:05.360 --> 32:07.840
And while a year prior, Justine had written

32:07.880 --> 32:09.800
a glamour magazine piece called

32:09.800 --> 32:12.320
I was a starter wife inside America's messiest divorce

32:12.320 --> 32:14.840
that like many firsthand accounts of Elon Musk

32:14.840 --> 32:17.120
make him sound like a total fucking dick.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.360
In that article, she wrote,

32:18.360 --> 32:21.360
Elon had called her open grief over Nevada's death,

32:21.360 --> 32:23.040
emotionally manipulative.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.280
Emotionally manipulative.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.520
Your child's eyes, her baby died.

32:26.520 --> 32:27.800
No wonder that marriage,

32:27.800 --> 32:29.920
like the hyperloop, fully self-driving technology,

32:29.920 --> 32:32.920
the cyber truck and his version of Twitter failed.

32:32.920 --> 32:36.120
Whew, well, that's as good a note to end on as any.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.160
What's extra crazy to me is that we can laugh

32:38.160 --> 32:40.840
at his awkward dancing and make fun of how unfunny he is.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.720
Thanks to the fact that government gives his company

32:42.720 --> 32:46.360
so much money and Tesla stock is such a huge part of the S&P,

32:46.360 --> 32:49.080
we all kinda own a stake in his clownery.

32:49.080 --> 32:51.840
Nobody should have as much money as Elon Musk has

32:51.840 --> 32:54.200
and nobody should have their fingers knuckle deep

32:54.200 --> 32:56.800
in that many industries so important to things

32:56.800 --> 33:00.320
like communication, transportation and national security.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.720
Alyssa, I haven't even gotten to the cherry on top.

33:02.720 --> 33:05.720
In April, the same week that Tesla announced record layoffs,

33:05.720 --> 33:08.720
Elon once again asked the company board to approve

33:08.720 --> 33:12.160
a $56 billion pay package for himself

33:12.160 --> 33:14.200
that had been rejected by a judge in Delaware

33:14.200 --> 33:16.640
over the fact that its exorbitant size

33:16.640 --> 33:19.840
represented negligence of his fiduciary duties as CEO.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.200
Sounds reasonable.

33:21.200 --> 33:26.200
Can you imagine, can you imagine asking for $56 billion

33:26.920 --> 33:30.000
after sending so many people out into the street?

33:30.000 --> 33:31.960
Evil as shit, absolutely not.

33:31.960 --> 33:33.200
Evil shit.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.280
The only way that Elon Musk is a true innovator

33:35.280 --> 33:38.400
is in his astonishing ability to oversell and under deliver.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.480
His career is a series of fanciful, unkeepable promises

33:41.480 --> 33:43.560
which a gullible media takes at his word,

33:43.560 --> 33:47.600
but maybe, just maybe, the jigs finally up.

33:47.600 --> 33:51.280
Wow, Elon, I feel like we barely scratched the surface.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.920
So on a scale of one to five weasels.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.840
Ooh, where's Elon?

33:54.840 --> 33:57.640
Oh, he's gotta be a hard five weasel for so many reasons.

33:57.640 --> 34:00.080
One, he's getting rich off our tax money.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.000
He's getting rich off our tax money,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.760
not doing shit with it, being mean to his kids

34:04.760 --> 34:08.080
and not even getting to the moon.

34:08.080 --> 34:08.900
Yeah.

34:08.900 --> 34:10.080
Give me my money back.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.440
Any ruined Twitter.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.920
Yes, I'm gonna agree with you.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.560
Okay, five, oh, we're in sync this week.

34:14.560 --> 34:17.280
I say a hard five weasels for Elon Musk

34:17.280 --> 34:20.320
just because he has so much power and he amassed it

34:20.320 --> 34:22.240
in a way that I feel like everyone is like,

34:22.240 --> 34:25.760
oh, whoa, this guy's in charge of a lot of stuff.

34:25.760 --> 34:29.240
I don't know if there's a world in which he is no longer

34:29.240 --> 34:32.120
just like the crazy person driving the economy.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.840
And that is deeply, deeply upsetting.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.440
Aaron, that was a fun one.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.840
