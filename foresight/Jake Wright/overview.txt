1. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages.
2. CSS rules are applied to HTML elements and define how they should be presented visually.
3. A CSS rule starts with a selector that targets an element (like `body`, `h1`, `a`, etc.), a declaration block, and individual declarations within curly braces.
4. Each declaration consists of a CSS property (like `font-weight`, `text-decoration`, `margin`, etc.), a colon, and the value you want to set for that property, followed by a semicolon.
5. Classes are targeted with a dot (`.selected`), IDs with a hash (`#header`), and tags (`a`, `body`, etc.) directly.
6. You can combine selectors to target more specific elements (e.g., `#header .sidebar`).
7. CSS best practices include using separate CSS files instead of inline styles for maintainability.
8. CSS properties set in this tutorial include font-weight (bold), text-decoration (none), list-style-type (none), padding, margin, and background color, among others.
9. CSS can be embedded within HTML elements using `style` attributes, placed inside `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section, or linked as an external stylesheet using the `<link>` element.
10. CSS is essential for creating visually appealing and responsive web designs.
