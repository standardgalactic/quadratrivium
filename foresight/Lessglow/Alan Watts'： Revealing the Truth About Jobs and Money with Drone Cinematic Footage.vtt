00:00.000 --> 00:09.520
I wonder often if there's any relationship between guilt and gold, that the love of money

00:09.520 --> 00:11.200
is the root of evil.

00:11.200 --> 00:15.120
It's very true saying.

00:15.120 --> 00:20.980
Because you see, I was saying yesterday that the difference between having a job and having

00:20.980 --> 00:29.600
a vocation is that a job is some unpleasant work you do in order to make money.

00:29.600 --> 00:33.960
With the sole purpose of making money.

00:33.960 --> 00:38.440
And there are plenty of jobs because there is still a certain amount of dirty work that

00:38.440 --> 00:44.320
nobody wants to do and that therefore they will pay someone to do it.

00:44.320 --> 00:49.880
There is essentially less and less of that kind of work because of mechanization.

00:49.880 --> 00:59.560
But if you do a job with the sole purpose of making money, you are absurd.

00:59.560 --> 01:08.800
Because if money becomes the goal and it does when you work that way, you begin increasingly

01:08.800 --> 01:13.680
to confuse it with happiness or with pleasure.

01:13.680 --> 01:19.480
Yes, one can take a whole handful of crisp dollar bills and practically water your mouth

01:19.480 --> 01:20.480
over them.

01:20.480 --> 01:25.960
But this is kind of a person who is confused like a Pavlov dog who salivates on the wrong

01:25.960 --> 01:37.360
bell.

01:37.360 --> 01:48.760
It goes back, you see, to the ancient guilt that if you don't work, you have no right

01:48.760 --> 01:53.480
to eat.

01:53.480 --> 01:58.480
But if there are others in the world who don't have enough to eat, you shouldn't enjoy your

01:58.480 --> 02:06.720
dinner even though you have no possible means that conveying the food to them.

02:06.720 --> 02:15.200
And while it is true that we are all one human family and that every individual involves

02:15.200 --> 02:22.720
every other individual, while it is true, therefore, we should do something about.

02:23.720 --> 02:26.720
Changing the situation.

02:26.720 --> 02:33.000
The one way of not doing anything about a situation is feeling guilty about it.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.280
Because when people feel guilty about a situation, they most usually, instead of doing something

02:38.280 --> 02:45.160
practical to change it, they resort to all sorts of symbolic methods of expiation.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.680
They go to confession.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.920
They see an analyst.

02:49.920 --> 02:55.440
They do all kinds of things which will be ways of actually not doing anything about

02:55.440 --> 03:01.160
the problem, but feeling all right about it instead.

03:01.160 --> 03:05.920
And guilt invariably produces that sort of reaction.

03:05.920 --> 03:09.560
It is a destructive emotion.

03:09.560 --> 03:20.920
And instead, we need to have a different attitude to our mistakes and to our misdeeds.

03:20.920 --> 03:25.080
Walt Whitman always admired animals because they do not lie awake at night and weep for

03:25.080 --> 03:29.000
their sins.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.880
Animals are practical in the real sense as our children who haven't been taught this

03:35.880 --> 03:42.440
extraordinary hang-up of guilt.

03:42.440 --> 03:48.440
Because if you have done something wrong and you have made a mistake and somebody makes

03:48.440 --> 03:59.320
you ashamed of it and guilty, you run around licking the sores of your wounded ego because

03:59.320 --> 04:02.880
you feel your pride has been hurt.

04:02.880 --> 04:11.080
The first thing to understand is that it is not a serious failing in a human being to

04:11.080 --> 04:15.320
make mistakes.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.720
Everybody has to make mistakes.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.080
There is no way out of it.

04:18.080 --> 04:21.040
You can't learn anything unless you make mistakes.

04:21.040 --> 04:28.320
We find, for example, in Japan, the Japanese have a terrible hang-up about making mistakes.

04:28.320 --> 04:34.320
They therefore never have the courage to practice their English properly.

04:34.320 --> 04:40.640
They have had seven years of English in school, most of it very, very badly taught.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.400
And it is irrelevant English.

04:42.400 --> 04:52.400
They learn all about Shakespeare and Dickens and Thackeray and Thomas Hardy and so on.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.960
And therefore they can't carry on an everyday conversation.

04:54.960 --> 05:01.240
It's like the way the English study French, all about pens of gardeners' aunts and things

05:01.240 --> 05:05.320
like that.

05:05.320 --> 05:10.560
But they are ashamed to try out their English unless drunk.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.760
So if you want to get into conversation with the Japanese in English, you have to go to

05:14.760 --> 05:24.560
bars and then they say university students and so on there will loosen up and talk.

05:24.560 --> 05:30.000
Because they no longer have the inhibition, the shame of saying the wrong thing.

05:30.000 --> 05:37.920
So likewise I know a very great anthropologist who was taught music, playing the piano in

05:37.920 --> 05:40.160
the same way I was.

05:40.160 --> 05:48.640
When I was taught music, the school mom who taught me used to put an India rubber, an

05:48.640 --> 05:53.480
eraser it's called in this country, on the top of each hand so that I would have my hands

05:53.480 --> 05:55.800
in good posture.

05:55.800 --> 06:01.240
And every time I'd play a wrong note she'd hit my fingers with a pencil.

06:01.240 --> 06:06.240
And this great anthropologist had had a similar sort of musical education.

06:06.240 --> 06:10.160
And when confronted with a piano in the presence of an absolutely marvelous teacher in San

06:10.160 --> 06:12.680
Francisco, she said she was amazed.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.880
He was completely incapable of reading notes.

06:15.880 --> 06:19.600
He blocked at everything.

06:19.600 --> 06:29.000
So another great teacher of the piano I knew said simply, you must not be afraid of playing

06:29.000 --> 06:32.760
wrong notes.

06:32.760 --> 06:40.800
Just forget it, play it wrong and then eventually go over it again and you'll eventually get

06:40.800 --> 06:41.800
it right.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.840
But you must not block.

06:43.840 --> 06:50.960
Just keep the same rhythm going even if you have to slow it down, but keep the proportionate

06:50.960 --> 06:53.320
rhythm of one note to another.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.960
And if it's the wrong note, play the wrong note as long as you play something in the

06:56.960 --> 07:00.600
right rhythm.

07:00.600 --> 07:08.240
So you know this is a way of taking away people's blockage, people's guilt and shame about making

07:08.240 --> 07:11.600
mistakes.

07:11.600 --> 07:19.280
So you absolutely, freedom means basically the freedom to make mistakes.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.680
The freedom to be a damn fool.

07:22.680 --> 07:28.160
And then not to recriminate with yourself when you do finally realize that it was a mistake.

07:28.160 --> 07:32.720
But simply don't do it again.

07:32.720 --> 07:37.320
Or at least do it less often.

07:37.320 --> 07:41.480
So you know, this is the puzzle.

07:41.480 --> 07:46.760
When you go to confession in the Catholic Church, which is an enormous method of inculcating

07:46.760 --> 07:50.760
a sense of guilt, very subtle.

07:50.760 --> 07:56.120
One says of course that Catholics are on the whole less guilty than Protestants.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.120
More relaxed.

07:57.120 --> 08:02.680
And there's some truth in that, but only some.

08:02.680 --> 08:05.920
Protestants of course have chronic guilt.

08:05.920 --> 08:12.240
And you can work this out by a very simple little formula, that when the Protestants

08:12.240 --> 08:20.880
in England abandoned what is called a curricular confession to a priest, they inserted in their

08:20.880 --> 08:28.320
prayer book a general confession in which the congregation all made its confession together.

08:28.320 --> 08:32.960
Now what does a Catholic say when he makes his confession?

08:32.960 --> 08:37.600
The formula is, I confess to God Almighty, the Blessed Mary of a Virgin, blessed John

08:37.600 --> 08:41.680
the Baptist, the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul and all the saints, that I have sinned exceedingly

08:41.680 --> 08:46.560
in thought word and deed by my fault, by my own fault, by my own most grievous fault.

08:46.560 --> 08:55.160
Wherefore I beg, blessed Mary, etc., and you, Father, to pray for me to the Lord our God.

08:55.160 --> 08:59.280
And the priest says, Almighty God, have mercy upon you, forgive you your sins, and bring

08:59.280 --> 09:02.920
you to everlasting life by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ committed unto me

09:03.280 --> 09:06.440
I absolve thee from all thy sins in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the

09:06.440 --> 09:09.440
Holy Spirit.

09:09.440 --> 09:18.480
Now instead of that, what they had to introduce into the Anglican formula was instead of this

09:18.480 --> 09:29.560
very simple confession of sins before the whole company of heaven, an absolute grovel

09:29.680 --> 09:36.840
wherein they say that they have sinned so horribly, and that the remembrance of these

09:36.840 --> 09:41.680
sins is grievous unto us, the burden of them is intolerable, have mercy upon us, have mercy

09:41.680 --> 09:49.280
upon us, most merciful Father, and all this cringing and crying, breast beating and wallowing

09:49.280 --> 09:50.280
in guilt.

09:50.280 --> 09:57.920
And then the priest, instead of saying a simple formula of absolution, quotes all kinds of

09:57.920 --> 10:03.880
scriptural texts to prove from the Bible that those who do truly and earnestly repent

10:03.880 --> 10:08.120
will be forgiven by God, because they're very uncertain about it, therefore they have to

10:08.120 --> 10:13.400
quote all the authorities.

10:13.400 --> 10:22.320
And this absolutely groveling form of confession replaces the old one because they were a little

10:22.320 --> 10:27.760
bit scared about abandoning direct confession of sins to the priest.

10:27.760 --> 10:38.800
And now going back to the Catholic problem about guilt, you say when you have confessed

10:38.800 --> 10:48.880
after saying this formula to all the saints, you confess the specific sins you've committed,

10:48.880 --> 10:54.200
and you know, I stole something, committed adultery three times, and so on, whatever

10:54.200 --> 10:55.700
it was.

10:55.700 --> 11:07.620
And then you say at the end, for these are all my sins which I cannot now remember.

11:07.620 --> 11:19.260
I firmly purpose amendment, and humbly ask pardon of God and of you Father, absolution.

11:19.260 --> 11:26.980
Now I firmly purpose amendment, that is where the fly in the ointment consists because the

11:26.980 --> 11:34.020
doctrine is that you have made a true confession if at the same time you have a seer intention

11:34.020 --> 11:37.980
of acting differently in the future.

11:37.980 --> 11:46.220
Now no sensitive Catholic can say that without having grave doubts as to whether actually

11:46.220 --> 11:49.340
he isn't going to do some of these things again.

11:49.340 --> 11:54.300
So if you're a workaday Catholic, like a Mexican peasant or something like that, you

11:54.300 --> 11:57.140
know that the confession is just a safety valve.

11:57.140 --> 12:04.700
You're going to go on living just as lackadaisically as ever, but you go to church every so often

12:04.700 --> 12:12.180
and you get rid of the guilt and the evil, it's like going to the bathroom.

12:12.180 --> 12:16.660
But when you get thoughtful about these things and you wonder whether you do really mean

12:16.660 --> 12:22.380
what you say, whether your motive is pure and your intention is right, you get into

12:22.380 --> 12:26.300
a rightful hang-up.

12:26.300 --> 12:37.620
And one of the reasons that our technology is impeded and prevented from feeding the

12:37.620 --> 12:44.380
world properly is the failure of one of our networks.

12:44.380 --> 12:49.620
It's an information network and it's called money.

12:49.620 --> 12:56.540
About which we have the most unbelievable superstitions and psychological blocks which

12:56.540 --> 13:03.140
have been gone into at some length by Freud who equates our valuation of money with our

13:03.140 --> 13:12.340
attitude to excrement and a very complicated lot of complexes grow up around that.

13:12.340 --> 13:22.540
But money and our psychological attitude to money is a major obstacle to a proper development

13:22.540 --> 13:30.860
of technology enabling it to do what it is supposed to do, that is to save labor and

13:30.860 --> 13:37.700
to produce goods, services and so on adequately.

13:37.700 --> 13:44.660
So I must introduce this with a story which is entirely legendary, indeed quite apocryphal.

13:44.660 --> 13:50.620
The great banks of the world at one time got absolutely sick of the expense and security

13:50.620 --> 13:56.900
measures involved in shipping consignments of gold from one bank to another.

13:56.900 --> 14:04.060
And so they decided that all the chief banks of the world would open offices on a certain

14:04.060 --> 14:10.140
island in the South Pacific which was balmy and comfortable and there they would store

14:10.140 --> 14:12.780
all the gold in the world.

14:12.780 --> 14:19.100
And they put it in great subterranean vaults reached by deep elevator shafts and then all

14:19.100 --> 14:23.780
they had to do when one bank or one country owed gold to another was to trundle it across

14:23.780 --> 14:26.460
the street.

14:26.460 --> 14:32.900
And this was very efficient and it went on beautifully for five or six years.

14:32.900 --> 14:36.780
Then the presidents of the world banks got together and said let's have a convention

14:36.780 --> 14:41.020
out on this island and take our wives and families.

14:41.020 --> 14:46.620
So about seven years from the date of opening all those presidents and their wives and families

14:46.620 --> 14:52.500
went out to this specific island and they inspected the books and everything was beautifully

14:52.500 --> 14:53.500
in order.

14:54.380 --> 14:58.900
Then the children said, our daddy can't we see the gold.

14:58.900 --> 15:01.020
They said of course you may see the gold.

15:01.020 --> 15:04.300
And they said to the managers, let's take our children down to the vaults and show

15:04.300 --> 15:06.540
them the gold.

15:06.540 --> 15:14.300
And the managers said well it's a little bit inconvenient at this time and perhaps the

15:14.300 --> 15:22.500
children would not really be very interested after all it's just only old plain gold.

15:22.500 --> 15:27.220
And the president said oh no no come now they'd be thrilled let's go down and see.

15:27.220 --> 15:34.940
And there was further humming and hawing and delays and finally it came out that a few

15:34.940 --> 15:41.060
years before there had been a catastrophic subterranean birth quake and all the vaults

15:41.060 --> 15:44.380
had been swallowed up and all the gold had disappeared.

15:44.380 --> 15:48.500
But so far as the bookkeeping was concerned everything was in perfect order.

15:52.820 --> 16:02.860
What this means then is that money is nothing but bookkeeping.

16:02.860 --> 16:04.540
It is figures.

16:04.540 --> 16:17.100
It is a way of measuring what you owe the community and what the community owes you.

16:17.100 --> 16:21.580
It is of course as you all know a substitute for barter.

16:21.580 --> 16:27.660
If you worked on a farm and the farmer paid you in terms of ears of corn, onions, cabbages

16:27.660 --> 16:32.740
and other vegetables and yet you wanted a pot and pan of some kind and you took a few

16:32.740 --> 16:39.900
vegetables over to the man who so made pots and pans and you swapped.

16:39.900 --> 16:46.780
Some people used cowry shells to stand for money so that you wouldn't have to barter

16:46.780 --> 16:56.180
and carry around all these inconvenient loads of goods and then of course gold was used

16:56.180 --> 17:05.620
because gold was rare and because gold was supposed to have a constant value.

17:05.620 --> 17:14.780
You might ponder the question when a banker buys gold with what does he pay for it?

17:14.780 --> 17:18.700
The answer is a mystery called credit.

17:18.700 --> 17:30.900
Credit is bookkeeping and as the economy of the western world developed it was found

17:30.900 --> 17:37.540
that there was not enough gold around if it were to remain constant in value to exchange

17:37.540 --> 17:39.820
goods and services.

17:39.820 --> 17:44.580
You could of course have changed the picture by putting down the price of goods and services

17:44.580 --> 17:51.140
to keep pace with the amount of gold and circulation but nobody will ever put down

17:51.140 --> 17:52.140
the price.

17:52.140 --> 17:59.380
There is something in our psychology whereby prices always tend to go up but at the same

17:59.380 --> 18:05.780
time therefore because the amount of gold in the world did not provide an adequate channel

18:05.780 --> 18:11.540
for the circulation of goods and services all great industrial nations went heavily

18:11.540 --> 18:13.600
into debt.

18:13.600 --> 18:17.900
They created a thing called the national debt which year by year gets bigger and bigger

18:17.900 --> 18:22.020
and bigger to the horror and consternation of old fashioned republicans who pay their

18:22.020 --> 18:24.740
bills.

18:24.740 --> 18:28.340
But the reason for the increase of the national debt is extremely obvious.

18:28.340 --> 18:36.580
It is that with an expanding gross national product there needs to be more and more money

18:36.580 --> 18:42.300
that is to say tokens of exchange in order to circulate the amount of goods produced

18:42.300 --> 18:48.260
which is ever increasing.

18:48.260 --> 18:55.780
Now I am not an economist and I can refer you to the work of those who really are but

18:55.780 --> 19:01.940
any fool can see certain extremely fundamental principles about this whole situation.

19:01.940 --> 19:07.140
Now I am speaking of the thought today of a man called Robert Theobald who sort of ties

19:07.140 --> 19:13.540
in with the general picture of people like McLuhan and Buckminster Fuller in having very

19:13.540 --> 19:20.780
far out thoughts and very adventurous thoughts about what we should do about money.

19:20.780 --> 19:27.580
But he is in the following of a man like Frederick Soddy who was a Nobel Prize chemist who was

19:27.580 --> 19:35.780
one of the first people to think really freshly about economics or people like Silvio Gasel

19:35.780 --> 19:40.340
in Austria and Major Douglas in England.

19:40.340 --> 19:44.540
He is in that following.

19:44.540 --> 19:52.720
And the proposition that he puts forward is very simple that money is the circulation

19:52.720 --> 19:59.260
of information and in itself has no value.

19:59.260 --> 20:00.760
Gold of course has some value.

20:00.760 --> 20:08.760
It has some value for industry and some value for dentistry and some value for jewelry.

20:08.760 --> 20:18.920
But as a means of exchanging the goods and services of the world it is as primitive as

20:18.920 --> 20:29.500
most horses for carrying the mail.

20:29.500 --> 20:36.880
We must recognize then that money is a pure abstraction.

20:36.880 --> 20:46.520
I was on a television show a little while ago with Ted Sorenson and Raymond Molley and

20:46.520 --> 20:51.080
they were having a long, long discussion which sounded like something that goes on in a smoke-filled

20:51.080 --> 20:57.520
back room of party bosses where they were talking about the prospects for the Republican

20:57.520 --> 21:01.360
Democratic parties in 1968.

21:01.360 --> 21:05.680
And then they got on to the question of automation and the problems of unemployment that it was

21:05.680 --> 21:09.720
making and the difficulties of transferring workers from this to that when they were only

21:09.720 --> 21:12.280
trained for this.

21:12.280 --> 21:16.920
When I said the trouble with you gentlemen is you still think money is real.

21:16.920 --> 21:21.160
And they looked at me and sort of said oh someone who doesn't think money is real because

21:21.160 --> 21:27.200
everybody knows money is money and it's very important.

21:27.200 --> 21:31.680
But it just isn't real at all because it has the same relationship to real wealth that

21:31.680 --> 21:36.560
is to say to actual goods and services that words have to meaning.

21:36.560 --> 21:39.440
That words have to the physical world.

21:39.440 --> 21:44.160
And as words are not the physical world, money is not wealth.

21:44.160 --> 21:52.400
It only is an accounting of available energy, economic energy.

21:52.400 --> 21:59.840
Now what happens then when you introduce technology into production?

21:59.840 --> 22:04.840
You produce enormous quantities of goods by technological methods.

22:04.840 --> 22:09.560
But at the same time you put people out of work.

22:09.560 --> 22:14.480
You can say oh but it always creates more jobs, there will always be more jobs, yes.

22:14.480 --> 22:18.040
But lots of them will be futile jobs.

22:18.040 --> 22:24.560
They will be jobs making every kind of frippery and unnecessary contraption.

22:24.560 --> 22:28.120
And one will also at the same time have to beguile the public into feeling that they

22:28.120 --> 22:33.480
need and want these completely unnecessary things that aren't even beautiful.

22:33.480 --> 22:37.760
And therefore an enormous amount of nonsense employment and busy work bureaucratic and

22:37.760 --> 22:43.680
otherwise it has to be created in order to keep people working because we believe as

22:43.680 --> 22:49.080
good Protestants that the devil finds work for idle hands to do.

22:49.080 --> 22:53.840
But the basic principle of the whole thing has been completely overlooked that the purpose

22:53.840 --> 23:00.680
of the machine is to make drudgery unnecessary.

23:00.680 --> 23:08.240
And if we don't allow it to achieve its purpose we live in a constant state of self-frustration.

23:08.240 --> 23:16.920
So then if a given manufacturer automates his plant and dismisses his labor force and

23:16.920 --> 23:26.600
they have to operate on a very much diminished income, say some sort of dole, the manufacturer

23:26.600 --> 23:34.120
suddenly finds that the public does not have the wherewithal to buy his products.

23:34.120 --> 23:43.320
And therefore he has invested in this expensive automotive machinery to no purpose.

23:43.320 --> 23:49.640
And therefore obviously the public has to be provided with the means of purchasing what

23:49.640 --> 23:52.520
the machines produce.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.600
People say that's not fair.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.280
Where's the money going to come from?

23:56.280 --> 23:58.000
Who's going to pay for it?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.680
The answer is the machine.

24:00.680 --> 24:09.040
The machine pays for it because the machine works for the manufacturer and for the community.

24:09.040 --> 24:17.560
This is not saying, you see, that this is not the statist communist idea that you expropriate

24:17.560 --> 24:21.280
the manufacturer and say you can't own and run this factory anymore, it is owned by the

24:21.280 --> 24:22.280
government.

24:22.280 --> 24:29.480
It is only saying that the government or the people have to be responsible for issuing

24:29.480 --> 24:37.840
to themselves sufficient credit to circulate the goods they are producing and have to balance

24:37.840 --> 24:45.600
the measuring standard of money with the gross national product.

24:45.600 --> 24:49.560
That means that taxation is obsolete, completely obsolete.

24:49.560 --> 24:55.520
We ought to go the other way, fear bold points out, that every individual should be assured

24:55.520 --> 24:58.240
of a minimum income.

24:58.240 --> 25:01.800
Now you see that absolutely horrifies most people.

25:01.800 --> 25:06.160
Say all these waste drawers, these people who are out of a job because they're really

25:06.160 --> 25:14.080
lazy, see, given the money, yeah.

25:14.080 --> 25:18.320
Because otherwise the machines can't work.

25:18.320 --> 25:20.560
We come to blockage.

25:20.560 --> 25:26.400
This was the situation of the Great Depression when here we were still in a material sense

25:26.400 --> 25:33.320
a very rich country with plenty of fields and farms and mines and factories, everything

25:33.320 --> 25:40.920
going but suddenly because of a psychological hang-up, because of a mysterious mumbo-jumbo

25:40.920 --> 25:45.440
about the economy, about the banking.

25:45.440 --> 25:52.960
We were all miserable and poor, starving in the midst of plenty, just because of a psychological

25:52.960 --> 25:53.960
hang-up.

25:53.960 --> 26:01.080
And that hang-up is that money is real and that people ought to suffer in order to get

26:01.080 --> 26:02.080
it.

26:02.080 --> 26:07.480
But the whole point of the machine is to relieve you of that suffering, which is an ingenuity.

26:07.480 --> 26:15.880
You see, we are psychologically back in the 17th century and technically in the 20th.

26:15.880 --> 26:19.920
And here comes the problem.

26:19.920 --> 26:31.560
So what we have to find out how to do is to change the psychological attitude to money

26:31.560 --> 26:39.360
and to wealth and furthermore to pleasure and furthermore to the nature of work.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.920
And this is a formidable problem.

26:41.920 --> 26:48.760
It requires the best brains in public relations, in propaganda, in all that kind of thing, in

26:48.760 --> 26:57.520
all the media, television, radio, newspapers, everything to try to get across a message

26:57.520 --> 27:01.040
to the vast general public about what money is.

27:01.040 --> 27:04.080
You see, the difficulty is this.

27:04.080 --> 27:09.120
When the public suspects that the money that is being issued, the dollar bills being issued

27:09.120 --> 27:16.160
by the government, are only paper and stand only for paper, they start putting up prices.

27:16.160 --> 27:20.640
So you get an inflationary situation where the more paper money there is, the higher

27:20.640 --> 27:24.640
and higher and higher the prices go.

27:24.640 --> 27:32.240
Which is a very stupid psychological maneuver.

27:32.240 --> 27:35.880
And people have to be persuaded.

27:35.880 --> 27:40.240
The least effective way of persuading people is passing laws, but they have to be persuaded

27:40.240 --> 27:44.760
somehow not to put up the prices, but to play fair with each other.
