1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,520
I wonder often if there's any relationship between guilt and gold, that the love of money

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,200
is the root of evil.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,120
It's very true saying.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,980
Because you see, I was saying yesterday that the difference between having a job and having

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:29,600
a vocation is that a job is some unpleasant work you do in order to make money.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,960
With the sole purpose of making money.

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,440
And there are plenty of jobs because there is still a certain amount of dirty work that

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,320
nobody wants to do and that therefore they will pay someone to do it.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,880
There is essentially less and less of that kind of work because of mechanization.

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:59,560
But if you do a job with the sole purpose of making money, you are absurd.

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:08,800
Because if money becomes the goal and it does when you work that way, you begin increasingly

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,680
to confuse it with happiness or with pleasure.

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,480
Yes, one can take a whole handful of crisp dollar bills and practically water your mouth

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
over them.

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,960
But this is kind of a person who is confused like a Pavlov dog who salivates on the wrong

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:37,360
bell.

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:48,760
It goes back, you see, to the ancient guilt that if you don't work, you have no right

18
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,480
to eat.

19
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,480
But if there are others in the world who don't have enough to eat, you shouldn't enjoy your

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:06,720
dinner even though you have no possible means that conveying the food to them.

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:15,200
And while it is true that we are all one human family and that every individual involves

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,720
every other individual, while it is true, therefore, we should do something about.

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Changing the situation.

24
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,000
The one way of not doing anything about a situation is feeling guilty about it.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,280
Because when people feel guilty about a situation, they most usually, instead of doing something

26
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:45,160
practical to change it, they resort to all sorts of symbolic methods of expiation.

27
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,680
They go to confession.

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,920
They see an analyst.

29
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,440
They do all kinds of things which will be ways of actually not doing anything about

30
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,160
the problem, but feeling all right about it instead.

31
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,920
And guilt invariably produces that sort of reaction.

32
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,560
It is a destructive emotion.

33
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:20,920
And instead, we need to have a different attitude to our mistakes and to our misdeeds.

34
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,080
Walt Whitman always admired animals because they do not lie awake at night and weep for

35
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,000
their sins.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,880
Animals are practical in the real sense as our children who haven't been taught this

37
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:42,440
extraordinary hang-up of guilt.

38
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,440
Because if you have done something wrong and you have made a mistake and somebody makes

39
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:59,320
you ashamed of it and guilty, you run around licking the sores of your wounded ego because

40
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,880
you feel your pride has been hurt.

41
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:11,080
The first thing to understand is that it is not a serious failing in a human being to

42
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,320
make mistakes.

43
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,720
Everybody has to make mistakes.

44
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,080
There is no way out of it.

45
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,040
You can't learn anything unless you make mistakes.

46
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:28,320
We find, for example, in Japan, the Japanese have a terrible hang-up about making mistakes.

47
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,320
They therefore never have the courage to practice their English properly.

48
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,640
They have had seven years of English in school, most of it very, very badly taught.

49
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,400
And it is irrelevant English.

50
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:52,400
They learn all about Shakespeare and Dickens and Thackeray and Thomas Hardy and so on.

51
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,960
And therefore they can't carry on an everyday conversation.

52
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,240
It's like the way the English study French, all about pens of gardeners' aunts and things

53
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,320
like that.

54
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,560
But they are ashamed to try out their English unless drunk.

55
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,760
So if you want to get into conversation with the Japanese in English, you have to go to

56
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:24,560
bars and then they say university students and so on there will loosen up and talk.

57
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,000
Because they no longer have the inhibition, the shame of saying the wrong thing.

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,920
So likewise I know a very great anthropologist who was taught music, playing the piano in

59
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,160
the same way I was.

60
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:48,640
When I was taught music, the school mom who taught me used to put an India rubber, an

61
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,480
eraser it's called in this country, on the top of each hand so that I would have my hands

62
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,800
in good posture.

63
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,240
And every time I'd play a wrong note she'd hit my fingers with a pencil.

64
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,240
And this great anthropologist had had a similar sort of musical education.

65
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,160
And when confronted with a piano in the presence of an absolutely marvelous teacher in San

66
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,680
Francisco, she said she was amazed.

67
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,880
He was completely incapable of reading notes.

68
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,600
He blocked at everything.

69
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:29,000
So another great teacher of the piano I knew said simply, you must not be afraid of playing

70
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,760
wrong notes.

71
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:40,800
Just forget it, play it wrong and then eventually go over it again and you'll eventually get

72
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
it right.

73
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,840
But you must not block.

74
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,960
Just keep the same rhythm going even if you have to slow it down, but keep the proportionate

75
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,320
rhythm of one note to another.

76
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,960
And if it's the wrong note, play the wrong note as long as you play something in the

77
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,600
right rhythm.

78
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:08,240
So you know this is a way of taking away people's blockage, people's guilt and shame about making

79
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,600
mistakes.

80
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:19,280
So you absolutely, freedom means basically the freedom to make mistakes.

81
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,680
The freedom to be a damn fool.

82
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,160
And then not to recriminate with yourself when you do finally realize that it was a mistake.

83
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,720
But simply don't do it again.

84
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,320
Or at least do it less often.

85
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,480
So you know, this is the puzzle.

86
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,760
When you go to confession in the Catholic Church, which is an enormous method of inculcating

87
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,760
a sense of guilt, very subtle.

88
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,120
One says of course that Catholics are on the whole less guilty than Protestants.

89
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
More relaxed.

90
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,680
And there's some truth in that, but only some.

91
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,920
Protestants of course have chronic guilt.

92
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,240
And you can work this out by a very simple little formula, that when the Protestants

93
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:20,880
in England abandoned what is called a curricular confession to a priest, they inserted in their

94
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:28,320
prayer book a general confession in which the congregation all made its confession together.

95
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,960
Now what does a Catholic say when he makes his confession?

96
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,600
The formula is, I confess to God Almighty, the Blessed Mary of a Virgin, blessed John

97
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,680
the Baptist, the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul and all the saints, that I have sinned exceedingly

98
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,560
in thought word and deed by my fault, by my own fault, by my own most grievous fault.

99
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:55,160
Wherefore I beg, blessed Mary, etc., and you, Father, to pray for me to the Lord our God.

100
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,280
And the priest says, Almighty God, have mercy upon you, forgive you your sins, and bring

101
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,920
you to everlasting life by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ committed unto me

102
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,440
I absolve thee from all thy sins in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the

103
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Holy Spirit.

104
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:18,480
Now instead of that, what they had to introduce into the Anglican formula was instead of this

105
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:29,560
very simple confession of sins before the whole company of heaven, an absolute grovel

106
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,840
wherein they say that they have sinned so horribly, and that the remembrance of these

107
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,680
sins is grievous unto us, the burden of them is intolerable, have mercy upon us, have mercy

108
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:49,280
upon us, most merciful Father, and all this cringing and crying, breast beating and wallowing

109
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
in guilt.

110
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:57,920
And then the priest, instead of saying a simple formula of absolution, quotes all kinds of

111
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,880
scriptural texts to prove from the Bible that those who do truly and earnestly repent

112
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,120
will be forgiven by God, because they're very uncertain about it, therefore they have to

113
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,400
quote all the authorities.

114
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:22,320
And this absolutely groveling form of confession replaces the old one because they were a little

115
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,760
bit scared about abandoning direct confession of sins to the priest.

116
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:38,800
And now going back to the Catholic problem about guilt, you say when you have confessed

117
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:48,880
after saying this formula to all the saints, you confess the specific sins you've committed,

118
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,200
and you know, I stole something, committed adultery three times, and so on, whatever

119
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,700
it was.

120
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:07,620
And then you say at the end, for these are all my sins which I cannot now remember.

121
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:19,260
I firmly purpose amendment, and humbly ask pardon of God and of you Father, absolution.

122
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:26,980
Now I firmly purpose amendment, that is where the fly in the ointment consists because the

123
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:34,020
doctrine is that you have made a true confession if at the same time you have a seer intention

124
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,980
of acting differently in the future.

125
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:46,220
Now no sensitive Catholic can say that without having grave doubts as to whether actually

126
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,340
he isn't going to do some of these things again.

127
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:54,300
So if you're a workaday Catholic, like a Mexican peasant or something like that, you

128
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,140
know that the confession is just a safety valve.

129
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:04,700
You're going to go on living just as lackadaisically as ever, but you go to church every so often

130
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:12,180
and you get rid of the guilt and the evil, it's like going to the bathroom.

131
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,660
But when you get thoughtful about these things and you wonder whether you do really mean

132
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,380
what you say, whether your motive is pure and your intention is right, you get into

133
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,300
a rightful hang-up.

134
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:37,620
And one of the reasons that our technology is impeded and prevented from feeding the

135
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:44,380
world properly is the failure of one of our networks.

136
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:49,620
It's an information network and it's called money.

137
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:56,540
About which we have the most unbelievable superstitions and psychological blocks which

138
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:03,140
have been gone into at some length by Freud who equates our valuation of money with our

139
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:12,340
attitude to excrement and a very complicated lot of complexes grow up around that.

140
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:22,540
But money and our psychological attitude to money is a major obstacle to a proper development

141
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:30,860
of technology enabling it to do what it is supposed to do, that is to save labor and

142
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:37,700
to produce goods, services and so on adequately.

143
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:44,660
So I must introduce this with a story which is entirely legendary, indeed quite apocryphal.

144
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:50,620
The great banks of the world at one time got absolutely sick of the expense and security

145
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:56,900
measures involved in shipping consignments of gold from one bank to another.

146
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:04,060
And so they decided that all the chief banks of the world would open offices on a certain

147
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:10,140
island in the South Pacific which was balmy and comfortable and there they would store

148
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,780
all the gold in the world.

149
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:19,100
And they put it in great subterranean vaults reached by deep elevator shafts and then all

150
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,780
they had to do when one bank or one country owed gold to another was to trundle it across

151
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,460
the street.

152
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:32,900
And this was very efficient and it went on beautifully for five or six years.

153
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,780
Then the presidents of the world banks got together and said let's have a convention

154
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,020
out on this island and take our wives and families.

155
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:46,620
So about seven years from the date of opening all those presidents and their wives and families

156
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:52,500
went out to this specific island and they inspected the books and everything was beautifully

157
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
in order.

158
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,900
Then the children said, our daddy can't we see the gold.

159
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,020
They said of course you may see the gold.

160
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,300
And they said to the managers, let's take our children down to the vaults and show

161
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,540
them the gold.

162
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:14,300
And the managers said well it's a little bit inconvenient at this time and perhaps the

163
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:22,500
children would not really be very interested after all it's just only old plain gold.

164
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,220
And the president said oh no no come now they'd be thrilled let's go down and see.

165
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:34,940
And there was further humming and hawing and delays and finally it came out that a few

166
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:41,060
years before there had been a catastrophic subterranean birth quake and all the vaults

167
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,380
had been swallowed up and all the gold had disappeared.

168
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,500
But so far as the bookkeeping was concerned everything was in perfect order.

169
00:15:52,820 --> 00:16:02,860
What this means then is that money is nothing but bookkeeping.

170
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,540
It is figures.

171
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:17,100
It is a way of measuring what you owe the community and what the community owes you.

172
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,580
It is of course as you all know a substitute for barter.

173
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:27,660
If you worked on a farm and the farmer paid you in terms of ears of corn, onions, cabbages

174
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,740
and other vegetables and yet you wanted a pot and pan of some kind and you took a few

175
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:39,900
vegetables over to the man who so made pots and pans and you swapped.

176
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:46,780
Some people used cowry shells to stand for money so that you wouldn't have to barter

177
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:56,180
and carry around all these inconvenient loads of goods and then of course gold was used

178
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:05,620
because gold was rare and because gold was supposed to have a constant value.

179
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:14,780
You might ponder the question when a banker buys gold with what does he pay for it?

180
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,700
The answer is a mystery called credit.

181
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:30,900
Credit is bookkeeping and as the economy of the western world developed it was found

182
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:37,540
that there was not enough gold around if it were to remain constant in value to exchange

183
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,820
goods and services.

184
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,580
You could of course have changed the picture by putting down the price of goods and services

185
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:51,140
to keep pace with the amount of gold and circulation but nobody will ever put down

186
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,140
the price.

187
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:59,380
There is something in our psychology whereby prices always tend to go up but at the same

188
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:05,780
time therefore because the amount of gold in the world did not provide an adequate channel

189
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:11,540
for the circulation of goods and services all great industrial nations went heavily

190
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,600
into debt.

191
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,900
They created a thing called the national debt which year by year gets bigger and bigger

192
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,020
and bigger to the horror and consternation of old fashioned republicans who pay their

193
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,740
bills.

194
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,340
But the reason for the increase of the national debt is extremely obvious.

195
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:36,580
It is that with an expanding gross national product there needs to be more and more money

196
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:42,300
that is to say tokens of exchange in order to circulate the amount of goods produced

197
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:48,260
which is ever increasing.

198
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:55,780
Now I am not an economist and I can refer you to the work of those who really are but

199
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,940
any fool can see certain extremely fundamental principles about this whole situation.

200
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:07,140
Now I am speaking of the thought today of a man called Robert Theobald who sort of ties

201
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:13,540
in with the general picture of people like McLuhan and Buckminster Fuller in having very

202
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:20,780
far out thoughts and very adventurous thoughts about what we should do about money.

203
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:27,580
But he is in the following of a man like Frederick Soddy who was a Nobel Prize chemist who was

204
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:35,780
one of the first people to think really freshly about economics or people like Silvio Gasel

205
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,340
in Austria and Major Douglas in England.

206
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,540
He is in that following.

207
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:52,720
And the proposition that he puts forward is very simple that money is the circulation

208
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,260
of information and in itself has no value.

209
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,760
Gold of course has some value.

210
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:08,760
It has some value for industry and some value for dentistry and some value for jewelry.

211
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:18,920
But as a means of exchanging the goods and services of the world it is as primitive as

212
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:29,500
most horses for carrying the mail.

213
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:36,880
We must recognize then that money is a pure abstraction.

214
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:46,520
I was on a television show a little while ago with Ted Sorenson and Raymond Molley and

215
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,080
they were having a long, long discussion which sounded like something that goes on in a smoke-filled

216
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:57,520
back room of party bosses where they were talking about the prospects for the Republican

217
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,360
Democratic parties in 1968.

218
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,680
And then they got on to the question of automation and the problems of unemployment that it was

219
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,720
making and the difficulties of transferring workers from this to that when they were only

220
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,280
trained for this.

221
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,920
When I said the trouble with you gentlemen is you still think money is real.

222
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,160
And they looked at me and sort of said oh someone who doesn't think money is real because

223
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,200
everybody knows money is money and it's very important.

224
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,680
But it just isn't real at all because it has the same relationship to real wealth that

225
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,560
is to say to actual goods and services that words have to meaning.

226
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,440
That words have to the physical world.

227
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,160
And as words are not the physical world, money is not wealth.

228
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:52,400
It only is an accounting of available energy, economic energy.

229
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:59,840
Now what happens then when you introduce technology into production?

230
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,840
You produce enormous quantities of goods by technological methods.

231
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,560
But at the same time you put people out of work.

232
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:14,480
You can say oh but it always creates more jobs, there will always be more jobs, yes.

233
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,040
But lots of them will be futile jobs.

234
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:24,560
They will be jobs making every kind of frippery and unnecessary contraption.

235
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,120
And one will also at the same time have to beguile the public into feeling that they

236
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,480
need and want these completely unnecessary things that aren't even beautiful.

237
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,760
And therefore an enormous amount of nonsense employment and busy work bureaucratic and

238
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,680
otherwise it has to be created in order to keep people working because we believe as

239
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,080
good Protestants that the devil finds work for idle hands to do.

240
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,840
But the basic principle of the whole thing has been completely overlooked that the purpose

241
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:00,680
of the machine is to make drudgery unnecessary.

242
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:08,240
And if we don't allow it to achieve its purpose we live in a constant state of self-frustration.

243
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:16,920
So then if a given manufacturer automates his plant and dismisses his labor force and

244
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:26,600
they have to operate on a very much diminished income, say some sort of dole, the manufacturer

245
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:34,120
suddenly finds that the public does not have the wherewithal to buy his products.

246
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:43,320
And therefore he has invested in this expensive automotive machinery to no purpose.

247
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:49,640
And therefore obviously the public has to be provided with the means of purchasing what

248
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,520
the machines produce.

249
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,600
People say that's not fair.

250
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,280
Where's the money going to come from?

251
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,000
Who's going to pay for it?

252
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,680
The answer is the machine.

253
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:09,040
The machine pays for it because the machine works for the manufacturer and for the community.

254
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:17,560
This is not saying, you see, that this is not the statist communist idea that you expropriate

255
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,280
the manufacturer and say you can't own and run this factory anymore, it is owned by the

256
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
government.

257
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:29,480
It is only saying that the government or the people have to be responsible for issuing

258
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:37,840
to themselves sufficient credit to circulate the goods they are producing and have to balance

259
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:45,600
the measuring standard of money with the gross national product.

260
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,560
That means that taxation is obsolete, completely obsolete.

261
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:55,520
We ought to go the other way, fear bold points out, that every individual should be assured

262
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,240
of a minimum income.

263
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,800
Now you see that absolutely horrifies most people.

264
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,160
Say all these waste drawers, these people who are out of a job because they're really

265
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:14,080
lazy, see, given the money, yeah.

266
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,320
Because otherwise the machines can't work.

267
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,560
We come to blockage.

268
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:26,400
This was the situation of the Great Depression when here we were still in a material sense

269
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:33,320
a very rich country with plenty of fields and farms and mines and factories, everything

270
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:40,920
going but suddenly because of a psychological hang-up, because of a mysterious mumbo-jumbo

271
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,440
about the economy, about the banking.

272
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:52,960
We were all miserable and poor, starving in the midst of plenty, just because of a psychological

273
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
hang-up.

274
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:01,080
And that hang-up is that money is real and that people ought to suffer in order to get

275
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
it.

276
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,480
But the whole point of the machine is to relieve you of that suffering, which is an ingenuity.

277
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:15,880
You see, we are psychologically back in the 17th century and technically in the 20th.

278
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,920
And here comes the problem.

279
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:31,560
So what we have to find out how to do is to change the psychological attitude to money

280
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:39,360
and to wealth and furthermore to pleasure and furthermore to the nature of work.

281
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,920
And this is a formidable problem.

282
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:48,760
It requires the best brains in public relations, in propaganda, in all that kind of thing, in

283
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:57,520
all the media, television, radio, newspapers, everything to try to get across a message

284
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,040
to the vast general public about what money is.

285
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,080
You see, the difficulty is this.

286
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,120
When the public suspects that the money that is being issued, the dollar bills being issued

287
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:16,160
by the government, are only paper and stand only for paper, they start putting up prices.

288
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,640
So you get an inflationary situation where the more paper money there is, the higher

289
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,640
and higher and higher the prices go.

290
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:32,240
Which is a very stupid psychological maneuver.

291
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,880
And people have to be persuaded.

292
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,240
The least effective way of persuading people is passing laws, but they have to be persuaded

293
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,760
somehow not to put up the prices, but to play fair with each other.
