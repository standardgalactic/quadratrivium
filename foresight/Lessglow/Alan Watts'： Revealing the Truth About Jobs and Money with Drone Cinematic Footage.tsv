0	9520	I wonder often if there's any relationship between guilt and gold, that the love of money
9520	11200	is the root of evil.
11200	15120	It's very true saying.
15120	20980	Because you see, I was saying yesterday that the difference between having a job and having
20980	29600	a vocation is that a job is some unpleasant work you do in order to make money.
29600	33960	With the sole purpose of making money.
33960	38440	And there are plenty of jobs because there is still a certain amount of dirty work that
38440	44320	nobody wants to do and that therefore they will pay someone to do it.
44320	49880	There is essentially less and less of that kind of work because of mechanization.
49880	59560	But if you do a job with the sole purpose of making money, you are absurd.
59560	68800	Because if money becomes the goal and it does when you work that way, you begin increasingly
68800	73680	to confuse it with happiness or with pleasure.
73680	79480	Yes, one can take a whole handful of crisp dollar bills and practically water your mouth
79480	80480	over them.
80480	85960	But this is kind of a person who is confused like a Pavlov dog who salivates on the wrong
85960	97360	bell.
97360	108760	It goes back, you see, to the ancient guilt that if you don't work, you have no right
108760	113480	to eat.
113480	118480	But if there are others in the world who don't have enough to eat, you shouldn't enjoy your
118480	126720	dinner even though you have no possible means that conveying the food to them.
126720	135200	And while it is true that we are all one human family and that every individual involves
135200	142720	every other individual, while it is true, therefore, we should do something about.
143720	146720	Changing the situation.
146720	153000	The one way of not doing anything about a situation is feeling guilty about it.
153000	158280	Because when people feel guilty about a situation, they most usually, instead of doing something
158280	165160	practical to change it, they resort to all sorts of symbolic methods of expiation.
165160	167680	They go to confession.
167680	169920	They see an analyst.
169920	175440	They do all kinds of things which will be ways of actually not doing anything about
175440	181160	the problem, but feeling all right about it instead.
181160	185920	And guilt invariably produces that sort of reaction.
185920	189560	It is a destructive emotion.
189560	200920	And instead, we need to have a different attitude to our mistakes and to our misdeeds.
200920	205080	Walt Whitman always admired animals because they do not lie awake at night and weep for
205080	209000	their sins.
209000	215880	Animals are practical in the real sense as our children who haven't been taught this
215880	222440	extraordinary hang-up of guilt.
222440	228440	Because if you have done something wrong and you have made a mistake and somebody makes
228440	239320	you ashamed of it and guilty, you run around licking the sores of your wounded ego because
239320	242880	you feel your pride has been hurt.
242880	251080	The first thing to understand is that it is not a serious failing in a human being to
251080	255320	make mistakes.
255320	256720	Everybody has to make mistakes.
256720	258080	There is no way out of it.
258080	261040	You can't learn anything unless you make mistakes.
261040	268320	We find, for example, in Japan, the Japanese have a terrible hang-up about making mistakes.
268320	274320	They therefore never have the courage to practice their English properly.
274320	280640	They have had seven years of English in school, most of it very, very badly taught.
280640	282400	And it is irrelevant English.
282400	292400	They learn all about Shakespeare and Dickens and Thackeray and Thomas Hardy and so on.
292400	294960	And therefore they can't carry on an everyday conversation.
294960	301240	It's like the way the English study French, all about pens of gardeners' aunts and things
301240	305320	like that.
305320	310560	But they are ashamed to try out their English unless drunk.
310560	314760	So if you want to get into conversation with the Japanese in English, you have to go to
314760	324560	bars and then they say university students and so on there will loosen up and talk.
324560	330000	Because they no longer have the inhibition, the shame of saying the wrong thing.
330000	337920	So likewise I know a very great anthropologist who was taught music, playing the piano in
337920	340160	the same way I was.
340160	348640	When I was taught music, the school mom who taught me used to put an India rubber, an
348640	353480	eraser it's called in this country, on the top of each hand so that I would have my hands
353480	355800	in good posture.
355800	361240	And every time I'd play a wrong note she'd hit my fingers with a pencil.
361240	366240	And this great anthropologist had had a similar sort of musical education.
366240	370160	And when confronted with a piano in the presence of an absolutely marvelous teacher in San
370160	372680	Francisco, she said she was amazed.
372680	375880	He was completely incapable of reading notes.
375880	379600	He blocked at everything.
379600	389000	So another great teacher of the piano I knew said simply, you must not be afraid of playing
389000	392760	wrong notes.
392760	400800	Just forget it, play it wrong and then eventually go over it again and you'll eventually get
400800	401800	it right.
401800	403840	But you must not block.
403840	410960	Just keep the same rhythm going even if you have to slow it down, but keep the proportionate
410960	413320	rhythm of one note to another.
413320	416960	And if it's the wrong note, play the wrong note as long as you play something in the
416960	420600	right rhythm.
420600	428240	So you know this is a way of taking away people's blockage, people's guilt and shame about making
428240	431600	mistakes.
431600	439280	So you absolutely, freedom means basically the freedom to make mistakes.
439280	442680	The freedom to be a damn fool.
442680	448160	And then not to recriminate with yourself when you do finally realize that it was a mistake.
448160	452720	But simply don't do it again.
452720	457320	Or at least do it less often.
457320	461480	So you know, this is the puzzle.
461480	466760	When you go to confession in the Catholic Church, which is an enormous method of inculcating
466760	470760	a sense of guilt, very subtle.
470760	476120	One says of course that Catholics are on the whole less guilty than Protestants.
476120	477120	More relaxed.
477120	482680	And there's some truth in that, but only some.
482680	485920	Protestants of course have chronic guilt.
485920	492240	And you can work this out by a very simple little formula, that when the Protestants
492240	500880	in England abandoned what is called a curricular confession to a priest, they inserted in their
500880	508320	prayer book a general confession in which the congregation all made its confession together.
508320	512960	Now what does a Catholic say when he makes his confession?
512960	517600	The formula is, I confess to God Almighty, the Blessed Mary of a Virgin, blessed John
517600	521680	the Baptist, the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul and all the saints, that I have sinned exceedingly
521680	526560	in thought word and deed by my fault, by my own fault, by my own most grievous fault.
526560	535160	Wherefore I beg, blessed Mary, etc., and you, Father, to pray for me to the Lord our God.
535160	539280	And the priest says, Almighty God, have mercy upon you, forgive you your sins, and bring
539280	542920	you to everlasting life by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ committed unto me
543280	546440	I absolve thee from all thy sins in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
546440	549440	Holy Spirit.
549440	558480	Now instead of that, what they had to introduce into the Anglican formula was instead of this
558480	569560	very simple confession of sins before the whole company of heaven, an absolute grovel
569680	576840	wherein they say that they have sinned so horribly, and that the remembrance of these
576840	581680	sins is grievous unto us, the burden of them is intolerable, have mercy upon us, have mercy
581680	589280	upon us, most merciful Father, and all this cringing and crying, breast beating and wallowing
589280	590280	in guilt.
590280	597920	And then the priest, instead of saying a simple formula of absolution, quotes all kinds of
597920	603880	scriptural texts to prove from the Bible that those who do truly and earnestly repent
603880	608120	will be forgiven by God, because they're very uncertain about it, therefore they have to
608120	613400	quote all the authorities.
613400	622320	And this absolutely groveling form of confession replaces the old one because they were a little
622320	627760	bit scared about abandoning direct confession of sins to the priest.
627760	638800	And now going back to the Catholic problem about guilt, you say when you have confessed
638800	648880	after saying this formula to all the saints, you confess the specific sins you've committed,
648880	654200	and you know, I stole something, committed adultery three times, and so on, whatever
654200	655700	it was.
655700	667620	And then you say at the end, for these are all my sins which I cannot now remember.
667620	679260	I firmly purpose amendment, and humbly ask pardon of God and of you Father, absolution.
679260	686980	Now I firmly purpose amendment, that is where the fly in the ointment consists because the
686980	694020	doctrine is that you have made a true confession if at the same time you have a seer intention
694020	697980	of acting differently in the future.
697980	706220	Now no sensitive Catholic can say that without having grave doubts as to whether actually
706220	709340	he isn't going to do some of these things again.
709340	714300	So if you're a workaday Catholic, like a Mexican peasant or something like that, you
714300	717140	know that the confession is just a safety valve.
717140	724700	You're going to go on living just as lackadaisically as ever, but you go to church every so often
724700	732180	and you get rid of the guilt and the evil, it's like going to the bathroom.
732180	736660	But when you get thoughtful about these things and you wonder whether you do really mean
736660	742380	what you say, whether your motive is pure and your intention is right, you get into
742380	746300	a rightful hang-up.
746300	757620	And one of the reasons that our technology is impeded and prevented from feeding the
757620	764380	world properly is the failure of one of our networks.
764380	769620	It's an information network and it's called money.
769620	776540	About which we have the most unbelievable superstitions and psychological blocks which
776540	783140	have been gone into at some length by Freud who equates our valuation of money with our
783140	792340	attitude to excrement and a very complicated lot of complexes grow up around that.
792340	802540	But money and our psychological attitude to money is a major obstacle to a proper development
802540	810860	of technology enabling it to do what it is supposed to do, that is to save labor and
810860	817700	to produce goods, services and so on adequately.
817700	824660	So I must introduce this with a story which is entirely legendary, indeed quite apocryphal.
824660	830620	The great banks of the world at one time got absolutely sick of the expense and security
830620	836900	measures involved in shipping consignments of gold from one bank to another.
836900	844060	And so they decided that all the chief banks of the world would open offices on a certain
844060	850140	island in the South Pacific which was balmy and comfortable and there they would store
850140	852780	all the gold in the world.
852780	859100	And they put it in great subterranean vaults reached by deep elevator shafts and then all
859100	863780	they had to do when one bank or one country owed gold to another was to trundle it across
863780	866460	the street.
866460	872900	And this was very efficient and it went on beautifully for five or six years.
872900	876780	Then the presidents of the world banks got together and said let's have a convention
876780	881020	out on this island and take our wives and families.
881020	886620	So about seven years from the date of opening all those presidents and their wives and families
886620	892500	went out to this specific island and they inspected the books and everything was beautifully
892500	893500	in order.
894380	898900	Then the children said, our daddy can't we see the gold.
898900	901020	They said of course you may see the gold.
901020	904300	And they said to the managers, let's take our children down to the vaults and show
904300	906540	them the gold.
906540	914300	And the managers said well it's a little bit inconvenient at this time and perhaps the
914300	922500	children would not really be very interested after all it's just only old plain gold.
922500	927220	And the president said oh no no come now they'd be thrilled let's go down and see.
927220	934940	And there was further humming and hawing and delays and finally it came out that a few
934940	941060	years before there had been a catastrophic subterranean birth quake and all the vaults
941060	944380	had been swallowed up and all the gold had disappeared.
944380	948500	But so far as the bookkeeping was concerned everything was in perfect order.
952820	962860	What this means then is that money is nothing but bookkeeping.
962860	964540	It is figures.
964540	977100	It is a way of measuring what you owe the community and what the community owes you.
977100	981580	It is of course as you all know a substitute for barter.
981580	987660	If you worked on a farm and the farmer paid you in terms of ears of corn, onions, cabbages
987660	992740	and other vegetables and yet you wanted a pot and pan of some kind and you took a few
992740	999900	vegetables over to the man who so made pots and pans and you swapped.
999900	1006780	Some people used cowry shells to stand for money so that you wouldn't have to barter
1006780	1016180	and carry around all these inconvenient loads of goods and then of course gold was used
1016180	1025620	because gold was rare and because gold was supposed to have a constant value.
1025620	1034780	You might ponder the question when a banker buys gold with what does he pay for it?
1034780	1038700	The answer is a mystery called credit.
1038700	1050900	Credit is bookkeeping and as the economy of the western world developed it was found
1050900	1057540	that there was not enough gold around if it were to remain constant in value to exchange
1057540	1059820	goods and services.
1059820	1064580	You could of course have changed the picture by putting down the price of goods and services
1064580	1071140	to keep pace with the amount of gold and circulation but nobody will ever put down
1071140	1072140	the price.
1072140	1079380	There is something in our psychology whereby prices always tend to go up but at the same
1079380	1085780	time therefore because the amount of gold in the world did not provide an adequate channel
1085780	1091540	for the circulation of goods and services all great industrial nations went heavily
1091540	1093600	into debt.
1093600	1097900	They created a thing called the national debt which year by year gets bigger and bigger
1097900	1102020	and bigger to the horror and consternation of old fashioned republicans who pay their
1102020	1104740	bills.
1104740	1108340	But the reason for the increase of the national debt is extremely obvious.
1108340	1116580	It is that with an expanding gross national product there needs to be more and more money
1116580	1122300	that is to say tokens of exchange in order to circulate the amount of goods produced
1122300	1128260	which is ever increasing.
1128260	1135780	Now I am not an economist and I can refer you to the work of those who really are but
1135780	1141940	any fool can see certain extremely fundamental principles about this whole situation.
1141940	1147140	Now I am speaking of the thought today of a man called Robert Theobald who sort of ties
1147140	1153540	in with the general picture of people like McLuhan and Buckminster Fuller in having very
1153540	1160780	far out thoughts and very adventurous thoughts about what we should do about money.
1160780	1167580	But he is in the following of a man like Frederick Soddy who was a Nobel Prize chemist who was
1167580	1175780	one of the first people to think really freshly about economics or people like Silvio Gasel
1175780	1180340	in Austria and Major Douglas in England.
1180340	1184540	He is in that following.
1184540	1192720	And the proposition that he puts forward is very simple that money is the circulation
1192720	1199260	of information and in itself has no value.
1199260	1200760	Gold of course has some value.
1200760	1208760	It has some value for industry and some value for dentistry and some value for jewelry.
1208760	1218920	But as a means of exchanging the goods and services of the world it is as primitive as
1218920	1229500	most horses for carrying the mail.
1229500	1236880	We must recognize then that money is a pure abstraction.
1236880	1246520	I was on a television show a little while ago with Ted Sorenson and Raymond Molley and
1246520	1251080	they were having a long, long discussion which sounded like something that goes on in a smoke-filled
1251080	1257520	back room of party bosses where they were talking about the prospects for the Republican
1257520	1261360	Democratic parties in 1968.
1261360	1265680	And then they got on to the question of automation and the problems of unemployment that it was
1265680	1269720	making and the difficulties of transferring workers from this to that when they were only
1269720	1272280	trained for this.
1272280	1276920	When I said the trouble with you gentlemen is you still think money is real.
1276920	1281160	And they looked at me and sort of said oh someone who doesn't think money is real because
1281160	1287200	everybody knows money is money and it's very important.
1287200	1291680	But it just isn't real at all because it has the same relationship to real wealth that
1291680	1296560	is to say to actual goods and services that words have to meaning.
1296560	1299440	That words have to the physical world.
1299440	1304160	And as words are not the physical world, money is not wealth.
1304160	1312400	It only is an accounting of available energy, economic energy.
1312400	1319840	Now what happens then when you introduce technology into production?
1319840	1324840	You produce enormous quantities of goods by technological methods.
1324840	1329560	But at the same time you put people out of work.
1329560	1334480	You can say oh but it always creates more jobs, there will always be more jobs, yes.
1334480	1338040	But lots of them will be futile jobs.
1338040	1344560	They will be jobs making every kind of frippery and unnecessary contraption.
1344560	1348120	And one will also at the same time have to beguile the public into feeling that they
1348120	1353480	need and want these completely unnecessary things that aren't even beautiful.
1353480	1357760	And therefore an enormous amount of nonsense employment and busy work bureaucratic and
1357760	1363680	otherwise it has to be created in order to keep people working because we believe as
1363680	1369080	good Protestants that the devil finds work for idle hands to do.
1369080	1373840	But the basic principle of the whole thing has been completely overlooked that the purpose
1373840	1380680	of the machine is to make drudgery unnecessary.
1380680	1388240	And if we don't allow it to achieve its purpose we live in a constant state of self-frustration.
1388240	1396920	So then if a given manufacturer automates his plant and dismisses his labor force and
1396920	1406600	they have to operate on a very much diminished income, say some sort of dole, the manufacturer
1406600	1414120	suddenly finds that the public does not have the wherewithal to buy his products.
1414120	1423320	And therefore he has invested in this expensive automotive machinery to no purpose.
1423320	1429640	And therefore obviously the public has to be provided with the means of purchasing what
1429640	1432520	the machines produce.
1432520	1434600	People say that's not fair.
1434600	1436280	Where's the money going to come from?
1436280	1438000	Who's going to pay for it?
1438000	1440680	The answer is the machine.
1440680	1449040	The machine pays for it because the machine works for the manufacturer and for the community.
1449040	1457560	This is not saying, you see, that this is not the statist communist idea that you expropriate
1457560	1461280	the manufacturer and say you can't own and run this factory anymore, it is owned by the
1461280	1462280	government.
1462280	1469480	It is only saying that the government or the people have to be responsible for issuing
1469480	1477840	to themselves sufficient credit to circulate the goods they are producing and have to balance
1477840	1485600	the measuring standard of money with the gross national product.
1485600	1489560	That means that taxation is obsolete, completely obsolete.
1489560	1495520	We ought to go the other way, fear bold points out, that every individual should be assured
1495520	1498240	of a minimum income.
1498240	1501800	Now you see that absolutely horrifies most people.
1501800	1506160	Say all these waste drawers, these people who are out of a job because they're really
1506160	1514080	lazy, see, given the money, yeah.
1514080	1518320	Because otherwise the machines can't work.
1518320	1520560	We come to blockage.
1520560	1526400	This was the situation of the Great Depression when here we were still in a material sense
1526400	1533320	a very rich country with plenty of fields and farms and mines and factories, everything
1533320	1540920	going but suddenly because of a psychological hang-up, because of a mysterious mumbo-jumbo
1540920	1545440	about the economy, about the banking.
1545440	1552960	We were all miserable and poor, starving in the midst of plenty, just because of a psychological
1552960	1553960	hang-up.
1553960	1561080	And that hang-up is that money is real and that people ought to suffer in order to get
1561080	1562080	it.
1562080	1567480	But the whole point of the machine is to relieve you of that suffering, which is an ingenuity.
1567480	1575880	You see, we are psychologically back in the 17th century and technically in the 20th.
1575880	1579920	And here comes the problem.
1579920	1591560	So what we have to find out how to do is to change the psychological attitude to money
1591560	1599360	and to wealth and furthermore to pleasure and furthermore to the nature of work.
1599360	1601920	And this is a formidable problem.
1601920	1608760	It requires the best brains in public relations, in propaganda, in all that kind of thing, in
1608760	1617520	all the media, television, radio, newspapers, everything to try to get across a message
1617520	1621040	to the vast general public about what money is.
1621040	1624080	You see, the difficulty is this.
1624080	1629120	When the public suspects that the money that is being issued, the dollar bills being issued
1629120	1636160	by the government, are only paper and stand only for paper, they start putting up prices.
1636160	1640640	So you get an inflationary situation where the more paper money there is, the higher
1640640	1644640	and higher and higher the prices go.
1644640	1652240	Which is a very stupid psychological maneuver.
1652240	1655880	And people have to be persuaded.
1655880	1660240	The least effective way of persuading people is passing laws, but they have to be persuaded
1660240	1664760	somehow not to put up the prices, but to play fair with each other.
