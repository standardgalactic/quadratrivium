1. **Legal Concerns for Internet Access**: Developers have limited internet access for models like ChargeGPT due to legal issues such as copyright infringement. People were scraping paywall content, which is against the law. Opening up full internet access would require careful consideration of copyright laws and other regulations.

2. **Current State of ChargeGPT**: As of now, ChargeGPT can access some parts of the internet, like public data on Reddit, but it won't provide access to copyrighted content behind paywalls.

3. **Personal Use of GPT**: You can train a personal GPT model by providing your own data, such as emails or social media posts. However, you should be cautious about uploading extremely private information, as the data will be stored on their servers.

4. **Customization for Personal Style**: To make GPT respond in your personal style, you would need to provide clear instructions and possibly engage an engineer for fine-tuning. This process involves defining the tone of voice, language, and presentation you want the AI to adopt.

5. **Practical Experience**: The most valuable aspect of working with AI like GPT is building intuition through practical experience. It's recommended to spend more time working directly with the systems to understand their capabilities and limitations.

6. **Feedback**: The presentation was well-received, with participants finding it one of the most useful and practical AI sessions they had attended.

Remember, when fine-tuning a model like GPT for personal use, always prioritize your privacy and handle your data responsibly. Fine-tuning requires technical expertise but can lead to a more personalized AI assistant that aligns with your communication style and preferences.
