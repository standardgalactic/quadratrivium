0	5520	Thank you, Dina. And hello, everyone. Excited and very happy to be here.
7840	13120	So today, we're going to spend about one and a half hours talking about
13120	19600	generative AI and recent trends in artificial intelligence. Let me share my presentation.
21760	27920	So I will skip my introduction because Dina did a great intro.
28320	34720	But if you want to maybe get in touch with me, I will send the presentation afterwards.
34720	46160	And it has my Twitter and Telegram account. So a bit of logistical logistics. So the session
46160	54240	is being recorded. I will have a lot of links, useful links and materials and examples in the
54240	61920	slides. And those are for you to access after the workshop. I hope it will be useful. And
61920	67360	there will be a lot of links that I will not even have time to cover. So I hope that these
67360	74000	materials will be useful. The lecture or the workshop itself will take about one hour.
74560	81520	And then we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A. But it's Saturday, so I'm happy to maybe stay
81520	89520	a little bit longer if there are more questions. And the plan for today is for us to talk a little
89520	95280	bit about what is artificial intelligence? How is it changing recently? And how it does it impact
95280	102720	the economics and different industries? Then we will talk about two very specific areas of
102720	110720	application of artificial intelligence, which is personal. Sorry, I will unmute people for
112720	120160	time being. We'll talk about how artificial intelligence can help you in your personal
120160	130000	life, in your business, in your maybe arts, in different areas of life. And then how AI can
130000	136640	help your business. And I will show a lot of practical tools. So the goal and the structure
136640	144880	of today's workshop is to give a presentation, but most importantly is to show specific use cases,
144880	151040	how this can be used in practice, because there's a lot of theoretical videos or podcasts or
151040	159120	articles online. And I'm not here to re-shuffle and repeat what you can already find. I'm here to
159120	166640	actually show some practical application and some use cases that I hope will be useful.
167840	175760	And with that being said, we can start. So let's talk about why artificial intelligence
175760	181920	is important and why everybody is talking about AI right now or at least for the last year since
181920	192000	Georgia BT came out. In fact, artificial intelligence is quite old and quite old concept
192000	199520	and technology. It has been around for at least as long as digital computing has been around.
199520	206080	The first paper that mentioned the idea of building computation networks inspired by how
206080	213280	biological systems work, specifically how human brain works was published in 1943. So it's been
215120	223120	80 years of development in artificial intelligence. And the most important, the first seminal paper
223120	228960	that you probably heard about was published in 1950 by Alan Turing where he proposed this idea
228960	234080	of thinking machines. And this is actually the paper where the concept of Turing test comes from.
234960	238880	And over these 80 years, there's been a lot of ups and downs. There have been a lot of
238880	246000	development, a lot of hopes, a lot of actually things that are now called AI winters, which were
246000	252800	periods, prolonged periods for decades where people thought that there can be no progress made.
252800	260000	And then it changed from this AI winter to period of a lot of hope and inspiration and
260000	265840	new technological development. And right now we're witnessing one of those periods. And it
265840	270160	seems like it's the biggest one since the invention of the concept of artificial intelligence.
270800	277200	But actually, the whole idea of thinking machines or building something that is built by human but
277200	287360	not, but has ability to think and complete tasks, it comes even from prehistoric times.
287360	290960	For example, I found this quote, and you probably heard this concept of Golem,
290960	298720	which is this machine made of clay that people can build and then it would help with different
298720	311600	tasks. So I found one of mentions from some source from year 500. And I actually did a quick
311600	317680	experiment. I asked chat GPT and Google Bart, which is one of the chatbots developed by Google,
318240	323120	what do they think? Are they golems? And this is what I got. This is the response that I got from
323760	328400	Google Bart. It says that in some sense, it is possible to view me as a golem. This is the
328400	333920	response that Google artificial intelligence is giving. And it is actually giving a comparison
334880	344880	between Bart and Golem and different areas. Can it learn? Can it grow? It actually outperforms
344880	353040	this concept of mystical, magical creature of a Golem. And I have links to both chat GPT and Bart
353040	357600	here if you want to ask them the same question or maybe continue that conversation.
357600	366560	But today, artificial intelligence is a very practical thing. And it is being used across
366560	374400	all different areas of economy. And the first important thing to understand about AI is that
374400	380160	AI is GPT. GPT stands for general purpose technology, which means that artificial
380160	386080	intelligence is one of those technologies similar to maybe steam engine or electricity,
386480	392240	or internet, which powers all different areas of economics and all different areas of society.
392240	396240	And there are a lot of applications in healthcare, in education, in business,
396240	401840	in manufacturing, in any industry, you name it, arts, culture, and so on.
403360	409360	And because artificial intelligence has been around, there are a lot of different branches
409360	416240	and flavors of AI. And what most people are talking about today, which is GPT,
416240	422480	chatbots, large language models, is relatively new. This area has been created maybe four or
422480	430720	five years ago. It started in 2017 with the paper called, Attention is All You Need,
430720	436720	but real products are actually being developed just for the past three or four years. And
436720	442240	generative AI is relatively small. So for example, the other areas of artificial intelligence,
443200	448880	something like supervised learning or reinforcement learning is used in very practical
448880	453920	applications as well. For example, in digital advertising, Google and Facebook and Twitter,
453920	460880	all their advertisement recommendation system works using AI or self-driving cars or maybe
460960	468240	trading systems. So today, we're not going to talk about all of different applications of the AI
468240	475920	because it takes a whole university course to study that. We're going to focus on actually
475920	482240	generative AI, at least most recent and the fastest growing areas and branch of artificial
482240	489680	intelligence. And generative AI is all these different products and technologies that you hear
490480	499520	when you hear about chatbots, large language models. One of the most popular examples is
499520	506000	chat GPT. There's also a lot of different chatbots, one by Facebook called Lama, one by Google,
506000	513360	called Bart, one by Entropic, and then there's a few hundreds of products like this.
514320	519040	In addition to large language models, there are also diffusion models, which are
519920	526880	tools that allow us to, so large language models, how they work, they are creating text.
526880	533440	You ask them question or you give them prompt and they generate text. So they're really the
533440	540400	principle of how they work is very simple. They just generate a next word in the sentence. And
541280	547600	because they're so complex and so smart and they use so much data when they've been trained,
548400	553360	when they have been trained, in order to generate the next word in the sentence,
553360	562320	they had to learn the whole world model. So if you ask chat GPT who is like, I don't know,
563920	570080	46 president of the United States of America, it will give you the correct answer.
570080	574640	But to give that answer, in order to give that answer, it had to learn a lot of things. What
574640	579200	is US? What is the president? What is politics? What is election cycle? And it knows all these
579200	584720	concepts and those concepts are stored inside the model. And this is why it seems to be so smart
584720	589920	and this is actually, and this is why it is actually useful in a lot of business and personal
589920	598560	tasks. Diffusion models are models that are able to generate pictures and video. And one of the
598560	606720	most popular examples of such products is mid-journey and also Dali tool or stable diffusion.
606720	613360	Also a lot of products, all applications in app store or internet that can create you AI photo
613360	621600	or AI stylization, most of them, they use this concept of diffusion. They're based on
621600	627120	diffusion neural networks and diffusion models. But also in addition to language models and
627120	632880	diffusion models, there's a lot of smaller but no less important applications such as speech
632880	641600	recognition, voice synthesis, music generation, creation of 3D art or 3D objects for video games,
642160	647440	and many more, including very, very, very narrow and very specific ones like
648320	659840	generation of proteins for pharma companies or designing chips for computer chip manufacturing
659840	671680	companies. So how is, I want to talk about economics of AI. So I will be using a few
671920	682720	cited and popular and well done research papers to show just some of the statistics.
683280	690240	So this one is a report created by McKinsey, published about four months ago. And what they
690960	699200	came up with in that report is that generative AI could deliver a total value of 4.4 trillion dollars
700160	708080	in economics from new use cases. So these are only new use cases that are being unlocked
708080	713680	by this new technology. But also in addition to that, there's also eight trillion dollars annually.
713680	719440	So we are talking about annual GDP growth that can be gained through productivity increase
719440	725680	by workers that they use AI or businesses that they use AI in their existing tasks. And on the
725680	735200	right, there are, this graph shows impact in terms of billions of dollars in different areas
735200	740800	of business. So you can, as you can see, sales, marketing, software engineering, customer operations,
740800	747920	products are areas that will benefit the most from implementation and use and leverage of
747920	755280	artificial intelligence, but also all these other areas like legal or HR or procurement or finance,
755280	761360	there's also quite a few of very practical applications and I will cover some of those later.
764320	772720	And from the same report and another interesting piece of statistics, what they came up with
772720	779360	is that current generative AI technologies have potential to automate work activities that absorb
779360	785040	60 to 80 percent of employees' time today. It doesn't apply to all existing occupations and
785040	792400	professions, but for highly qualified office workers, this can be a huge time saving. And
792400	797680	this is, this stats is based just on existing level of technology. It doesn't take into account
797680	803040	that in the future, the technology will evolve. And we are seeing that the growth, the speed of
803040	811840	growth and speed of development of AI is staggering. It's huge. Another report, and I also have a link
811840	820080	down here below, from University of Pennsylvania, it shows that 80 percent of U.S. workforce will
820080	825840	have at least 10 percent of their daily tasks exposed or automated by large language models.
826400	832560	And this does not only apply to the United States, this generally applies to any work
832560	841840	that is characteristic to developed economy, which is service and office workers. So that means that
841840	848000	most of the economy, most of the developed economy will have at least some, at least 10 percent
848720	854720	of exposure to large language models and that will lead to automation and economic boost,
854720	861920	boosting economic productivity. Another report by Gartner where they say that 30 percent of
861920	868880	outbound tasks, marketing messages will be generated by large language models, will be
868880	875280	genetically, synthetically generated. And this is their prediction for year 2045. So basically
875280	880000	just one year from now. And this is, this is a huge increase if we're talking about marketing
880720	888480	industry globally. So why do we see these huge numbers? And these reports, these are not some
888480	895920	sci-fi movies. These are very trusted, established and, and, and, and, and reputable organizations
895920	902560	that are giving these very bold predictions. The reason for that is that generative AI is
902560	911120	both intuitive to use and it is broad. What I mean by that, generative AI is very simple to use
911120	917600	because you generally just need to learn linguistic interface, which is common, which is nature for
917680	924080	us. Like we humans, by the age of two or three or four years old, we are pretty comfortable with
924080	930240	linguistic interface. We learn to talk to our parents or our friends. And this is all you need
930240	935760	to really start using tools like ChargeGPT. You can, even if you don't know how to type, if you
935760	942080	don't know how to write, you can still do it because if you download ChargeGPT on your iPhone,
942080	948400	you can just talk to it. It will reply you. And that's pretty much instantly useful and helpful to
949040	957520	most of global population. But also in addition to ease of use, it is very broadly applicable.
957520	963840	It can augment pretty much every cognitive task. And I will go into details. I will show examples
963840	969280	of some of the, some of those tasks. It can also power embodiment in robotics so it can help
969360	975680	a lot of automation and help growth of robotic systems so it can help robots to navigate
975680	983600	environments or complete complex tasks. And at the end of the day, the use case and the outcome
983600	989840	of the growth of artificial intelligence is the global explosion of intelligence on the planet.
989840	997360	So this is maybe a little bit exaggerated picture, but it shows the idea that I'm trying to
997360	1004720	be here. So this is, the green line is the amount of human intelligence on Earth and maybe from
1004720	1010480	prehistoric times to our days, it's been growing gradually. But then with the advent and with
1011360	1017680	mass introduction of artificial intelligence, the total amount of intelligence on the Earth
1017680	1023840	is exploding rapidly. It doesn't mean that these AI tools will replace humans or they will do exactly
1023840	1031600	the same thing as humans do. I think the better way to think about it is as an augmentation or
1031600	1038720	insistence to what we do. But because we have ability to leverage this vast amount of intelligence,
1038720	1045040	we humans can achieve much, much more. We are spending less time and less energy. And that's
1045040	1053040	great. So I, because we are relatively short on time, I will not go into details of inner
1053040	1061840	workings of large language models and generative AI. I won't go, I will not go into technical
1061840	1070800	details, but I recommend this video. This is a video by Andrew Carpati, who is research lead
1070800	1076640	at OpenAI in the company that created ChatGPT. And this video is not very technical. I recommend you
1076640	1084080	to, if you have one hour, maybe in the evening or at some point, to watch this video. The link is
1084080	1089680	in the slide. And this video goes into exactly how the system work without too much technical detail,
1089680	1095920	but it gives better idea. And it comes from one of the person responsible for actually
1095920	1102320	development of this technology, who is much more knowledgeable and reputable in the space than I
1102320	1107280	am, for example. And he's also a great speaker. So really, really enjoyable video.
1109520	1117840	So yeah, we will not watch it right now, but let's go into specific AI use cases. So we'll start
1117840	1125440	with application of artificial intelligence for personal life. There's a lot of very, I would say
1125440	1132160	common and basic and maybe even boring stuff that you can do with tools like ChatGPT.
1132960	1139200	You can ask it to help craft a letter. You can ask it to check spelling. You can learn new languages
1139200	1144880	with it. You can translate the text. You can check your code. If you're a software engineer for
1144880	1151200	bugs, you can ask it to write new code. You can even learn new programming languages with it. You
1151200	1160560	can do any kind of text and language related tasks with tools like ChatGPT. But I thought that for
1160560	1166000	today presentation, that would be boring if I would just show like, okay, now you can translate
1166000	1172000	a letter into Chinese. Great, but this is not very exciting. Translation was possible before.
1172000	1178880	So today, we're not going to talk about this basic and simple stuff. Today, we're going to talk about
1178880	1187120	something maybe one level deeper or layer higher. Depends on how you want to put it.
1188560	1196560	And I want to start with this notion of learning partner. So for me, for my personal use case,
1196560	1205840	in my personal life, what I use large language models daily for is to learn new information
1205920	1214480	and to digest and to understand new complex stuff. So I want to, you can use ChatGPT or other tools,
1214480	1220880	and I will show different tools just to, again, to prove my point about the breasts and
1222640	1228000	number of different tools that exist. You can use GPT or similar LLMs as a learning partner. You
1228000	1233520	can ask it to explain complex information to you. You can ask it to be your tutor. You can even ask
1233520	1241840	it to create tests for you to learn and remember and verify yourself. You can ask GPT to engage in
1241840	1248800	Socratic dialogue with you. You can ask it to transcribe video or podcast. GPT directly cannot
1248800	1254720	do it, but there are free services that allow to transcribe and then answer questions based on
1255440	1260800	existing videos or existing podcasts. So for this first example, I want to show
1261440	1268240	another chatbot, which is not ChatGPT. Maybe it's a little bit less known, but it is called Clot AI.
1269920	1277440	It is free to use. So you can go to clot.ai, create an account. It might not work in some countries,
1277440	1285440	but it definitely works in UK and US. So if it doesn't work for you, you probably, the solution
1285440	1295440	here is to download VPN, choose either UK or US location, create an account, and then you don't
1295440	1300000	need it. So you just need VPN once to create an account and it will work for you and it will be
1300560	1308960	and it's completely free to use. So I will show one example, how I use Clot to work. So I have
1309280	1315920	to learn information. So I have a white paper. This is Bitcoin white paper. It goes into details
1315920	1323520	about how Bitcoin cryptocurrency network works. It is relatively technical. So what I would do,
1323520	1330480	if I want to learn about how Bitcoin works, but maybe let's say I'm not a technical person,
1330480	1336080	I don't understand too many things about cryptography, I would just upload a PDF here and
1336080	1342000	it could be any kind of scientific paper. And I will ask a question. And the question, my question
1342000	1349760	would be explain this paper as if I'm seven years old. So I will just ask Claude Chatbot to explain
1349760	1356720	the complex paper for me in simple terms. And as you can see, it already starts giving me answers
1356720	1363920	answer. And if you read it, I won't read the whole thing, but if you read it, you can see that it's
1363920	1371120	really, really simple. Like I have a kid who is about that age, and I'm sure he will understand.
1371120	1378560	So it just goes, sending money online is tricky, because you don't want one person spent the same
1378560	1387120	amount of money twice. And this is how Bitcoin helps it. And yeah, it's just a simple way of
1387120	1396480	explaining. I can also ask a follow up question, how new Bitcoins are created. So I can just chat
1396480	1406320	with this article. And it will continue generating these answers in this very simple term. So it
1406320	1413680	doesn't go into deep cryptography, it just calls it math puzzle. And that's easy to understand.
1413680	1421680	So that's just one example and one application. And I have link, Claude here on this slide.
1424160	1433040	Another example is to use large language models as your second brain, as a way to remember and
1433040	1441600	way to reference complex information. So you can record a lot of things today with even free online
1441600	1447520	tools, such as calls, for example, this call is being recorded, and Zoom is actually doing live
1448800	1457200	transcribing of what I'm saying. You can record documents, download documents. You can download
1457200	1464400	web pages. And then you can use one of these tools. And actually, each one of them is free to use,
1464400	1470240	at least up to a certain point. This first one is open source and it's free to use forever. So
1471120	1478240	if you want a free solution, I recommend this one. This last one is unreadable, is the one that I'm
1478240	1486160	going to show right now. And it is more focused on students and the way to prepare, for example.
1486880	1494640	And the way that second brain works is I just go to this website, I create a free account,
1494640	1501600	and then I kind of upload some information, some documents here, and talk to those documents.
1501600	1509040	So I'm just uploading a presentation, this presentation that I'm just showing. And I
1509040	1514800	upload this presentation here. And the difference between the example that I just showed before
1514800	1522400	with chatting with the paper, and this one is that here you can upload a lot of information.
1522400	1527840	You can upload the whole book, or maybe multiple books. And then this information is stored,
1527840	1534720	and you can use the same technique, you can just ask questions. So for example, I will ask,
1536800	1543760	it actually prepares some questions that I can ask, but I will ask, what are AI use cases in
1543760	1551600	marketing? And based on this presentation, it will give me answers. Personalized marketing,
1551600	1557760	empathetic communication. And if we scroll to the slide that is still coming, so a little bit of
1560240	1567040	unveil here. So this slide is AI marketing. And as you can see, it has actually found the
1567040	1573760	right slide. And it gives me information, not based on what chat GPT knows about marketing,
1573760	1579600	but based on this exact presentation. And if I were to upload a book here, I can just ask questions
1580160	1585120	to the book, and it will give answers based on relevant information that it finds in that book.
1585120	1590080	And that's very useful. This is also one of the applications that I'm using more or less daily
1590720	1602480	for various use cases. Another very, very powerful application is to use GPT or any other
1603280	1608640	large language model to be your thinking partner or brainstorm partner.
1610080	1617520	Because GPT on its own might not completely and full autonomously solve any of the problems that
1617520	1625440	you have, but it is great when you want to have someone to basically think with or discuss or
1625440	1634080	brainstorm ideas, please. And I will show example of me creating a prompt. So this is the prompt
1634080	1644320	that I did. I'm saying that I'm running webinars and lectures on how to use AI for work. And I'm
1644320	1651120	asking chat GPT to use these six thinking hats methodology, which is just brainstorming methodology
1651840	1658240	to help me generate ideas. And this is the response that I get from chat GPT. And this is
1658240	1663920	actually very useful. Again, I'm not going to read everything here, but this link is public.
1663920	1670960	And the value here is that it might not give me exact answer that I'm looking for, but it will
1670960	1677280	give me suggestions that will spark some imagination creativity that will help me to actually
1678080	1683760	come up with more creative answers. And this is also something that I'm using pretty much every
1683760	1692720	day for different questions and problems and issues that I'm facing. You can use different
1692720	1698320	methodology. So six thinking hats is completely optional. You can just go to chat GPT and type,
1699040	1706000	help me brainstorm ideas for present, for marketing campaign, for help me write
1709760	1718160	ideas for an article that I'm writing. And it will give you some ideas. And then you can ask
1718160	1724240	to elaborate and basically continue that conversation to get more valuable results.
1724960	1733520	One important thing here to note is that if you want to steer how chat GPT gives you answer,
1733520	1745440	if you have GPT account, I suggest to setting up custom instructions. So if we go to chat GPT,
1745440	1752880	you can, so first of all, if you don't have, I highly recommend to create an account
1752880	1760240	in chat GPT, the product itself is free, but you can also subscribe and get a plus subscription,
1760240	1766320	which gives you access to a more powerful model. But then when I'm talking to chat GPT,
1766320	1772160	instead of getting generic answers, it is very useful to use this thing called custom instructions.
1772160	1778320	So if you click on your profile, go to custom instructions, and you can add some information
1778320	1785440	here. So I will share the custom instructions that I'm using on this slide. You can change it
1786000	1792560	whatever way you want. But the value of this is you can steer how the answers are being generated.
1792560	1798080	For example, for me, the important thing is for it to respond concisely and be blunt,
1798080	1808240	because it usually likes to go into this very long and maybe descriptions of a lot of things.
1808240	1815280	And you can read through this. In my experience, adding these custom instructions really increases
1815280	1820640	the quality of response and increases the value that I'm getting from using chat GPT
1821600	1827360	almost two times. So highly, highly recommend using it. And you can copy this from the slide
1827360	1839200	and use in your own GPT. Next use case is communication. So I already mentioned that
1839200	1847520	GPT is great for writing any kind of emails, posts, or translating information. But it is also,
1847520	1855600	you can also ask GPT to write in a specific style. And one thing that I personally found very,
1855600	1864560	very exciting and very useful is to use GPT to visualize conversation. So this small screenshot
1864560	1869200	on the right is a small application that developed. So this is not part of chat GPT. It's not
1869200	1876160	something you get when you sign up. But this is just like a product, that's very, very small
1876160	1882560	product that I built to showcase what's possible. And I'm sure there will be or there probably are
1882560	1889120	already similar products that you can find online. Maybe some of them are paid, but I think the value
1889120	1899840	is very clear. So on the screenshot, what's happening is I'm using data from my Telegram
1899840	1905920	group channel. And you can use it for Slack or Discord or email threads with a lot of people.
1906800	1914800	And then in the screenshots, every square is a person and that's their name. Every star is a
1914800	1922480	topic that is being discussed. And every line is a specific message regarding that topic coming
1922480	1927360	from a specific user. So if I have a group channel in Telegram with maybe 100 people,
1927360	1933280	and I didn't open it for a month, and there's thousands of messages, it would take me hours
1933280	1941200	to read through that. But using something like this, using large language models to summarize
1941200	1947920	and then visualize data will help me to understand what's being discussed in that group. And I can
1947920	1955760	just skim and scan this image, spend five minutes, and I'm already up to date. And if I find something
1955760	1961840	that is useful or interesting for me, I can click on this line and it will open the specific message.
1961840	1967040	So this is one of the use cases that I kind of over many months I developed for myself. And this
1967040	1972320	really saves hours because I have a lot of different communication channels, a lot of social media
1973280	1979440	kind of comments, and it takes time, takes too much time if I try to read all of those.
1979440	1987760	I just don't have time to do anything else. I will show another example is related to
1987760	1995520	visualization. So one of the problems, one of the drawbacks of GPT and large language models that
1995520	2002160	you will probably identify and realize very quickly when you start using it is that they're
2002160	2010320	pretty bad at analytical and math tasks. So LLMs cannot really compute or count complex
2011040	2018560	mathematical questions or problems. But what they can do, they can write code. And when they write
2018560	2024880	and then execute computer code, this code is always giving you correct result because computer is
2024880	2030080	basically just a, it is a computer, it computes. So whatever code you put, you always get the
2030080	2037120	correct mathematical results. So if I ask GPT to solve me maybe like an integral, it will
2037120	2042000	most likely fail. But if I ask it to write a computer program that solves the same problem,
2042560	2049680	it will be, it will be correct. And solving integral may be not very useful or relevant for most of,
2050720	2057840	most of you or at least I don't do it daily. But I find this feature very, very useful when it
2057840	2065280	comes to data analysis. And I want to show an example. I have a spreadsheet, which is a sales
2065280	2073760	data related to motorcycles and cars. And it goes into, there's a lot of, there's a lot of
2073760	2082160	data. There's like sales number, customer name, address and country and all of that.
2082720	2092160	So what if I want to create some kind of, what if I want to get insights from this data?
2092160	2099760	For example, I can upload this file. I just upload this file to chat GPT. And I ask it,
2099760	2105920	draw me a histogram showing where the goods are shipped, the city and also use different colors
2105920	2111920	for different types of goods. And this is what I get. So it takes me, it really literally took me
2112560	2120560	30 seconds to wait until GPT completes it and gives me this picture. And this is actually,
2120560	2126000	I can also see the code that it wrote. So this is actually what it did. And this is a Python code
2126000	2134080	that analyzes the spreadsheet, takes specific data from it and draw draws a histogram. And if you
2134080	2140880	if you look closely, it is, it is, it is doing exactly what I asked. So it has city name like
2140880	2150480	Leo, New York city and so on. And it shows motorcycles in light green cars in dark green.
2150480	2156720	And I can actually keep going. I can ask, follow up questions. So for example,
2158160	2169360	I can ask it like, what was the average price for all of the goods? And it will do the same. It
2169360	2177360	will, it will also, we can actually see how, how it's writing code. It will, it will make mistakes.
2177360	2183840	It will write, it will do bugs, but then eventually it will correct itself. And this is the final
2183840	2188800	result that I get. I mean, this is maybe a simple question. I can just do it in Excel, but I can
2188800	2194800	ask it to do much more complex stuff. I can ask it to work on large files to do complex analysis.
2194800	2203920	And the goal of this example is to show that whatever tasks that usually you have to hire a
2203920	2209360	data analyst or ask a software engineer to do for you, now you can do just with
2210000	2215040	charge EPT, you can just talk to it and ask it to complete this and you will get results. And this
2215040	2220080	is very, very useful. Really, it saves thousands of dollars sometimes because,
2220960	2227280	because data scientists are not, are not cheap and GPT costs 20 bucks a month.
2230480	2242240	Okay. Moving, moving next. Another useful feature of GPT is that it can read and analyze
2242240	2249760	visual data. And this example that I'm showing here on the right is I basically took a photo
2249760	2256480	with my iPhone of the drawing that I made on my whiteboard here on the, on the, on the wall.
2256480	2263840	So I just, I took a pencil, I draw something on, on, on the whiteboard. And then I asked GPT,
2263840	2268800	please use this diagram and write me a structure outline for the presentation. So this is what I
2268800	2275520	had just thinking on, on, on, with, with my pencil on the whiteboard. And this is what I, sorry.
2276240	2283520	And this is what I got. So you can draw pictures, you can make photos, you can ask GPT to identify
2283520	2289440	objects on the photo, you can ask GPT to translate some text that, that, that is on the photo,
2289440	2296800	you can ask charge EPT to maybe extract information from the picture. And that's the value of
2296800	2303200	visual vision models that are, these vision models are only available in the paid version
2303200	2310320	of charge EPT, but if, but it's, it's really worth it. And there's also a free alternative,
2310320	2319120	I will show it later. Another use case is browsing, browsing the web. And I want to recommend a few
2319120	2323920	tools here, because one of the problems with another problem with large language models,
2323920	2328880	in addition to them not being very good at math, is that they,
2328960	2335360	by default, they don't have access to most recent information and news. So they don't have access
2335360	2343760	to internet by default. But we can ask either charge EPT to use this web browsing. So I can ask, like,
2343760	2353600	find me most recent news on AI on the web, and it will go and, and it will go and, it will go and
2353680	2369680	do a Google or Bing search. Sometimes it's being slow. We'll come back to that. But there's also a
2370400	2380400	specific and very specialized products that are free to use that allow to add this capability of
2380400	2385520	browsing the internet and getting data from the internet to large language models.
2385520	2391680	Two that I want to highlight specifically are Perplexity. Perplexity is really Google but better.
2391680	2397200	It allows you to, when you're searching for something, it allows you, instead of getting a list
2397200	2408480	of links, like you do on Google, it allows you to do a, to get a actual response. So for example,
2408560	2416400	there's a news about new solar system in Milky Way. If I press this, I, I just get an answer
2417200	2422800	saying that astronomers have, have discovered a new rare solar system in Milky Way and it goes on.
2422800	2429600	But this data, it's not just generated by LLM. This is not hallucination. It comes from, from,
2429600	2434720	from specific source. So I can read this. This is an answer for my question. Or I can go to the
2434720	2439920	source website. And this is associated press article on the same topic. And I can, I can read
2439920	2446480	the source. And I'm using Perplexity for a lot of things. Really, it is just in, every time when
2446480	2451120	I want to get an answer, if I'm not looking for a website, but for an answer for the question,
2451120	2458160	Perplexity works better than Google. For me, almost 100% of times. And it's free. And it has no
2458160	2464640	ads at least right now, maybe in the future. It also has a paid version that has more features
2464640	2473040	to it. But really, this is one of the, one of the best use cases and products built
2474400	2481040	using artificial intelligence. By the way, GPT also finished. So as you can see, when I asked it
2481040	2490000	to find more recent news on AI, what it did is it looked for, it did a Bing search. And it found
2490000	2498480	these articles. So again, this information is not something that GPT hallucinated. It is actually
2498480	2508960	coming from the source. It is coming from this generative AI tech branch section. So if you feel
2508960	2516480	like your chatbot is not using most recent information, I recommend using Perplexity,
2516480	2525520	web access for, for, for chat GPT or also Bing search. By the way, Bing has a free version of
2525520	2531680	GPT for. So if you don't have chat GPT, for some reason, you can use Bing, which is free
2533520	2539280	alternative or actually a free UI free version of charge GPT that anyone can use.
2539920	2545200	It doesn't cost anything. It is same quality, same model, same thing. It has access to internet.
2545760	2553920	And it also has a mobile app. So, so yeah, depending on your preferences, this might be
2556080	2562720	this, this, this, this, this might be a solution or good great thing to, to, to use for you.
2563920	2572320	And there's also GPTs. GPTs is something that was recently created by OpenAI by creator of,
2572320	2578240	by the company that created charge GPT and GPTs is ability to create your own version of GPT
2578240	2587280	that is using your own data. So I will not go into a lot of details here, but I just want to show
2587280	2593120	that creating your own GPT is very simple. So if you have a GPT plus subscription,
2593120	2600160	you can go to chat openAI.com slash GPTs and you can create your own GPT that can do anything you
2600160	2606080	want. And building this application is easy. You don't need to be software engineer. You can
2606080	2611360	just chat with it. Basically, there's a charge called GPT builder, and it will,
2614240	2619280	it will, it will, it will generate GPT for you. So let's, let's try something. And this is where
2619280	2625680	we actually going into, into business use cases, because this is both useful for personal, but
2625680	2632480	also for business use cases. So for example, I want to build a GPT that converts that,
2635120	2642400	that creates marketing slogan based, based on the logo.
2645840	2652160	And this is all I need to know. So the, like the most stunning, the most mind blowing thing here
2652160	2657680	is I'm right now, I'm doing software engineering. I'm creating a new product, a new product,
2657680	2663520	a new application. And all I do is just typing. I'm just chatting with this thing. So I don't
2663520	2669360	need to write any code. I don't need to, to know any programming languages. I just need to do it.
2669360	2677040	So it asks me, it suggests me a name, which is slogan crafter. I say, yeah, it's a good name.
2677040	2685840	Okay. So now it created me a logo. It created a name. And it also created a prompt. So if you
2685840	2692080	want to be more specific to change something in the behavior of how this application works,
2692080	2699680	you can go and edit this message. So let's test. We just created an application. It took me less
2699680	2706080	than 60 seconds. It was never possible ever before in the history of humankind.
2706640	2716480	So this is the logo that I have, Codex town, which is one of the projects that I run. And
2716480	2725840	I want to create a slogan for this logo. It's actually doing, it's not doing the right thing.
2725840	2732000	Sorry. I forgot to upload a picture.
2735760	2743520	Write me a slogan. So this is the logo that we have. And then it will,
2745360	2751520	it will create a slogan based, based on this, this logo, because it doesn't have any context
2751520	2756080	about what the project is about. It's just using the colors, basically the style of the image to
2756080	2763520	create the slogan. So this application might not be very useful. Goal for me is to show how easy,
2763520	2768560	how simple it is to build. I also want to show a few applications that are actually useful that
2768560	2775280	were created by, sorry, by other people and that I'm using daily. So for example,
2775760	2787360	let's go into this one, for example. So Dr. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist and he has a lot of
2787360	2793600	great podcasts. But the problem with his podcasts is that they're long and I didn't have time to
2793600	2799760	listen to a lot of them, to a lot of those. So what I can do, or someone, what someone did,
2799760	2805200	someone created, someone uploaded all the recordings of the podcasts by Andrew Huberman
2805760	2813760	and created a GPT. And now I can chat with this GPT and it will answer to me based on the question,
2813760	2821360	based on the data that is coming from those recordings. So I can ask for tips on staying
2821360	2829040	focused over time. This GPT will first search its own knowledge base, which you can upload
2829040	2835440	while creating a GPT. And then it will generate an answer based on, based on that.
2836800	2843440	So I already used it. I actually asked the same question and I find it extremely useful,
2843440	2850640	like I'm using most of those tips. And then this is just an example. Another example of GPT that
2850640	2859520	I created is a sketch to code. So this GPT allows me to upload any picture. I don't have,
2863040	2871200	I don't have right picture. Sorry, I didn't prepare. But basically, well, I won't show the
2871200	2882800	demo, but you can actually use it. So it's public. It's free to use. And what it does is I can just
2882800	2889520	create a simple image of the website, what I want to have on my website. And then I upload it here
2889520	2896720	and it outputs the code of the website that I can immediately run. So that really saves time and
2897440	2904400	almost replaces the work of website software engineer for, at least for simple stuff. So
2905680	2912880	it won't help with something very complex, like huge e-commerce website. But if you want a simple
2912880	2918160	page with a few elements, you can just draw it on a piece of paper. I can literally take a photo
2918160	2926000	of what I draw on my whiteboard and it will convert it into a code. And that's amazing. And
2926000	2937520	that's my blowing. So what I want to do next, I want to skim through a few slides. I won't stop
2937520	2946160	into detail on each one of those. But these slides are for you to use and to explore later.
2946720	2955680	On each of those slides, I have a list of different products and neural networks or AI models
2956320	2962560	that are useful for different tasks. So I have a capability listed on the left and then links
2962560	2970560	here. And there's a lot of those. We don't have time to see and to check every one of those.
2971280	2977200	But I want to show that there is a bunch of models that allow to generate text. There's a
2977200	2982640	bunch of models that are out to generate and help for software engineering with software engineering
2982640	2991360	job. There's a lot of models that allow you to generate music and voice and also translate text
2991360	2998320	to speech or speech to text. And there's a few models that actually a lot of models
2998800	3004480	right here. I have a link to the website which has a huge collection of different
3004480	3009600	image generation models. And most of those products, so on each one of those slides,
3009600	3016320	important thing is at least one or actually at least half of all these models are completely
3016320	3021680	free and open source. So you don't need to pay for anything to start using it.
3021680	3027200	If you want to use it into maybe some enterprise production use case, yes, there are enterprise
3027200	3033120	solutions, but to start to test to play with it, most of these things are actually free to use
3033120	3044800	and that's great and that gives a lot of increases accessibility. And finally, these models are
3044800	3051920	vision models. These are what I showed on one of the examples. These are models where you can
3051920	3057600	upload a photo or upload a picture and then ask questions about that picture. For example, it is
3057600	3064400	relatively good with actually medical diagnosis, although it is, I don't recommend it use instead
3064400	3070000	of professional medical help, but it is also useful for identifying objects like safety requirements
3070000	3076480	or maybe give recommendations regarding design or architecture or something like this.
3076480	3087520	And we already touched some of the business use cases. I wanted to show a few more. So we have
3087520	3096640	a few more minutes and let me go into some of the most interesting business use cases for
3096640	3105440	generative AI. I will skip this. Important and maybe most important thing about
3106240	3111760	use cases for AI in business is that business processes are not simple. Business processes are
3111760	3120720	not just one action. It is usually some logic. And this logic is hard to achieve just by chatting
3120720	3127600	with ChargeGPT. If you ask ChargeGPT to create something complex like, I don't know, promote
3127600	3133600	my product, it doesn't know what to do. There's too many things that goes into that task. But
3133600	3139520	if it is split into simple tasks and then we chain those tasks together, we can actually achieve
3139520	3149280	very complex behavior. One of the examples is to use AI for nature language processing.
3149920	3155360	Here on the right, on the example, I have an example of the user that has some kind of intent,
3156320	3164160	or some kind of message on our, let's say, website. And then this message can be classified,
3164160	3170480	depending on the intent. Is it an inquiry? Is it a price inquiry? Is it a complaint? Is it a
3170480	3178560	gratitude for our product? Based on that, we can use different prompts or different AI models
3178560	3183840	to generate a response. So one of the models will retrieve relevant data, for example, product
3183920	3189520	specification. Another model or another instance of the model will write response to the customer.
3189520	3196880	So use that product specification and answer to customer question. And then another model
3196880	3201280	will generate a picture and attach it to email and then that can be sent.
3205040	3211280	One, another example for business use case that a lot of companies are actually using today is to
3211280	3218080	use large language models as a knowledge management system. You can take all the existing digital
3218080	3227280	communication tools like Gmail, Zoom, Jobbox, LinkedIn, Office, Slack, and so on, then upload it
3227280	3237840	to a LLM system and then have ability for anyone in the company to ask questions against this
3237840	3244080	knowledge base. So if I have a list of product specifications, I upload it to this LLM and then
3244080	3248880	anyone in the company, any sales agent, for example, sales representative, if they have a question,
3248880	3256480	they can just ask, they can just type or even record a voice message and get answered to the
3256480	3261920	question like, for example, product X, what is the price or what is the dimensions and this
3261920	3267440	system will give instant response. So it saves a lot of communication overhead and saves a lot of
3267440	3279360	time when we want to share knowledge within the organization. Another huge use case in the,
3279360	3284880	if you remember the McKinsey report that I showed in the beginning, it is one of the primary use
3284880	3291120	case for large language models today is in engineering and there's two applications of that.
3291120	3298960	First of all, yes, AI is very, very helpful to software engineers. It can help write code, it can
3298960	3304720	test code, it can help you fix bugs, it can help identify bugs, but it is also useful to people
3304720	3310080	who are not engineers, but they need to complete some engineering tasks like the data analysis
3310080	3314960	example that I showed, but it can be much more complex. It can be connected to CRM system, to
3314960	3323040	databases, to existing websites, all different kinds of ERP and corporate systems.
3326880	3337120	And one of the probably on par with engineering, one of the most widely used applications of AI
3338080	3347120	is marketing. And in marketing, there's a lot of things how AI can help. And most of those are
3347120	3353520	related to either content generation. So you can create articles, blog posts, you can create text
3353520	3359360	that is search engine optimized, you can create graphics, you can even create videos, you can
3359360	3366880	create personalized content, which is something that was never possible before the AI. So if
3366880	3372800	your company has, let's say you have 100,000 customers and you know something about those
3372800	3381760	customers and you want to say them a personalized Christmas message, it was never possible to send
3381760	3389680	to manually write 100,000 messages to all of your customers. But now with AI, you can just upload
3389680	3395680	some of the personal information that you know about the customers, like I don't know where they
3395680	3403200	leave or what their interests or what do they like. And then have AI to generate 100,000 personalized
3403200	3411360	messages. And this can be just fun, just to do something nice to your customers. But this is
3411360	3415680	also valuable for the business. So if you're a business, let's say you are for financial
3415680	3421600	organizations, for example, we have a customer who's a bank. And for them, what they do, they know
3422320	3427120	like financial preferences of all their customers. And then the right messages that
3429280	3435760	are digest on the news in the stock market, based on specific interests. So if someone is
3435760	3441120	investing in high tech and another person is investing in, let's say sustainability companies,
3442160	3450960	these two persons will receive very personal and individual and very different email marketing
3451600	3458320	or email digest. And that is not just cool and fun. It is really increasing the conversion rate
3458320	3466240	and click through rate. And at the end, it is beneficial for the bottom line for how much
3466240	3477760	profit the company makes. And one more example here to show is customer operations. So the idea
3477760	3485120	of using AI in customer operations is that you can actually use AI, not instead of sales
3485120	3490080	representative, because sometimes you still need human to human interaction to close the sales.
3490720	3499200	But you can have it as an assistant, as a co-pilot to sales agents. So AI can help
3500480	3505840	sales agents and show them proactively show them some information that is relevant. What
3505840	3512080	makes sense to say to the customer. And it can also handle some of the cases. So if there are
3512080	3516960	simple questions, then AI can answer. If there's something more complex, or if the customer's
3516960	3527040	clothes is ready to buy, then it can send it to a sales representative and allow to speak to a person.
3527840	3535360	This is an example from legal. What I did here is it's very similar to the visualization example
3535360	3541920	that I showed in the beginning. But this is applied to contracts. Sometimes you have very
3541920	3548000	complex, very large legal contracts that are hard to understand, especially if you are not a lawyer.
3548160	3555680	So AI and large language models can be used here to create a diagram based on the contract. So,
3555680	3561600	for example, there's a 15-pages contract. And this is the diagram that only mentions
3562240	3567440	most important things for me to maybe make a decision or to review this diagram. So it does
3567440	3573680	not replace the work of the lawyer, but it is helpful for maybe executives or management
3574080	3579200	to see what's going on without reading all these 15-pages of complex legal text.
3579200	3586080	And that's just one of the examples. I'm skipping some things because we're close to the end of
3586080	3597040	presentation. But on the left, I have more examples for use cases of AI in each one of those areas.
3597920	3607440	One more area I want to highlight, I think it's very, very important, is people operations and HR.
3607440	3616560	And the reason I think large language models and AI is very useful here is because trading and
3616560	3624480	education is really the core of most businesses, like people are what makes business successful.
3625280	3637600	And I'm really a big fan and I really believe in the fact that large language models will do a lot of,
3639600	3649120	will enhance and improve and improve quality of education worldwide. Meaning that AI is helpful
3649280	3656480	as a tutor, even for the startups that are building AI educational software for
3657200	3663600	school children, for universities, and for corporate training programs as well. So AI can
3664320	3670720	run, can explain complex information as shown. It can generate case studies. It can simulate
3670720	3676160	some real work behavior. So for example, if you are training sales representatives,
3676160	3682480	you can generate, you can ask AI to be a partner to train and to
3685440	3691520	practice some sales skills. So you can ask AI to be an angry customer. And then it helps
3692080	3700320	people who are new to the job to know what to say if somebody is angry. Or you can ask AI to
3701120	3706240	to simulate a market situation. And that is useful for practicing
3708160	3713440	maybe some management skills. Or you can ask AI to generate a code that has some bucks.
3713440	3722880	And it's useful to upskill and train engineers. So this is, there's a lot of examples like this,
3722880	3728480	or a lot of, I would say, a lot of products, a lot of companies. So when we go into enterprise
3728480	3735360	use cases, those are mostly not free. Those are some big products or big companies doing this
3735360	3746000	and also small startups. But I, my suggestion is to really to, to pay close attention to AI
3746000	3751440	products in all of these areas. Because at the end of the day, what it gives, it gives economic
3751440	3759600	efficiency. And it allows to save costs. And it also allows to find new market opportunities.
3760320	3769680	And to wrap it up, I want to, I want to show one more slide here, which is regarding AI strategy.
3770240	3783200	So if you, if you plan to use AI in your business, I have a specific, I would say, plan or, or, or,
3783200	3788640	or suggestion how to approach this, because it might be overwhelming. There's a lot of products.
3788640	3793200	There's a lot of people trying to sell all different kinds of things. Some of those might be great.
3793920	3798480	Some of those might be great. Some of those might be very, very simple and too expensive.
3799040	3805040	So in order to do it correctly and in order to do it, like not to rush things, but also not to
3805040	3813600	wait until it's too late, I suggest starting with experiments with chat. So any simple business task
3813600	3820720	can be validated and can be tested in chat GPT, even in the free version. And that gives you idea,
3820800	3825920	overall idea, like, is it even possible and what would be the quality of the results? Some tasks
3825920	3832400	they are possible to do, but the quality is too bad. It's still like AI is still not as smart to
3832400	3838960	automate them. In some tasks, you will get good results. Once you have an experiment that you see
3838960	3846640	is working well in the chat, the next step would be to create a co-pilot, a workflow, maybe connect
3846720	3854480	a few chats with preset prompts. So one chat is, one prompt is responsible for writing a text,
3854480	3859600	and the second prompt is responsible for proofreading a text. And then you combine these
3859600	3866400	two together and you get to an agent. Agent is, when I show that slide with chains,
3866400	3877600	agent is a system, is a application that takes result of one AI tool and passes it to the next
3877600	3882320	tool and then passes it to the next tool. And those agents are relatively simple to develop.
3882320	3888480	You can use either no-code platforms, you can use it, build it internally if you have software
3888480	3893920	engineering team in your company, or you can find external developers. And this is not too expensive,
3893920	3900400	like AI used to cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars, like five, 10 years ago,
3900400	3905840	like huge AI deploy the deployment projects. Right now, building agent for search engine
3905840	3911520	optimization or sales or marketing, it can cost just a few thousand dollars, or you can do it,
3911520	3919360	build it for free. And I will not show exactly, I will not do full tutorial, but I want to show
3919600	3924560	a couple of tools. One of them is called Relevance AI. Another one is called Skate Pro.
3925840	3932800	Let me just show their landing pages. And I have both links in the presentation. So
3934000	3942000	this is just to show. So Relevance AI is a tool you can start using for free. They give you
3942000	3946960	quite a lot of free credits that you can use on the platform. So if it's small business,
3946960	3955520	you might even get away with free version. And then Skate Pro is also, they combine 1500 different
3955520	3963120	AI tools in a cascade. So you can create these agents and create very, very simple, very, very,
3963120	3974400	very powerful AI workflows. And maybe two last thing I want to say is that if something doesn't
3974400	3982320	work, I want to encourage you to not give up. Because what is happening is that AI
3984000	3993280	progress, progress in the AI space is stunningly fast. And we're moving at
3994080	3999920	increasing and unprecedented speed. So if something is not working, if you feel like
3999920	4006320	AI texts are maybe too dry, you don't like it. Or if you think that it is not helping you with
4007280	4012080	sales process, or it only helps for a very small percentage of your potential customers,
4012880	4023760	that is fine. But I really suggest you to keep, to just pay attention to the space. Because models
4023760	4028240	and tools, these foundational models, they are improving very, very rapidly. And if something
4028240	4036240	doesn't work today, it will likely change in the near future. And it is important to pay attention
4036240	4044800	and to build processes and products that will evolve, will get better with more powerful tools
4044800	4054960	and with more powerful underlying models. And that's it for my presentation. Thank you so much.
4055920	4064720	I have my contact information here on this slide. And we have some time. If there are any questions,
4064720	4070160	happy to answer, happy to discuss, happy to maybe show more, if you're interested in something.
4072720	4079200	Dina, maybe a question to you. How do we want to manage the Q&A part?
4079200	4088320	Stepan, thank you very much. I think it should be just an open floor,
4088320	4094000	whoever wants to raise your hand or turn on your camera or write in the chat,
4094720	4101520	if you don't want to show your face. Dimash has a question. Go ahead, Dimash.
4101760	4108880	Dimash, we cannot hear you.
4112880	4114240	You can also type in chat.
4115040	4116640	Yeah, just type in chat.
4116640	4125360	Okay, anybody else?
4129600	4135680	I mean, can I ask this brief question, Stepan? How can we make this personalized AI solutions
4135680	4139840	without compromising privacy and security, maybe?
4140640	4150800	Mm-hmm. Yeah, great question. So I had this slide where I had a list of different AI models.
4150800	4158880	And the one thing about OpenAI, ChargeGPT, is that that model is private, meaning that
4160160	4165360	it belongs to OpenAI. And whatever data you send it, it will end up on their server,
4165360	4174480	so they can potentially have access to it. So when you want to build an AI system
4174480	4180240	that is 100% private, 100% working on your own computer or in your organization,
4180880	4189920	I will give you very specific recommendation. Actually, I will just open it on my computer, but
4190880	4198400	I suggest using LM Studio. So you can go to this website, LMStudio.ai. This is a completely free
4198400	4205280	application that is available for Mac, Windows, Linux. And you can download this app. And then
4205280	4213600	inside that app, you can download any of hundreds of existing free models. So this is an app that
4213680	4220400	I have installed on my computer. And these are all the models that I have downloaded, but this is
4220400	4226640	just part of them. So when I use any of these models, no data is ever leaving my computer. I can
4226640	4232640	disconnect myself from the internet, and all of this will be working. And these models, most of
4232640	4239280	them are not as good as GPT-4, but depending on your task, it can be good enough. And there's
4239280	4246480	also a question I see in the chat about models that work well with Russian language. I can just
4246480	4255920	show it here. So you can go to here. And there's a model called Saiga. And this is one of the models
4255920	4262320	that works very well with specifically Russian language. But I think GPT-4 still outperforms
4263040	4271760	in, I would say, in every language except for maybe Chinese. So GPT-4 is the best model today
4272400	4279840	that working with any other language except for Chinese, because they have a lot of their own
4279840	4286720	Russian language models in China. But GPT-4 is great for English and other languages.
4295040	4305200	Okay. Any more questions? Can I ask the question? Yes. My name is Carla. I'm not technically
4305200	4312960	aware. I'm not that in business, actually. But can you distinguish between the
4312960	4317760	chat GPT-generated music and the human-generated music? How you do that?
4319760	4324800	Yeah. Good question. I think... So first of all, chat GPT-4 does not generate music, but there's
4325360	4332800	special tools specifically. It's called sueno.ai. So if anyone wants to generate music, there's also...
4333760	4344960	I will send it in chat. It's called sueno.ai. And the problem of identifying if something was...
4344960	4358000	if music, image, or text was created by AI or a human is quite hard. It is possible to identify
4358000	4366080	if it is just, I don't know, robotic sounds music or the text is just very, very, very badly written.
4366080	4373200	But as this model becomes better, it will be, in my opinion, so there's no technical way of
4374160	4380720	100% guarantee that something was created by an AI. So as these models get better,
4381360	4389280	it becomes very almost impossible to distinguish. So this is a hard problem that I don't think anyone
4389280	4396160	has an answer to, really. And does it mean that the old composers will lose the job eventually
4396160	4404080	with this chat GPT-generation, generating music, or like the still will be some use of the human?
4404800	4415840	I'm sure humans will always do music because AI doesn't... It can do something, it can help humans,
4415840	4420880	but I don't think it can, at least at this point, can produce... It doesn't have
4423360	4430640	subjective emotional experience. So I think that's the important part. That's the
4430640	4437200	crucial part for generating art. But what is happening today, what I see a lot is people,
4437200	4446720	artists, being writers and musicians and videographers and painters, they utilize AI tools
4446720	4455040	in their work more and more. And that's great because when electric synthesizers were created,
4455040	4461520	we got, or electric guitars were created, we got a whole new genre of music. So it's the same thing.
4461520	4469600	We now get more tools to express ourselves. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
4469600	4477280	Great question. There was a follow-up question, like what professions will be last to move with AI
4477840	4487920	in the chat. There was this question. Yeah. Good question. Actually, paradoxically,
4489360	4497760	things that are not being automated are things that are relatively low-paying jobs
4498720	4509200	and physical jobs. So I don't know, a barber or a hairdresser or a plumber or
4512480	4516240	someone who works in construction. It started at seven o'clock in the morning, I didn't realize.
4516240	4520560	Let's try this one. This is an AI workshop. Yeah.
4520560	4527280	Yeah. Sorry, Jim. I put you in mute for now.
4530080	4539040	And yeah. So the jobs that are least prone to automation are those that are
4540240	4546240	low-paying because there's less economic gain from that automation and also that are
4546960	4553040	manual and requires a lot of manual work because robotics is much more expensive than
4553600	4559920	software. Building a robot costs much more than building a software application. So
4559920	4566480	office jobs like marketing or sales or finance or legal innovation in those spaces are happening
4566480	4574960	much, much faster than, for example, robotic automation of cleaners or something like this.
4577040	4584800	I see, I'll read a few questions from the chat. So there's one question about
4586000	4593520	non-English-speaking languages. So I don't know about Mongolian. I don't know Mongolian,
4593520	4600080	so I cannot test it. But I would suggest to start with charge EPT. And if you don't have an account,
4600080	4606400	go to Bing chat and it will work exactly the same way as charge EPT.
4607760	4616320	What I found is that charge EPT is really good on... So the quality of the text it produces
4616880	4624400	is proportional to how much text on that language did it see during the training period when it
4624400	4630960	was trained. And that is more or less roughly proportional to how much text in that language
4630960	4638000	exists online. So obviously languages like English, Spanish, Chinese, French, German,
4640080	4646480	they have... There's a lot of text in those languages online and therefore GPT is very good
4647440	4654000	at those languages. Languages like Mongolian are not very... There's not too much of that
4654000	4660240	data. There's not a lot of that data in the training set. But it can still be good enough.
4660240	4668160	So I think GPT-4 would be the best benchmark. It's the best way to test how good models are today.
4670720	4675520	But over time, I see there's a lot of companies, a lot of projects, a lot of open source projects that
4675520	4682720	are building localized versions of LLMs. So I showed Saiga, which is a Russian version. It's
4682800	4688480	actually not the only one. There's a few more models that are specifically trained in Russian.
4689360	4696640	There's a lot of... I know a few companies in France doing the same. So this problem is slowly
4696640	4704960	being solved. But right now English is... It's just because most of the internet is in English,
4704960	4712480	that's why AI models speak English much, much better than other languages.
4713680	4724880	So the question is, where can we find various AI websites? I'm not sure. Are you talking about
4724880	4732160	AI models? If so, then this is the link I sent to chat.
4732160	4744480	There was a question about why developers are limiting access of these models to internet.
4747440	4757520	Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see now. Yes, great question. So one of the main reasons is it's a really legal
4757520	4766400	question. So people, when ChargeGPT first released internet access, it was used, it was very widely
4766400	4773760	used for scraping data from paywall content. So for example, Wall Street Journal is a paywall
4773760	4778720	website. You cannot access it. I think you can see like three articles a month, and then you
4778720	4785520	have to pay subscription. But people were using ChargeGPT to scrape articles from Wall Street Journal
4785520	4794720	and other media. And that was just a copyright issue. So it's not really a technical question.
4794720	4802080	It is a legal question. And legal questions tend to take longer to resolve than engineering
4802080	4811040	questions, just because of how legal system works. It's slow. But there are alternatives.
4811040	4820160	So today, ChargeGPT has access to the internet. It won't give you some paywall content, but it can,
4820160	4826080	for example, read Reddit or some public data that is available.
4826400	4835360	Okay, any more questions?
4839120	4845200	So I want to reiterate that. I will, sorry.
4847040	4854160	I have a last question, personal one. If the way to train my personal GPT,
4854240	4861440	if I could upload, for example, my Facebook archive and emails, how it could help me
4862160	4865920	in general, I mean, the private assistant?
4868000	4874640	Good question. I think, I don't know. It's really, you really should test it, because it depends
4874640	4880480	on what's in there and what data. And it's also like when you're uploading data to GPT,
4881440	4886720	you need to keep in mind that this data is being stored on their servers. So
4888160	4894080	maybe not, maybe not upload something very, very private information in there,
4894960	4898720	like Gmail, it can have, I don't know, financial information, something like this.
4899280	4909600	But the use cases for personal assistance is that you can use previous history of your communication
4910560	4917120	to generate answers to maybe incoming communication messages. So if you have history of all your
4917120	4924240	emails that you sent and you receive a similar email with a similar question, GPT will be very good
4924240	4931760	at producing a new response or writing a new draft, email draft in a style and with the content
4931760	4937920	that's very similar to what you sent in the past. GPT is one way to do it, maybe more technically
4937920	4944320	advanced way to do this would be through fine tuning, but that requires a lot of technical
4944320	4955520	expertise. So yeah, so this assistant can be a way of automating your own communication
4955520	4964160	and helping you with producing email drafts or responses or maybe messenger responses,
4965120	4972480	something like this. And it should also know my personality well if I upload the social media.
4973200	4979840	This is what you, right? Yeah, this is what you have to explain and define in the instructions.
4979840	4983200	So in GPT, when you create GPT, you have this instruction
4985360	4990720	box for instructions and you cannot, it cannot learn your personality based on
4990720	4997840	uploaded information, you need to explicitly type it and say like you need to answer in a
4997840	5004560	friendly tone, use maybe these words, don't use these words, use like this kind of language
5004560	5011200	presentation and so on. And then it will follow those instructions in order to actually
5011440	5019920	take the tone of voice and teach GPT to reply in your tone of voice. For that, you have to do
5019920	5032640	fine tuning. It's possible with GPT, but it requires more technical expertise. Probably need to find
5033280	5035920	an engineer to help with that.
5044080	5054880	All right. Yeah, so I see no more questions, but I will send recording and presentation to Dina,
5054880	5062160	so you will get it soon. All the links, everything I've shown in the today are in the
5062160	5068560	presentation. There's actually a bit more that I, a bit more slides, I skipped some of them.
5069760	5076960	So, so yeah, I hope, I hope, I hope this is valuable. I hope this is useful and I hope that
5077600	5085280	my sincere recommendation is to like just spend more time working with the systems and working
5085280	5095040	with GPT, with AI, because the most important thing is to build intuition. That's what most useful.
5097760	5103920	Thank you very much, Dipan. I think that was quite a comprehensive presentation, especially
5104000	5108240	for the first slide, being an intro. Tamuna, you want to say something?
5109840	5115680	I just wanted to say thank you. It was really one of the most useful and practical AI sessions
5115680	5122560	I attended, and I attended several, so thank you. It was really good. Thank you very much.
