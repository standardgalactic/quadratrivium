WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
Thank you, Dina. And hello, everyone. Excited and very happy to be here.

00:07.840 --> 00:13.120
So today, we're going to spend about one and a half hours talking about

00:13.120 --> 00:19.600
generative AI and recent trends in artificial intelligence. Let me share my presentation.

00:21.760 --> 00:27.920
So I will skip my introduction because Dina did a great intro.

00:28.320 --> 00:34.720
But if you want to maybe get in touch with me, I will send the presentation afterwards.

00:34.720 --> 00:46.160
And it has my Twitter and Telegram account. So a bit of logistical logistics. So the session

00:46.160 --> 00:54.240
is being recorded. I will have a lot of links, useful links and materials and examples in the

00:54.240 --> 01:01.920
slides. And those are for you to access after the workshop. I hope it will be useful. And

01:01.920 --> 01:07.360
there will be a lot of links that I will not even have time to cover. So I hope that these

01:07.360 --> 01:14.000
materials will be useful. The lecture or the workshop itself will take about one hour.

01:14.560 --> 01:21.520
And then we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A. But it's Saturday, so I'm happy to maybe stay

01:21.520 --> 01:29.520
a little bit longer if there are more questions. And the plan for today is for us to talk a little

01:29.520 --> 01:35.280
bit about what is artificial intelligence? How is it changing recently? And how it does it impact

01:35.280 --> 01:42.720
the economics and different industries? Then we will talk about two very specific areas of

01:42.720 --> 01:50.720
application of artificial intelligence, which is personal. Sorry, I will unmute people for

01:52.720 --> 02:00.160
time being. We'll talk about how artificial intelligence can help you in your personal

02:00.160 --> 02:10.000
life, in your business, in your maybe arts, in different areas of life. And then how AI can

02:10.000 --> 02:16.640
help your business. And I will show a lot of practical tools. So the goal and the structure

02:16.640 --> 02:24.880
of today's workshop is to give a presentation, but most importantly is to show specific use cases,

02:24.880 --> 02:31.040
how this can be used in practice, because there's a lot of theoretical videos or podcasts or

02:31.040 --> 02:39.120
articles online. And I'm not here to re-shuffle and repeat what you can already find. I'm here to

02:39.120 --> 02:46.640
actually show some practical application and some use cases that I hope will be useful.

02:47.840 --> 02:55.760
And with that being said, we can start. So let's talk about why artificial intelligence

02:55.760 --> 03:01.920
is important and why everybody is talking about AI right now or at least for the last year since

03:01.920 --> 03:12.000
Georgia BT came out. In fact, artificial intelligence is quite old and quite old concept

03:12.000 --> 03:19.520
and technology. It has been around for at least as long as digital computing has been around.

03:19.520 --> 03:26.080
The first paper that mentioned the idea of building computation networks inspired by how

03:26.080 --> 03:33.280
biological systems work, specifically how human brain works was published in 1943. So it's been

03:35.120 --> 03:43.120
80 years of development in artificial intelligence. And the most important, the first seminal paper

03:43.120 --> 03:48.960
that you probably heard about was published in 1950 by Alan Turing where he proposed this idea

03:48.960 --> 03:54.080
of thinking machines. And this is actually the paper where the concept of Turing test comes from.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.880
And over these 80 years, there's been a lot of ups and downs. There have been a lot of

03:58.880 --> 04:06.000
development, a lot of hopes, a lot of actually things that are now called AI winters, which were

04:06.000 --> 04:12.800
periods, prolonged periods for decades where people thought that there can be no progress made.

04:12.800 --> 04:20.000
And then it changed from this AI winter to period of a lot of hope and inspiration and

04:20.000 --> 04:25.840
new technological development. And right now we're witnessing one of those periods. And it

04:25.840 --> 04:30.160
seems like it's the biggest one since the invention of the concept of artificial intelligence.

04:30.800 --> 04:37.200
But actually, the whole idea of thinking machines or building something that is built by human but

04:37.200 --> 04:47.360
not, but has ability to think and complete tasks, it comes even from prehistoric times.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.960
For example, I found this quote, and you probably heard this concept of Golem,

04:50.960 --> 04:58.720
which is this machine made of clay that people can build and then it would help with different

04:58.720 --> 05:11.600
tasks. So I found one of mentions from some source from year 500. And I actually did a quick

05:11.600 --> 05:17.680
experiment. I asked chat GPT and Google Bart, which is one of the chatbots developed by Google,

05:18.240 --> 05:23.120
what do they think? Are they golems? And this is what I got. This is the response that I got from

05:23.760 --> 05:28.400
Google Bart. It says that in some sense, it is possible to view me as a golem. This is the

05:28.400 --> 05:33.920
response that Google artificial intelligence is giving. And it is actually giving a comparison

05:34.880 --> 05:44.880
between Bart and Golem and different areas. Can it learn? Can it grow? It actually outperforms

05:44.880 --> 05:53.040
this concept of mystical, magical creature of a Golem. And I have links to both chat GPT and Bart

05:53.040 --> 05:57.600
here if you want to ask them the same question or maybe continue that conversation.

05:57.600 --> 06:06.560
But today, artificial intelligence is a very practical thing. And it is being used across

06:06.560 --> 06:14.400
all different areas of economy. And the first important thing to understand about AI is that

06:14.400 --> 06:20.160
AI is GPT. GPT stands for general purpose technology, which means that artificial

06:20.160 --> 06:26.080
intelligence is one of those technologies similar to maybe steam engine or electricity,

06:26.480 --> 06:32.240
or internet, which powers all different areas of economics and all different areas of society.

06:32.240 --> 06:36.240
And there are a lot of applications in healthcare, in education, in business,

06:36.240 --> 06:41.840
in manufacturing, in any industry, you name it, arts, culture, and so on.

06:43.360 --> 06:49.360
And because artificial intelligence has been around, there are a lot of different branches

06:49.360 --> 06:56.240
and flavors of AI. And what most people are talking about today, which is GPT,

06:56.240 --> 07:02.480
chatbots, large language models, is relatively new. This area has been created maybe four or

07:02.480 --> 07:10.720
five years ago. It started in 2017 with the paper called, Attention is All You Need,

07:10.720 --> 07:16.720
but real products are actually being developed just for the past three or four years. And

07:16.720 --> 07:22.240
generative AI is relatively small. So for example, the other areas of artificial intelligence,

07:23.200 --> 07:28.880
something like supervised learning or reinforcement learning is used in very practical

07:28.880 --> 07:33.920
applications as well. For example, in digital advertising, Google and Facebook and Twitter,

07:33.920 --> 07:40.880
all their advertisement recommendation system works using AI or self-driving cars or maybe

07:40.960 --> 07:48.240
trading systems. So today, we're not going to talk about all of different applications of the AI

07:48.240 --> 07:55.920
because it takes a whole university course to study that. We're going to focus on actually

07:55.920 --> 08:02.240
generative AI, at least most recent and the fastest growing areas and branch of artificial

08:02.240 --> 08:09.680
intelligence. And generative AI is all these different products and technologies that you hear

08:10.480 --> 08:19.520
when you hear about chatbots, large language models. One of the most popular examples is

08:19.520 --> 08:26.000
chat GPT. There's also a lot of different chatbots, one by Facebook called Lama, one by Google,

08:26.000 --> 08:33.360
called Bart, one by Entropic, and then there's a few hundreds of products like this.

08:34.320 --> 08:39.040
In addition to large language models, there are also diffusion models, which are

08:39.920 --> 08:46.880
tools that allow us to, so large language models, how they work, they are creating text.

08:46.880 --> 08:53.440
You ask them question or you give them prompt and they generate text. So they're really the

08:53.440 --> 09:00.400
principle of how they work is very simple. They just generate a next word in the sentence. And

09:01.280 --> 09:07.600
because they're so complex and so smart and they use so much data when they've been trained,

09:08.400 --> 09:13.360
when they have been trained, in order to generate the next word in the sentence,

09:13.360 --> 09:22.320
they had to learn the whole world model. So if you ask chat GPT who is like, I don't know,

09:23.920 --> 09:30.080
46 president of the United States of America, it will give you the correct answer.

09:30.080 --> 09:34.640
But to give that answer, in order to give that answer, it had to learn a lot of things. What

09:34.640 --> 09:39.200
is US? What is the president? What is politics? What is election cycle? And it knows all these

09:39.200 --> 09:44.720
concepts and those concepts are stored inside the model. And this is why it seems to be so smart

09:44.720 --> 09:49.920
and this is actually, and this is why it is actually useful in a lot of business and personal

09:49.920 --> 09:58.560
tasks. Diffusion models are models that are able to generate pictures and video. And one of the

09:58.560 --> 10:06.720
most popular examples of such products is mid-journey and also Dali tool or stable diffusion.

10:06.720 --> 10:13.360
Also a lot of products, all applications in app store or internet that can create you AI photo

10:13.360 --> 10:21.600
or AI stylization, most of them, they use this concept of diffusion. They're based on

10:21.600 --> 10:27.120
diffusion neural networks and diffusion models. But also in addition to language models and

10:27.120 --> 10:32.880
diffusion models, there's a lot of smaller but no less important applications such as speech

10:32.880 --> 10:41.600
recognition, voice synthesis, music generation, creation of 3D art or 3D objects for video games,

10:42.160 --> 10:47.440
and many more, including very, very, very narrow and very specific ones like

10:48.320 --> 10:59.840
generation of proteins for pharma companies or designing chips for computer chip manufacturing

10:59.840 --> 11:11.680
companies. So how is, I want to talk about economics of AI. So I will be using a few

11:11.920 --> 11:22.720
cited and popular and well done research papers to show just some of the statistics.

11:23.280 --> 11:30.240
So this one is a report created by McKinsey, published about four months ago. And what they

11:30.960 --> 11:39.200
came up with in that report is that generative AI could deliver a total value of 4.4 trillion dollars

11:40.160 --> 11:48.080
in economics from new use cases. So these are only new use cases that are being unlocked

11:48.080 --> 11:53.680
by this new technology. But also in addition to that, there's also eight trillion dollars annually.

11:53.680 --> 11:59.440
So we are talking about annual GDP growth that can be gained through productivity increase

11:59.440 --> 12:05.680
by workers that they use AI or businesses that they use AI in their existing tasks. And on the

12:05.680 --> 12:15.200
right, there are, this graph shows impact in terms of billions of dollars in different areas

12:15.200 --> 12:20.800
of business. So you can, as you can see, sales, marketing, software engineering, customer operations,

12:20.800 --> 12:27.920
products are areas that will benefit the most from implementation and use and leverage of

12:27.920 --> 12:35.280
artificial intelligence, but also all these other areas like legal or HR or procurement or finance,

12:35.280 --> 12:41.360
there's also quite a few of very practical applications and I will cover some of those later.

12:44.320 --> 12:52.720
And from the same report and another interesting piece of statistics, what they came up with

12:52.720 --> 12:59.360
is that current generative AI technologies have potential to automate work activities that absorb

12:59.360 --> 13:05.040
60 to 80 percent of employees' time today. It doesn't apply to all existing occupations and

13:05.040 --> 13:12.400
professions, but for highly qualified office workers, this can be a huge time saving. And

13:12.400 --> 13:17.680
this is, this stats is based just on existing level of technology. It doesn't take into account

13:17.680 --> 13:23.040
that in the future, the technology will evolve. And we are seeing that the growth, the speed of

13:23.040 --> 13:31.840
growth and speed of development of AI is staggering. It's huge. Another report, and I also have a link

13:31.840 --> 13:40.080
down here below, from University of Pennsylvania, it shows that 80 percent of U.S. workforce will

13:40.080 --> 13:45.840
have at least 10 percent of their daily tasks exposed or automated by large language models.

13:46.400 --> 13:52.560
And this does not only apply to the United States, this generally applies to any work

13:52.560 --> 14:01.840
that is characteristic to developed economy, which is service and office workers. So that means that

14:01.840 --> 14:08.000
most of the economy, most of the developed economy will have at least some, at least 10 percent

14:08.720 --> 14:14.720
of exposure to large language models and that will lead to automation and economic boost,

14:14.720 --> 14:21.920
boosting economic productivity. Another report by Gartner where they say that 30 percent of

14:21.920 --> 14:28.880
outbound tasks, marketing messages will be generated by large language models, will be

14:28.880 --> 14:35.280
genetically, synthetically generated. And this is their prediction for year 2045. So basically

14:35.280 --> 14:40.000
just one year from now. And this is, this is a huge increase if we're talking about marketing

14:40.720 --> 14:48.480
industry globally. So why do we see these huge numbers? And these reports, these are not some

14:48.480 --> 14:55.920
sci-fi movies. These are very trusted, established and, and, and, and, and reputable organizations

14:55.920 --> 15:02.560
that are giving these very bold predictions. The reason for that is that generative AI is

15:02.560 --> 15:11.120
both intuitive to use and it is broad. What I mean by that, generative AI is very simple to use

15:11.120 --> 15:17.600
because you generally just need to learn linguistic interface, which is common, which is nature for

15:17.680 --> 15:24.080
us. Like we humans, by the age of two or three or four years old, we are pretty comfortable with

15:24.080 --> 15:30.240
linguistic interface. We learn to talk to our parents or our friends. And this is all you need

15:30.240 --> 15:35.760
to really start using tools like ChargeGPT. You can, even if you don't know how to type, if you

15:35.760 --> 15:42.080
don't know how to write, you can still do it because if you download ChargeGPT on your iPhone,

15:42.080 --> 15:48.400
you can just talk to it. It will reply you. And that's pretty much instantly useful and helpful to

15:49.040 --> 15:57.520
most of global population. But also in addition to ease of use, it is very broadly applicable.

15:57.520 --> 16:03.840
It can augment pretty much every cognitive task. And I will go into details. I will show examples

16:03.840 --> 16:09.280
of some of the, some of those tasks. It can also power embodiment in robotics so it can help

16:09.360 --> 16:15.680
a lot of automation and help growth of robotic systems so it can help robots to navigate

16:15.680 --> 16:23.600
environments or complete complex tasks. And at the end of the day, the use case and the outcome

16:23.600 --> 16:29.840
of the growth of artificial intelligence is the global explosion of intelligence on the planet.

16:29.840 --> 16:37.360
So this is maybe a little bit exaggerated picture, but it shows the idea that I'm trying to

16:37.360 --> 16:44.720
be here. So this is, the green line is the amount of human intelligence on Earth and maybe from

16:44.720 --> 16:50.480
prehistoric times to our days, it's been growing gradually. But then with the advent and with

16:51.360 --> 16:57.680
mass introduction of artificial intelligence, the total amount of intelligence on the Earth

16:57.680 --> 17:03.840
is exploding rapidly. It doesn't mean that these AI tools will replace humans or they will do exactly

17:03.840 --> 17:11.600
the same thing as humans do. I think the better way to think about it is as an augmentation or

17:11.600 --> 17:18.720
insistence to what we do. But because we have ability to leverage this vast amount of intelligence,

17:18.720 --> 17:25.040
we humans can achieve much, much more. We are spending less time and less energy. And that's

17:25.040 --> 17:33.040
great. So I, because we are relatively short on time, I will not go into details of inner

17:33.040 --> 17:41.840
workings of large language models and generative AI. I won't go, I will not go into technical

17:41.840 --> 17:50.800
details, but I recommend this video. This is a video by Andrew Carpati, who is research lead

17:50.800 --> 17:56.640
at OpenAI in the company that created ChatGPT. And this video is not very technical. I recommend you

17:56.640 --> 18:04.080
to, if you have one hour, maybe in the evening or at some point, to watch this video. The link is

18:04.080 --> 18:09.680
in the slide. And this video goes into exactly how the system work without too much technical detail,

18:09.680 --> 18:15.920
but it gives better idea. And it comes from one of the person responsible for actually

18:15.920 --> 18:22.320
development of this technology, who is much more knowledgeable and reputable in the space than I

18:22.320 --> 18:27.280
am, for example. And he's also a great speaker. So really, really enjoyable video.

18:29.520 --> 18:37.840
So yeah, we will not watch it right now, but let's go into specific AI use cases. So we'll start

18:37.840 --> 18:45.440
with application of artificial intelligence for personal life. There's a lot of very, I would say

18:45.440 --> 18:52.160
common and basic and maybe even boring stuff that you can do with tools like ChatGPT.

18:52.960 --> 18:59.200
You can ask it to help craft a letter. You can ask it to check spelling. You can learn new languages

18:59.200 --> 19:04.880
with it. You can translate the text. You can check your code. If you're a software engineer for

19:04.880 --> 19:11.200
bugs, you can ask it to write new code. You can even learn new programming languages with it. You

19:11.200 --> 19:20.560
can do any kind of text and language related tasks with tools like ChatGPT. But I thought that for

19:20.560 --> 19:26.000
today presentation, that would be boring if I would just show like, okay, now you can translate

19:26.000 --> 19:32.000
a letter into Chinese. Great, but this is not very exciting. Translation was possible before.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.880
So today, we're not going to talk about this basic and simple stuff. Today, we're going to talk about

19:38.880 --> 19:47.120
something maybe one level deeper or layer higher. Depends on how you want to put it.

19:48.560 --> 19:56.560
And I want to start with this notion of learning partner. So for me, for my personal use case,

19:56.560 --> 20:05.840
in my personal life, what I use large language models daily for is to learn new information

20:05.920 --> 20:14.480
and to digest and to understand new complex stuff. So I want to, you can use ChatGPT or other tools,

20:14.480 --> 20:20.880
and I will show different tools just to, again, to prove my point about the breasts and

20:22.640 --> 20:28.000
number of different tools that exist. You can use GPT or similar LLMs as a learning partner. You

20:28.000 --> 20:33.520
can ask it to explain complex information to you. You can ask it to be your tutor. You can even ask

20:33.520 --> 20:41.840
it to create tests for you to learn and remember and verify yourself. You can ask GPT to engage in

20:41.840 --> 20:48.800
Socratic dialogue with you. You can ask it to transcribe video or podcast. GPT directly cannot

20:48.800 --> 20:54.720
do it, but there are free services that allow to transcribe and then answer questions based on

20:55.440 --> 21:00.800
existing videos or existing podcasts. So for this first example, I want to show

21:01.440 --> 21:08.240
another chatbot, which is not ChatGPT. Maybe it's a little bit less known, but it is called Clot AI.

21:09.920 --> 21:17.440
It is free to use. So you can go to clot.ai, create an account. It might not work in some countries,

21:17.440 --> 21:25.440
but it definitely works in UK and US. So if it doesn't work for you, you probably, the solution

21:25.440 --> 21:35.440
here is to download VPN, choose either UK or US location, create an account, and then you don't

21:35.440 --> 21:40.000
need it. So you just need VPN once to create an account and it will work for you and it will be

21:40.560 --> 21:48.960
and it's completely free to use. So I will show one example, how I use Clot to work. So I have

21:49.280 --> 21:55.920
to learn information. So I have a white paper. This is Bitcoin white paper. It goes into details

21:55.920 --> 22:03.520
about how Bitcoin cryptocurrency network works. It is relatively technical. So what I would do,

22:03.520 --> 22:10.480
if I want to learn about how Bitcoin works, but maybe let's say I'm not a technical person,

22:10.480 --> 22:16.080
I don't understand too many things about cryptography, I would just upload a PDF here and

22:16.080 --> 22:22.000
it could be any kind of scientific paper. And I will ask a question. And the question, my question

22:22.000 --> 22:29.760
would be explain this paper as if I'm seven years old. So I will just ask Claude Chatbot to explain

22:29.760 --> 22:36.720
the complex paper for me in simple terms. And as you can see, it already starts giving me answers

22:36.720 --> 22:43.920
answer. And if you read it, I won't read the whole thing, but if you read it, you can see that it's

22:43.920 --> 22:51.120
really, really simple. Like I have a kid who is about that age, and I'm sure he will understand.

22:51.120 --> 22:58.560
So it just goes, sending money online is tricky, because you don't want one person spent the same

22:58.560 --> 23:07.120
amount of money twice. And this is how Bitcoin helps it. And yeah, it's just a simple way of

23:07.120 --> 23:16.480
explaining. I can also ask a follow up question, how new Bitcoins are created. So I can just chat

23:16.480 --> 23:26.320
with this article. And it will continue generating these answers in this very simple term. So it

23:26.320 --> 23:33.680
doesn't go into deep cryptography, it just calls it math puzzle. And that's easy to understand.

23:33.680 --> 23:41.680
So that's just one example and one application. And I have link, Claude here on this slide.

23:44.160 --> 23:53.040
Another example is to use large language models as your second brain, as a way to remember and

23:53.040 --> 24:01.600
way to reference complex information. So you can record a lot of things today with even free online

24:01.600 --> 24:07.520
tools, such as calls, for example, this call is being recorded, and Zoom is actually doing live

24:08.800 --> 24:17.200
transcribing of what I'm saying. You can record documents, download documents. You can download

24:17.200 --> 24:24.400
web pages. And then you can use one of these tools. And actually, each one of them is free to use,

24:24.400 --> 24:30.240
at least up to a certain point. This first one is open source and it's free to use forever. So

24:31.120 --> 24:38.240
if you want a free solution, I recommend this one. This last one is unreadable, is the one that I'm

24:38.240 --> 24:46.160
going to show right now. And it is more focused on students and the way to prepare, for example.

24:46.880 --> 24:54.640
And the way that second brain works is I just go to this website, I create a free account,

24:54.640 --> 25:01.600
and then I kind of upload some information, some documents here, and talk to those documents.

25:01.600 --> 25:09.040
So I'm just uploading a presentation, this presentation that I'm just showing. And I

25:09.040 --> 25:14.800
upload this presentation here. And the difference between the example that I just showed before

25:14.800 --> 25:22.400
with chatting with the paper, and this one is that here you can upload a lot of information.

25:22.400 --> 25:27.840
You can upload the whole book, or maybe multiple books. And then this information is stored,

25:27.840 --> 25:34.720
and you can use the same technique, you can just ask questions. So for example, I will ask,

25:36.800 --> 25:43.760
it actually prepares some questions that I can ask, but I will ask, what are AI use cases in

25:43.760 --> 25:51.600
marketing? And based on this presentation, it will give me answers. Personalized marketing,

25:51.600 --> 25:57.760
empathetic communication. And if we scroll to the slide that is still coming, so a little bit of

26:00.240 --> 26:07.040
unveil here. So this slide is AI marketing. And as you can see, it has actually found the

26:07.040 --> 26:13.760
right slide. And it gives me information, not based on what chat GPT knows about marketing,

26:13.760 --> 26:19.600
but based on this exact presentation. And if I were to upload a book here, I can just ask questions

26:20.160 --> 26:25.120
to the book, and it will give answers based on relevant information that it finds in that book.

26:25.120 --> 26:30.080
And that's very useful. This is also one of the applications that I'm using more or less daily

26:30.720 --> 26:42.480
for various use cases. Another very, very powerful application is to use GPT or any other

26:43.280 --> 26:48.640
large language model to be your thinking partner or brainstorm partner.

26:50.080 --> 26:57.520
Because GPT on its own might not completely and full autonomously solve any of the problems that

26:57.520 --> 27:05.440
you have, but it is great when you want to have someone to basically think with or discuss or

27:05.440 --> 27:14.080
brainstorm ideas, please. And I will show example of me creating a prompt. So this is the prompt

27:14.080 --> 27:24.320
that I did. I'm saying that I'm running webinars and lectures on how to use AI for work. And I'm

27:24.320 --> 27:31.120
asking chat GPT to use these six thinking hats methodology, which is just brainstorming methodology

27:31.840 --> 27:38.240
to help me generate ideas. And this is the response that I get from chat GPT. And this is

27:38.240 --> 27:43.920
actually very useful. Again, I'm not going to read everything here, but this link is public.

27:43.920 --> 27:50.960
And the value here is that it might not give me exact answer that I'm looking for, but it will

27:50.960 --> 27:57.280
give me suggestions that will spark some imagination creativity that will help me to actually

27:58.080 --> 28:03.760
come up with more creative answers. And this is also something that I'm using pretty much every

28:03.760 --> 28:12.720
day for different questions and problems and issues that I'm facing. You can use different

28:12.720 --> 28:18.320
methodology. So six thinking hats is completely optional. You can just go to chat GPT and type,

28:19.040 --> 28:26.000
help me brainstorm ideas for present, for marketing campaign, for help me write

28:29.760 --> 28:38.160
ideas for an article that I'm writing. And it will give you some ideas. And then you can ask

28:38.160 --> 28:44.240
to elaborate and basically continue that conversation to get more valuable results.

28:44.960 --> 28:53.520
One important thing here to note is that if you want to steer how chat GPT gives you answer,

28:53.520 --> 29:05.440
if you have GPT account, I suggest to setting up custom instructions. So if we go to chat GPT,

29:05.440 --> 29:12.880
you can, so first of all, if you don't have, I highly recommend to create an account

29:12.880 --> 29:20.240
in chat GPT, the product itself is free, but you can also subscribe and get a plus subscription,

29:20.240 --> 29:26.320
which gives you access to a more powerful model. But then when I'm talking to chat GPT,

29:26.320 --> 29:32.160
instead of getting generic answers, it is very useful to use this thing called custom instructions.

29:32.160 --> 29:38.320
So if you click on your profile, go to custom instructions, and you can add some information

29:38.320 --> 29:45.440
here. So I will share the custom instructions that I'm using on this slide. You can change it

29:46.000 --> 29:52.560
whatever way you want. But the value of this is you can steer how the answers are being generated.

29:52.560 --> 29:58.080
For example, for me, the important thing is for it to respond concisely and be blunt,

29:58.080 --> 30:08.240
because it usually likes to go into this very long and maybe descriptions of a lot of things.

30:08.240 --> 30:15.280
And you can read through this. In my experience, adding these custom instructions really increases

30:15.280 --> 30:20.640
the quality of response and increases the value that I'm getting from using chat GPT

30:21.600 --> 30:27.360
almost two times. So highly, highly recommend using it. And you can copy this from the slide

30:27.360 --> 30:39.200
and use in your own GPT. Next use case is communication. So I already mentioned that

30:39.200 --> 30:47.520
GPT is great for writing any kind of emails, posts, or translating information. But it is also,

30:47.520 --> 30:55.600
you can also ask GPT to write in a specific style. And one thing that I personally found very,

30:55.600 --> 31:04.560
very exciting and very useful is to use GPT to visualize conversation. So this small screenshot

31:04.560 --> 31:09.200
on the right is a small application that developed. So this is not part of chat GPT. It's not

31:09.200 --> 31:16.160
something you get when you sign up. But this is just like a product, that's very, very small

31:16.160 --> 31:22.560
product that I built to showcase what's possible. And I'm sure there will be or there probably are

31:22.560 --> 31:29.120
already similar products that you can find online. Maybe some of them are paid, but I think the value

31:29.120 --> 31:39.840
is very clear. So on the screenshot, what's happening is I'm using data from my Telegram

31:39.840 --> 31:45.920
group channel. And you can use it for Slack or Discord or email threads with a lot of people.

31:46.800 --> 31:54.800
And then in the screenshots, every square is a person and that's their name. Every star is a

31:54.800 --> 32:02.480
topic that is being discussed. And every line is a specific message regarding that topic coming

32:02.480 --> 32:07.360
from a specific user. So if I have a group channel in Telegram with maybe 100 people,

32:07.360 --> 32:13.280
and I didn't open it for a month, and there's thousands of messages, it would take me hours

32:13.280 --> 32:21.200
to read through that. But using something like this, using large language models to summarize

32:21.200 --> 32:27.920
and then visualize data will help me to understand what's being discussed in that group. And I can

32:27.920 --> 32:35.760
just skim and scan this image, spend five minutes, and I'm already up to date. And if I find something

32:35.760 --> 32:41.840
that is useful or interesting for me, I can click on this line and it will open the specific message.

32:41.840 --> 32:47.040
So this is one of the use cases that I kind of over many months I developed for myself. And this

32:47.040 --> 32:52.320
really saves hours because I have a lot of different communication channels, a lot of social media

32:53.280 --> 32:59.440
kind of comments, and it takes time, takes too much time if I try to read all of those.

32:59.440 --> 33:07.760
I just don't have time to do anything else. I will show another example is related to

33:07.760 --> 33:15.520
visualization. So one of the problems, one of the drawbacks of GPT and large language models that

33:15.520 --> 33:22.160
you will probably identify and realize very quickly when you start using it is that they're

33:22.160 --> 33:30.320
pretty bad at analytical and math tasks. So LLMs cannot really compute or count complex

33:31.040 --> 33:38.560
mathematical questions or problems. But what they can do, they can write code. And when they write

33:38.560 --> 33:44.880
and then execute computer code, this code is always giving you correct result because computer is

33:44.880 --> 33:50.080
basically just a, it is a computer, it computes. So whatever code you put, you always get the

33:50.080 --> 33:57.120
correct mathematical results. So if I ask GPT to solve me maybe like an integral, it will

33:57.120 --> 34:02.000
most likely fail. But if I ask it to write a computer program that solves the same problem,

34:02.560 --> 34:09.680
it will be, it will be correct. And solving integral may be not very useful or relevant for most of,

34:10.720 --> 34:17.840
most of you or at least I don't do it daily. But I find this feature very, very useful when it

34:17.840 --> 34:25.280
comes to data analysis. And I want to show an example. I have a spreadsheet, which is a sales

34:25.280 --> 34:33.760
data related to motorcycles and cars. And it goes into, there's a lot of, there's a lot of

34:33.760 --> 34:42.160
data. There's like sales number, customer name, address and country and all of that.

34:42.720 --> 34:52.160
So what if I want to create some kind of, what if I want to get insights from this data?

34:52.160 --> 34:59.760
For example, I can upload this file. I just upload this file to chat GPT. And I ask it,

34:59.760 --> 35:05.920
draw me a histogram showing where the goods are shipped, the city and also use different colors

35:05.920 --> 35:11.920
for different types of goods. And this is what I get. So it takes me, it really literally took me

35:12.560 --> 35:20.560
30 seconds to wait until GPT completes it and gives me this picture. And this is actually,

35:20.560 --> 35:26.000
I can also see the code that it wrote. So this is actually what it did. And this is a Python code

35:26.000 --> 35:34.080
that analyzes the spreadsheet, takes specific data from it and draw draws a histogram. And if you

35:34.080 --> 35:40.880
if you look closely, it is, it is, it is doing exactly what I asked. So it has city name like

35:40.880 --> 35:50.480
Leo, New York city and so on. And it shows motorcycles in light green cars in dark green.

35:50.480 --> 35:56.720
And I can actually keep going. I can ask, follow up questions. So for example,

35:58.160 --> 36:09.360
I can ask it like, what was the average price for all of the goods? And it will do the same. It

36:09.360 --> 36:17.360
will, it will also, we can actually see how, how it's writing code. It will, it will make mistakes.

36:17.360 --> 36:23.840
It will write, it will do bugs, but then eventually it will correct itself. And this is the final

36:23.840 --> 36:28.800
result that I get. I mean, this is maybe a simple question. I can just do it in Excel, but I can

36:28.800 --> 36:34.800
ask it to do much more complex stuff. I can ask it to work on large files to do complex analysis.

36:34.800 --> 36:43.920
And the goal of this example is to show that whatever tasks that usually you have to hire a

36:43.920 --> 36:49.360
data analyst or ask a software engineer to do for you, now you can do just with

36:50.000 --> 36:55.040
charge EPT, you can just talk to it and ask it to complete this and you will get results. And this

36:55.040 --> 37:00.080
is very, very useful. Really, it saves thousands of dollars sometimes because,

37:00.960 --> 37:07.280
because data scientists are not, are not cheap and GPT costs 20 bucks a month.

37:10.480 --> 37:22.240
Okay. Moving, moving next. Another useful feature of GPT is that it can read and analyze

37:22.240 --> 37:29.760
visual data. And this example that I'm showing here on the right is I basically took a photo

37:29.760 --> 37:36.480
with my iPhone of the drawing that I made on my whiteboard here on the, on the, on the wall.

37:36.480 --> 37:43.840
So I just, I took a pencil, I draw something on, on, on the whiteboard. And then I asked GPT,

37:43.840 --> 37:48.800
please use this diagram and write me a structure outline for the presentation. So this is what I

37:48.800 --> 37:55.520
had just thinking on, on, on, with, with my pencil on the whiteboard. And this is what I, sorry.

37:56.240 --> 38:03.520
And this is what I got. So you can draw pictures, you can make photos, you can ask GPT to identify

38:03.520 --> 38:09.440
objects on the photo, you can ask GPT to translate some text that, that, that is on the photo,

38:09.440 --> 38:16.800
you can ask charge EPT to maybe extract information from the picture. And that's the value of

38:16.800 --> 38:23.200
visual vision models that are, these vision models are only available in the paid version

38:23.200 --> 38:30.320
of charge EPT, but if, but it's, it's really worth it. And there's also a free alternative,

38:30.320 --> 38:39.120
I will show it later. Another use case is browsing, browsing the web. And I want to recommend a few

38:39.120 --> 38:43.920
tools here, because one of the problems with another problem with large language models,

38:43.920 --> 38:48.880
in addition to them not being very good at math, is that they,

38:48.960 --> 38:55.360
by default, they don't have access to most recent information and news. So they don't have access

38:55.360 --> 39:03.760
to internet by default. But we can ask either charge EPT to use this web browsing. So I can ask, like,

39:03.760 --> 39:13.600
find me most recent news on AI on the web, and it will go and, and it will go and, it will go and

39:13.680 --> 39:29.680
do a Google or Bing search. Sometimes it's being slow. We'll come back to that. But there's also a

39:30.400 --> 39:40.400
specific and very specialized products that are free to use that allow to add this capability of

39:40.400 --> 39:45.520
browsing the internet and getting data from the internet to large language models.

39:45.520 --> 39:51.680
Two that I want to highlight specifically are Perplexity. Perplexity is really Google but better.

39:51.680 --> 39:57.200
It allows you to, when you're searching for something, it allows you, instead of getting a list

39:57.200 --> 40:08.480
of links, like you do on Google, it allows you to do a, to get a actual response. So for example,

40:08.560 --> 40:16.400
there's a news about new solar system in Milky Way. If I press this, I, I just get an answer

40:17.200 --> 40:22.800
saying that astronomers have, have discovered a new rare solar system in Milky Way and it goes on.

40:22.800 --> 40:29.600
But this data, it's not just generated by LLM. This is not hallucination. It comes from, from,

40:29.600 --> 40:34.720
from specific source. So I can read this. This is an answer for my question. Or I can go to the

40:34.720 --> 40:39.920
source website. And this is associated press article on the same topic. And I can, I can read

40:39.920 --> 40:46.480
the source. And I'm using Perplexity for a lot of things. Really, it is just in, every time when

40:46.480 --> 40:51.120
I want to get an answer, if I'm not looking for a website, but for an answer for the question,

40:51.120 --> 40:58.160
Perplexity works better than Google. For me, almost 100% of times. And it's free. And it has no

40:58.160 --> 41:04.640
ads at least right now, maybe in the future. It also has a paid version that has more features

41:04.640 --> 41:13.040
to it. But really, this is one of the, one of the best use cases and products built

41:14.400 --> 41:21.040
using artificial intelligence. By the way, GPT also finished. So as you can see, when I asked it

41:21.040 --> 41:30.000
to find more recent news on AI, what it did is it looked for, it did a Bing search. And it found

41:30.000 --> 41:38.480
these articles. So again, this information is not something that GPT hallucinated. It is actually

41:38.480 --> 41:48.960
coming from the source. It is coming from this generative AI tech branch section. So if you feel

41:48.960 --> 41:56.480
like your chatbot is not using most recent information, I recommend using Perplexity,

41:56.480 --> 42:05.520
web access for, for, for chat GPT or also Bing search. By the way, Bing has a free version of

42:05.520 --> 42:11.680
GPT for. So if you don't have chat GPT, for some reason, you can use Bing, which is free

42:13.520 --> 42:19.280
alternative or actually a free UI free version of charge GPT that anyone can use.

42:19.920 --> 42:25.200
It doesn't cost anything. It is same quality, same model, same thing. It has access to internet.

42:25.760 --> 42:33.920
And it also has a mobile app. So, so yeah, depending on your preferences, this might be

42:36.080 --> 42:42.720
this, this, this, this, this might be a solution or good great thing to, to, to use for you.

42:43.920 --> 42:52.320
And there's also GPTs. GPTs is something that was recently created by OpenAI by creator of,

42:52.320 --> 42:58.240
by the company that created charge GPT and GPTs is ability to create your own version of GPT

42:58.240 --> 43:07.280
that is using your own data. So I will not go into a lot of details here, but I just want to show

43:07.280 --> 43:13.120
that creating your own GPT is very simple. So if you have a GPT plus subscription,

43:13.120 --> 43:20.160
you can go to chat openAI.com slash GPTs and you can create your own GPT that can do anything you

43:20.160 --> 43:26.080
want. And building this application is easy. You don't need to be software engineer. You can

43:26.080 --> 43:31.360
just chat with it. Basically, there's a charge called GPT builder, and it will,

43:34.240 --> 43:39.280
it will, it will, it will generate GPT for you. So let's, let's try something. And this is where

43:39.280 --> 43:45.680
we actually going into, into business use cases, because this is both useful for personal, but

43:45.680 --> 43:52.480
also for business use cases. So for example, I want to build a GPT that converts that,

43:55.120 --> 44:02.400
that creates marketing slogan based, based on the logo.

44:05.840 --> 44:12.160
And this is all I need to know. So the, like the most stunning, the most mind blowing thing here

44:12.160 --> 44:17.680
is I'm right now, I'm doing software engineering. I'm creating a new product, a new product,

44:17.680 --> 44:23.520
a new application. And all I do is just typing. I'm just chatting with this thing. So I don't

44:23.520 --> 44:29.360
need to write any code. I don't need to, to know any programming languages. I just need to do it.

44:29.360 --> 44:37.040
So it asks me, it suggests me a name, which is slogan crafter. I say, yeah, it's a good name.

44:37.040 --> 44:45.840
Okay. So now it created me a logo. It created a name. And it also created a prompt. So if you

44:45.840 --> 44:52.080
want to be more specific to change something in the behavior of how this application works,

44:52.080 --> 44:59.680
you can go and edit this message. So let's test. We just created an application. It took me less

44:59.680 --> 45:06.080
than 60 seconds. It was never possible ever before in the history of humankind.

45:06.640 --> 45:16.480
So this is the logo that I have, Codex town, which is one of the projects that I run. And

45:16.480 --> 45:25.840
I want to create a slogan for this logo. It's actually doing, it's not doing the right thing.

45:25.840 --> 45:32.000
Sorry. I forgot to upload a picture.

45:35.760 --> 45:43.520
Write me a slogan. So this is the logo that we have. And then it will,

45:45.360 --> 45:51.520
it will create a slogan based, based on this, this logo, because it doesn't have any context

45:51.520 --> 45:56.080
about what the project is about. It's just using the colors, basically the style of the image to

45:56.080 --> 46:03.520
create the slogan. So this application might not be very useful. Goal for me is to show how easy,

46:03.520 --> 46:08.560
how simple it is to build. I also want to show a few applications that are actually useful that

46:08.560 --> 46:15.280
were created by, sorry, by other people and that I'm using daily. So for example,

46:15.760 --> 46:27.360
let's go into this one, for example. So Dr. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist and he has a lot of

46:27.360 --> 46:33.600
great podcasts. But the problem with his podcasts is that they're long and I didn't have time to

46:33.600 --> 46:39.760
listen to a lot of them, to a lot of those. So what I can do, or someone, what someone did,

46:39.760 --> 46:45.200
someone created, someone uploaded all the recordings of the podcasts by Andrew Huberman

46:45.760 --> 46:53.760
and created a GPT. And now I can chat with this GPT and it will answer to me based on the question,

46:53.760 --> 47:01.360
based on the data that is coming from those recordings. So I can ask for tips on staying

47:01.360 --> 47:09.040
focused over time. This GPT will first search its own knowledge base, which you can upload

47:09.040 --> 47:15.440
while creating a GPT. And then it will generate an answer based on, based on that.

47:16.800 --> 47:23.440
So I already used it. I actually asked the same question and I find it extremely useful,

47:23.440 --> 47:30.640
like I'm using most of those tips. And then this is just an example. Another example of GPT that

47:30.640 --> 47:39.520
I created is a sketch to code. So this GPT allows me to upload any picture. I don't have,

47:43.040 --> 47:51.200
I don't have right picture. Sorry, I didn't prepare. But basically, well, I won't show the

47:51.200 --> 48:02.800
demo, but you can actually use it. So it's public. It's free to use. And what it does is I can just

48:02.800 --> 48:09.520
create a simple image of the website, what I want to have on my website. And then I upload it here

48:09.520 --> 48:16.720
and it outputs the code of the website that I can immediately run. So that really saves time and

48:17.440 --> 48:24.400
almost replaces the work of website software engineer for, at least for simple stuff. So

48:25.680 --> 48:32.880
it won't help with something very complex, like huge e-commerce website. But if you want a simple

48:32.880 --> 48:38.160
page with a few elements, you can just draw it on a piece of paper. I can literally take a photo

48:38.160 --> 48:46.000
of what I draw on my whiteboard and it will convert it into a code. And that's amazing. And

48:46.000 --> 48:57.520
that's my blowing. So what I want to do next, I want to skim through a few slides. I won't stop

48:57.520 --> 49:06.160
into detail on each one of those. But these slides are for you to use and to explore later.

49:06.720 --> 49:15.680
On each of those slides, I have a list of different products and neural networks or AI models

49:16.320 --> 49:22.560
that are useful for different tasks. So I have a capability listed on the left and then links

49:22.560 --> 49:30.560
here. And there's a lot of those. We don't have time to see and to check every one of those.

49:31.280 --> 49:37.200
But I want to show that there is a bunch of models that allow to generate text. There's a

49:37.200 --> 49:42.640
bunch of models that are out to generate and help for software engineering with software engineering

49:42.640 --> 49:51.360
job. There's a lot of models that allow you to generate music and voice and also translate text

49:51.360 --> 49:58.320
to speech or speech to text. And there's a few models that actually a lot of models

49:58.800 --> 50:04.480
right here. I have a link to the website which has a huge collection of different

50:04.480 --> 50:09.600
image generation models. And most of those products, so on each one of those slides,

50:09.600 --> 50:16.320
important thing is at least one or actually at least half of all these models are completely

50:16.320 --> 50:21.680
free and open source. So you don't need to pay for anything to start using it.

50:21.680 --> 50:27.200
If you want to use it into maybe some enterprise production use case, yes, there are enterprise

50:27.200 --> 50:33.120
solutions, but to start to test to play with it, most of these things are actually free to use

50:33.120 --> 50:44.800
and that's great and that gives a lot of increases accessibility. And finally, these models are

50:44.800 --> 50:51.920
vision models. These are what I showed on one of the examples. These are models where you can

50:51.920 --> 50:57.600
upload a photo or upload a picture and then ask questions about that picture. For example, it is

50:57.600 --> 51:04.400
relatively good with actually medical diagnosis, although it is, I don't recommend it use instead

51:04.400 --> 51:10.000
of professional medical help, but it is also useful for identifying objects like safety requirements

51:10.000 --> 51:16.480
or maybe give recommendations regarding design or architecture or something like this.

51:16.480 --> 51:27.520
And we already touched some of the business use cases. I wanted to show a few more. So we have

51:27.520 --> 51:36.640
a few more minutes and let me go into some of the most interesting business use cases for

51:36.640 --> 51:45.440
generative AI. I will skip this. Important and maybe most important thing about

51:46.240 --> 51:51.760
use cases for AI in business is that business processes are not simple. Business processes are

51:51.760 --> 52:00.720
not just one action. It is usually some logic. And this logic is hard to achieve just by chatting

52:00.720 --> 52:07.600
with ChargeGPT. If you ask ChargeGPT to create something complex like, I don't know, promote

52:07.600 --> 52:13.600
my product, it doesn't know what to do. There's too many things that goes into that task. But

52:13.600 --> 52:19.520
if it is split into simple tasks and then we chain those tasks together, we can actually achieve

52:19.520 --> 52:29.280
very complex behavior. One of the examples is to use AI for nature language processing.

52:29.920 --> 52:35.360
Here on the right, on the example, I have an example of the user that has some kind of intent,

52:36.320 --> 52:44.160
or some kind of message on our, let's say, website. And then this message can be classified,

52:44.160 --> 52:50.480
depending on the intent. Is it an inquiry? Is it a price inquiry? Is it a complaint? Is it a

52:50.480 --> 52:58.560
gratitude for our product? Based on that, we can use different prompts or different AI models

52:58.560 --> 53:03.840
to generate a response. So one of the models will retrieve relevant data, for example, product

53:03.920 --> 53:09.520
specification. Another model or another instance of the model will write response to the customer.

53:09.520 --> 53:16.880
So use that product specification and answer to customer question. And then another model

53:16.880 --> 53:21.280
will generate a picture and attach it to email and then that can be sent.

53:25.040 --> 53:31.280
One, another example for business use case that a lot of companies are actually using today is to

53:31.280 --> 53:38.080
use large language models as a knowledge management system. You can take all the existing digital

53:38.080 --> 53:47.280
communication tools like Gmail, Zoom, Jobbox, LinkedIn, Office, Slack, and so on, then upload it

53:47.280 --> 53:57.840
to a LLM system and then have ability for anyone in the company to ask questions against this

53:57.840 --> 54:04.080
knowledge base. So if I have a list of product specifications, I upload it to this LLM and then

54:04.080 --> 54:08.880
anyone in the company, any sales agent, for example, sales representative, if they have a question,

54:08.880 --> 54:16.480
they can just ask, they can just type or even record a voice message and get answered to the

54:16.480 --> 54:21.920
question like, for example, product X, what is the price or what is the dimensions and this

54:21.920 --> 54:27.440
system will give instant response. So it saves a lot of communication overhead and saves a lot of

54:27.440 --> 54:39.360
time when we want to share knowledge within the organization. Another huge use case in the,

54:39.360 --> 54:44.880
if you remember the McKinsey report that I showed in the beginning, it is one of the primary use

54:44.880 --> 54:51.120
case for large language models today is in engineering and there's two applications of that.

54:51.120 --> 54:58.960
First of all, yes, AI is very, very helpful to software engineers. It can help write code, it can

54:58.960 --> 55:04.720
test code, it can help you fix bugs, it can help identify bugs, but it is also useful to people

55:04.720 --> 55:10.080
who are not engineers, but they need to complete some engineering tasks like the data analysis

55:10.080 --> 55:14.960
example that I showed, but it can be much more complex. It can be connected to CRM system, to

55:14.960 --> 55:23.040
databases, to existing websites, all different kinds of ERP and corporate systems.

55:26.880 --> 55:37.120
And one of the probably on par with engineering, one of the most widely used applications of AI

55:38.080 --> 55:47.120
is marketing. And in marketing, there's a lot of things how AI can help. And most of those are

55:47.120 --> 55:53.520
related to either content generation. So you can create articles, blog posts, you can create text

55:53.520 --> 55:59.360
that is search engine optimized, you can create graphics, you can even create videos, you can

55:59.360 --> 56:06.880
create personalized content, which is something that was never possible before the AI. So if

56:06.880 --> 56:12.800
your company has, let's say you have 100,000 customers and you know something about those

56:12.800 --> 56:21.760
customers and you want to say them a personalized Christmas message, it was never possible to send

56:21.760 --> 56:29.680
to manually write 100,000 messages to all of your customers. But now with AI, you can just upload

56:29.680 --> 56:35.680
some of the personal information that you know about the customers, like I don't know where they

56:35.680 --> 56:43.200
leave or what their interests or what do they like. And then have AI to generate 100,000 personalized

56:43.200 --> 56:51.360
messages. And this can be just fun, just to do something nice to your customers. But this is

56:51.360 --> 56:55.680
also valuable for the business. So if you're a business, let's say you are for financial

56:55.680 --> 57:01.600
organizations, for example, we have a customer who's a bank. And for them, what they do, they know

57:02.320 --> 57:07.120
like financial preferences of all their customers. And then the right messages that

57:09.280 --> 57:15.760
are digest on the news in the stock market, based on specific interests. So if someone is

57:15.760 --> 57:21.120
investing in high tech and another person is investing in, let's say sustainability companies,

57:22.160 --> 57:30.960
these two persons will receive very personal and individual and very different email marketing

57:31.600 --> 57:38.320
or email digest. And that is not just cool and fun. It is really increasing the conversion rate

57:38.320 --> 57:46.240
and click through rate. And at the end, it is beneficial for the bottom line for how much

57:46.240 --> 57:57.760
profit the company makes. And one more example here to show is customer operations. So the idea

57:57.760 --> 58:05.120
of using AI in customer operations is that you can actually use AI, not instead of sales

58:05.120 --> 58:10.080
representative, because sometimes you still need human to human interaction to close the sales.

58:10.720 --> 58:19.200
But you can have it as an assistant, as a co-pilot to sales agents. So AI can help

58:20.480 --> 58:25.840
sales agents and show them proactively show them some information that is relevant. What

58:25.840 --> 58:32.080
makes sense to say to the customer. And it can also handle some of the cases. So if there are

58:32.080 --> 58:36.960
simple questions, then AI can answer. If there's something more complex, or if the customer's

58:36.960 --> 58:47.040
clothes is ready to buy, then it can send it to a sales representative and allow to speak to a person.

58:47.840 --> 58:55.360
This is an example from legal. What I did here is it's very similar to the visualization example

58:55.360 --> 59:01.920
that I showed in the beginning. But this is applied to contracts. Sometimes you have very

59:01.920 --> 59:08.000
complex, very large legal contracts that are hard to understand, especially if you are not a lawyer.

59:08.160 --> 59:15.680
So AI and large language models can be used here to create a diagram based on the contract. So,

59:15.680 --> 59:21.600
for example, there's a 15-pages contract. And this is the diagram that only mentions

59:22.240 --> 59:27.440
most important things for me to maybe make a decision or to review this diagram. So it does

59:27.440 --> 59:33.680
not replace the work of the lawyer, but it is helpful for maybe executives or management

59:34.080 --> 59:39.200
to see what's going on without reading all these 15-pages of complex legal text.

59:39.200 --> 59:46.080
And that's just one of the examples. I'm skipping some things because we're close to the end of

59:46.080 --> 59:57.040
presentation. But on the left, I have more examples for use cases of AI in each one of those areas.

59:57.920 --> 01:00:07.440
One more area I want to highlight, I think it's very, very important, is people operations and HR.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:16.560
And the reason I think large language models and AI is very useful here is because trading and

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:24.480
education is really the core of most businesses, like people are what makes business successful.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:37.600
And I'm really a big fan and I really believe in the fact that large language models will do a lot of,

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:49.120
will enhance and improve and improve quality of education worldwide. Meaning that AI is helpful

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:56.480
as a tutor, even for the startups that are building AI educational software for

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:03.600
school children, for universities, and for corporate training programs as well. So AI can

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:10.720
run, can explain complex information as shown. It can generate case studies. It can simulate

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:16.160
some real work behavior. So for example, if you are training sales representatives,

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:22.480
you can generate, you can ask AI to be a partner to train and to

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:31.520
practice some sales skills. So you can ask AI to be an angry customer. And then it helps

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:40.320
people who are new to the job to know what to say if somebody is angry. Or you can ask AI to

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:46.240
to simulate a market situation. And that is useful for practicing

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:53.440
maybe some management skills. Or you can ask AI to generate a code that has some bucks.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:02.880
And it's useful to upskill and train engineers. So this is, there's a lot of examples like this,

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:08.480
or a lot of, I would say, a lot of products, a lot of companies. So when we go into enterprise

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:15.360
use cases, those are mostly not free. Those are some big products or big companies doing this

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:26.000
and also small startups. But I, my suggestion is to really to, to pay close attention to AI

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.440
products in all of these areas. Because at the end of the day, what it gives, it gives economic

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:39.600
efficiency. And it allows to save costs. And it also allows to find new market opportunities.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:49.680
And to wrap it up, I want to, I want to show one more slide here, which is regarding AI strategy.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:03:03.200
So if you, if you plan to use AI in your business, I have a specific, I would say, plan or, or, or,

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:08.640
or suggestion how to approach this, because it might be overwhelming. There's a lot of products.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:13.200
There's a lot of people trying to sell all different kinds of things. Some of those might be great.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:18.480
Some of those might be great. Some of those might be very, very simple and too expensive.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:25.040
So in order to do it correctly and in order to do it, like not to rush things, but also not to

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:33.600
wait until it's too late, I suggest starting with experiments with chat. So any simple business task

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:40.720
can be validated and can be tested in chat GPT, even in the free version. And that gives you idea,

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.920
overall idea, like, is it even possible and what would be the quality of the results? Some tasks

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:52.400
they are possible to do, but the quality is too bad. It's still like AI is still not as smart to

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:58.960
automate them. In some tasks, you will get good results. Once you have an experiment that you see

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:06.640
is working well in the chat, the next step would be to create a co-pilot, a workflow, maybe connect

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:14.480
a few chats with preset prompts. So one chat is, one prompt is responsible for writing a text,

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:19.600
and the second prompt is responsible for proofreading a text. And then you combine these

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:26.400
two together and you get to an agent. Agent is, when I show that slide with chains,

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:37.600
agent is a system, is a application that takes result of one AI tool and passes it to the next

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.320
tool and then passes it to the next tool. And those agents are relatively simple to develop.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:48.480
You can use either no-code platforms, you can use it, build it internally if you have software

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:53.920
engineering team in your company, or you can find external developers. And this is not too expensive,

01:04:53.920 --> 01:05:00.400
like AI used to cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars, like five, 10 years ago,

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:05.840
like huge AI deploy the deployment projects. Right now, building agent for search engine

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:11.520
optimization or sales or marketing, it can cost just a few thousand dollars, or you can do it,

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:19.360
build it for free. And I will not show exactly, I will not do full tutorial, but I want to show

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.560
a couple of tools. One of them is called Relevance AI. Another one is called Skate Pro.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:32.800
Let me just show their landing pages. And I have both links in the presentation. So

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:42.000
this is just to show. So Relevance AI is a tool you can start using for free. They give you

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.960
quite a lot of free credits that you can use on the platform. So if it's small business,

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:55.520
you might even get away with free version. And then Skate Pro is also, they combine 1500 different

01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:03.120
AI tools in a cascade. So you can create these agents and create very, very simple, very, very,

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:14.400
very powerful AI workflows. And maybe two last thing I want to say is that if something doesn't

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:22.320
work, I want to encourage you to not give up. Because what is happening is that AI

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:33.280
progress, progress in the AI space is stunningly fast. And we're moving at

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:39.920
increasing and unprecedented speed. So if something is not working, if you feel like

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:46.320
AI texts are maybe too dry, you don't like it. Or if you think that it is not helping you with

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:52.080
sales process, or it only helps for a very small percentage of your potential customers,

01:06:52.880 --> 01:07:03.760
that is fine. But I really suggest you to keep, to just pay attention to the space. Because models

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.240
and tools, these foundational models, they are improving very, very rapidly. And if something

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:16.240
doesn't work today, it will likely change in the near future. And it is important to pay attention

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:24.800
and to build processes and products that will evolve, will get better with more powerful tools

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:34.960
and with more powerful underlying models. And that's it for my presentation. Thank you so much.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:44.720
I have my contact information here on this slide. And we have some time. If there are any questions,

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:50.160
happy to answer, happy to discuss, happy to maybe show more, if you're interested in something.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:59.200
Dina, maybe a question to you. How do we want to manage the Q&A part?

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:08.320
Stepan, thank you very much. I think it should be just an open floor,

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:14.000
whoever wants to raise your hand or turn on your camera or write in the chat,

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:21.520
if you don't want to show your face. Dimash has a question. Go ahead, Dimash.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:28.880
Dimash, we cannot hear you.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.240
You can also type in chat.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.640
Yeah, just type in chat.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:45.360
Okay, anybody else?

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:55.680
I mean, can I ask this brief question, Stepan? How can we make this personalized AI solutions

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:59.840
without compromising privacy and security, maybe?

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:10.800
Mm-hmm. Yeah, great question. So I had this slide where I had a list of different AI models.

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:18.880
And the one thing about OpenAI, ChargeGPT, is that that model is private, meaning that

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:25.360
it belongs to OpenAI. And whatever data you send it, it will end up on their server,

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:34.480
so they can potentially have access to it. So when you want to build an AI system

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:40.240
that is 100% private, 100% working on your own computer or in your organization,

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:49.920
I will give you very specific recommendation. Actually, I will just open it on my computer, but

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:58.400
I suggest using LM Studio. So you can go to this website, LMStudio.ai. This is a completely free

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:05.280
application that is available for Mac, Windows, Linux. And you can download this app. And then

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:13.600
inside that app, you can download any of hundreds of existing free models. So this is an app that

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:20.400
I have installed on my computer. And these are all the models that I have downloaded, but this is

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:26.640
just part of them. So when I use any of these models, no data is ever leaving my computer. I can

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.640
disconnect myself from the internet, and all of this will be working. And these models, most of

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:39.280
them are not as good as GPT-4, but depending on your task, it can be good enough. And there's

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:46.480
also a question I see in the chat about models that work well with Russian language. I can just

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:55.920
show it here. So you can go to here. And there's a model called Saiga. And this is one of the models

01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:02.320
that works very well with specifically Russian language. But I think GPT-4 still outperforms

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:11.760
in, I would say, in every language except for maybe Chinese. So GPT-4 is the best model today

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:19.840
that working with any other language except for Chinese, because they have a lot of their own

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:26.720
Russian language models in China. But GPT-4 is great for English and other languages.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:45.200
Okay. Any more questions? Can I ask the question? Yes. My name is Carla. I'm not technically

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:52.960
aware. I'm not that in business, actually. But can you distinguish between the

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:57.760
chat GPT-generated music and the human-generated music? How you do that?

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:04.800
Yeah. Good question. I think... So first of all, chat GPT-4 does not generate music, but there's

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:12.800
special tools specifically. It's called sueno.ai. So if anyone wants to generate music, there's also...

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:24.960
I will send it in chat. It's called sueno.ai. And the problem of identifying if something was...

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:38.000
if music, image, or text was created by AI or a human is quite hard. It is possible to identify

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:46.080
if it is just, I don't know, robotic sounds music or the text is just very, very, very badly written.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:53.200
But as this model becomes better, it will be, in my opinion, so there's no technical way of

01:12:54.160 --> 01:13:00.720
100% guarantee that something was created by an AI. So as these models get better,

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:09.280
it becomes very almost impossible to distinguish. So this is a hard problem that I don't think anyone

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:16.160
has an answer to, really. And does it mean that the old composers will lose the job eventually

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:24.080
with this chat GPT-generation, generating music, or like the still will be some use of the human?

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:35.840
I'm sure humans will always do music because AI doesn't... It can do something, it can help humans,

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:40.880
but I don't think it can, at least at this point, can produce... It doesn't have

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:50.640
subjective emotional experience. So I think that's the important part. That's the

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:57.200
crucial part for generating art. But what is happening today, what I see a lot is people,

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:06.720
artists, being writers and musicians and videographers and painters, they utilize AI tools

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:15.040
in their work more and more. And that's great because when electric synthesizers were created,

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:21.520
we got, or electric guitars were created, we got a whole new genre of music. So it's the same thing.

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:29.600
We now get more tools to express ourselves. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:37.280
Great question. There was a follow-up question, like what professions will be last to move with AI

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:47.920
in the chat. There was this question. Yeah. Good question. Actually, paradoxically,

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:57.760
things that are not being automated are things that are relatively low-paying jobs

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:09.200
and physical jobs. So I don't know, a barber or a hairdresser or a plumber or

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:16.240
someone who works in construction. It started at seven o'clock in the morning, I didn't realize.

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:20.560
Let's try this one. This is an AI workshop. Yeah.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:27.280
Yeah. Sorry, Jim. I put you in mute for now.

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:39.040
And yeah. So the jobs that are least prone to automation are those that are

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:46.240
low-paying because there's less economic gain from that automation and also that are

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:53.040
manual and requires a lot of manual work because robotics is much more expensive than

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:59.920
software. Building a robot costs much more than building a software application. So

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:06.480
office jobs like marketing or sales or finance or legal innovation in those spaces are happening

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:14.960
much, much faster than, for example, robotic automation of cleaners or something like this.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:24.800
I see, I'll read a few questions from the chat. So there's one question about

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:33.520
non-English-speaking languages. So I don't know about Mongolian. I don't know Mongolian,

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:40.080
so I cannot test it. But I would suggest to start with charge EPT. And if you don't have an account,

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:46.400
go to Bing chat and it will work exactly the same way as charge EPT.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:56.320
What I found is that charge EPT is really good on... So the quality of the text it produces

01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:04.400
is proportional to how much text on that language did it see during the training period when it

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:10.960
was trained. And that is more or less roughly proportional to how much text in that language

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:18.000
exists online. So obviously languages like English, Spanish, Chinese, French, German,

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:26.480
they have... There's a lot of text in those languages online and therefore GPT is very good

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:34.000
at those languages. Languages like Mongolian are not very... There's not too much of that

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.240
data. There's not a lot of that data in the training set. But it can still be good enough.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:48.160
So I think GPT-4 would be the best benchmark. It's the best way to test how good models are today.

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:55.520
But over time, I see there's a lot of companies, a lot of projects, a lot of open source projects that

01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:02.720
are building localized versions of LLMs. So I showed Saiga, which is a Russian version. It's

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:08.480
actually not the only one. There's a few more models that are specifically trained in Russian.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:16.640
There's a lot of... I know a few companies in France doing the same. So this problem is slowly

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:24.960
being solved. But right now English is... It's just because most of the internet is in English,

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:32.480
that's why AI models speak English much, much better than other languages.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:44.880
So the question is, where can we find various AI websites? I'm not sure. Are you talking about

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:52.160
AI models? If so, then this is the link I sent to chat.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:19:04.480
There was a question about why developers are limiting access of these models to internet.

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:17.520
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see now. Yes, great question. So one of the main reasons is it's a really legal

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:26.400
question. So people, when ChargeGPT first released internet access, it was used, it was very widely

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:33.760
used for scraping data from paywall content. So for example, Wall Street Journal is a paywall

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.720
website. You cannot access it. I think you can see like three articles a month, and then you

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:45.520
have to pay subscription. But people were using ChargeGPT to scrape articles from Wall Street Journal

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:54.720
and other media. And that was just a copyright issue. So it's not really a technical question.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:20:02.080
It is a legal question. And legal questions tend to take longer to resolve than engineering

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:11.040
questions, just because of how legal system works. It's slow. But there are alternatives.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:20.160
So today, ChargeGPT has access to the internet. It won't give you some paywall content, but it can,

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:26.080
for example, read Reddit or some public data that is available.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:35.360
Okay, any more questions?

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:45.200
So I want to reiterate that. I will, sorry.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:54.160
I have a last question, personal one. If the way to train my personal GPT,

01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:01.440
if I could upload, for example, my Facebook archive and emails, how it could help me

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:05.920
in general, I mean, the private assistant?

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:14.640
Good question. I think, I don't know. It's really, you really should test it, because it depends

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:20.480
on what's in there and what data. And it's also like when you're uploading data to GPT,

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:26.720
you need to keep in mind that this data is being stored on their servers. So

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:34.080
maybe not, maybe not upload something very, very private information in there,

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:38.720
like Gmail, it can have, I don't know, financial information, something like this.

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:49.600
But the use cases for personal assistance is that you can use previous history of your communication

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:57.120
to generate answers to maybe incoming communication messages. So if you have history of all your

01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:04.240
emails that you sent and you receive a similar email with a similar question, GPT will be very good

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:11.760
at producing a new response or writing a new draft, email draft in a style and with the content

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:17.920
that's very similar to what you sent in the past. GPT is one way to do it, maybe more technically

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:24.320
advanced way to do this would be through fine tuning, but that requires a lot of technical

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:35.520
expertise. So yeah, so this assistant can be a way of automating your own communication

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:44.160
and helping you with producing email drafts or responses or maybe messenger responses,

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:52.480
something like this. And it should also know my personality well if I upload the social media.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:59.840
This is what you, right? Yeah, this is what you have to explain and define in the instructions.

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:03.200
So in GPT, when you create GPT, you have this instruction

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:10.720
box for instructions and you cannot, it cannot learn your personality based on

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:17.840
uploaded information, you need to explicitly type it and say like you need to answer in a

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:24.560
friendly tone, use maybe these words, don't use these words, use like this kind of language

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:31.200
presentation and so on. And then it will follow those instructions in order to actually

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:39.920
take the tone of voice and teach GPT to reply in your tone of voice. For that, you have to do

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:52.640
fine tuning. It's possible with GPT, but it requires more technical expertise. Probably need to find

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.920
an engineer to help with that.

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:14.880
All right. Yeah, so I see no more questions, but I will send recording and presentation to Dina,

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:22.160
so you will get it soon. All the links, everything I've shown in the today are in the

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:28.560
presentation. There's actually a bit more that I, a bit more slides, I skipped some of them.

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:36.960
So, so yeah, I hope, I hope, I hope this is valuable. I hope this is useful and I hope that

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:45.280
my sincere recommendation is to like just spend more time working with the systems and working

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:55.040
with GPT, with AI, because the most important thing is to build intuition. That's what most useful.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:03.920
Thank you very much, Dipan. I think that was quite a comprehensive presentation, especially

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.240
for the first slide, being an intro. Tamuna, you want to say something?

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:15.680
I just wanted to say thank you. It was really one of the most useful and practical AI sessions

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:22.560
I attended, and I attended several, so thank you. It was really good. Thank you very much.
