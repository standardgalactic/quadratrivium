1. **Truss Analysis**: To analyze a truss, you start by drawing its free body diagram (FBD), identifying all unknown forces, and then apply the principles of static equilibrium. For planar trusses, this involves three equilibrium equations: sum of forces in the vertical (y-axis) and horizontal (x-axis) directions, and sum of moments about an arbitrary point.

2. **Internal Forces**: The internal forces in a truss are calculated for each member, with the assumption that the structure is in static equilibrium under the applied loads. These forces can be either tensile or compressive.

3. **Static Determinancy**: A truss is considered statically determinant if it has enough redundancies (members and reactions) so that all internal forces can be determined using equilibrium equations alone. If a truss has too many members, it may be statically indeterminate and requires additional methods for analysis, such as the force or displacement methods.

4. **Truss Designs**: The Howe, Pratt, and Warren trusses are classic designs from the 19th century, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of material usage, cost-effectiveness, and susceptibility to buckling under compression loads.

5. **Howe Truss**: Vertical members are mostly in tension, and diagonal members are in compression.

6. **Pratt Truss**: Inner vertical members are mostly in compression, and the inner diagonal members are in tension. It is more cost-effective than the Howe truss due to shorter members being used in compression.

7. **Warren Truss**: Uses equilateral triangles for all members, which allows for fewer and shorter members, making it a cost-effective and efficient design. Diagonal members alternate between tension and compression.

8. **Space Trusses**: These are three-dimensional structures that can be analyzed similarly to planar trusses but require six equilibrium equations for forces and moments, and at each joint, you have three equations to solve.

9. **Application**: The methods used to analyze trusses can be applied to both planar and space trusses, with the main difference being the number of equations needed to solve for the unknown forces in the members.

10. **Practical Considerations**: In real-life scenarios, additional factors such as member buckling, material properties, and environmental effects must also be considered when designing or analyzing truss structures.
