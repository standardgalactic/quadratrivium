0	2960	So I think we're going to live in a world where there are going to be hundreds of millions
2960	7760	and billions of different AI agents, eventually probably more AI agents than there are people
7760	8760	in the world.
8760	9760	All right.
9760	12440	So Lama 3.1 was just released today.
12440	17120	And along with that, there has been a ton of additional information released from meta
17120	19720	about how they think about open source.
19720	25680	Mark Zuckerberg wrote a letter, which I will also be covering, but he also did a 30 plus
25680	27800	minute interview with Rowan Chang.
27800	31440	And so today we're going to watch the video together and I'm going to give you my thoughts
31440	32440	on it.
32440	36760	Can I also just say I am absolutely loving Mark Zuckerberg's current vibes.
36760	41500	His transformation is going to be studied in business school for decades to come.
41500	42500	So let's keep watching.
42500	43500	Okay.
43500	48040	In this first section, he is going to introduce the Lama 3.1 launch and it'll be in his
48040	49640	own words and what he thinks about it.
49640	50640	So let's watch.
50640	54320	I mean, the big release today, first of all, happy to be doing this big fan of what you
54320	56000	do.
56000	61600	The big release today is Lama 3.1 and we're releasing three models.
61600	65640	The first time we're releasing a 405 billion parameter model.
65640	71000	So it's by far the most sophisticated open source model that I think anyone has put out.
71000	74920	And it really kind of is competitive with some of the leading close models and in some
74920	75920	areas is even ahead.
75920	81440	So I'm really excited to see what people do with that, especially now that we're making
81440	86680	it so that the community policies around Lama allow people to use it as a teacher model
86680	92560	to distill and fine tune and basically create whatever other models they want with it.
92560	93760	I already have to pause it.
93760	97160	So he said a lot just in those few words.
97160	101680	First of all, the 405 billion parameter model is outstanding.
101680	106120	It is leaps and bounds more sophisticated than any other open source model out there.
106120	111360	It is directly competitive with closed source frontier models and it is really the first
111360	114480	open source model that can be considered frontier.
114480	120920	Also all of this is a direct shot at open AI and other closed source companies.
120920	123880	And he is taking a tried and true playbook.
123880	126560	Microsoft did this for years.
126560	131000	Basically when you're behind in a technology race, the strategy that you employ is called
131000	132840	scorched earth.
132840	137600	Essentially invest a ton of money into replicating whatever that technology is and then release
137600	138800	it for free.
138800	143680	Because at that point it becomes ubiquitous, it becomes a commodity and why would anybody
143680	148680	go and pay premium prices for a closed source frontier model when you can have full control
148680	151920	over the model and pay fractions of the price.
151920	155160	Plus you are increasing competition greatly.
155160	159440	And so you have companies like grok, GROQ who are able to take this large model and
159440	164800	run it at inference speeds that are absolutely incredible orders of magnitude greater than
164800	166280	what open AI can run at.
166280	170080	And by the way, I don't think open AI is down for the count by any means.
170080	172480	Sam Altman is a brilliant operator.
172480	178520	And this is likely why they just released GPT-40 mini, a model that is as performant
178520	183040	as GPT-40 but for a fraction of the price and it's much faster.
183040	184840	So they're getting the message.
184840	186600	They see the writing on the wall.
186600	190200	Models are becoming commodities and I just read an article and I'm going to talk about
190200	194680	this in another video that open AI is building their own AI chips.
194680	198600	And again, that's really where a lot of the differentiation comes from.
198600	202400	That is why GROQ is so special because of their unique chip design that allows them
202400	205960	to run inference at blazing fast speeds.
205960	210880	And open AI wants to accomplish the same thing because especially after this release, models
210880	211880	are a commodity.
211880	212880	Let's keep watching.
212880	218160	In addition to that, we've distilled the 405 billion parameter model down to make newer
218160	224360	and updated and now leading for their size 70 billion and 8 billion parameter models.
224400	228640	So that's actually one thing I didn't quite realize even after reading the announcement,
228640	233840	they took the 405 billion parameter model and distilled it down into the 3.1 versions of
233840	236240	the 8 billion and 70 billion parameter models.
236240	237240	I didn't know that.
237240	241680	Does that mean that the 8 billion and 70 billion parameter models that first came out the three
241680	245560	version were standalone models and now these are completely new models?
245560	246720	I'm not actually sure.
246720	248280	So if you know, let me know in the comments.
248280	252520	Yeah, I mean, taking a step back, I think this is a pretty big moment for open source AI.
252680	256640	Yeah, I've been reflecting on this and I kind of think it's, you know, I thought for a while
256640	260160	that open source AI was going to become the industry standard.
260160	265880	And I thought that it would basically follow the path that Linux did, where, you know,
265880	270120	if you just go back to before Linux was popular, there, you know, there were all these companies
270120	274520	that had their own closed versions of Unix and at the time, you know, there's nothing
274520	279240	that was sort of that sophisticated that had ever been done as an open source project.
279240	282600	And people thought, hey, no, this is like the closed model of development is the only
282600	284120	way to do something that's this advanced.
284120	291080	And at first Linux kind of got its foothold because it was cheaper because developers
291080	292680	could customize it in different ways.
292680	297240	And then over time as the ecosystem built out, it, you know, got more scrutiny.
297240	299280	So it actually became the more secure one.
299280	300760	It became the more advanced one.
300760	305120	There were more partners that basically built more capabilities in the case of Linux, more
305120	309800	developers, and things like that, that basically ended up making it have more capabilities as
309800	311280	well than any closed source Unix.
311280	318840	So I think that this moment with Lama 3.1 is kind of like that inflection point where
318840	324880	I think Lama has the opportunity to become the open source AI standard for open source
324880	328280	to become the standard, the industry standard for AI.
328280	333720	And even in the places where it's not yet ahead on performance, it leads on, on kind
333720	338600	of cost and on, on customized ability and on the ability to take the model and fine tune
338600	340960	it and do all the things that you want with it.
340960	346000	So he also mentioned, and I forgot to mention this in my last comments, but he also mentioned
346000	351160	that they changed the license and now with the 405 billion perimeter model, they allow
351160	356160	you to create synthetic data from that model to train smaller models.
356160	361600	So that is a huge change and extremely valuable for the ecosystem.
361600	364520	This is what NVIDIA did with their Nemetron model.
364520	371200	They trained a massive model that generates data and has the permission to do so to train
371200	372200	smaller models.
372200	377320	And this is going to allow a lot of companies, a lot of AI model companies as well to make
377320	381080	their own versions of these models, dependent on the use case.
381080	386080	And that is a really cool strategy and something again, I really appreciate from meta.
386080	389320	I think that those are just huge advantages that that we're going to see developers take
389360	393160	and we're focusing on building out this partner ecosystem and there are going to be all these
393160	395040	different capabilities that get built out around it.
395040	396440	So yeah, and that's another thing.
396440	399720	He's not doing this just to screw over the closed source companies.
399720	404240	He actually believes in this as a true business strategy.
404240	409560	If you build out the foundation for other companies to come build on top of you, then
409560	414520	of course you get to set the standards and then you'll figure out ways to monetize over
414520	415520	time.
415520	416520	That's essentially what they did with Facebook.
416520	419560	They built out a platform, other developers came and built on top of it.
419560	423680	Now the counter example to that is Apple with the App Store.
423680	428120	They built a completely closed system and then other developers because it was so popular
428120	430040	came and built on top of it.
430040	433840	And there's the alternative Android, which is the open version of the smartphone operating
433840	434840	system.
434840	438600	So we needed a strong open source player in AI and now we have it.
438600	439600	All right.
439600	442560	Next is something you all ask me about all the time whenever I put out a tutorial, whenever
442560	446480	I put out some kind of news, you always ask me, okay, but what's the real world use case
446480	450520	and that's something that I've been trying to include more and more in my videos.
450520	454280	So now what Mark is going to talk about in this segment is what he sees as the real world
454280	455280	use cases.
455280	458960	He's probably going to start with the things that we all know are pretty obvious and are
458960	462560	the basic intro use cases for AI.
462560	466560	But I'm hoping he's also going to talk about the more sophisticated use cases and there's
466560	470720	probably a ton of use cases we haven't even thought of yet or that the capabilities aren't
470720	472320	quite there yet until today.
472320	473320	So let's watch.
473320	480320	The thing that I'm most excited about is seeing people use it to distill and fine tune their
480320	481320	own models.
481320	482320	Right.
482320	485560	It's, I mean, like you're saying, I mean, this is the first open source frontier level
485560	488400	model, but it's not the first frontier level model.
488400	492240	So there have been other models that sort of have that capacity and yeah, people are going
492240	497000	to want to do inference directly on the four or five because it's, you know, by our estimates,
497000	502400	it's going to be at 50% cheaper, I think, than the GPT four or to do that directly.
502480	506040	And so I think that that obviously makes a difference to a lot of people.
506040	510480	But the thing that I think is really new in the world with this is the, because it's
510480	513040	open weights, the ability to take the model.
513040	518600	And by the way, it was rumored that Meta was not going to release the weights for the 405
518600	521240	billion parameter model, but Mark Zuckerberg corrected them.
521240	524000	And it seems like he held true to his promise.
524000	525000	They did release it.
525000	526720	It is completely open source.
526720	532240	And I can truly say that completely open source and distill it down to whatever size
532280	536840	that you want to use it for synthetic data generation, to use it as a teacher model.
537640	541000	You know, so our vision for the future, it's not just, okay, it was never that there's
541000	542280	going to be one singular thing.
542280	545880	I think this is like open AI sort of as this vision that they're going to build kind of
545880	550320	one big AI, Anthropic does to Google does to it's never been our vision.
550320	553480	Our vision is that there should be lots of different models.
553480	559160	I think every startup out there, every enterprise governments, they all kind of want to have
559400	561280	their own custom models.
561640	566000	And yeah, when the closed ecosystem was so much better than open source, it was just
566000	570640	better to take the vanilla closed thing off the shelf, because even though you could
570640	573960	customize open source, there was still some gap between the performance that you could
573960	575600	get, but now we don't see that anymore.
575600	578720	So this is actually something that I believe in really strongly.
578720	582640	And if you've watched my videos as of the last few weeks and months, you've heard me
582640	588960	say it, I truly believe that small vertical narrow use case models
589160	593560	are going to be the future, especially, and again, something else I've talked about as
593560	597560	AI compute continues to get pushed towards edge devices.
597600	602880	The only way we're going to be able to have capable AI is by running small models, multiple
602880	605160	small models on a device like this.
605200	610360	And when we also have algorithmic innovations like route LLM and mixture of agents, all
610360	615720	of a sudden, these small models become so much better and know when to offload to these
615880	619320	giant kind of world knowledge models, if they have to.
619360	624840	And funny, that is the approach that Apple intelligence took, but they just took the
624840	629440	completely closed ecosystem approach, which is very Apple to do as open source basically
629440	630320	closes the gap.
630720	637000	I think you're just going to see this wide proliferation of models where people now have
637000	641440	the incentive to basically customize and build and train exactly the right size model for
641440	645120	what they're doing, train their data into it, they're going to have the tools to do it
645120	649720	because of a lot of the partner integrations that the companies like Amazon are doing with
649720	654440	AWS or Databricks or different folks like that, who are building these whole suites
654440	657680	of services for distilling and fine tuning open models.
657680	659920	So I think that that's going to be the thing that's new here.
659920	662720	And that's really exciting is how far can that get pushed?
662760	666800	And and that's a completely new capability in the world because there hasn't been an
666800	672040	open source or open weight model of kind of this sophistication that's ever been released
672040	672480	before.
672520	672760	Yeah.
672760	674520	And that's a really important point.
674840	680360	The battle for unique and diverse data is really going to be the front lines of artificial
680360	681000	intelligence.
681000	686720	That is why, as I mentioned in a recent previous video, open AI has been building partnerships
686720	690520	with numerous content companies like Time Magazine and so on.
690600	696000	And so if you're a company and you have this very unique, very proprietary data set, you can
696000	703840	now take these large frontier open source models and train them on your particular use case for
703840	708320	your business, whether you want to use it internally or resell it to your industry.
708320	710960	And I think that's a really interesting approach.
711080	711320	All right.
711320	716640	In this next section, Rowan asks Mark Zuckerberg about how they're going to teach the world
716640	720160	how to use these AI models and specifically about open source and its benefits.
720160	721480	So let's watch what he has to say.
721560	721840	Yeah.
721840	726680	So I'd say before a 3.1 hour approach, I mean, the reason that Meta fundamentally is
726680	731480	investing in this is we basically want to know that we have access to, to a leading
731480	737040	model, you know, because of some of our, our history of kind of how mobile worked and
737040	742240	things like that, we didn't want to be in a position where we had to rely on some competitor.
742280	742720	All right.
742800	746080	So he kind of revealed why he's employing this strategy.
746360	751360	During the mobile revolution, Facebook got caught flat footed.
751360	756840	They basically were completely platform dependent on Apple or Android.
756840	761800	And they even tried to make their own phone at a certain point, although it was a failed
761800	762480	project.
762480	766680	So he is obviously not wanting to make that same mistake again.
766720	767920	We built it for ourselves.
768280	773680	And before a 3.1, you know, we, we kind of had this instinct that if we made it open
773680	777400	source, there would be a community that would grow around it and that would actually extend
777400	779920	the capabilities and make it more valuable for everyone, including us.
780120	782120	Because at the end of the day, this isn't just a technology.
782120	783360	It's an ecosystem, right?
783360	784680	That, that, that you're developing.
784680	788280	So in order for this to end up being a useful thing for us, there also needs to be a broad
788280	788880	ecosystem.
789520	793400	One of the big changes that I think we see with llama 3.1 is instead of just building
793400	797600	it for ourselves and throwing it over the wall and letting developers use it, this time
797600	803840	we're really taking a much more proactive stance on building partnerships and making
803840	809240	sure that there's this whole ecosystem of companies that can do interesting things with
809240	811840	the model and conserve developers in ways that we're not going to.
811960	816480	Okay, really, what that translates into is they want control of the ecosystem.
816480	818440	They want to be able to define the standards.
818680	820720	They want to build up the ecosystem.
820720	824800	So there's obviously a financial motive for meta and it's not just purely out of the
824800	828080	goodness of their heart that they release this model for free, but that's okay.
828120	829400	Everybody can still win.
829480	833360	And quickly, I want to show Mark Zuckerberg talking about GROC, which is, as you know,
833360	836600	one of my favorite companies out there right now in the world of AI.
836640	840720	The time I think that there are also going to be folks like GROC, right, who are doing
840760	846840	really interesting work on really kind of ultra low latency inference.
846840	848840	And I'm really excited to get this in their hands.
848840	851400	And they're building something for launch that basically.
851520	855040	Okay, so obviously this was filmed a few days before launch, if not more.
855080	858120	And GROC on day one already has it available.
858360	861160	I haven't been able to use it because there's been so many people trying.
861160	863120	It basically says they're bandwidth limited.
863120	865400	But as soon as I can, I'm definitely going to try it out.
865440	869720	Next, Rowan asks Mark Zuckerberg what the implications are of open source AI.
869720	874320	And this has been a fierce debate amongst obviously close source companies like
874320	878960	open AI and open source companies like Meta AI, Mark Zuckerberg, Yann LeCun.
879080	884960	And what I really appreciate about the open source approach is that it hopefully puts
885000	889640	a stop to any regulatory capture that might be happening and likely is happening
889640	892680	from the likes of Google and open AI.
892920	894840	They want regulation.
894840	900680	They want the hurdle to start a new AI company, a new innovative frontier AI model
900680	904200	to be as high as possible because they're already on that side of the fence.
904320	906360	They don't want anybody else at their party.
906440	914440	My view is that open source is a really important ingredient to having a positive AI future.
914600	918200	And that there are all these awesome things that AI is going to bring in terms
918200	922200	of productivity gains and creativity enhancements for people.
922200	924800	And hopefully it'll help us with research and things like that.
925120	929440	But I think open source is an important part of how we make sure that this benefits
929440	931480	everyone and is accessible to everyone.
931760	935600	It isn't something that's just locked into a handful of big companies.
935800	940760	At the same time, I actually think that open source is going to end up being the
940760	943480	safer and more secure way to develop AI.
943720	947360	I know that there's sort of a debate today about is open source safe?
947760	949920	And I actually take the different position on it.
949920	951000	It's not only do I think it's safe.
951000	953360	I think it's safer than the alternative of closed development.
953360	956720	And yeah, so I'm going to cut him off for a second because I kind of already know
956720	960120	where he's going, something I've already talked about in previous videos.
960160	962680	And he actually talked about it a little bit earlier in this video.
962800	967320	Basically, when you open source something and everybody with diverse skills,
967320	972960	diverse perspectives and a much larger pool of talent can look and examine
973000	976320	every single line of code, every single piece of data, how it's behaving,
976320	979880	why it's doing certain things, you're going to harden the system.
979960	983280	Much more so than closed source systems.
983320	985840	Now, there's some examples where that's not the case.
985840	989560	There's some examples where that is the case, but I think generally speaking,
989800	993160	open source tends to be more secure than closed source systems.
993200	995200	If you agree, let me know in the comments.
995200	997800	I'm not sure if that's even a controversial statement or not.
997840	1001240	You know, I sort of break it down into, you know, there are lots of different
1001240	1004920	kinds of harm, so you can't just talk about one type of thing.
1005200	1008920	But on this, I think that there's unintentional harms.
1008920	1013000	So the system goes off the rails in some way that people didn't intend.
1013520	1016440	And then there's intentional harms where you have like some bad actors
1016440	1019800	trying to use the system to do something bad when it comes to unintentional harms,
1019800	1023320	which I think, by the way, it's worth noting that like most of the sci-fi
1023320	1028360	scenarios that people worry about of AI just going rogue are kind of unintentional.
1028640	1033520	I actually think that open source should be safer on that because it's
1034080	1036680	it will have more scrutiny, they'll have more transparency.
1037640	1041640	And I think all the developers who use it with all the Lama Guard
1041640	1043640	and the safety tools that it comes with,
1045080	1047720	there's going to be so much scrutiny and testing and pressure on those
1047960	1052480	that my guess is that it will have kind of just like traditional open
1052480	1056280	source software, any kind of issues with it, I think will be ironed out
1056280	1059840	and fixed a lot quicker than with the closed models.
1059840	1063080	So I think you've got you've got that on kind of unintentional harm,
1063080	1066360	which is why I think most of the discussion around safety for open
1066360	1069320	source revolves around intentional harm. It's OK, it's open.
1069320	1072280	It's out there. How are you going to stop bad actors from doing it?
1072680	1073840	Doing bad things with it?
1073840	1077040	There, I think you basically want to probably divide the problem
1077760	1080960	into kind of smaller actors like an individual or
1081840	1086040	or some kind of smaller group that's trying to create some some some mayhem
1086640	1090600	and the larger actors who are more sophisticated and have huge amounts
1090600	1092680	of resources like big nation states.
1092720	1095240	I think it's kind of a different mix for the two of those.
1095400	1098960	This reminds me of something that Jan LeCun talked about in his interview
1098960	1101840	with Lex Friedman. I'm actually forgetting the name he called this,
1101840	1106680	but he essentially said that if everybody has open source frontier models
1106840	1109800	that are incredibly capable, as capable as closed source,
1110080	1113800	then it's basically a battle of AI versus AI.
1113800	1117760	If there's a bad actor and a good actor with AI, whoever has the better AI
1117760	1122160	is going to win. And if both sides have equal AI, or if they're just off
1122160	1127360	by, let's say, 5% in terms of capabilities, then it's pretty much null.
1127560	1131240	And one AI is going to protect the good actors from the bad actors.
1131240	1135080	AI. Now, the instance that we're not talking about,
1135080	1140000	which I actually don't think is possible is if bad actors with huge resources
1140000	1145720	suddenly get a massive jump in capabilities in AI
1145760	1147760	that nobody else even thought was possible.
1147920	1155320	So imagine all of a sudden a bad actors AI is 100% better than the good actors AI.
1155320	1157640	At that point, we'd probably be in trouble.
1157640	1161440	But as I said, I don't even believe that's possible just because of the iterative
1161440	1164440	nature of artificial intelligence innovation.
1164480	1168320	There just aren't these huge step functions in capability gain.
1168440	1172160	You know, for the smaller actors, my view on this is that, you know,
1172160	1176240	the way that we've, I think that having a balance of power on this is super important.
1176840	1179400	You know, what we've done in managing our social networks is we have all these
1179400	1183240	kind of bad actors who are trying to do kind of bad stuff on our networks.
1183240	1186240	And a lot of times they deploy AI systems to do that.
1186240	1188960	And the way that we stop them and identify them is by having more
1188960	1193080	sophisticated AI systems that have more compute to go find what they're doing.
1193400	1197160	So I think that this is actually pretty similar to the governments and law
1197160	1200000	enforcement essentially maintain order in society.
1200200	1203240	It's like, yeah, you have a bunch of rogue people who might be committing crimes.
1203480	1207360	But, you know, generally the police forces and the militaries are much
1207360	1209000	better funded, have more resources.
1209240	1210880	And I think that that's basically going to be true here.
1211200	1215000	As a matter of fact, I think what you want is for open source to be widely deployed,
1215000	1218160	which I think that there's sort of a risk if it's closed, that that's not the case.
1218160	1221000	But when it's open, you're going to have all these big institutions
1221320	1225200	that have a ton of resources that they can basically deploy these systems
1225200	1227720	in a way that I think will check bad actors.
1227720	1232760	Then you get to the question of basically, you know, folks like
1232760	1235360	China or like large, sophisticated actors.
1235680	1238640	And one of the questions that you sometimes hear debated is like, OK,
1238800	1242000	if you're open sourcing the really advanced models, how do you make it so
1242000	1246360	that that it doesn't get to to China or they're not going to use that against us?
1246360	1249920	And that's sometimes an argument that people have for, hey, you should lock down development.
1249920	1252480	But I think that that's sort of missing a few things.
1252760	1256360	One is that in order for this all to work, the US has to have an advantage
1256360	1258480	in the first place or the West.
1258480	1263600	And in kind of our advantage is basically open and decentralized innovation,
1263600	1266880	where it's not just a small number of big companies or labs at startups
1266880	1271200	and universities and individuals hacking on things who are in parts of companies.
1271200	1272600	And that's a big part of it.
1272600	1273960	And you don't want to shut that down.
1273960	1277280	And I think if you do, you increase the chance that we don't even lead in the first place.
1277640	1282840	But then I think you get to the the issue, which is, OK, China or not even China,
1282840	1287480	any government, you know, there are all the risks of kind of stealing the models
1287480	1291240	and an espionage, I mean, a lot of the models fit on, you know, a hard drive
1291240	1294360	that you can quickly put in your backpack or whatever.
1294360	1300920	And it's I just think we need to be realistic about how likely it is that we can secure
1301520	1305000	and not just not us, but like any of the tech companies can secure any of these
1305680	1309240	models long term against very sophisticated efforts to do that.
1309360	1314040	So if you remember my video about the situational awareness paper by Leopold
1314080	1318080	Aschenbrenner, he specifically calls out China, but let's just use any large state
1318080	1325080	actor, the chances of being able to protect a closed source model, the weights
1325240	1328800	indefinitely is essentially zero in my mind.
1328920	1333600	How many times have US companies been hacked specifically by China and their IP stolen?
1333880	1336640	And here's the thing, it only needs to happen once.
1336960	1343120	You only need to have one minor lapse in security and then you lose the model weights.
1343240	1348120	So with the likelihood of a private company like open AI getting hacked, having their
1348120	1353600	model weights stolen, then let's just assume state actors are going to have these AI models.
1353600	1356880	So let's just make sure everybody has them.
1357000	1361280	Let's make sure all of the good guys, quote unquote, good guys, quote unquote, bad guys,
1361560	1364320	they all have the same capabilities.
1364320	1369560	And thus we're back to the original statement of it's one AI versus another AI.
1369720	1375440	My own fear is that if we lock down development, we end up in a world where basically you have
1375440	1379640	a small number of companies, plus all the adversaries who can steal the model are the
1379640	1380720	only ones who have access.
1381000	1385440	But all the startups, all the universities, all the individual hackers are kind of just
1385440	1387720	left out and don't have the ability to do this.
1387720	1396400	So my own view is that a realistic aim that we should hope for is that we use open
1396400	1400920	source to basically develop the leading and most robust ecosystem in the world, in
1400920	1407160	that we have an expectation that our companies work closely with our government and allied
1407160	1412200	governments on national security so that way our governments can persistently just be
1412200	1416240	integrating the latest technology and have, you know, whatever it is, a six month advantage,
1416240	1418040	eight month advantage on our adversaries.
1418040	1421280	And I think that that's, you know, I don't know that that in this world, you get a 10
1421280	1426240	year permanent advantage, but I think a kind of perpetual lead actually will make us more
1426240	1430960	safe in one where we're leading, then the model that others are advocating, which is,
1430960	1435080	okay, you have a small number of closed labs, they lock down development, we probably risk
1435080	1439520	being in the lead at all, like probably the other governments are getting access to it.
1439800	1441160	It's that that's my view.
1441200	1446680	I actually think on both these things, spreading prosperity for more evenly around the world,
1446680	1450680	making it so that there can be more progress and on safety, I think we're basically just
1450680	1452520	going to find over time that open source leads.
1452720	1454320	Look, there are going to be issues, right?
1454320	1455600	It's like, well, to mitigate the issues.
1455600	1456880	We're going to test everything rigorously.
1456880	1458800	We do, we work with governments and all the stuff.
1459080	1460160	We'll continue doing that.
1460520	1464440	Um, but that's my view of kind of where the equilibrium, I think we'll settle out, given
1464440	1465160	what I know today.
1465240	1470520	So next, Mark Zuckerberg is going to start talking about economic possibilities with
1470520	1471560	the use of AI.
1471560	1475600	And this is something that I'm extremely curious and excited about.
1475640	1477400	I tend to be an optimist.
1477440	1481920	I can also see the pessimist point of view here and open AI just came out with a bunch of
1481920	1485880	research talking about UBI and economic effects of AI.
1485880	1488800	And I'm going to be reading and covering that in a subsequent video.
1488960	1491520	But for now, let's see what Mark Zuckerberg has to say about it.
1491600	1496040	There's a version of this, which AI will do no matter how it's developed.
1496640	1500600	Um, and then there's a version of this that I think benefits from open source specifically.
1500600	1505040	So I think that AI has more potential than any other single technology that's
1505040	1510040	being developed right now to increase productivity, accelerate the economy, um,
1510040	1514200	make it set kind of every person has the ability to be more creative and, and,
1514440	1516320	and produce more interesting things.
1516320	1517800	And I think that that's all going to be great.
1517800	1521880	I also think I hope that it'll help out with science and, um, medical research
1521880	1523000	and things like that.
1523040	1527920	There are a lot of folks today, though, who don't necessarily have access to the
1527920	1531640	ability to fine tune or build their own state of the art models.
1531720	1535120	So they're sort of limited to what these large labs do.
1535520	1539760	Um, and like I just said, I think, um, you know, one of the defining
1539880	1544680	aspects of our culture and innovation as a sort of a country or, or society is
1544680	1547200	like, it's not just big companies that do it, right?
1547200	1550680	There's all these startups and hackers and academics and people in university.
1551040	1555800	And I think you want to give all of those folks access to state of the art models
1555800	1558720	that they can build on top of, not just that they can run, which is what they have
1558720	1563400	today with, with the closed vendors, but that they can build on top of and tweak
1563400	1567480	and distill down to smaller models that they can run on their laptop or their
1567480	1569840	phone or whatever other device they're building.
1569840	1572560	And I think that that's just going to unlock a ton of progress.
1572920	1577040	There's also a version of this where there are, you can look at it by, you know,
1577040	1578160	nation too.
1578600	1581760	Um, you know, so it's not just that startups might not have the resources
1581760	1585180	or universities might not have the resources to go train their own, um,
1585200	1588280	they know, large scale foundation models now or in the future.
1588560	1591280	But, um, but there were a lot of countries that aren't going to have
1591280	1594840	the ability to do that because I mean, you know, pretty soon these things
1594840	1597440	are going to cost many billions of dollars to train.
1597480	1602160	And I think that having the ability for different countries and entrepreneurs
1602160	1607080	and different countries and businesses to use it to serve people better and just
1607080	1612080	do better work is going to be something that, that basically like lifts all boats
1612080	1616640	around the world and, um, which just has a massive kind of equalizing effect.
1616640	1618640	So I know that that's really positive.
1618680	1622760	Here, Rowan asked Mark about specifically in his letter, which I'll
1622800	1627480	cover in another video, but he directly called out Apple in their closed approach
1627480	1631040	and Rowan asked him to elaborate on it and what are his thoughts.
1631040	1631760	So let's listen.
1631880	1637360	I mean, my point in there is more, it's a little more philosophical on how
1637360	1643760	it's affected my own kind of approach towards things and, and psychologically
1643760	1646000	sort of affected how I think about building stuff.
1646440	1649080	Um, I actually don't know how they're going to approach AI.
1649360	1651360	Um, you know, they do some open development.
1651360	1652600	I do some closed development.
1652920	1655560	Um, you know, by the way, I think it's worth noting, like, I don't actually
1655560	1657360	consider myself to be an open source as Ellen.
1657360	1660520	I just think that in this case, um, I think that open models are going to be
1660520	1662520	the standard and I think that that's going to be good for the world, but we
1662520	1664240	do open development, we do close development.
1664240	1664960	So I get it, right?
1664960	1667680	And I'm not saying that Apple is necessarily going to be on the wrong place
1667680	1672440	on this for AI, but if you look back over the last 10 or 15 years, it has
1672440	1678240	been a formative experience for us is building our services on top of platforms
1678240	1683120	that are controlled by our competitors and for a number of different incentives.
1683200	1686800	Oh, I can just sense, I can just sense the anger here.
1686880	1692160	And I can tell he's being very diplomatic about the way he's saying all of this.
1692480	1698160	But I know he got burned and, and burned for years on the fact that he had to
1698160	1703920	build his platforms during the mobile revolution, which really took over everything.
1703920	1709040	He had to build Facebook and the rest of his app portfolio on top of his competitors.
1709040	1710960	And he doesn't want to make that mistake again.
1710960	1716800	That is also likely why they invested and he invested so much in the metaverse
1716800	1722320	because he really foresaw the VR revolution as being the next computing platform.
1722320	1724480	And so he wanted to be way ahead of that.
1724480	1725600	And he was.
1725600	1730960	And although it didn't come to fruition either as quickly or at all, the way he
1731040	1734240	thought it would, AI seemingly is heading in that same direction.
1734240	1736080	And he wants to be the platform.
1736080	1737680	Meta wants to be the platform.
1737680	1743680	They absolutely, from my perspective, apply different rules to kind of limit what we can do.
1743680	1746000	And, and yeah, they have all these taxes.
1746000	1750880	And, you know, at some point we did, we've done some analysis that we think we'd be
1750880	1754880	way more profitable if it weren't for some of these arbitrary rules.
1754880	1757280	And I think a lot of other businesses would be too.
1757280	1761440	But, you know, honestly, the money part, I think it's annoying.
1761440	1762880	But for me, it's not the biggest thing.
1762880	1768160	It's, I think it's a little bit soul crushing when you go build features that are what you
1768160	1770560	believe is good for your community.
1770560	1775040	And then you're told that you can't ship them because some company wants to put you in a box
1775040	1776960	so that they can better compete with you.
1776960	1778640	Don't mess with the Zuck.
1778640	1781120	He thinks in 4D chess.
1781120	1784640	My concern for AI at this point isn't actually Apple.
1784640	1787680	It's more the other companies and how that would evolve.
1787680	1790160	And I think to some degree, it's not even that.
1790160	1792800	I'm not even saying that they're like bad people.
1792800	1797920	It's, it's, I think that there's just a physics and incentive structure to the system where,
1797920	1802400	you know, if you build a closed system, then eventually there are all these forces on you
1802400	1806960	that sort of kind of push you to, to kind of clamp down on things.
1806960	1815280	And I think that it will be a healthier ecosystem if it's developed more like the web,
1815280	1816240	but more capable.
1816240	1820320	And I think that, you know, because of how mobile developed where the closed model won,
1820320	1820560	right?
1820560	1824640	And it's like Apple, I think, has really reaped most of the benefits in terms of,
1824640	1828400	you know, they, there might be more Android phones out there, but like Apple gets like
1828400	1830800	almost all the profits of, for mobile phones.
1831360	1835360	I think there's a bit of recency bias because these are, these are long cycles.
1835360	1838800	Right? I mean, the iPhone, I think it came out in 2007, right?
1838800	1840560	So we're almost 20 years into this thing.
1840560	1845600	It's a long cycle, but it's easy to forget the fact that the closed model doesn't always win.
1846560	1852000	If you go back to PCs, now I know a lot of people have, especially if you're using the
1852000	1857120	Linux analogy, people don't necessarily consider windows to be maximally open, but compared to
1857120	1862480	the, the Apple approach of kind of coupling your operating system with, with the device,
1863200	1867040	the windows approach was a more open ecosystem and it won.
1867600	1873360	And part of my hope for the next generation of platforms, which includes both AI and the
1873360	1877760	work that we're doing and augmented in virtual reality is to, you know, meta wants to be on the
1877760	1879520	side of building the open ecosystems.
1880080	1883600	And it's not just that we want to build something that's an alternative to the closed
1883600	1887680	ecosystem. I want to restore the industry to the state where the open ecosystem is actually
1887680	1888800	the one that is leading.
1888800	1894320	As I said earlier, his motivations for doing this are clearly because he got burned.
1894320	1900720	That is why he is trying to change the way that this ecosystem is going to be developed
1900720	1902240	and play out in the long run.
1902240	1905200	And I kind of love it. I love this approach.
1905200	1912000	This is also why Elon Musk decided to open source grok because he was bitter at open AI
1912000	1916560	being closed AI, taking a bunch of his money and then eventually converting into a for-profit
1916560	1922400	company. And so there is nothing like a burned entrepreneur with a chip on their shoulder
1922400	1925920	and a little bit of spite to really drive them to innovate.
1925920	1929120	And let me tell you, I am here for it. I love it.
1929120	1932480	All right. So Rowan now asks Mark Zuckerberg about Lama 4.
1932480	1937200	And I'm sure he's already planning Lama 4, but he just released Lama 3.5.
1937200	1939520	He just released the 405B model.
1939520	1943680	And so I think all of their efforts, probably for the foreseeable future,
1943760	1949920	are going to be on iterating and innovating on Lama 3, Lama 3.1, Lama 3.2.
1949920	1953040	And they'll probably have Lama 4 cooking in the background,
1953040	1955200	but it's going to be a while before we see that.
1955200	1960880	And I'm going to guess that's probably going to come out a little bit after GPT-5 comes out.
1960880	1965680	Oh man. I mean, it's, you know, we're just doing 3.1 for Lama now.
1965680	1972080	I think it might be a little early to talk about Lama 4, but we've got the compute cluster set up.
1972400	1975040	All right. I think that was hilarious.
1975040	1979040	He's like, oh, it's probably a little bit too early to be thinking about Lama 4,
1979040	1984160	but we have all the compute necessary to do it. I absolutely love this new version of Zuck.
1984160	1988880	The data setup, we kind of have a sense of what the architecture is going to be,
1988880	1992720	and have run a bunch of research experiments to kind of max that out.
1992720	1998080	So I do think that Lama 4 is going to be another big leap on top of Lama 3.
1998080	2001520	I think we have a bunch more progress that we can make.
2001520	2003680	I mean, this is the first dot release for Lama.
2003680	2010880	There's more that I'd like to do, including launching the multimodal models, which we...
2010880	2015520	Yes. I can't wait for that. That is the one biggest missing capability between Lama 3,
2015520	2022240	4.0.5.B, and GPT-4.0. GPT-4.0 can take many different file formats, interpret them,
2022240	2026720	including images, and really that one feature I use all the time.
2027200	2031760	Unfortunately, we have not had a Lama model that is really truly multimodal,
2031760	2035920	and there have been a few fine-tuned versions that allow for multimodality,
2035920	2040240	but they don't work super well if I'm being honest. You've seen me test them on this channel,
2040240	2043840	so I can't wait for a native multimodal Lama 3.1.
2043840	2046800	We kind of had an unfortunate setback on that,
2048080	2051120	but I think we're going to be launching them probably everywhere outside of the EU.
2051840	2056400	For those who are wondering what he's talking about, just recently it was reported that they
2056400	2061360	are not going to be releasing multimodal AI in the EU strictly because of their regulations,
2061360	2067200	and that is the setback that he's talking about. I can't wait till they release it here in the US
2067200	2072080	and other countries that allow it, but not going to be in the EU, and that is one reason why they
2072080	2078480	need to ease up on the regulation in the EU, and hopefully we don't over-regulate in the US,
2078480	2082480	and from where I'm from, California. Yeah, probably a little early to talk about Lama 4,
2082960	2086640	but it is going to be awesome, and it has been one of the interesting things in running the
2086640	2095760	company is basically planning out the compute clusters and data trajectories for not just
2095760	2103520	Lama 4, but the next probably four or five versions of Lama, because these are long lead
2103520	2110480	time investments to build out these data centers and the power around them and the chip architectures
2110480	2116160	and the networking architectures, so all this stuff. So yeah, I realize that's a bit of a non-answer
2116160	2123920	for now other than just some general excitement, but I don't know, I think Lama 3 deserves at
2123920	2132320	least a week of kind of just processing what we've put out there before we get into talking
2132320	2135680	about the future. All right, I'm going to put this out into the world. I want to interview
2135680	2140240	Mark Zuckerberg, and if I'm the one who gets to interview him or one of the ones who gets to
2140240	2145280	interview him as part of the Lama 4 launch, I would love that. So if anybody from META is watching
2145280	2150640	this, please consider me. I would love to do that. All right, next, he's going to be talking about AGI
2150640	2157680	and agents, something that I've seen little bits of in the Lama 3.1 launch. They are defining their
2157680	2162160	own agent architecture, it seems, or its own language. I still haven't dug into it too deeply
2162160	2167200	yet, but I plan to, but let's see what Mark has to say about AGI and specifically agents.
2167200	2172160	I'm happy to talk about it both from a technical perspective and a product perspective, but since
2172160	2178640	we've mostly talked about the models so far, maybe I'll start with the products. So our vision
2179360	2186000	is that there should be a lot of different AIs out there in AI services, not just kind of one
2186000	2191360	singular AI. And that really informs the open source approach. It's, you know, it also informs
2191360	2197280	the product roadmap. So yeah, we have META AI. META AI is doing quite well. My goal was for it
2197280	2202960	to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year. I think we're well on track
2202960	2209120	for that. We'll probably hit it, hit that milestone, you know, a few months before the end of the year.
2209120	2215840	That's a huge statement, if true. That means that META AI has more usage than chat GPT,
2215840	2220640	which would be surprising to me because anybody who knows about AI knows about chat GPT, but they
2220640	2226640	don't necessarily know about Anthropics Clawd or other models. And many people have never even heard
2226640	2233360	of Lama before. Obviously, META has the billions of built-in user base. So it's exciting to see
2233360	2239120	that. But he's specifically talking about the META.AI product. And I believe when he's saying META AI,
2239120	2245440	it's not just META.AI, which is kind of the chat GPT competitor, but it is also each of the
2245520	2251040	implementations of META AI in each of their products, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, etc.
2251040	2257440	A lot of what we're focused on is giving every creator and every small business the ability to
2257440	2264000	create AI agents for themselves, making it so that every person on our platforms can create their own
2264000	2268080	AI agents that they want to interact with. And if you think about it, these are just
2268080	2272640	huge spaces, right? So there are hundreds of millions of small businesses in the world.
2272640	2275760	And one of the things I think is really important is basically making it
2276560	2282240	so with a relatively small amount of work, a business can basically, you know, few taps,
2283040	2289760	stand up an AI agent for themselves that can do customer support, sales, communicate with all
2289760	2294720	their people, all their customers. That's going to be hundreds of millions, maybe billions of
2294720	2300160	what kind of small business agents. Similar deal for creators. There are more than,
2300160	2303920	there's more than 200 million people on our platforms who consider themselves creators,
2303920	2309200	who basically use our platform in a way that is primarily for, you know, building a community,
2310560	2314480	you know, putting out content feel like it's kind of like a part of their job is doing that.
2315040	2318640	And they all have this basic issue, which is that there aren't enough hours in the day to engage
2318640	2322480	with their community as much as they'd like. And likewise, I think that their communities would
2322480	2327920	generally want more of their time, but, but again, not enough hours in the day. So I just think it's
2328480	2332400	there's going to be a huge unlock where basically every creator can pull in all their information
2332400	2337760	from social media, can train these systems to reflect their values and their business objectives
2337760	2343120	and what they're trying to do. And then people can interact with that. It'll be almost like this,
2343120	2349760	almost artistic artifact that creators create that people can kind of interact with in different
2349760	2353680	ways. And then, and that's not even getting into all the different ways that I think people are
2353680	2357040	going to be able to create, you know, different AI agents for themselves to do different things.
2357040	2360320	So I think we're going to live in a world where there are going to be hundreds of millions and
2360320	2364880	billions of different AI agents, eventually probably more AI agents than there are people in
2364880	2367520	the world, and that people are just going to interact with them in all these different ways.
2367520	2371840	So that's part of, you know, that's the product vision. Obviously, there's a lot of business
2371840	2375760	opportunity in that. That's where we want to go make money. So we don't want to, we're not going
2375760	2380080	to make money from selling access to the model itself. Because again, we're not a public cloud
2380080	2384960	company. We will make money by building the best products. An important ingredient to the best
2384960	2390000	products is building, is having the best models. So this is echoing exactly what Jan Lacoon told
2390000	2395360	Lex Freeman a few months ago, where he said, they're not going to make money by developing and
2395360	2400240	deploying open source models, but as being the company who can define the standards and thus
2400240	2404240	make the best products around that AI, that's going to be meta. And that's how they're going
2404240	2409120	to make money. All right, in this last section, he talks about fear of AI, why people worry about
2409120	2412800	AI, why they should, why they shouldn't. So let's take a look. I mean, financially, one thing that
2412800	2420160	I'm quite aware of is the internet had a big bubble burst before it succeeded. And it's all
2420160	2425920	the people who were very long on the internet were eventually right. But sometimes things take
2425920	2429360	a little longer to develop than you think. And you just need to have the commitment to see that
2429360	2434400	through. And that's something that I'm aware of. Because yeah, I mean, I'm really excited about,
2434400	2437280	you know, all the unlocks that we're going to get from llama three, and then llama four,
2437280	2440320	and then llama five, and I think that's going to translate into better products. But
2441200	2446080	realistically, it's hard to know in advance when something is good enough that you're going to
2446080	2451040	have a product that billions of people use. And then when it's ready to kind of be a large business.
2451040	2456240	And I mean, look, we're all spending, you know, a lot of capital and on basically training these
2456240	2459680	models. So I think that people are going to be probably losing money for quite a while.
2459680	2463840	Yeah. And that's what I've been hearing generally from the industry. Every single big tech company,
2463840	2468880	even a lot of VC dollars going into startups, they're all spending their money buying the silicon.
2468880	2474080	They are mostly buying it from Nvidia. That is why Nvidia stock price has skyrocketed over the last
2474080	2479680	couple of years. However, all of that initial investment has not necessarily translated into
2479680	2483520	revenue. In fact, I think the number is only like 30 billion in revenue, even though there's been a
2483520	2489360	trillion dollars in spend. So that's not sustainable in the long term. There is likely a mini bubble
2489360	2495760	that is going to burst eventually. But obviously I'm bullish on AI. And that's what I'm dedicating
2495760	2500160	all of my time to right now. So I believe in it in the long run. And as he said,
2500160	2506800	people who were early on the web and long on the web eventually were right. Now there was a bubble
2506800	2512640	in between that we do have to think about and consider and worry about when it comes to AI.
2512640	2517440	The other part of this that I think you are more getting at is people's concern about what it means
2517440	2523520	for their livelihoods. And on that, this is one of the reasons why I think the open source approach,
2523520	2530000	the approach of lots of different models out there that are kind of personalized and customized to
2530000	2537680	every business and every creator and every person. I think that's important because if this develops
2537680	2544960	in a way where it's just a small number of companies that build the products and benefit
2544960	2549920	and people use the products and maybe they like talking to an AI assistant and that's valuable
2549920	2558560	for them. But if this doesn't in some way help lift all boats, then I think you end up eventually
2558560	2565360	getting a backlash. And part of what I've spent some time thinking about after just looking at how
2565920	2572480	the kind of Web 2.0 stuff developed is in the next generation of technologies around AI,
2572560	2582080	around AR and VR. How do we create not just a thriving set of products and economic productivity
2582080	2587280	gains, but how do we have a better and more sustainable political economy around it where
2587280	2592720	there's just way more people who feel like they're kind of bought in or benefiting from this
2593360	2599760	in support of the system? And I thought we did that reasonably well with social media,
2600320	2605040	but just looking at some of the feedback and some of the response from the world,
2605920	2609360	I think that it's going to be important to do that even better with AI and some of the new
2609360	2614480	technologies in order to mitigate some of the concerns that people are going to have about
2614480	2618320	what this is going to mean for their livelihoods and jobs and their lives.
2618320	2622080	So we're going to end it there. I think that is a great place to end it. Something for us to think
2622080	2628800	about over the coming weeks, months and years, incredibly important stuff. I'm so excited to see
2628880	2633760	all the different innovations that come from Lama 3.1, whether we're talking about an extremely
2633760	2640320	capable model that can fit on your phone or on your laptop, or the massive 405B model that is
2640320	2645360	as capable as any closed source frontier model. If you enjoyed this video, please consider giving
