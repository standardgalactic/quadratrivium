1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Given a particular matrix if you want to compute its trace, you will be basically adding up the

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:13,440
diagonal entries. But this is quite an algebraic approach in thinking about trace. Can we visualize

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,440
what's really happening when we add these diagonal entries? The visualization will also

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,080
explain many properties of trace you might have seen. There is one particular property that I'm

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,440
saving for the end of the video series, which is traceab equals traceba. However,

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:41,280
in the majority of cases where one of a or b is invertible, we can derive it using one of the other

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,960
properties. But in any case, let's start the visualization. At the end of the previous video,

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,480
we have described a matrix as a vector field. Let's expand on that a little bit.

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,520
If you are given a matrix a, then the vector field would be constructed by attaching every

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:09,520
point with position vector x by the vector ax. A little note on the illustration on screen here.

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,000
Technically, if this illustration really describes ax, then the vector field would

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
look very messy because some of the vectors would be too long. So the usual thing to do

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,040
is to standardize the lengths of the vectors, which will still give you the direction,

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,160
and if you really need the length, then add colors to indicate how long the vector should have been.

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,480
In particular, these two vectors are the important ones because they are the vectors

16
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:48,960
attached to the points 1, 0 and 0, 1 respectively. The vector attached to 1, 0 would be the first

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,120
column of A, while the vector attached to 0, 1 would be the second column of A.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,720
With this visualization of matrices, the intuition for trace is just one sentence.

19
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,880
The trace of A is the divergence of this vector field created by the matrix A.

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,920
We are going to see what divergence is. Now I am aware that this has been talked about on YouTube,

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,840
but I want to be more quantitative, so bear with me if you already knew the visual intuition

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,960
of divergence. Given a particular vector field, we can define divergence at a point,

23
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:36,960
say this red dot. We now consider a very small region around this dot, and write down the area

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:44,720
of this small region. The next thing is to let every point in this small region evolve together

25
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:52,960
along the vector field. As you see, the area of this region changes. For divergence, we are

26
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:00,480
interested in thinking about how quickly the area changes initially, per area, as the area of the

27
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,480
initial region shrinks to 0. In this case, let's look at how the area evolves again. We can see

28
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,520
that it initially decreases, and in fact keeps decreasing along the way, so because the area

29
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:23,280
change is negative, we have the divergence at this red dot to also be negative. However,

30
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:31,200
one reminder is that this rate of area change is per area. In this case, if we compare the final

31
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,880
area with the initial area, we can record a change of negative 0.148 during the evolution.

32
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,720
Now, if we quadruple the initial area and again play the same game and let this area evolve

33
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:55,680
under the flow of the vector field, and this time, we record a change of negative 0.595 in area.

34
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:04,480
If we compare this change to the previous area change, this is exactly a factor of 4 accounting

35
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:12,480
for rounding errors in my computer simulation. So, in our intuition of divergence, the per area

36
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:20,160
part is very important. So that's the divergence part, but why is this related to the trace of

37
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,720
the matrix generating the vector field? Actually, the first question that comes up would be that the

38
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,680
divergence is a local property. This means that if we consider another point on the vector field,

39
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,320
the divergence could be different. So, why does this statement seem like the divergence is the

40
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,360
same everywhere? Well, it's because it is, but just in this specific case, where everything is

41
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,880
generated by the matrix A. To see why the divergence is the same everywhere, let's first denote this

42
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:02,720
point with its position vector x and any point within our small region around x to be x plus d

43
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:11,600
for small displacements d from x. Now, the vectors attached to those two points are A x and A x plus

44
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,160
d respectively. This means that the initial displacement between these two points is d,

45
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,440
and after a very short time epsilon, the displacement is increased by epsilon times

46
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,960
A d. Here, A d is the difference in their velocities or the rate where they drift apart.

47
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,720
However, notice that there is absolutely no x here. This result does not depend on x.

48
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,320
So, if we have this exact shape of the small region, let's illustrate it with just three points,

49
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,280
each with displacements d i from the point we try to compute the divergence of.

50
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:02,080
After a short epsilon period of time, the displacements are changed to d i plus epsilon

51
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:11,360
A d i. But these are independent of our position. So, even if we have this initial region elsewhere,

52
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:20,080
we will still have the exact same shape after time epsilon. The change in area is the same

53
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,600
everywhere. Because the divergence is the area change per area, divergence is the same

54
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,880
everywhere in this case. This also means we can choose a convenient region to see how its area

55
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:42,320
changes, and this region doesn't have to be infinitesimal either. This is because if we chop

56
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:50,640
any normal region into very small ones, then from our intuition of divergence, each small region U i

57
00:06:51,200 --> 00:07:00,400
has its area changed from A i to A i times 1 plus epsilon times divergence after time epsilon.

58
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,720
Most importantly, we know now that divergence is the same across all these regions. So, for the

59
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:16,720
entire region U, which has its area being the sum of these small regions, would also scale by the

60
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:24,560
same factor of 1 plus epsilon times divergence. Since we can basically choose any region to see

61
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:33,120
how the area evolves, a convenient choice is the unit square containing points 1 0 and 0 1,

62
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,680
as the initial area would automatically be 1. So, we focus on the rate of area change.

63
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:48,880
If we suppose that A is the square matrix A, B, C, D, then as said before, the vector attached

64
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:56,800
to 1 0 would be the first column A, C, and the vector attached to 0 1 would be the second column,

65
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:06,800
B, D. Let's focus on the point 1 0 and its attached vector A, C. Here, its vertical component doesn't

66
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,520
really matter here, because it doesn't change the area of the region. The base and height of the

67
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,080
parallelogram have not changed. So, the vertical component doesn't matter, but what about the

68
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:29,200
horizontal component? This time, it matters. The area has changed. The rate of change here is given

69
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:37,200
by precisely the horizontal component of the attached vector, which is A. You can run a very

70
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:44,480
similar argument on the other point 0 1 here. This time, the horizontal component does not matter,

71
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,880
because again, the area wouldn't change in that case, and the vertical component provides the

72
00:08:50,880 --> 00:09:00,320
change in area. In this case, the vertical component is D. So, altogether, the rate of change in area

73
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:08,560
would be A plus D, which is exactly the sum of the diagonal entries of the matrix A. So,

74
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,120
we have demonstrated that trace is really the divergence of the vector field. Now,

75
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,200
if you are not convinced by these horizontal component or vertical component arguments,

76
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,560
all we are doing is computing the determinant of this slightly different matrix. The first column

77
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:36,560
is where the point 1 0 moves to after time epsilon with this velocity A C. Similarly,

78
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:44,480
the second column is where the point 0 1 moves to after time epsilon with the velocity B D.

79
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,840
If you actually compute this determinant, then we see that this is really the rate of change

80
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:59,200
of the area. That is also the trace. Anyway, the fact that trace is just the divergence of the

81
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:06,720
vector field is very useful for understanding the many properties of trace, and these properties

82
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,840
one by one would be the focus of the video from this point onwards. Let's first start with why

83
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:21,840
trace is the sum of eigenvalues. When visualizing matrices this way with vector fields, if the

84
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:30,000
position vector x is an eigenvector of A, then the vector attached to it, which is A x, would face

85
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,200
the same or opposite direction as the position vector. In fact, once you are on this line,

86
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,120
you will stay on this line because the position and velocity vectors are both on this line.

87
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,560
In the case where there are two such lines, where the position vector and the velocity

88
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,960
vector attached are on the same line, then to investigate the divergence of the vector field

89
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:02,560
and hence the trace, one convenient choice of region is a parallelogram aligned with these two

90
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:09,680
lines. Let's label the two lines by their eigenvalues lambda 1 and lambda 2 respectively.

91
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:18,480
And let's say the side lengths of the parallelogram are A and B. Focus on this corner of the

92
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,440
parallelogram. The length of the vector attached to it should be lambda 1A. That's because on

93
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:33,760
this line, every position vector satisfies A x equals lambda 1 x. Since the position vector has

94
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:41,920
length A in our notation, the vector attached to it should be with length lambda 1A. So after a

95
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:49,440
very short time epsilon, we should have an extra length of epsilon lambda 1A along this line.

96
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,480
Using the same argument on the other corner of the parallelogram,

97
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,680
the extra length on the other line would be epsilon lambda 2B after time epsilon.

98
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:09,920
In this illustration, lambda 2 is negative, so the so-called extra length is actually length

99
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,080
lost. So after a short time epsilon, the length along this lambda 2 line would be

100
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:25,760
B x 1 plus epsilon lambda 2, and similarly the length along the lambda 1 line would be A x 1

101
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:34,160
plus epsilon lambda 1. The new area is the product of the side lengths and sine theta,

102
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:42,400
where theta is the angle between these two lines. Compare this with the old area, which is AB sine

103
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:49,120
theta. If we now compute the divergence of this vector field, which is the rate of area change

104
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,880
per area, then we would have this expression, which is new area minus the old area over the

105
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:05,360
time period of epsilon, divided by the initial area, which is AB sine theta. If you really compute

106
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:14,880
this, we would have lambda 1 plus lambda 2 plus a small bit involving epsilon. However, as epsilon

107
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,800
tends to zero, then the epsilon bit does not contribute, and we are left with the sum of

108
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:28,960
eigenvalues. So the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues in this illustration. So this is the

109
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:36,320
first property of trace. The next property has something to do with the exponential of matrices,

110
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:43,520
which I have described in the previous video as well. Essentially, given a vector field created by

111
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:52,080
the matrix A, the flow of this point with position vector x along the vector field is precisely given

112
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:59,280
by e to the ta applied to x, where t is the time elapsed when you flow along the field.

113
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,040
The determinant of a matrix is the scale factor of this unit square under the matrix transformation.

114
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,240
Applying the matrix e to the ta to this square is equivalent to letting the region flow along the

115
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,440
vector field, so the area of whatever we end up with is the determinant of the matrix exponential.

116
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,560
And we actually know how the areas evolve along this vector flow. Let's denote the area of this

117
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:37,280
region as s of t, which depends on time elapsed along the vector field. The trace of a is the rate

118
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:43,360
of area change per area, with the rate of change in area being the derivative of s,

119
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:53,040
and the area being s of t itself. By rearranging this formula, we obtain a differential equation

120
00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:00,880
in s. Note that the trace of a does not depend on t, it is a constant, so the determinant s of t

121
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:09,520
can be solved as e to the t times trace of a. This neatly explains why the determinant of the

122
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:17,840
exponential matrix is the exponential of trace. Now let's go to the property that the trace is

123
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:25,120
independent of basis vectors. Given the matrix a, as usual we consider the vector field

124
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,600
generated. This time, we apply a linear transformation q to the whole picture.

125
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:39,360
In general, where the vectors emanate from would change, and the vectors attached would also change.

126
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:49,280
More specifically, what had been x is now transformed to qx, and what used to be ax is now

127
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:57,120
qax. This one needs a bit of explanation. Initially, the attached vector to the point x

128
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:05,680
is going from point x to x plus ax, so when we apply the transformation q on the whole picture,

129
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:15,840
then the attached vector goes from qx to qx plus qax, so this attached vector is qax.

130
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:26,080
Now let's call this new position vector y, then in terms of y, the attached vector is qa

131
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:36,560
qinverse y, if q is invertible. So for any position vector y, the attached vector is qa qinverse y,

132
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:44,320
which suggests that this is actually the vector field of another matrix, qa qinverse.

133
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,840
Now the trace is the rate of change in area per area, but in applying q to the whole thing,

134
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,600
all areas scale by the determinant of q, and this factor of determinant cancels

135
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:08,720
when we consider the quotient. So in other words, the trace of a equals the trace of qa qinverse,

136
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:16,400
or if you want to go for the usual change of basis formula p inverse ap, simply substitute the matrix

137
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:25,200
q as p inverse. Using this relation, we are able to derive another famous property of trace,

138
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:33,040
which starts from rewriting trace of ab. If b is invertible, then we can simply add in

139
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:41,280
b inverse b, and the expression stays the same. However, written like this, we can use the property

140
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:49,680
we just derived, and then we can obtain, it is the trace of ba. Now this property of trace

141
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:57,200
is perhaps more well known, but we have done a bit of algebra to get here. There is a better way,

142
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,200
but we will need to introduce the concept of lee bracket, a story for another time.

143
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,480
So we can obtain this property of trace by transforming the whole plane by p inverse,

144
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:18,000
and the final property we will see is this perhaps less famous formula. This formula is known as

145
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,080
Jacobi's formula for a matrix A that depends on time t. Well technically, this is only true if

146
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:33,200
a of t in this formula is invertible, because there is a inverse in the formula. A more general

147
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:40,640
formula involves the adjoint matrix, which is defined even if a is not invertible. But for the

148
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:48,320
purpose of visualization, we are going to assume a is invertible and try to understand this formula

149
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:56,080
first. First off, what does the left hand side really mean? The determinant can refer to the area

150
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:05,120
of a parallelogram, described by a of t acting on the two basis vectors. This area will change

151
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:14,800
because a itself evolves with time. In fact, these points would also change as a changes. The rate at

152
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:23,200
which these corners move is exactly a prime of t acting on the basis vectors. If we can somehow

153
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:31,120
make this into a whole vector field generated by the matrix m, then we know how the area evolves.

154
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:39,040
Specifically, we know that the trace of m is the rate of area change per area. In this case,

155
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:46,160
the rate of area change is the derivative of determinant of a, and the area is of course

156
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:54,000
just the determinant of a itself. So, if we rearrange this, then we have something that

157
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,520
really looks like the Tobi formula. The problem now is, what is m? What is the matrix m that

158
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:08,880
generates this vector field? Now, particularly at the points a of t acting on the basis vectors,

159
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,520
we know what the vectors attached should be. To go from the position vectors to the attached

160
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:24,240
vectors, we can simply apply a prime a inverse on the position vectors. So, the matrix m we are

161
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:32,880
looking for is a prime a inverse. If we go back to what we have obtained previously about derivative

162
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:42,240
of determinant, we simply substitute the matrix m to be a prime a inverse. This is almost the same

163
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,880
as Jacobi's formula, just that the matrix in the trace has the other order in multiplication,

164
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:56,400
a inverse before a prime here. Don't worry, there are two approaches here. Either use the

165
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:05,120
property we discovered that trace a b equals trace b a for a or b being invertible, or similar to how

166
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:13,200
we dealt with the previous property, we just apply a inverse to the whole picture. In that case,

167
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:21,040
the corners of the parallelogram go back to the standard places 1 0 and 0 1, but the vectors

168
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:29,200
attached to these places are a inverse a prime acting on the basis vectors. This is because

169
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,480
previously they were just a prime acting on them, but we have applied a inverse to the whole picture.

170
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:45,200
This means that the matrix generating the vector field would be a inverse a prime, and the matrix

171
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:52,480
m to be put into the formula that we derived previously would be a inverse a prime. And

172
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,040
this is exactly the Jacobi's formula where the matrices in the trace are in the right order.

173
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:08,240
a inverse a prime. So this is the Jacobi's formula derived in the case when a is invertible. We are

174
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:16,000
able to derive and understand many properties of trace visually by thinking of trace as divergence,

175
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,880
or the rate of area change per area, when the area evolves along the vector field.
