Checking Mathemaniac/Matrix trace isn't just summing the diagonal ｜ Lie groups, algebras, brackets #5.txt
1. **Trace and Area**: The trace of a matrix in a 2x2 case can be visualized as the rate of change of area with respect to the area itself when transformations are applied to a plane. For a general n x n matrix, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements.

2. **Trace and Change of Basis**: If we apply a transformation matrix `p` (which could be `qaq^-1`) to a matrix `A`, the trace of `A` remains unchanged because the area scaling factor (determant of `q`) cancels out when considering the quotient of areas.

3. **Trace and Invertibility**: For two invertible matrices `A` and `B`, the trace of `AB` is the same as the trace of `BA`. This can be derived by using a change of basis or by introducing a transformation that brings points back to their original positions but with vectors attached that represent the action of `A`'s derivative.

4. **Jacobi's Formula**: This formula describes how the determinant of a matrix changes over time, given its derivative (denoted as `A'` for matrix `A` at time `t`). If `A(t)` is invertible, Jacobi's formula states that the rate of change of the determinant of `A(t)` is equal to the trace of `A'(t)`.

5. **Visualization of Jacobi's Formula**: The visualization involves a parallelogram whose area is determined by the matrix `A(t)`. The corners of this parallelogram move over time due to the transformation represented by `A'(t)`. To find the rate of change of the area, we consider the vector field generated by `A'(t)` and compute the trace of the matrix that would generate this vector field at the points where `A(t)` acts on the basis vectors. This matrix is `A'(t)A(t)^-1`, which is the Jacobian matrix of the transformation defined by `A(t)`.

6. **Deriving Jacobi's Formula**: The matrix that generates the vector field at the points where `A(t)` acts on the basis vectors is `A'(t)A(t)^-1`. This leads to Jacobi's formula, which is the trace of `A'(t)A(t)^-1`, when `A(t)` is invertible.

In summary, we have visually and algebraically derived Jacobi's formula for the rate of change of the determinant of a matrix `A(t)` as the trace of its derivative `A'(t)` at time `t`. This involves understanding transformations, the concept of area in linear algebra, and how derivatives affect these areas.

Checking Mathemaniac/Random walks in 2D and 3D are fundamentally different (Markov chains approach).txt
1. **Recurrence vs Transience in Random Walks**: In a random walk, a particle moves step by step in a particular space (2D or 3D), with each step being equally likely to be in any of the available directions. The question of whether the particle will eventually return to its starting point—whether the random walk is recurrent or transient—depends on whether the series summing the probabilities of returning to the origin after exactly n steps converges or diverges.

2. **Calculating Return Probabilities**: The probability of returning to the origin in a 2D random walk after exactly n steps is given by the formula (1/4)^(n-1) * (2n choose n) / 2^(2n). In a 3D random walk, this probability is (1/6)^(n-1) * (3n choose n) / 3^(3n). Here, "choose" represents the binomial coefficient.

3. **Factorial Overcounting**: The binomial coefficients overcount different permutations of return moves, especially when considering interpermutations between the fixed movement sequences (like left-right or up-down-front-back in 2D and 3D, respectively). To correct for this, we divide the total number of return paths by all the factorial terms that represent these permutations.

4. **Number of Return Paths**: For a given i (where i can range from 0 to n), the number of return paths is two times the binomial coefficient divided by i! and (n-i)! in 2D, and three times the binomial coefficient divided by i!, (j=i)j!, and (n-i)! in 3D.

5. **Convergence and Divergence**: The series representing the return probabilities converges for 3D random walks and diverges for 2D random walks. This is because each term in the series for 2D scales like 1/n, which is analogous to the harmonic series (which diverges). In contrast, each term in the series for 3D scales like 1/(3^(3/2) * n^(1/2)), which leads to a convergent series.

6. **Inner-Outer Region Explanation**: The distinction between recurrence and transience in different dimensions can also be explained using the concept of an inner region (where the particle has a high probability of returning to the origin) versus an outer region (where the probability of return decreases significantly). In 2D, the inner and outer regions are close in scale, but in 3D, the outer region is much larger relative to the inner region, making it less likely for the particle to return after venturing too far away.

7. **Cambridge Math Student Connection**: The connection between the recurrence of random walks and Stein's paradox is mentioned as an example of how different problems in mathematics can sometimes have surprising links, particularly in higher dimensions (2D and 3D). This connection is explored further in Larry Brown's 1971 paper.
