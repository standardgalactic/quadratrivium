00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
Given a particular matrix if you want to compute its trace, you will be basically adding up the

00:05.760 --> 00:13.440
diagonal entries. But this is quite an algebraic approach in thinking about trace. Can we visualize

00:13.440 --> 00:19.440
what's really happening when we add these diagonal entries? The visualization will also

00:19.440 --> 00:26.080
explain many properties of trace you might have seen. There is one particular property that I'm

00:26.080 --> 00:33.440
saving for the end of the video series, which is traceab equals traceba. However,

00:33.440 --> 00:41.280
in the majority of cases where one of a or b is invertible, we can derive it using one of the other

00:41.280 --> 00:48.960
properties. But in any case, let's start the visualization. At the end of the previous video,

00:48.960 --> 00:54.480
we have described a matrix as a vector field. Let's expand on that a little bit.

00:55.200 --> 01:01.520
If you are given a matrix a, then the vector field would be constructed by attaching every

01:01.520 --> 01:09.520
point with position vector x by the vector ax. A little note on the illustration on screen here.

01:10.240 --> 01:16.000
Technically, if this illustration really describes ax, then the vector field would

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
look very messy because some of the vectors would be too long. So the usual thing to do

01:22.000 --> 01:27.040
is to standardize the lengths of the vectors, which will still give you the direction,

01:27.600 --> 01:34.160
and if you really need the length, then add colors to indicate how long the vector should have been.

01:34.960 --> 01:40.480
In particular, these two vectors are the important ones because they are the vectors

01:40.480 --> 01:48.960
attached to the points 1, 0 and 0, 1 respectively. The vector attached to 1, 0 would be the first

01:48.960 --> 01:55.120
column of A, while the vector attached to 0, 1 would be the second column of A.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.720
With this visualization of matrices, the intuition for trace is just one sentence.

02:02.720 --> 02:08.880
The trace of A is the divergence of this vector field created by the matrix A.

02:09.840 --> 02:15.920
We are going to see what divergence is. Now I am aware that this has been talked about on YouTube,

02:16.000 --> 02:21.840
but I want to be more quantitative, so bear with me if you already knew the visual intuition

02:21.840 --> 02:28.960
of divergence. Given a particular vector field, we can define divergence at a point,

02:28.960 --> 02:36.960
say this red dot. We now consider a very small region around this dot, and write down the area

02:36.960 --> 02:44.720
of this small region. The next thing is to let every point in this small region evolve together

02:44.720 --> 02:52.960
along the vector field. As you see, the area of this region changes. For divergence, we are

02:52.960 --> 03:00.480
interested in thinking about how quickly the area changes initially, per area, as the area of the

03:00.480 --> 03:08.480
initial region shrinks to 0. In this case, let's look at how the area evolves again. We can see

03:08.480 --> 03:15.520
that it initially decreases, and in fact keeps decreasing along the way, so because the area

03:15.520 --> 03:23.280
change is negative, we have the divergence at this red dot to also be negative. However,

03:23.280 --> 03:31.200
one reminder is that this rate of area change is per area. In this case, if we compare the final

03:31.200 --> 03:38.880
area with the initial area, we can record a change of negative 0.148 during the evolution.

03:39.600 --> 03:46.720
Now, if we quadruple the initial area and again play the same game and let this area evolve

03:46.720 --> 03:55.680
under the flow of the vector field, and this time, we record a change of negative 0.595 in area.

03:56.320 --> 04:04.480
If we compare this change to the previous area change, this is exactly a factor of 4 accounting

04:04.480 --> 04:12.480
for rounding errors in my computer simulation. So, in our intuition of divergence, the per area

04:12.480 --> 04:20.160
part is very important. So that's the divergence part, but why is this related to the trace of

04:20.160 --> 04:26.720
the matrix generating the vector field? Actually, the first question that comes up would be that the

04:26.720 --> 04:33.680
divergence is a local property. This means that if we consider another point on the vector field,

04:33.680 --> 04:40.320
the divergence could be different. So, why does this statement seem like the divergence is the

04:40.320 --> 04:47.360
same everywhere? Well, it's because it is, but just in this specific case, where everything is

04:47.440 --> 04:54.880
generated by the matrix A. To see why the divergence is the same everywhere, let's first denote this

04:54.880 --> 05:02.720
point with its position vector x and any point within our small region around x to be x plus d

05:02.720 --> 05:11.600
for small displacements d from x. Now, the vectors attached to those two points are A x and A x plus

05:11.600 --> 05:18.160
d respectively. This means that the initial displacement between these two points is d,

05:18.800 --> 05:25.440
and after a very short time epsilon, the displacement is increased by epsilon times

05:25.440 --> 05:32.960
A d. Here, A d is the difference in their velocities or the rate where they drift apart.

05:33.520 --> 05:40.720
However, notice that there is absolutely no x here. This result does not depend on x.

05:41.760 --> 05:48.320
So, if we have this exact shape of the small region, let's illustrate it with just three points,

05:48.320 --> 05:53.280
each with displacements d i from the point we try to compute the divergence of.

05:54.480 --> 06:02.080
After a short epsilon period of time, the displacements are changed to d i plus epsilon

06:02.080 --> 06:11.360
A d i. But these are independent of our position. So, even if we have this initial region elsewhere,

06:11.920 --> 06:20.080
we will still have the exact same shape after time epsilon. The change in area is the same

06:20.080 --> 06:27.600
everywhere. Because the divergence is the area change per area, divergence is the same

06:27.600 --> 06:34.880
everywhere in this case. This also means we can choose a convenient region to see how its area

06:34.880 --> 06:42.320
changes, and this region doesn't have to be infinitesimal either. This is because if we chop

06:42.320 --> 06:50.640
any normal region into very small ones, then from our intuition of divergence, each small region U i

06:51.200 --> 07:00.400
has its area changed from A i to A i times 1 plus epsilon times divergence after time epsilon.

07:01.120 --> 07:08.720
Most importantly, we know now that divergence is the same across all these regions. So, for the

07:08.720 --> 07:16.720
entire region U, which has its area being the sum of these small regions, would also scale by the

07:16.720 --> 07:24.560
same factor of 1 plus epsilon times divergence. Since we can basically choose any region to see

07:24.560 --> 07:33.120
how the area evolves, a convenient choice is the unit square containing points 1 0 and 0 1,

07:33.120 --> 07:39.680
as the initial area would automatically be 1. So, we focus on the rate of area change.

07:40.880 --> 07:48.880
If we suppose that A is the square matrix A, B, C, D, then as said before, the vector attached

07:48.880 --> 07:56.800
to 1 0 would be the first column A, C, and the vector attached to 0 1 would be the second column,

07:56.800 --> 08:06.800
B, D. Let's focus on the point 1 0 and its attached vector A, C. Here, its vertical component doesn't

08:06.800 --> 08:13.520
really matter here, because it doesn't change the area of the region. The base and height of the

08:13.520 --> 08:20.080
parallelogram have not changed. So, the vertical component doesn't matter, but what about the

08:20.080 --> 08:29.200
horizontal component? This time, it matters. The area has changed. The rate of change here is given

08:29.200 --> 08:37.200
by precisely the horizontal component of the attached vector, which is A. You can run a very

08:37.280 --> 08:44.480
similar argument on the other point 0 1 here. This time, the horizontal component does not matter,

08:44.480 --> 08:50.880
because again, the area wouldn't change in that case, and the vertical component provides the

08:50.880 --> 09:00.320
change in area. In this case, the vertical component is D. So, altogether, the rate of change in area

09:00.320 --> 09:08.560
would be A plus D, which is exactly the sum of the diagonal entries of the matrix A. So,

09:08.560 --> 09:15.120
we have demonstrated that trace is really the divergence of the vector field. Now,

09:15.120 --> 09:21.200
if you are not convinced by these horizontal component or vertical component arguments,

09:21.200 --> 09:28.560
all we are doing is computing the determinant of this slightly different matrix. The first column

09:28.560 --> 09:36.560
is where the point 1 0 moves to after time epsilon with this velocity A C. Similarly,

09:36.560 --> 09:44.480
the second column is where the point 0 1 moves to after time epsilon with the velocity B D.

09:45.440 --> 09:51.840
If you actually compute this determinant, then we see that this is really the rate of change

09:51.840 --> 09:59.200
of the area. That is also the trace. Anyway, the fact that trace is just the divergence of the

09:59.200 --> 10:06.720
vector field is very useful for understanding the many properties of trace, and these properties

10:06.720 --> 10:13.840
one by one would be the focus of the video from this point onwards. Let's first start with why

10:13.840 --> 10:21.840
trace is the sum of eigenvalues. When visualizing matrices this way with vector fields, if the

10:21.840 --> 10:30.000
position vector x is an eigenvector of A, then the vector attached to it, which is A x, would face

10:30.000 --> 10:37.200
the same or opposite direction as the position vector. In fact, once you are on this line,

10:37.200 --> 10:43.120
you will stay on this line because the position and velocity vectors are both on this line.

10:44.080 --> 10:48.560
In the case where there are two such lines, where the position vector and the velocity

10:48.560 --> 10:54.960
vector attached are on the same line, then to investigate the divergence of the vector field

10:54.960 --> 11:02.560
and hence the trace, one convenient choice of region is a parallelogram aligned with these two

11:02.560 --> 11:09.680
lines. Let's label the two lines by their eigenvalues lambda 1 and lambda 2 respectively.

11:10.400 --> 11:18.480
And let's say the side lengths of the parallelogram are A and B. Focus on this corner of the

11:18.480 --> 11:25.440
parallelogram. The length of the vector attached to it should be lambda 1A. That's because on

11:25.440 --> 11:33.760
this line, every position vector satisfies A x equals lambda 1 x. Since the position vector has

11:33.760 --> 11:41.920
length A in our notation, the vector attached to it should be with length lambda 1A. So after a

11:41.920 --> 11:49.440
very short time epsilon, we should have an extra length of epsilon lambda 1A along this line.

11:50.240 --> 11:54.480
Using the same argument on the other corner of the parallelogram,

11:54.480 --> 12:01.680
the extra length on the other line would be epsilon lambda 2B after time epsilon.

12:02.400 --> 12:09.920
In this illustration, lambda 2 is negative, so the so-called extra length is actually length

12:09.920 --> 12:16.080
lost. So after a short time epsilon, the length along this lambda 2 line would be

12:16.640 --> 12:25.760
B x 1 plus epsilon lambda 2, and similarly the length along the lambda 1 line would be A x 1

12:25.760 --> 12:34.160
plus epsilon lambda 1. The new area is the product of the side lengths and sine theta,

12:34.160 --> 12:42.400
where theta is the angle between these two lines. Compare this with the old area, which is AB sine

12:42.400 --> 12:49.120
theta. If we now compute the divergence of this vector field, which is the rate of area change

12:49.120 --> 12:56.880
per area, then we would have this expression, which is new area minus the old area over the

12:56.880 --> 13:05.360
time period of epsilon, divided by the initial area, which is AB sine theta. If you really compute

13:05.360 --> 13:14.880
this, we would have lambda 1 plus lambda 2 plus a small bit involving epsilon. However, as epsilon

13:14.880 --> 13:20.800
tends to zero, then the epsilon bit does not contribute, and we are left with the sum of

13:20.800 --> 13:28.960
eigenvalues. So the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues in this illustration. So this is the

13:28.960 --> 13:36.320
first property of trace. The next property has something to do with the exponential of matrices,

13:36.320 --> 13:43.520
which I have described in the previous video as well. Essentially, given a vector field created by

13:43.520 --> 13:52.080
the matrix A, the flow of this point with position vector x along the vector field is precisely given

13:52.080 --> 13:59.280
by e to the ta applied to x, where t is the time elapsed when you flow along the field.

14:00.000 --> 14:07.040
The determinant of a matrix is the scale factor of this unit square under the matrix transformation.

14:07.680 --> 14:14.240
Applying the matrix e to the ta to this square is equivalent to letting the region flow along the

14:14.240 --> 14:21.440
vector field, so the area of whatever we end up with is the determinant of the matrix exponential.

14:22.160 --> 14:28.560
And we actually know how the areas evolve along this vector flow. Let's denote the area of this

14:28.560 --> 14:37.280
region as s of t, which depends on time elapsed along the vector field. The trace of a is the rate

14:37.280 --> 14:43.360
of area change per area, with the rate of change in area being the derivative of s,

14:44.000 --> 14:53.040
and the area being s of t itself. By rearranging this formula, we obtain a differential equation

14:53.120 --> 15:00.880
in s. Note that the trace of a does not depend on t, it is a constant, so the determinant s of t

15:00.880 --> 15:09.520
can be solved as e to the t times trace of a. This neatly explains why the determinant of the

15:09.520 --> 15:17.840
exponential matrix is the exponential of trace. Now let's go to the property that the trace is

15:17.840 --> 15:25.120
independent of basis vectors. Given the matrix a, as usual we consider the vector field

15:25.120 --> 15:31.600
generated. This time, we apply a linear transformation q to the whole picture.

15:32.400 --> 15:39.360
In general, where the vectors emanate from would change, and the vectors attached would also change.

15:39.920 --> 15:49.280
More specifically, what had been x is now transformed to qx, and what used to be ax is now

15:49.280 --> 15:57.120
qax. This one needs a bit of explanation. Initially, the attached vector to the point x

15:57.120 --> 16:05.680
is going from point x to x plus ax, so when we apply the transformation q on the whole picture,

16:05.760 --> 16:15.840
then the attached vector goes from qx to qx plus qax, so this attached vector is qax.

16:16.960 --> 16:26.080
Now let's call this new position vector y, then in terms of y, the attached vector is qa

16:26.080 --> 16:36.560
qinverse y, if q is invertible. So for any position vector y, the attached vector is qa qinverse y,

16:36.560 --> 16:44.320
which suggests that this is actually the vector field of another matrix, qa qinverse.

16:45.280 --> 16:51.840
Now the trace is the rate of change in area per area, but in applying q to the whole thing,

16:52.480 --> 16:59.600
all areas scale by the determinant of q, and this factor of determinant cancels

16:59.600 --> 17:08.720
when we consider the quotient. So in other words, the trace of a equals the trace of qa qinverse,

17:09.280 --> 17:16.400
or if you want to go for the usual change of basis formula p inverse ap, simply substitute the matrix

17:16.400 --> 17:25.200
q as p inverse. Using this relation, we are able to derive another famous property of trace,

17:25.200 --> 17:33.040
which starts from rewriting trace of ab. If b is invertible, then we can simply add in

17:33.040 --> 17:41.280
b inverse b, and the expression stays the same. However, written like this, we can use the property

17:41.280 --> 17:49.680
we just derived, and then we can obtain, it is the trace of ba. Now this property of trace

17:49.680 --> 17:57.200
is perhaps more well known, but we have done a bit of algebra to get here. There is a better way,

17:57.200 --> 18:03.200
but we will need to introduce the concept of lee bracket, a story for another time.

18:04.000 --> 18:10.480
So we can obtain this property of trace by transforming the whole plane by p inverse,

18:10.480 --> 18:18.000
and the final property we will see is this perhaps less famous formula. This formula is known as

18:18.000 --> 18:26.080
Jacobi's formula for a matrix A that depends on time t. Well technically, this is only true if

18:26.080 --> 18:33.200
a of t in this formula is invertible, because there is a inverse in the formula. A more general

18:33.200 --> 18:40.640
formula involves the adjoint matrix, which is defined even if a is not invertible. But for the

18:40.640 --> 18:48.320
purpose of visualization, we are going to assume a is invertible and try to understand this formula

18:48.320 --> 18:56.080
first. First off, what does the left hand side really mean? The determinant can refer to the area

18:56.080 --> 19:05.120
of a parallelogram, described by a of t acting on the two basis vectors. This area will change

19:05.120 --> 19:14.800
because a itself evolves with time. In fact, these points would also change as a changes. The rate at

19:14.800 --> 19:23.200
which these corners move is exactly a prime of t acting on the basis vectors. If we can somehow

19:23.200 --> 19:31.120
make this into a whole vector field generated by the matrix m, then we know how the area evolves.

19:31.120 --> 19:39.040
Specifically, we know that the trace of m is the rate of area change per area. In this case,

19:39.040 --> 19:46.160
the rate of area change is the derivative of determinant of a, and the area is of course

19:46.720 --> 19:54.000
just the determinant of a itself. So, if we rearrange this, then we have something that

19:54.000 --> 20:01.520
really looks like the Tobi formula. The problem now is, what is m? What is the matrix m that

20:01.520 --> 20:08.880
generates this vector field? Now, particularly at the points a of t acting on the basis vectors,

20:08.880 --> 20:15.520
we know what the vectors attached should be. To go from the position vectors to the attached

20:15.520 --> 20:24.240
vectors, we can simply apply a prime a inverse on the position vectors. So, the matrix m we are

20:24.240 --> 20:32.880
looking for is a prime a inverse. If we go back to what we have obtained previously about derivative

20:32.880 --> 20:42.240
of determinant, we simply substitute the matrix m to be a prime a inverse. This is almost the same

20:42.240 --> 20:48.880
as Jacobi's formula, just that the matrix in the trace has the other order in multiplication,

20:49.520 --> 20:56.400
a inverse before a prime here. Don't worry, there are two approaches here. Either use the

20:56.400 --> 21:05.120
property we discovered that trace a b equals trace b a for a or b being invertible, or similar to how

21:05.120 --> 21:13.200
we dealt with the previous property, we just apply a inverse to the whole picture. In that case,

21:13.200 --> 21:21.040
the corners of the parallelogram go back to the standard places 1 0 and 0 1, but the vectors

21:21.040 --> 21:29.200
attached to these places are a inverse a prime acting on the basis vectors. This is because

21:29.200 --> 21:36.480
previously they were just a prime acting on them, but we have applied a inverse to the whole picture.

21:37.280 --> 21:45.200
This means that the matrix generating the vector field would be a inverse a prime, and the matrix

21:45.200 --> 21:52.480
m to be put into the formula that we derived previously would be a inverse a prime. And

21:52.480 --> 21:59.040
this is exactly the Jacobi's formula where the matrices in the trace are in the right order.

21:59.520 --> 22:08.240
a inverse a prime. So this is the Jacobi's formula derived in the case when a is invertible. We are

22:08.240 --> 22:16.000
able to derive and understand many properties of trace visually by thinking of trace as divergence,

22:16.000 --> 22:22.880
or the rate of area change per area, when the area evolves along the vector field.
