1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,880
Okay. You can probably see this right now, which isn't good. But awesome. So I am... Yeah,

2
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,960
that's okay. And I guess if you can see this, that's fine. I don't think I have anything

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:31,040
secret here. I don't have a second monitor currently, but I'm anticipating. This is the

4
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,920
first time, obviously, I've streamed on anything ever. So if there's sound issues,

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,120
let me know. I'll just see notifications pop up because right now I'm only working on one

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:49,000
screen. So based on the title of the stream, you're probably thinking I'm going to talk

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,520
about section 230, which I am. But first, I need to talk about Lord McAlpine and the Kiwi

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,320
Farms. And if you don't know what those are, that's totally okay. Lord McAlpine is a, was a,

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:09,560
maybe still is, I don't know, a British politician who in 2012, there was a documentary released

10
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:20,600
by the BBC that implied he was a predator of some kind. And he sued them, of course, he sued

11
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,760
the BBC and said, you know, that they didn't say his name, but they didn't imply he was a predator

12
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,640
of some kind. And so he was able to sue them and get some money out of them. Let me actually,

13
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:38,560
I'm going to adjust my microphone, sorry for the noise, if there is any. So anyway,

14
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,560
he sued them and won. Well, he settled outside a court. I mean, I consider that winning. He got

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,200
paid a lot of money. But he didn't technically win a judgment. He just settled outside a court.

16
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,960
Anyway, the damage had already been done. And 1000 people around about on Twitter,

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,520
tweeted the accusation that he was a predator. And about 9,000 people retweeted the accusation.

18
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,680
So what did Lord McAlpine do? He sued all of those people around all the ones he could find

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:13,840
anyway, around 10,000 people were sued by Lord McAlpine. You know, whoever he could find,

20
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,920
basically, he settled with or he won in court. I don't think he lost any of those cases. The most

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:27,600
famous one is this gentleman over here, who what's his name, Alan Davies, who paid him $15,000. So

22
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
you can imagine if he had sued all 10,000 people and they paid this much exactly how much he would

23
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,200
have gotten, it would have been insane. He had to delete the tweet. He apologized. He paid Lord

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,320
McAlpine 15,000 pounds, not dollars. And then he donated an additional amount of money. I don't

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:48,240
think they said how much to a local charity. And that was it. All because this guy tweeted and or

26
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,840
retweeted an accusation that wasn't true. Now, what's interesting about that story is that

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,080
Lord McAlpine sued the BBC and he won all that money. And then he had to sue 10,000 people on

28
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,360
Twitter to get recompense for the accusation that was seemingly not true. But he didn't sue

29
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,320
Twitter directly. You might wonder why like why would he sue the BBC, which is obviously much

30
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,920
easier than suing 10,000 individuals. But then on Twitter, sue 10,000 individuals. And there's

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,560
a reason for that. And the reason for that is a basically section 230 part C, part one, or I'm

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:34,800
sure there's some legal way to say this, I just don't know. But anyway, so that story aside,

33
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,840
I guess I should say I know I said my next video was going to be about WeChat. Obviously, I just

34
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,760
want to do this real quick. And I recorded this in my car, like you'll sometimes I post those

35
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,400
videos and be ranting in my car. And I was so tired of editing it and redoing it. I was just like

36
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,240
screw it, I'm just going to do it live. And then we'll, we'll, that'll be, that'll be it. We will

37
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:59,760
just see how it goes. So sorry, if you're listening to this later, and you hear me stuttering a lot,

38
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,280
stammering a lot, it's because I'm doing this live and I don't edit those things out, obviously live.

39
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,400
Anyway, so section 230 is actually quite long. In the title of the video, I mentioned it was 26

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
words. There's there's a lot more to it than just that. The important part that everyone cares about

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,000
is this here though, these are the 26 words I was referring to, which say no provider or user of an

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,800
interactive computer service, which means things like Twitter, Facebook, shall be treated as the

43
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,240
publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. Now,

44
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,320
if you're wondering what information content provider means, I brought that up as well. It means

45
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,560
information content provider, the term means any person or entity that is responsible in a whole

46
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,440
or in part for the creation or development of information provided through the internet, capital

47
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,200
I internet, or any other interactive computer service. So an information content provider is

48
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:59,920
someone posting something online. So if we go back to the Lord McAlpine example, Twitter cannot be

49
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,600
held liable based on these 26 words for information posted on their platform. You cannot sue Twitter

50
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,200
if someone on Twitter of their own volition accuses you of being a predator. You have to sue the

51
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:19,280
person individually. So why am I talking about Section 230? Because right now in America, as the

52
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,200
election is getting nearer, it's an issue that's coming up more and more and being spoken about

53
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:30,320
more and more, which is basically what should we do about it? Both presidential candidates,

54
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,560
Donald Trump and Joe Biden, have expressed interest in wanting to repeal it entirely,

55
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,080
this entire thing, just repeal it. The effect of that would mean that someone like Lord McAlpine

56
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,560
or anyone could sue Twitter for defamation or potential defamation posted on their website,

57
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,640
and the lawsuits wouldn't be thrown out immediately citing the Section 230 protection.

58
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,360
Some people like Trump view this as and Biden view this as a good thing, because

59
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,080
basically what their argument is that these big platforms that I'm going to keep using Twitter

60
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,760
as the example to keep it simple, but this works for any of them, Patreon, Facebook,

61
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:14,400
even MySpace or something, all the big names in tech, they enjoy this protection.

62
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,600
Also to make it more clear, because as I'm speaking, it's occurring to me, I don't think I made it

63
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:27,360
entirely clear. Section 230, if like the Washington Post posts an article that accuses Lord McAlpine

64
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,240
of being a predator, they can be sued. But if someone in the comment section of that article

65
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,920
calls him a predator, the Washington Post can't be sued, he has to sue that individual. And the

66
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,480
reason for that is colloquially, they call it platforms versus publishers. So in the article

67
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,480
sense of Washington Post, they publish and editorialize the articles they post, but they

68
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,480
don't publish and editorialize the comments. So that's the main difference is that they can't

69
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,480
be held liable for the things said in the comments. There are some exceptions to that,

70
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,720
but I won't go into that now, not at no point. So let me check over here real quick, sorry.

71
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,960
Oof. I'm definitely gonna have to get another monitor. That's going to be really annoying.

72
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,040
I can't just keep on checking back over there. I got a size issue, a resolution issue,

73
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,000
that I'm not able to troubleshoot because it's on the same screen I'm on. Anyway,

74
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,680
let me continue. So I'm talking about, I don't really have a point in this video. I just kind

75
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,920
of wanted to rant about this a little bit, because if you're a fan of Section 230, which I am, for

76
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,200
reasons I'll get to in a little bit, you're in a stressful situation, which is currently

77
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,000
the president and the opposing candidate, the person who's not the incumbent,

78
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,160
they both want to do away with Section 230 for different reasons, but to the same effect.

79
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Really the same reason they just have different points of view, but it's the same reason why

80
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,840
they want to get rid of it, which is these companies have enjoyed so much protection from this law

81
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,760
and not given anything in return, and now it's clear that these sites are centralized locations

82
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:10,720
for severe issues in our country and around the world. Facebook being able to censor not,

83
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,640
well, I guess I should say first that I don't, I'm not really a fan of Trump or Biden, so

84
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,280
I'm not making these arguments because I'm pro or against either of them, but these are the

85
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,320
arguments they make. From the Facebook point of view, they're able to block and censor certain

86
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:34,160
information based on, well, really their own frivolous ideas, but they can do it based on where

87
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:42,320
you live, based on how they feel you should feel. There was an article that came out so many years

88
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,080
ago, whenever that Analytica stuff was coming out, where basically there was an insider who was

89
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,440
saying, if you're a Facebook user who uses it more than one hour per day, the odds that you've

90
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,440
been involved in a social experiment are between 99 and 100%, and those social experiments included

91
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,880
things like seeing if they could affect your mood by showing you depressing updates, you know,

92
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,720
because you'll notice on Facebook, the updates, they're not in order, they're not like in timeline

93
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,600
order, because that would make the most sense. They're like in keyword order that you don't know

94
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,760
because it's part of some experiment you're being used in, but you're not privy to.

95
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,280
Anyway, there's all that. I used to have rants about that online. I took down, they weren't on

96
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,960
YouTube, but, you know, I have a lot of feelings on how these companies utilize this, how they mess

97
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,280
with your brain in an attempt to see if it gets you to use their platform for longer periods.

98
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,560
Anyway, these companies have pretty much been able to work under the table, do all this stuff

99
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,200
behind the scenes, and they've been able to have people, whether they provoke the responses or not,

100
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,080
post whatever they want on their platforms. And as long as they're making a good faith effort to

101
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,320
keep illegal material off of their platforms, people can say whatever they want, and the

102
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,600
companies themselves are not held liable. From Trump's perspective, he's saying, look, this is

103
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,240
being used to censor right-wingers and right-wing politics on these massive, massive communication

104
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,600
platforms. And from Biden's perspective, he's saying these platforms are being used to organize

105
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,320
hate groups and to spread hate speech in ways we've never precedented before, and it's causing

106
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,840
civil unrest globally and, of course, domestically for us in America. Something like that. I've

107
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,240
paraphrased both those arguments, but I think the heart of them is there. I think they would both agree

108
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,480
that that's a fair characterization. So they've talked about repealing it. Trump is currently

109
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,680
pushing, this is on Trump's priority list, way higher than it is on Joe Biden's, because

110
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,400
basically, Trump is under the impression, well, I mean, he's actually right. I mean,

111
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,400
it doesn't matter if you like him or not. He is correct about this. That Twitter is unfairly

112
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:52,480
targeting him, and they're doing that by whenever he posts something that is factually incorrect,

113
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,880
they're flagging his tweets and putting a little message at the bottom saying,

114
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,040
here's a link to some articles that counter the information, why it may or may not be true,

115
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,520
what he's tweeting about. But they aren't doing that for Biden, who the BBC,

116
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,880
assumedly, ostensibly unbiased source in this election. And even if they were biased,

117
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,400
it's almost like they would be biased in favor of Biden and not Trump.

118
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,240
They fact checked some of the claims Biden made, and he tweeted about on the day of the

119
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,160
first presidential debate, and they completely debunked them. They're like, these are not true,

120
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,280
but Twitter doesn't flag Biden's tweets. And so Trump is right, they are unfairly targeting him.

121
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,800
And his point is, as it gets closer to the election, he's basically threatening Twitter by

122
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:50,480
saying, I'm going to repeal section 230, which means any site that is just a forum for communication,

123
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,920
like YouTube would survive, I think Facebook would survive, but Reddit and Twitter would not.

124
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Anything that's just a forum for communication would be sued into oblivion. The moment section

125
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,280
230 is repealed, which brings me on to what I mentioned earlier about the Kiwi Farms.

126
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,400
So one of the reasons why I like section 230, I'm no fan of the Kiwi Farms, but I like small

127
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:22,960
sites having the ability to basically come up. And Kiwi Farms was an experiment. I guess I won't

128
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,600
just say Kiwi Farms because Kiwi Farms and HAN were both an experiment in the same way,

129
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:36,160
which was basically they were going to be these very unique online forums that

130
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,520
I guess attracted that attracted people who were interested in a certain

131
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,920
certain subsets of internet culture. HAN was more experimental than Kiwi Farms because Kiwi Farms

132
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:59,360
was like specifically let's talk about and document weirdos on the internet. And HAN was,

133
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:10,000
I want to see what happens if we create a Reddit where basically users can create their own,

134
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,400
basically it was like Reddit. It was basically a more anonymous users can create their own

135
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:22,160
subreddits or subchans, whatever it's called, I don't know. So basically it was a image board

136
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,920
Reddit hybrid with very little moderation intentionally. And it was kind of an experiment

137
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,800
in that way. And so I like that idea. I'm not a fan of either of those places. I've talked about

138
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:42,320
that before, but the idea I think is great. And those sites, they never would survive if it wasn't

139
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,320
for Section 230 because they do enjoy this Section 230c1 protection, this one I just talked about.

140
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:56,080
As long as they're doing good faith moderation, they don't have any reason at all to be afraid of

141
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,960
starting a site. You right now don't have any reason at all to be afraid of starting a site like

142
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,640
more experimental than HAN or Kiwi Farms, for example. You don't have any reason at all to be

143
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:12,800
afraid of that because you would be protected under this American law. Assuming you were hosting it

144
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:20,720
or the business was started in America or based out of America, I think HAN famously, the creators

145
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,560
didn't live in America, the administrators didn't, but it was hosted out of America, which is why

146
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,760
actually I'm not going to pretend like I'm a lawyer on this. I don't know what the rules are

147
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,480
surrounding that. I'm not sure if you have to just have like an LLC set up in America for this

148
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,680
to work and you can host it anywhere. I guess you would have to because digital ocean operates under

149
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,080
American law, but they obviously have servers all around the world. That's one of the things they

150
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:54,480
offer is that you can use servers from anywhere. Anyway, sorry, I went back to check and see if

151
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,480
I was still getting that issue. I still am. Honestly, I guess I'll take this time to say,

152
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,000
if anyone sees this in the future, I'm going to start taking streaming and doing YouTubeing a

153
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,320
little bit more seriously. There was a guy I met years ago who was super into fitness.

154
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,080
I was always like, what is it with you? How do you do this? All he did was eat,

155
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,280
breathe, and live fitness. I thought that seems like such a crazy thing. I've never felt that way.

156
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,560
I was like, how do you stay so inspired to do it? Because every day he would spend a job's

157
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:35,760
length amount of time, like four to six hours just focusing on meal prepping or exercising or

158
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:43,840
whatever else he was doing. He said, every time I get demotivated, I buy myself something related

159
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,880
to it to kind of rekindle my interest and remind myself it's a hobby. I remember thinking,

160
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,000
that's stupid. That's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard, but I tried it recently.

161
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Long story short, after Corona, I had a lot more work emergencies come up,

162
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,720
things I had to work on, and I stopped doing music. I used to do electronic and,

163
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:12,560
I guess, analog, non-electronic music a lot. I haven't done it at all since Corona started,

164
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,160
but I went out and I bought a new interface, and all of a sudden, I'm doing it again. I thought,

165
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,200
you know what, maybe that's a good idea. I was thinking about taking this a little more seriously,

166
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,120
and I thought, I should buy a new microphone, because the one I'm using now, I've had for like

167
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,440
12 years. If anyone has a suggestion, that was the whole reason I went off on that entire tangent,

168
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,640
was just to say, if anyone has a suggestion for a microphone that's not like, you know,

169
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,800
I don't need to start my own radio show, I don't need something crazy, but it would be nice to

170
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,240
have something nicer than what I have now. I just have a USB blue microphone, like from

171
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,360
before at Blue was a thing, before anyone knew what it was, before every streamer ever had a

172
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,600
Blue Yeti. This is before Yeti, I think. It's just Blue, it's like S2 something, I don't know.

173
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,760
Anyway, it's really old. So anyway, let me know. Okay, tangent, didn't mean to say that, sorry.

174
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,200
Overall, the reason why, and like I said, there wasn't really a point to this video,

175
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,680
I'm going to wrap up here in a bit, but the reason why I kind of wanted to rant about this and talk

176
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:22,080
about it and get back on to talking about 230 at all is because the internet, after the repeal

177
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,960
of 230, which again, I don't think it'll be repeal. I think Biden and Trump are both saying that to

178
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,640
threaten these companies into changing their behavior. I think what they're going to do is

179
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,360
they're going to revise it or amend it. There have already been proposed amendments. I think

180
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,800
actually one that didn't have a huge impact was passed recently. You have to fact check me on

181
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,440
that, don't quote me, but I'm pretty sure there was an amendment made to 230 recently that didn't

182
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,760
affect this part, C1, which I'm looking at here, I'm highlighting now on the screen if you're looking.

183
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,800
But it did affect something. So I think what these guys want to do is they want to amend it,

184
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,200
they want to change it, they want to make it so these companies don't have insane amounts of power

185
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,800
as far as controlling or in some cases not controlling from the Biden perspective,

186
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:18,160
powerful movements on their sites. But they also want to keep the idea that some company can start

187
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,800
some small experiment. Because remember, you guys have to remember, I don't know if anyone here is

188
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,040
old enough or who watches my channel is old enough to remember when Twitter wasn't a thing,

189
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,600
when it was a joke, people laughed at because it was back then it was like 120 characters,

190
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,880
I think, or maybe it was even 60. And it was just laughable. I mean, it was a silly goofy thing

191
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,720
where people posted like haikus and like, it was like vine for words for like witty people.

192
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,040
And then all of a sudden news started getting onto it, like people would say they would post

193
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,760
links to news articles. And it was all of a sudden the place where news traveled fastest,

194
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,800
like seconds after an event happened, you could find it on Twitter.

195
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,120
And you could almost always verify it was true. And so Twitter was an experiment. And Twitter would

196
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,280
have been sued into dust and ash if Section 230 didn't exist when it was created. So this law has

197
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,520
to exist in some way. I don't like how powerful these companies have gotten either guys, but

198
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,240
this law has to exist in some way for innovative ideas like that to exist in the future of the

199
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,960
internet. So anyway, kind of want to just get it out there, let people know my thoughts on it.

200
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,520
I'm a huge fan of Section 230, especially C one this part here. I agree that there's a problem

201
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,760
with how free. Well, free is the wrong word, I don't want to say we need to be less free. No, there's

202
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:47,520
there was obviously no foresight, because how could there have been for how quickly these

203
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,160
companies grew to be just massive giants that are playing huge parts in political games.

204
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,480
You guys, of course, would remember in the last election, if you followed the American election

205
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:07,520
at all from 2016, that Facebook was heavily accused of being a platform where anti Trump

206
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,120
and anti Clinton propaganda was propagated. Twitter was to there was, of course, you still

207
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,440
hear the meme about Russian bots, Russian bots on Twitter posting misinformation and FUD.

208
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,440
You still hear about that. And these companies never anticipated getting to that point. So I do

209
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,080
agree they're, it's almost like they're too powerful. It's almost like they're too important

210
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,840
for what they are, which were basically, they all started as cute ways to, you know,

211
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,680
cute things to show your grandma on the internet. That's how they all started.

212
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,760
But now they've grown into this thing where think about the fact that Twitter,

213
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:47,920
if Twitter were to ban one of the presidential candidates' accounts in America while they were

214
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:53,360
campaigning, just think of what that would do. If Trump's account got banned or deleted,

215
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,360
or Biden's account got banned or deleted, I think that would actually incite physical

216
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,840
violence in the real world, in meat space, not cyberspace. And I don't think they can do it.

217
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,520
If you guys might remember that liberal who was fired from Twitter in their last day,

218
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,240
they deleted the president's account, which actually I thought was pretty funny. I mean,

219
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,880
it's obviously, obviously it was a terrible idea. And I think that person actually faced legal charges,

220
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,200
but, you know, it's pretty funny to leave the president's account. But that highlighted the

221
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:29,120
whole issue, which is, oh, Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, is he just the like CEO in spirit,

222
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,480
or is he actually still there? Let's say he is because I don't want to fact check myself

223
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:40,320
right now. Jack Dorsey is the owner of this company, and he's incapable of deleting certain

224
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,920
accounts. It doesn't matter if the president says the most dangerous thing in the world on Twitter.

225
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,200
While he's campaigning, he is unable to delete his account without inciting some kind of very

226
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,640
serious real world backlash. Anyway, it's all very interesting. And Section 230 allowed them

227
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,400
to get here. So I understand the complaints about it needing to be revised. But at the same time,

228
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,920
if we get rid of it, small experimental sites, even ones that I may not be a fan of like the Kiwi

229
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,360
Farms or HNN, I think that the future of the internet isn't allowing those to exist. And Section

230
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,120
230 is unique to American law. It's nowhere else. Noel, the owner of Kiwi Farms, has talked about

231
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,000
this extensively. And again, whether you like him or not, we disagree on certain things, we agree on

232
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,640
others. But he said like he spent most of his young life living in other countries for various

233
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,040
reasons. And he spends a lot of time reading the free speech laws of other countries. And he said

234
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:42,160
he's read the laws of Uruguay, Rwanda, Ukraine, Poland, and nowhere, nowhere where he thought

235
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,800
he would be safe to host his site. Is there a law as powerful as Section 230 protecting

236
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:54,960
small site owners from the crazy things their users might say? So anyway, that's it. I'm probably

237
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,680
going to stop going live now. It's been about, I guess, 20 minutes, a bit of a rough start there,

238
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:06,800
if you were on. I expect most people will see this after it's published and not live. Recommendation

239
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,960
for a microphone, please, if you have one, that would be cool. If you thought this was cool, let

240
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,480
me know. Obviously, I'm going to do the WeChat video next. I just, after seeing some of the things

241
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,520
that just happened recently on Twitter and seeing Trump once again, pushing to repeal Section 230,

242
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,480
I just wanted to talk about this. And that's pretty much all I got. Thanks, everybody.

243
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:37,440
No, now I got to figure out how to stop streaming. Oh, God.
