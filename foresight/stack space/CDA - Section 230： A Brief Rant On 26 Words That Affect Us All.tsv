0	19880	Okay. You can probably see this right now, which isn't good. But awesome. So I am... Yeah,
19880	23960	that's okay. And I guess if you can see this, that's fine. I don't think I have anything
23960	31040	secret here. I don't have a second monitor currently, but I'm anticipating. This is the
31040	35920	first time, obviously, I've streamed on anything ever. So if there's sound issues,
35920	39120	let me know. I'll just see notifications pop up because right now I'm only working on one
39120	49000	screen. So based on the title of the stream, you're probably thinking I'm going to talk
49000	54520	about section 230, which I am. But first, I need to talk about Lord McAlpine and the Kiwi
54520	61320	Farms. And if you don't know what those are, that's totally okay. Lord McAlpine is a, was a,
61320	69560	maybe still is, I don't know, a British politician who in 2012, there was a documentary released
69560	80600	by the BBC that implied he was a predator of some kind. And he sued them, of course, he sued
80600	84760	the BBC and said, you know, that they didn't say his name, but they didn't imply he was a predator
84760	89640	of some kind. And so he was able to sue them and get some money out of them. Let me actually,
89640	98560	I'm going to adjust my microphone, sorry for the noise, if there is any. So anyway,
98640	102560	he sued them and won. Well, he settled outside a court. I mean, I consider that winning. He got
102560	107200	paid a lot of money. But he didn't technically win a judgment. He just settled outside a court.
107200	112960	Anyway, the damage had already been done. And 1000 people around about on Twitter,
112960	119520	tweeted the accusation that he was a predator. And about 9,000 people retweeted the accusation.
120080	125680	So what did Lord McAlpine do? He sued all of those people around all the ones he could find
125680	133840	anyway, around 10,000 people were sued by Lord McAlpine. You know, whoever he could find,
133840	137920	basically, he settled with or he won in court. I don't think he lost any of those cases. The most
137920	147600	famous one is this gentleman over here, who what's his name, Alan Davies, who paid him $15,000. So
147600	151600	you can imagine if he had sued all 10,000 people and they paid this much exactly how much he would
151600	157200	have gotten, it would have been insane. He had to delete the tweet. He apologized. He paid Lord
157200	162320	McAlpine 15,000 pounds, not dollars. And then he donated an additional amount of money. I don't
162320	168240	think they said how much to a local charity. And that was it. All because this guy tweeted and or
168240	173840	retweeted an accusation that wasn't true. Now, what's interesting about that story is that
174720	182080	Lord McAlpine sued the BBC and he won all that money. And then he had to sue 10,000 people on
182080	189360	Twitter to get recompense for the accusation that was seemingly not true. But he didn't sue
189360	194320	Twitter directly. You might wonder why like why would he sue the BBC, which is obviously much
194320	199920	easier than suing 10,000 individuals. But then on Twitter, sue 10,000 individuals. And there's
200000	206560	a reason for that. And the reason for that is a basically section 230 part C, part one, or I'm
206560	214800	sure there's some legal way to say this, I just don't know. But anyway, so that story aside,
214800	217840	I guess I should say I know I said my next video was going to be about WeChat. Obviously, I just
217840	221760	want to do this real quick. And I recorded this in my car, like you'll sometimes I post those
221760	226400	videos and be ranting in my car. And I was so tired of editing it and redoing it. I was just like
226400	232240	screw it, I'm just going to do it live. And then we'll, we'll, that'll be, that'll be it. We will
232240	239760	just see how it goes. So sorry, if you're listening to this later, and you hear me stuttering a lot,
239760	243280	stammering a lot, it's because I'm doing this live and I don't edit those things out, obviously live.
244160	250400	Anyway, so section 230 is actually quite long. In the title of the video, I mentioned it was 26
250400	254400	words. There's there's a lot more to it than just that. The important part that everyone cares about
254400	260000	is this here though, these are the 26 words I was referring to, which say no provider or user of an
260000	264800	interactive computer service, which means things like Twitter, Facebook, shall be treated as the
264800	272240	publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. Now,
272240	276320	if you're wondering what information content provider means, I brought that up as well. It means
277280	282560	information content provider, the term means any person or entity that is responsible in a whole
282560	287440	or in part for the creation or development of information provided through the internet, capital
287440	293200	I internet, or any other interactive computer service. So an information content provider is
293200	299920	someone posting something online. So if we go back to the Lord McAlpine example, Twitter cannot be
299920	305600	held liable based on these 26 words for information posted on their platform. You cannot sue Twitter
305600	311200	if someone on Twitter of their own volition accuses you of being a predator. You have to sue the
311280	319280	person individually. So why am I talking about Section 230? Because right now in America, as the
319280	323200	election is getting nearer, it's an issue that's coming up more and more and being spoken about
323200	330320	more and more, which is basically what should we do about it? Both presidential candidates,
330320	334560	Donald Trump and Joe Biden, have expressed interest in wanting to repeal it entirely,
334560	340080	this entire thing, just repeal it. The effect of that would mean that someone like Lord McAlpine
340080	346560	or anyone could sue Twitter for defamation or potential defamation posted on their website,
346560	350640	and the lawsuits wouldn't be thrown out immediately citing the Section 230 protection.
352880	357360	Some people like Trump view this as and Biden view this as a good thing, because
358160	362080	basically what their argument is that these big platforms that I'm going to keep using Twitter
362080	365760	as the example to keep it simple, but this works for any of them, Patreon, Facebook,
366720	374400	even MySpace or something, all the big names in tech, they enjoy this protection.
376640	379600	Also to make it more clear, because as I'm speaking, it's occurring to me, I don't think I made it
379600	387360	entirely clear. Section 230, if like the Washington Post posts an article that accuses Lord McAlpine
387360	394240	of being a predator, they can be sued. But if someone in the comment section of that article
394320	399920	calls him a predator, the Washington Post can't be sued, he has to sue that individual. And the
399920	404480	reason for that is colloquially, they call it platforms versus publishers. So in the article
404480	408480	sense of Washington Post, they publish and editorialize the articles they post, but they
408480	412480	don't publish and editorialize the comments. So that's the main difference is that they can't
412480	416480	be held liable for the things said in the comments. There are some exceptions to that,
416480	422720	but I won't go into that now, not at no point. So let me check over here real quick, sorry.
425200	428960	Oof. I'm definitely gonna have to get another monitor. That's going to be really annoying.
428960	435040	I can't just keep on checking back over there. I got a size issue, a resolution issue,
435760	440000	that I'm not able to troubleshoot because it's on the same screen I'm on. Anyway,
441040	445680	let me continue. So I'm talking about, I don't really have a point in this video. I just kind
445680	449920	of wanted to rant about this a little bit, because if you're a fan of Section 230, which I am, for
449920	455200	reasons I'll get to in a little bit, you're in a stressful situation, which is currently
456080	462000	the president and the opposing candidate, the person who's not the incumbent,
463920	468160	they both want to do away with Section 230 for different reasons, but to the same effect.
468160	472160	Really the same reason they just have different points of view, but it's the same reason why
472160	477840	they want to get rid of it, which is these companies have enjoyed so much protection from this law
477840	483760	and not given anything in return, and now it's clear that these sites are centralized locations
483760	490720	for severe issues in our country and around the world. Facebook being able to censor not,
491840	496640	well, I guess I should say first that I don't, I'm not really a fan of Trump or Biden, so
497440	501280	I'm not making these arguments because I'm pro or against either of them, but these are the
501280	508320	arguments they make. From the Facebook point of view, they're able to block and censor certain
508320	514160	information based on, well, really their own frivolous ideas, but they can do it based on where
514160	522320	you live, based on how they feel you should feel. There was an article that came out so many years
522320	528080	ago, whenever that Analytica stuff was coming out, where basically there was an insider who was
528080	533440	saying, if you're a Facebook user who uses it more than one hour per day, the odds that you've
533440	539440	been involved in a social experiment are between 99 and 100%, and those social experiments included
539440	544880	things like seeing if they could affect your mood by showing you depressing updates, you know,
544880	548720	because you'll notice on Facebook, the updates, they're not in order, they're not like in timeline
548720	553600	order, because that would make the most sense. They're like in keyword order that you don't know
553600	557760	because it's part of some experiment you're being used in, but you're not privy to.
559200	563280	Anyway, there's all that. I used to have rants about that online. I took down, they weren't on
563280	568960	YouTube, but, you know, I have a lot of feelings on how these companies utilize this, how they mess
568960	573280	with your brain in an attempt to see if it gets you to use their platform for longer periods.
573280	578560	Anyway, these companies have pretty much been able to work under the table, do all this stuff
578560	583200	behind the scenes, and they've been able to have people, whether they provoke the responses or not,
583200	588080	post whatever they want on their platforms. And as long as they're making a good faith effort to
588080	592320	keep illegal material off of their platforms, people can say whatever they want, and the
592320	597600	companies themselves are not held liable. From Trump's perspective, he's saying, look, this is
597600	602240	being used to censor right-wingers and right-wing politics on these massive, massive communication
602240	607600	platforms. And from Biden's perspective, he's saying these platforms are being used to organize
608320	612320	hate groups and to spread hate speech in ways we've never precedented before, and it's causing
612320	617840	civil unrest globally and, of course, domestically for us in America. Something like that. I've
617840	622240	paraphrased both those arguments, but I think the heart of them is there. I think they would both agree
622240	628480	that that's a fair characterization. So they've talked about repealing it. Trump is currently
628480	635680	pushing, this is on Trump's priority list, way higher than it is on Joe Biden's, because
636800	640400	basically, Trump is under the impression, well, I mean, he's actually right. I mean,
640400	644400	it doesn't matter if you like him or not. He is correct about this. That Twitter is unfairly
644400	652480	targeting him, and they're doing that by whenever he posts something that is factually incorrect,
653120	656880	they're flagging his tweets and putting a little message at the bottom saying,
656880	663040	here's a link to some articles that counter the information, why it may or may not be true,
663120	667520	what he's tweeting about. But they aren't doing that for Biden, who the BBC,
669440	674880	assumedly, ostensibly unbiased source in this election. And even if they were biased,
674880	678400	it's almost like they would be biased in favor of Biden and not Trump.
681520	686240	They fact checked some of the claims Biden made, and he tweeted about on the day of the
686240	690160	first presidential debate, and they completely debunked them. They're like, these are not true,
690160	695280	but Twitter doesn't flag Biden's tweets. And so Trump is right, they are unfairly targeting him.
696240	702800	And his point is, as it gets closer to the election, he's basically threatening Twitter by
702800	710480	saying, I'm going to repeal section 230, which means any site that is just a forum for communication,
710480	715920	like YouTube would survive, I think Facebook would survive, but Reddit and Twitter would not.
716640	722640	Anything that's just a forum for communication would be sued into oblivion. The moment section
722640	727280	230 is repealed, which brings me on to what I mentioned earlier about the Kiwi Farms.
728480	734400	So one of the reasons why I like section 230, I'm no fan of the Kiwi Farms, but I like small
734400	742960	sites having the ability to basically come up. And Kiwi Farms was an experiment. I guess I won't
742960	747600	just say Kiwi Farms because Kiwi Farms and HAN were both an experiment in the same way,
748880	756160	which was basically they were going to be these very unique online forums that
759120	765520	I guess attracted that attracted people who were interested in a certain
766080	771920	certain subsets of internet culture. HAN was more experimental than Kiwi Farms because Kiwi Farms
771920	779360	was like specifically let's talk about and document weirdos on the internet. And HAN was,
779360	790000	I want to see what happens if we create a Reddit where basically users can create their own,
790000	794400	basically it was like Reddit. It was basically a more anonymous users can create their own
794960	802160	subreddits or subchans, whatever it's called, I don't know. So basically it was a image board
802160	809920	Reddit hybrid with very little moderation intentionally. And it was kind of an experiment
809920	814800	in that way. And so I like that idea. I'm not a fan of either of those places. I've talked about
814800	822320	that before, but the idea I think is great. And those sites, they never would survive if it wasn't
822320	828320	for Section 230 because they do enjoy this Section 230c1 protection, this one I just talked about.
829280	836080	As long as they're doing good faith moderation, they don't have any reason at all to be afraid of
836080	840960	starting a site. You right now don't have any reason at all to be afraid of starting a site like
841760	846640	more experimental than HAN or Kiwi Farms, for example. You don't have any reason at all to be
846640	852800	afraid of that because you would be protected under this American law. Assuming you were hosting it
852800	860720	or the business was started in America or based out of America, I think HAN famously, the creators
860720	866560	didn't live in America, the administrators didn't, but it was hosted out of America, which is why
866560	869760	actually I'm not going to pretend like I'm a lawyer on this. I don't know what the rules are
869760	874480	surrounding that. I'm not sure if you have to just have like an LLC set up in America for this
874480	881680	to work and you can host it anywhere. I guess you would have to because digital ocean operates under
881680	886080	American law, but they obviously have servers all around the world. That's one of the things they
886080	894480	offer is that you can use servers from anywhere. Anyway, sorry, I went back to check and see if
894480	898480	I was still getting that issue. I still am. Honestly, I guess I'll take this time to say,
898480	904000	if anyone sees this in the future, I'm going to start taking streaming and doing YouTubeing a
904000	910320	little bit more seriously. There was a guy I met years ago who was super into fitness.
913280	918080	I was always like, what is it with you? How do you do this? All he did was eat,
918080	923280	breathe, and live fitness. I thought that seems like such a crazy thing. I've never felt that way.
924000	928560	I was like, how do you stay so inspired to do it? Because every day he would spend a job's
928640	935760	length amount of time, like four to six hours just focusing on meal prepping or exercising or
935760	943840	whatever else he was doing. He said, every time I get demotivated, I buy myself something related
943840	948880	to it to kind of rekindle my interest and remind myself it's a hobby. I remember thinking,
949920	954000	that's stupid. That's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard, but I tried it recently.
954000	959600	Long story short, after Corona, I had a lot more work emergencies come up,
960240	964720	things I had to work on, and I stopped doing music. I used to do electronic and,
966080	972560	I guess, analog, non-electronic music a lot. I haven't done it at all since Corona started,
972560	978160	but I went out and I bought a new interface, and all of a sudden, I'm doing it again. I thought,
978160	981200	you know what, maybe that's a good idea. I was thinking about taking this a little more seriously,
981200	985120	and I thought, I should buy a new microphone, because the one I'm using now, I've had for like
985120	991440	12 years. If anyone has a suggestion, that was the whole reason I went off on that entire tangent,
991440	996640	was just to say, if anyone has a suggestion for a microphone that's not like, you know,
996640	1000800	I don't need to start my own radio show, I don't need something crazy, but it would be nice to
1000800	1006240	have something nicer than what I have now. I just have a USB blue microphone, like from
1006240	1011360	before at Blue was a thing, before anyone knew what it was, before every streamer ever had a
1011360	1017600	Blue Yeti. This is before Yeti, I think. It's just Blue, it's like S2 something, I don't know.
1017600	1023760	Anyway, it's really old. So anyway, let me know. Okay, tangent, didn't mean to say that, sorry.
1025840	1029200	Overall, the reason why, and like I said, there wasn't really a point to this video,
1029200	1033680	I'm going to wrap up here in a bit, but the reason why I kind of wanted to rant about this and talk
1033680	1042080	about it and get back on to talking about 230 at all is because the internet, after the repeal
1042080	1046960	of 230, which again, I don't think it'll be repeal. I think Biden and Trump are both saying that to
1046960	1050640	threaten these companies into changing their behavior. I think what they're going to do is
1050640	1055360	they're going to revise it or amend it. There have already been proposed amendments. I think
1055360	1060800	actually one that didn't have a huge impact was passed recently. You have to fact check me on
1060800	1065440	that, don't quote me, but I'm pretty sure there was an amendment made to 230 recently that didn't
1065440	1069760	affect this part, C1, which I'm looking at here, I'm highlighting now on the screen if you're looking.
1071360	1076800	But it did affect something. So I think what these guys want to do is they want to amend it,
1076800	1081200	they want to change it, they want to make it so these companies don't have insane amounts of power
1082000	1086800	as far as controlling or in some cases not controlling from the Biden perspective,
1087760	1098160	powerful movements on their sites. But they also want to keep the idea that some company can start
1098160	1102800	some small experiment. Because remember, you guys have to remember, I don't know if anyone here is
1102800	1107040	old enough or who watches my channel is old enough to remember when Twitter wasn't a thing,
1107040	1111600	when it was a joke, people laughed at because it was back then it was like 120 characters,
1111600	1116880	I think, or maybe it was even 60. And it was just laughable. I mean, it was a silly goofy thing
1116880	1122720	where people posted like haikus and like, it was like vine for words for like witty people.
1124080	1129040	And then all of a sudden news started getting onto it, like people would say they would post
1129040	1133760	links to news articles. And it was all of a sudden the place where news traveled fastest,
1133760	1136800	like seconds after an event happened, you could find it on Twitter.
1136880	1143120	And you could almost always verify it was true. And so Twitter was an experiment. And Twitter would
1143120	1149280	have been sued into dust and ash if Section 230 didn't exist when it was created. So this law has
1149280	1153520	to exist in some way. I don't like how powerful these companies have gotten either guys, but
1153520	1160240	this law has to exist in some way for innovative ideas like that to exist in the future of the
1160240	1164960	internet. So anyway, kind of want to just get it out there, let people know my thoughts on it.
1164960	1171520	I'm a huge fan of Section 230, especially C one this part here. I agree that there's a problem
1171520	1177760	with how free. Well, free is the wrong word, I don't want to say we need to be less free. No, there's
1180160	1187520	there was obviously no foresight, because how could there have been for how quickly these
1187520	1194160	companies grew to be just massive giants that are playing huge parts in political games.
1195200	1198480	You guys, of course, would remember in the last election, if you followed the American election
1198480	1207520	at all from 2016, that Facebook was heavily accused of being a platform where anti Trump
1207520	1213120	and anti Clinton propaganda was propagated. Twitter was to there was, of course, you still
1213200	1217440	hear the meme about Russian bots, Russian bots on Twitter posting misinformation and FUD.
1218000	1221440	You still hear about that. And these companies never anticipated getting to that point. So I do
1221440	1226080	agree they're, it's almost like they're too powerful. It's almost like they're too important
1227120	1231840	for what they are, which were basically, they all started as cute ways to, you know,
1232400	1235680	cute things to show your grandma on the internet. That's how they all started.
1236720	1239760	But now they've grown into this thing where think about the fact that Twitter,
1240560	1247920	if Twitter were to ban one of the presidential candidates' accounts in America while they were
1247920	1253360	campaigning, just think of what that would do. If Trump's account got banned or deleted,
1253360	1259360	or Biden's account got banned or deleted, I think that would actually incite physical
1259360	1265840	violence in the real world, in meat space, not cyberspace. And I don't think they can do it.
1265840	1269520	If you guys might remember that liberal who was fired from Twitter in their last day,
1269520	1272240	they deleted the president's account, which actually I thought was pretty funny. I mean,
1272240	1276880	it's obviously, obviously it was a terrible idea. And I think that person actually faced legal charges,
1276880	1281200	but, you know, it's pretty funny to leave the president's account. But that highlighted the
1281200	1289120	whole issue, which is, oh, Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, is he just the like CEO in spirit,
1289120	1292480	or is he actually still there? Let's say he is because I don't want to fact check myself
1293200	1300320	right now. Jack Dorsey is the owner of this company, and he's incapable of deleting certain
1300320	1303920	accounts. It doesn't matter if the president says the most dangerous thing in the world on Twitter.
1304960	1311200	While he's campaigning, he is unable to delete his account without inciting some kind of very
1311200	1316640	serious real world backlash. Anyway, it's all very interesting. And Section 230 allowed them
1316640	1320400	to get here. So I understand the complaints about it needing to be revised. But at the same time,
1320400	1325920	if we get rid of it, small experimental sites, even ones that I may not be a fan of like the Kiwi
1325920	1331360	Farms or HNN, I think that the future of the internet isn't allowing those to exist. And Section
1331360	1337120	230 is unique to American law. It's nowhere else. Noel, the owner of Kiwi Farms, has talked about
1337120	1342000	this extensively. And again, whether you like him or not, we disagree on certain things, we agree on
1342000	1348640	others. But he said like he spent most of his young life living in other countries for various
1348720	1353040	reasons. And he spends a lot of time reading the free speech laws of other countries. And he said
1353040	1362160	he's read the laws of Uruguay, Rwanda, Ukraine, Poland, and nowhere, nowhere where he thought
1362160	1366800	he would be safe to host his site. Is there a law as powerful as Section 230 protecting
1367760	1374960	small site owners from the crazy things their users might say? So anyway, that's it. I'm probably
1374960	1379680	going to stop going live now. It's been about, I guess, 20 minutes, a bit of a rough start there,
1379680	1386800	if you were on. I expect most people will see this after it's published and not live. Recommendation
1386800	1390960	for a microphone, please, if you have one, that would be cool. If you thought this was cool, let
1390960	1396480	me know. Obviously, I'm going to do the WeChat video next. I just, after seeing some of the things
1396480	1401520	that just happened recently on Twitter and seeing Trump once again, pushing to repeal Section 230,
1401520	1406480	I just wanted to talk about this. And that's pretty much all I got. Thanks, everybody.
1408800	1417440	No, now I got to figure out how to stop streaming. Oh, God.
