00:00.000 --> 00:19.880
Okay. You can probably see this right now, which isn't good. But awesome. So I am... Yeah,

00:19.880 --> 00:23.960
that's okay. And I guess if you can see this, that's fine. I don't think I have anything

00:23.960 --> 00:31.040
secret here. I don't have a second monitor currently, but I'm anticipating. This is the

00:31.040 --> 00:35.920
first time, obviously, I've streamed on anything ever. So if there's sound issues,

00:35.920 --> 00:39.120
let me know. I'll just see notifications pop up because right now I'm only working on one

00:39.120 --> 00:49.000
screen. So based on the title of the stream, you're probably thinking I'm going to talk

00:49.000 --> 00:54.520
about section 230, which I am. But first, I need to talk about Lord McAlpine and the Kiwi

00:54.520 --> 01:01.320
Farms. And if you don't know what those are, that's totally okay. Lord McAlpine is a, was a,

01:01.320 --> 01:09.560
maybe still is, I don't know, a British politician who in 2012, there was a documentary released

01:09.560 --> 01:20.600
by the BBC that implied he was a predator of some kind. And he sued them, of course, he sued

01:20.600 --> 01:24.760
the BBC and said, you know, that they didn't say his name, but they didn't imply he was a predator

01:24.760 --> 01:29.640
of some kind. And so he was able to sue them and get some money out of them. Let me actually,

01:29.640 --> 01:38.560
I'm going to adjust my microphone, sorry for the noise, if there is any. So anyway,

01:38.640 --> 01:42.560
he sued them and won. Well, he settled outside a court. I mean, I consider that winning. He got

01:42.560 --> 01:47.200
paid a lot of money. But he didn't technically win a judgment. He just settled outside a court.

01:47.200 --> 01:52.960
Anyway, the damage had already been done. And 1000 people around about on Twitter,

01:52.960 --> 01:59.520
tweeted the accusation that he was a predator. And about 9,000 people retweeted the accusation.

02:00.080 --> 02:05.680
So what did Lord McAlpine do? He sued all of those people around all the ones he could find

02:05.680 --> 02:13.840
anyway, around 10,000 people were sued by Lord McAlpine. You know, whoever he could find,

02:13.840 --> 02:17.920
basically, he settled with or he won in court. I don't think he lost any of those cases. The most

02:17.920 --> 02:27.600
famous one is this gentleman over here, who what's his name, Alan Davies, who paid him $15,000. So

02:27.600 --> 02:31.600
you can imagine if he had sued all 10,000 people and they paid this much exactly how much he would

02:31.600 --> 02:37.200
have gotten, it would have been insane. He had to delete the tweet. He apologized. He paid Lord

02:37.200 --> 02:42.320
McAlpine 15,000 pounds, not dollars. And then he donated an additional amount of money. I don't

02:42.320 --> 02:48.240
think they said how much to a local charity. And that was it. All because this guy tweeted and or

02:48.240 --> 02:53.840
retweeted an accusation that wasn't true. Now, what's interesting about that story is that

02:54.720 --> 03:02.080
Lord McAlpine sued the BBC and he won all that money. And then he had to sue 10,000 people on

03:02.080 --> 03:09.360
Twitter to get recompense for the accusation that was seemingly not true. But he didn't sue

03:09.360 --> 03:14.320
Twitter directly. You might wonder why like why would he sue the BBC, which is obviously much

03:14.320 --> 03:19.920
easier than suing 10,000 individuals. But then on Twitter, sue 10,000 individuals. And there's

03:20.000 --> 03:26.560
a reason for that. And the reason for that is a basically section 230 part C, part one, or I'm

03:26.560 --> 03:34.800
sure there's some legal way to say this, I just don't know. But anyway, so that story aside,

03:34.800 --> 03:37.840
I guess I should say I know I said my next video was going to be about WeChat. Obviously, I just

03:37.840 --> 03:41.760
want to do this real quick. And I recorded this in my car, like you'll sometimes I post those

03:41.760 --> 03:46.400
videos and be ranting in my car. And I was so tired of editing it and redoing it. I was just like

03:46.400 --> 03:52.240
screw it, I'm just going to do it live. And then we'll, we'll, that'll be, that'll be it. We will

03:52.240 --> 03:59.760
just see how it goes. So sorry, if you're listening to this later, and you hear me stuttering a lot,

03:59.760 --> 04:03.280
stammering a lot, it's because I'm doing this live and I don't edit those things out, obviously live.

04:04.160 --> 04:10.400
Anyway, so section 230 is actually quite long. In the title of the video, I mentioned it was 26

04:10.400 --> 04:14.400
words. There's there's a lot more to it than just that. The important part that everyone cares about

04:14.400 --> 04:20.000
is this here though, these are the 26 words I was referring to, which say no provider or user of an

04:20.000 --> 04:24.800
interactive computer service, which means things like Twitter, Facebook, shall be treated as the

04:24.800 --> 04:32.240
publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. Now,

04:32.240 --> 04:36.320
if you're wondering what information content provider means, I brought that up as well. It means

04:37.280 --> 04:42.560
information content provider, the term means any person or entity that is responsible in a whole

04:42.560 --> 04:47.440
or in part for the creation or development of information provided through the internet, capital

04:47.440 --> 04:53.200
I internet, or any other interactive computer service. So an information content provider is

04:53.200 --> 04:59.920
someone posting something online. So if we go back to the Lord McAlpine example, Twitter cannot be

04:59.920 --> 05:05.600
held liable based on these 26 words for information posted on their platform. You cannot sue Twitter

05:05.600 --> 05:11.200
if someone on Twitter of their own volition accuses you of being a predator. You have to sue the

05:11.280 --> 05:19.280
person individually. So why am I talking about Section 230? Because right now in America, as the

05:19.280 --> 05:23.200
election is getting nearer, it's an issue that's coming up more and more and being spoken about

05:23.200 --> 05:30.320
more and more, which is basically what should we do about it? Both presidential candidates,

05:30.320 --> 05:34.560
Donald Trump and Joe Biden, have expressed interest in wanting to repeal it entirely,

05:34.560 --> 05:40.080
this entire thing, just repeal it. The effect of that would mean that someone like Lord McAlpine

05:40.080 --> 05:46.560
or anyone could sue Twitter for defamation or potential defamation posted on their website,

05:46.560 --> 05:50.640
and the lawsuits wouldn't be thrown out immediately citing the Section 230 protection.

05:52.880 --> 05:57.360
Some people like Trump view this as and Biden view this as a good thing, because

05:58.160 --> 06:02.080
basically what their argument is that these big platforms that I'm going to keep using Twitter

06:02.080 --> 06:05.760
as the example to keep it simple, but this works for any of them, Patreon, Facebook,

06:06.720 --> 06:14.400
even MySpace or something, all the big names in tech, they enjoy this protection.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.600
Also to make it more clear, because as I'm speaking, it's occurring to me, I don't think I made it

06:19.600 --> 06:27.360
entirely clear. Section 230, if like the Washington Post posts an article that accuses Lord McAlpine

06:27.360 --> 06:34.240
of being a predator, they can be sued. But if someone in the comment section of that article

06:34.320 --> 06:39.920
calls him a predator, the Washington Post can't be sued, he has to sue that individual. And the

06:39.920 --> 06:44.480
reason for that is colloquially, they call it platforms versus publishers. So in the article

06:44.480 --> 06:48.480
sense of Washington Post, they publish and editorialize the articles they post, but they

06:48.480 --> 06:52.480
don't publish and editorialize the comments. So that's the main difference is that they can't

06:52.480 --> 06:56.480
be held liable for the things said in the comments. There are some exceptions to that,

06:56.480 --> 07:02.720
but I won't go into that now, not at no point. So let me check over here real quick, sorry.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.960
Oof. I'm definitely gonna have to get another monitor. That's going to be really annoying.

07:08.960 --> 07:15.040
I can't just keep on checking back over there. I got a size issue, a resolution issue,

07:15.760 --> 07:20.000
that I'm not able to troubleshoot because it's on the same screen I'm on. Anyway,

07:21.040 --> 07:25.680
let me continue. So I'm talking about, I don't really have a point in this video. I just kind

07:25.680 --> 07:29.920
of wanted to rant about this a little bit, because if you're a fan of Section 230, which I am, for

07:29.920 --> 07:35.200
reasons I'll get to in a little bit, you're in a stressful situation, which is currently

07:36.080 --> 07:42.000
the president and the opposing candidate, the person who's not the incumbent,

07:43.920 --> 07:48.160
they both want to do away with Section 230 for different reasons, but to the same effect.

07:48.160 --> 07:52.160
Really the same reason they just have different points of view, but it's the same reason why

07:52.160 --> 07:57.840
they want to get rid of it, which is these companies have enjoyed so much protection from this law

07:57.840 --> 08:03.760
and not given anything in return, and now it's clear that these sites are centralized locations

08:03.760 --> 08:10.720
for severe issues in our country and around the world. Facebook being able to censor not,

08:11.840 --> 08:16.640
well, I guess I should say first that I don't, I'm not really a fan of Trump or Biden, so

08:17.440 --> 08:21.280
I'm not making these arguments because I'm pro or against either of them, but these are the

08:21.280 --> 08:28.320
arguments they make. From the Facebook point of view, they're able to block and censor certain

08:28.320 --> 08:34.160
information based on, well, really their own frivolous ideas, but they can do it based on where

08:34.160 --> 08:42.320
you live, based on how they feel you should feel. There was an article that came out so many years

08:42.320 --> 08:48.080
ago, whenever that Analytica stuff was coming out, where basically there was an insider who was

08:48.080 --> 08:53.440
saying, if you're a Facebook user who uses it more than one hour per day, the odds that you've

08:53.440 --> 08:59.440
been involved in a social experiment are between 99 and 100%, and those social experiments included

08:59.440 --> 09:04.880
things like seeing if they could affect your mood by showing you depressing updates, you know,

09:04.880 --> 09:08.720
because you'll notice on Facebook, the updates, they're not in order, they're not like in timeline

09:08.720 --> 09:13.600
order, because that would make the most sense. They're like in keyword order that you don't know

09:13.600 --> 09:17.760
because it's part of some experiment you're being used in, but you're not privy to.

09:19.200 --> 09:23.280
Anyway, there's all that. I used to have rants about that online. I took down, they weren't on

09:23.280 --> 09:28.960
YouTube, but, you know, I have a lot of feelings on how these companies utilize this, how they mess

09:28.960 --> 09:33.280
with your brain in an attempt to see if it gets you to use their platform for longer periods.

09:33.280 --> 09:38.560
Anyway, these companies have pretty much been able to work under the table, do all this stuff

09:38.560 --> 09:43.200
behind the scenes, and they've been able to have people, whether they provoke the responses or not,

09:43.200 --> 09:48.080
post whatever they want on their platforms. And as long as they're making a good faith effort to

09:48.080 --> 09:52.320
keep illegal material off of their platforms, people can say whatever they want, and the

09:52.320 --> 09:57.600
companies themselves are not held liable. From Trump's perspective, he's saying, look, this is

09:57.600 --> 10:02.240
being used to censor right-wingers and right-wing politics on these massive, massive communication

10:02.240 --> 10:07.600
platforms. And from Biden's perspective, he's saying these platforms are being used to organize

10:08.320 --> 10:12.320
hate groups and to spread hate speech in ways we've never precedented before, and it's causing

10:12.320 --> 10:17.840
civil unrest globally and, of course, domestically for us in America. Something like that. I've

10:17.840 --> 10:22.240
paraphrased both those arguments, but I think the heart of them is there. I think they would both agree

10:22.240 --> 10:28.480
that that's a fair characterization. So they've talked about repealing it. Trump is currently

10:28.480 --> 10:35.680
pushing, this is on Trump's priority list, way higher than it is on Joe Biden's, because

10:36.800 --> 10:40.400
basically, Trump is under the impression, well, I mean, he's actually right. I mean,

10:40.400 --> 10:44.400
it doesn't matter if you like him or not. He is correct about this. That Twitter is unfairly

10:44.400 --> 10:52.480
targeting him, and they're doing that by whenever he posts something that is factually incorrect,

10:53.120 --> 10:56.880
they're flagging his tweets and putting a little message at the bottom saying,

10:56.880 --> 11:03.040
here's a link to some articles that counter the information, why it may or may not be true,

11:03.120 --> 11:07.520
what he's tweeting about. But they aren't doing that for Biden, who the BBC,

11:09.440 --> 11:14.880
assumedly, ostensibly unbiased source in this election. And even if they were biased,

11:14.880 --> 11:18.400
it's almost like they would be biased in favor of Biden and not Trump.

11:21.520 --> 11:26.240
They fact checked some of the claims Biden made, and he tweeted about on the day of the

11:26.240 --> 11:30.160
first presidential debate, and they completely debunked them. They're like, these are not true,

11:30.160 --> 11:35.280
but Twitter doesn't flag Biden's tweets. And so Trump is right, they are unfairly targeting him.

11:36.240 --> 11:42.800
And his point is, as it gets closer to the election, he's basically threatening Twitter by

11:42.800 --> 11:50.480
saying, I'm going to repeal section 230, which means any site that is just a forum for communication,

11:50.480 --> 11:55.920
like YouTube would survive, I think Facebook would survive, but Reddit and Twitter would not.

11:56.640 --> 12:02.640
Anything that's just a forum for communication would be sued into oblivion. The moment section

12:02.640 --> 12:07.280
230 is repealed, which brings me on to what I mentioned earlier about the Kiwi Farms.

12:08.480 --> 12:14.400
So one of the reasons why I like section 230, I'm no fan of the Kiwi Farms, but I like small

12:14.400 --> 12:22.960
sites having the ability to basically come up. And Kiwi Farms was an experiment. I guess I won't

12:22.960 --> 12:27.600
just say Kiwi Farms because Kiwi Farms and HAN were both an experiment in the same way,

12:28.880 --> 12:36.160
which was basically they were going to be these very unique online forums that

12:39.120 --> 12:45.520
I guess attracted that attracted people who were interested in a certain

12:46.080 --> 12:51.920
certain subsets of internet culture. HAN was more experimental than Kiwi Farms because Kiwi Farms

12:51.920 --> 12:59.360
was like specifically let's talk about and document weirdos on the internet. And HAN was,

12:59.360 --> 13:10.000
I want to see what happens if we create a Reddit where basically users can create their own,

13:10.000 --> 13:14.400
basically it was like Reddit. It was basically a more anonymous users can create their own

13:14.960 --> 13:22.160
subreddits or subchans, whatever it's called, I don't know. So basically it was a image board

13:22.160 --> 13:29.920
Reddit hybrid with very little moderation intentionally. And it was kind of an experiment

13:29.920 --> 13:34.800
in that way. And so I like that idea. I'm not a fan of either of those places. I've talked about

13:34.800 --> 13:42.320
that before, but the idea I think is great. And those sites, they never would survive if it wasn't

13:42.320 --> 13:48.320
for Section 230 because they do enjoy this Section 230c1 protection, this one I just talked about.

13:49.280 --> 13:56.080
As long as they're doing good faith moderation, they don't have any reason at all to be afraid of

13:56.080 --> 14:00.960
starting a site. You right now don't have any reason at all to be afraid of starting a site like

14:01.760 --> 14:06.640
more experimental than HAN or Kiwi Farms, for example. You don't have any reason at all to be

14:06.640 --> 14:12.800
afraid of that because you would be protected under this American law. Assuming you were hosting it

14:12.800 --> 14:20.720
or the business was started in America or based out of America, I think HAN famously, the creators

14:20.720 --> 14:26.560
didn't live in America, the administrators didn't, but it was hosted out of America, which is why

14:26.560 --> 14:29.760
actually I'm not going to pretend like I'm a lawyer on this. I don't know what the rules are

14:29.760 --> 14:34.480
surrounding that. I'm not sure if you have to just have like an LLC set up in America for this

14:34.480 --> 14:41.680
to work and you can host it anywhere. I guess you would have to because digital ocean operates under

14:41.680 --> 14:46.080
American law, but they obviously have servers all around the world. That's one of the things they

14:46.080 --> 14:54.480
offer is that you can use servers from anywhere. Anyway, sorry, I went back to check and see if

14:54.480 --> 14:58.480
I was still getting that issue. I still am. Honestly, I guess I'll take this time to say,

14:58.480 --> 15:04.000
if anyone sees this in the future, I'm going to start taking streaming and doing YouTubeing a

15:04.000 --> 15:10.320
little bit more seriously. There was a guy I met years ago who was super into fitness.

15:13.280 --> 15:18.080
I was always like, what is it with you? How do you do this? All he did was eat,

15:18.080 --> 15:23.280
breathe, and live fitness. I thought that seems like such a crazy thing. I've never felt that way.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.560
I was like, how do you stay so inspired to do it? Because every day he would spend a job's

15:28.640 --> 15:35.760
length amount of time, like four to six hours just focusing on meal prepping or exercising or

15:35.760 --> 15:43.840
whatever else he was doing. He said, every time I get demotivated, I buy myself something related

15:43.840 --> 15:48.880
to it to kind of rekindle my interest and remind myself it's a hobby. I remember thinking,

15:49.920 --> 15:54.000
that's stupid. That's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard, but I tried it recently.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.600
Long story short, after Corona, I had a lot more work emergencies come up,

16:00.240 --> 16:04.720
things I had to work on, and I stopped doing music. I used to do electronic and,

16:06.080 --> 16:12.560
I guess, analog, non-electronic music a lot. I haven't done it at all since Corona started,

16:12.560 --> 16:18.160
but I went out and I bought a new interface, and all of a sudden, I'm doing it again. I thought,

16:18.160 --> 16:21.200
you know what, maybe that's a good idea. I was thinking about taking this a little more seriously,

16:21.200 --> 16:25.120
and I thought, I should buy a new microphone, because the one I'm using now, I've had for like

16:25.120 --> 16:31.440
12 years. If anyone has a suggestion, that was the whole reason I went off on that entire tangent,

16:31.440 --> 16:36.640
was just to say, if anyone has a suggestion for a microphone that's not like, you know,

16:36.640 --> 16:40.800
I don't need to start my own radio show, I don't need something crazy, but it would be nice to

16:40.800 --> 16:46.240
have something nicer than what I have now. I just have a USB blue microphone, like from

16:46.240 --> 16:51.360
before at Blue was a thing, before anyone knew what it was, before every streamer ever had a

16:51.360 --> 16:57.600
Blue Yeti. This is before Yeti, I think. It's just Blue, it's like S2 something, I don't know.

16:57.600 --> 17:03.760
Anyway, it's really old. So anyway, let me know. Okay, tangent, didn't mean to say that, sorry.

17:05.840 --> 17:09.200
Overall, the reason why, and like I said, there wasn't really a point to this video,

17:09.200 --> 17:13.680
I'm going to wrap up here in a bit, but the reason why I kind of wanted to rant about this and talk

17:13.680 --> 17:22.080
about it and get back on to talking about 230 at all is because the internet, after the repeal

17:22.080 --> 17:26.960
of 230, which again, I don't think it'll be repeal. I think Biden and Trump are both saying that to

17:26.960 --> 17:30.640
threaten these companies into changing their behavior. I think what they're going to do is

17:30.640 --> 17:35.360
they're going to revise it or amend it. There have already been proposed amendments. I think

17:35.360 --> 17:40.800
actually one that didn't have a huge impact was passed recently. You have to fact check me on

17:40.800 --> 17:45.440
that, don't quote me, but I'm pretty sure there was an amendment made to 230 recently that didn't

17:45.440 --> 17:49.760
affect this part, C1, which I'm looking at here, I'm highlighting now on the screen if you're looking.

17:51.360 --> 17:56.800
But it did affect something. So I think what these guys want to do is they want to amend it,

17:56.800 --> 18:01.200
they want to change it, they want to make it so these companies don't have insane amounts of power

18:02.000 --> 18:06.800
as far as controlling or in some cases not controlling from the Biden perspective,

18:07.760 --> 18:18.160
powerful movements on their sites. But they also want to keep the idea that some company can start

18:18.160 --> 18:22.800
some small experiment. Because remember, you guys have to remember, I don't know if anyone here is

18:22.800 --> 18:27.040
old enough or who watches my channel is old enough to remember when Twitter wasn't a thing,

18:27.040 --> 18:31.600
when it was a joke, people laughed at because it was back then it was like 120 characters,

18:31.600 --> 18:36.880
I think, or maybe it was even 60. And it was just laughable. I mean, it was a silly goofy thing

18:36.880 --> 18:42.720
where people posted like haikus and like, it was like vine for words for like witty people.

18:44.080 --> 18:49.040
And then all of a sudden news started getting onto it, like people would say they would post

18:49.040 --> 18:53.760
links to news articles. And it was all of a sudden the place where news traveled fastest,

18:53.760 --> 18:56.800
like seconds after an event happened, you could find it on Twitter.

18:56.880 --> 19:03.120
And you could almost always verify it was true. And so Twitter was an experiment. And Twitter would

19:03.120 --> 19:09.280
have been sued into dust and ash if Section 230 didn't exist when it was created. So this law has

19:09.280 --> 19:13.520
to exist in some way. I don't like how powerful these companies have gotten either guys, but

19:13.520 --> 19:20.240
this law has to exist in some way for innovative ideas like that to exist in the future of the

19:20.240 --> 19:24.960
internet. So anyway, kind of want to just get it out there, let people know my thoughts on it.

19:24.960 --> 19:31.520
I'm a huge fan of Section 230, especially C one this part here. I agree that there's a problem

19:31.520 --> 19:37.760
with how free. Well, free is the wrong word, I don't want to say we need to be less free. No, there's

19:40.160 --> 19:47.520
there was obviously no foresight, because how could there have been for how quickly these

19:47.520 --> 19:54.160
companies grew to be just massive giants that are playing huge parts in political games.

19:55.200 --> 19:58.480
You guys, of course, would remember in the last election, if you followed the American election

19:58.480 --> 20:07.520
at all from 2016, that Facebook was heavily accused of being a platform where anti Trump

20:07.520 --> 20:13.120
and anti Clinton propaganda was propagated. Twitter was to there was, of course, you still

20:13.200 --> 20:17.440
hear the meme about Russian bots, Russian bots on Twitter posting misinformation and FUD.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.440
You still hear about that. And these companies never anticipated getting to that point. So I do

20:21.440 --> 20:26.080
agree they're, it's almost like they're too powerful. It's almost like they're too important

20:27.120 --> 20:31.840
for what they are, which were basically, they all started as cute ways to, you know,

20:32.400 --> 20:35.680
cute things to show your grandma on the internet. That's how they all started.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.760
But now they've grown into this thing where think about the fact that Twitter,

20:40.560 --> 20:47.920
if Twitter were to ban one of the presidential candidates' accounts in America while they were

20:47.920 --> 20:53.360
campaigning, just think of what that would do. If Trump's account got banned or deleted,

20:53.360 --> 20:59.360
or Biden's account got banned or deleted, I think that would actually incite physical

20:59.360 --> 21:05.840
violence in the real world, in meat space, not cyberspace. And I don't think they can do it.

21:05.840 --> 21:09.520
If you guys might remember that liberal who was fired from Twitter in their last day,

21:09.520 --> 21:12.240
they deleted the president's account, which actually I thought was pretty funny. I mean,

21:12.240 --> 21:16.880
it's obviously, obviously it was a terrible idea. And I think that person actually faced legal charges,

21:16.880 --> 21:21.200
but, you know, it's pretty funny to leave the president's account. But that highlighted the

21:21.200 --> 21:29.120
whole issue, which is, oh, Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, is he just the like CEO in spirit,

21:29.120 --> 21:32.480
or is he actually still there? Let's say he is because I don't want to fact check myself

21:33.200 --> 21:40.320
right now. Jack Dorsey is the owner of this company, and he's incapable of deleting certain

21:40.320 --> 21:43.920
accounts. It doesn't matter if the president says the most dangerous thing in the world on Twitter.

21:44.960 --> 21:51.200
While he's campaigning, he is unable to delete his account without inciting some kind of very

21:51.200 --> 21:56.640
serious real world backlash. Anyway, it's all very interesting. And Section 230 allowed them

21:56.640 --> 22:00.400
to get here. So I understand the complaints about it needing to be revised. But at the same time,

22:00.400 --> 22:05.920
if we get rid of it, small experimental sites, even ones that I may not be a fan of like the Kiwi

22:05.920 --> 22:11.360
Farms or HNN, I think that the future of the internet isn't allowing those to exist. And Section

22:11.360 --> 22:17.120
230 is unique to American law. It's nowhere else. Noel, the owner of Kiwi Farms, has talked about

22:17.120 --> 22:22.000
this extensively. And again, whether you like him or not, we disagree on certain things, we agree on

22:22.000 --> 22:28.640
others. But he said like he spent most of his young life living in other countries for various

22:28.720 --> 22:33.040
reasons. And he spends a lot of time reading the free speech laws of other countries. And he said

22:33.040 --> 22:42.160
he's read the laws of Uruguay, Rwanda, Ukraine, Poland, and nowhere, nowhere where he thought

22:42.160 --> 22:46.800
he would be safe to host his site. Is there a law as powerful as Section 230 protecting

22:47.760 --> 22:54.960
small site owners from the crazy things their users might say? So anyway, that's it. I'm probably

22:54.960 --> 22:59.680
going to stop going live now. It's been about, I guess, 20 minutes, a bit of a rough start there,

22:59.680 --> 23:06.800
if you were on. I expect most people will see this after it's published and not live. Recommendation

23:06.800 --> 23:10.960
for a microphone, please, if you have one, that would be cool. If you thought this was cool, let

23:10.960 --> 23:16.480
me know. Obviously, I'm going to do the WeChat video next. I just, after seeing some of the things

23:16.480 --> 23:21.520
that just happened recently on Twitter and seeing Trump once again, pushing to repeal Section 230,

23:21.520 --> 23:26.480
I just wanted to talk about this. And that's pretty much all I got. Thanks, everybody.

23:28.800 --> 23:37.440
No, now I got to figure out how to stop streaming. Oh, God.
