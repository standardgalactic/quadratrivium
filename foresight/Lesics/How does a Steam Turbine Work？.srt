00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
Nuclear and coal-based thermal power plants together produce almost half of

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:11,440
the world's power. Steam turbines lie at the heart of these power plants. They

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,960
convert thermal energy in the steam to mechanical energy. This video will explain

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,380
the inner workings of the steam turbines and why they are constructed in the

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,920
manner they are in a step-by-step logical manner. To understand its basic

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,080
workings, let's first observe one of their blades.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,120
You can see that the blade of a steam turbine has an airfoil shape. When the

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,040
high-energy fluid passes over it, this airfoil shape will create a pressure

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,520
difference. This will subsequently create lift force. The lift force will rotate the

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:55,320
turbine. In short, the energy in the fluid transfers to the mechanical energy of

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,360
the rotor. To further understand steam turbine operation, let's understand

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:07,120
fluid energy in greater depth. A fluid has three forms of energy, due to its

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:15,360
speed, pressure, and temperature. As the blades absorb energy from the fluid, all

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,400
three forms of energy come down.

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,040
The low-velocity jet is of no use to produce effective lift force. To increase

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,600
velocity, the fluid is passed through a stator section. The stator set a

17
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,480
stationary and attached to the turbine casing. You can see that flow area

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:42,880
decreases along the stator and the speed thus increases. In short, the stator acts

19
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,520
like a nozzle. As the speed of the jet increases in the stator, kinetic energy

20
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,920
increases. As there is no net energy transfer in the fluid in stator section,

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,800
the pressure and temperature of the jet should decrease to keep the total energy

22
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:03,280
constant. Now, the next row of rotors is added. The stator also makes sure that the

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,600
flow coming out of it will be at an optimum angle of attack to the next

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:15,240
rotor set. After that, another nozzle set is added. Many such sets are used in a

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:21,120
steam turbine. There is an important term while designing steam turbines, namely

26
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,440
degree of reaction. This term is calculated by dividing pressure and

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,920
temperature energy by the total energy change in the rotor. Pressure and

28
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,760
temperature energy together is called enthalpy. The degree of reaction decides

29
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,840
what type of steam turbine it is. As the pressure of the steam undergoes a

30
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,880
drastic reduction during steam turbine operation, its volume increases

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,360
proportionally. To accommodate such an expanded steam, we have to increase the

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,560
flow area. Otherwise, the flow speed will become too high. This is the reason why

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,520
the steam turbine blades are too long towards the outlet. You can see how long

34
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,480
the last stage turbine blades are compared to the first stage blades. The tips

35
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,600
of such long blades will have very high velocity compared to the root. A twist is

36
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,080
given to it so that all blade cross sections will remain at an optimum

37
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:22,880
angle of attack. This kind of large turbine uses two such symmetrical units. You

38
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:32,480
can see how the steam is equally divided between these units. High capacity

39
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,400
power plants use different stages of steam turbines, such as high pressure

40
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:44,640
turbine, intermediate pressure turbine, and low pressure turbines. All these

41
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,360
units are attached to a single rotating shaft. The shaft in turn is connected to

42
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,560
a generator. The reason for such different stages is quite interesting. With

43
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,160
greater steam temperature comes greater power plant efficiency. This is

44
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,960
according to the second law of thermodynamics. But we cannot have

45
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,160
temperature greater than 600 degrees Celsius since the turbine blade material

46
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,400
will not withstand temperature more than that. Temperature of the steam decreases

47
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,440
as it flows along the rows of the blade. Consequently, a great way to increase

48
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,080
power plant efficiency is to add more heat after the first stage. So after the

49
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:36,280
first stage, the steam is bypassed to the boiler and more heat is added. This is

50
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,080
known as reheating. This will increase the steam temperature again, leading to

51
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:48,480
higher power plant efficiency and output. One challenging problem in power plant

52
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,920
operation is to keep the speed of the steam turbine constant. This is important

53
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,480
since frequency of the electricity produced is directly proportional to the

54
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,160
generator speed. However, depending on the load or power demand, the steam turbine

55
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,160
speed will vary. To keep the steam turbine speed constant, a steam flow governing

56
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,460
mechanism is used. If the steam turbine rotates at a higher speed, the control

57
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,400
valve will automatically reduce the steam flow rate to the turbine until the

58
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,920
speed becomes normal. If the turbine rotates at a low speed, the inverse will

59
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,200
be done. In this way, the balance of power demand and power supply will be

60
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,640
perfectly synchronized. To learn more about degree of reaction and its
