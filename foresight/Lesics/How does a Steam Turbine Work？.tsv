0	4260	Nuclear and coal-based thermal power plants together produce almost half of
4260	11440	the world's power. Steam turbines lie at the heart of these power plants. They
11440	16960	convert thermal energy in the steam to mechanical energy. This video will explain
16960	20380	the inner workings of the steam turbines and why they are constructed in the
20380	25920	manner they are in a step-by-step logical manner. To understand its basic
25920	30080	workings, let's first observe one of their blades.
31520	37120	You can see that the blade of a steam turbine has an airfoil shape. When the
37120	41040	high-energy fluid passes over it, this airfoil shape will create a pressure
41040	48520	difference. This will subsequently create lift force. The lift force will rotate the
48520	55320	turbine. In short, the energy in the fluid transfers to the mechanical energy of
55320	60360	the rotor. To further understand steam turbine operation, let's understand
60360	67120	fluid energy in greater depth. A fluid has three forms of energy, due to its
67120	75360	speed, pressure, and temperature. As the blades absorb energy from the fluid, all
75360	79400	three forms of energy come down.
80400	87040	The low-velocity jet is of no use to produce effective lift force. To increase
87040	91600	velocity, the fluid is passed through a stator section. The stator set a
91600	95480	stationary and attached to the turbine casing. You can see that flow area
95480	102880	decreases along the stator and the speed thus increases. In short, the stator acts
102880	107520	like a nozzle. As the speed of the jet increases in the stator, kinetic energy
107560	111920	increases. As there is no net energy transfer in the fluid in stator section,
111920	115800	the pressure and temperature of the jet should decrease to keep the total energy
115800	123280	constant. Now, the next row of rotors is added. The stator also makes sure that the
123280	126600	flow coming out of it will be at an optimum angle of attack to the next
126600	135240	rotor set. After that, another nozzle set is added. Many such sets are used in a
135240	141120	steam turbine. There is an important term while designing steam turbines, namely
141120	145440	degree of reaction. This term is calculated by dividing pressure and
145440	149920	temperature energy by the total energy change in the rotor. Pressure and
149920	154760	temperature energy together is called enthalpy. The degree of reaction decides
154760	160840	what type of steam turbine it is. As the pressure of the steam undergoes a
160840	164880	drastic reduction during steam turbine operation, its volume increases
164880	169360	proportionally. To accommodate such an expanded steam, we have to increase the
169360	176560	flow area. Otherwise, the flow speed will become too high. This is the reason why
176560	181520	the steam turbine blades are too long towards the outlet. You can see how long
181520	186480	the last stage turbine blades are compared to the first stage blades. The tips
186480	190600	of such long blades will have very high velocity compared to the root. A twist is
190600	194080	given to it so that all blade cross sections will remain at an optimum
194120	202880	angle of attack. This kind of large turbine uses two such symmetrical units. You
202880	212480	can see how the steam is equally divided between these units. High capacity
212480	216400	power plants use different stages of steam turbines, such as high pressure
216400	224640	turbine, intermediate pressure turbine, and low pressure turbines. All these
224640	231360	units are attached to a single rotating shaft. The shaft in turn is connected to
231360	237560	a generator. The reason for such different stages is quite interesting. With
237560	242160	greater steam temperature comes greater power plant efficiency. This is
242160	247960	according to the second law of thermodynamics. But we cannot have
247960	252160	temperature greater than 600 degrees Celsius since the turbine blade material
252160	258400	will not withstand temperature more than that. Temperature of the steam decreases
258400	263440	as it flows along the rows of the blade. Consequently, a great way to increase
263440	269080	power plant efficiency is to add more heat after the first stage. So after the
269080	276280	first stage, the steam is bypassed to the boiler and more heat is added. This is
276280	281080	known as reheating. This will increase the steam temperature again, leading to
281080	288480	higher power plant efficiency and output. One challenging problem in power plant
288480	292920	operation is to keep the speed of the steam turbine constant. This is important
292920	296480	since frequency of the electricity produced is directly proportional to the
296480	301160	generator speed. However, depending on the load or power demand, the steam turbine
301160	307160	speed will vary. To keep the steam turbine speed constant, a steam flow governing
307160	313460	mechanism is used. If the steam turbine rotates at a higher speed, the control
313460	317400	valve will automatically reduce the steam flow rate to the turbine until the
317400	321920	speed becomes normal. If the turbine rotates at a low speed, the inverse will
321920	327200	be done. In this way, the balance of power demand and power supply will be
327200	331640	perfectly synchronized. To learn more about degree of reaction and its
