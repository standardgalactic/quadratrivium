Nuclear and coal-based thermal power plants together produce almost half of

00:04.260 --> 00:11.440
the world's power. Steam turbines lie at the heart of these power plants. They

00:11.440 --> 00:16.960
convert thermal energy in the steam to mechanical energy. This video will explain

00:16.960 --> 00:20.380
the inner workings of the steam turbines and why they are constructed in the

00:20.380 --> 00:25.920
manner they are in a step-by-step logical manner. To understand its basic

00:25.920 --> 00:30.080
workings, let's first observe one of their blades.

00:31.520 --> 00:37.120
You can see that the blade of a steam turbine has an airfoil shape. When the

00:37.120 --> 00:41.040
high-energy fluid passes over it, this airfoil shape will create a pressure

00:41.040 --> 00:48.520
difference. This will subsequently create lift force. The lift force will rotate the

00:48.520 --> 00:55.320
turbine. In short, the energy in the fluid transfers to the mechanical energy of

00:55.320 --> 01:00.360
the rotor. To further understand steam turbine operation, let's understand

01:00.360 --> 01:07.120
fluid energy in greater depth. A fluid has three forms of energy, due to its

01:07.120 --> 01:15.360
speed, pressure, and temperature. As the blades absorb energy from the fluid, all

01:15.360 --> 01:19.400
three forms of energy come down.

01:20.400 --> 01:27.040
The low-velocity jet is of no use to produce effective lift force. To increase

01:27.040 --> 01:31.600
velocity, the fluid is passed through a stator section. The stator set a

01:31.600 --> 01:35.480
stationary and attached to the turbine casing. You can see that flow area

01:35.480 --> 01:42.880
decreases along the stator and the speed thus increases. In short, the stator acts

01:42.880 --> 01:47.520
like a nozzle. As the speed of the jet increases in the stator, kinetic energy

01:47.560 --> 01:51.920
increases. As there is no net energy transfer in the fluid in stator section,

01:51.920 --> 01:55.800
the pressure and temperature of the jet should decrease to keep the total energy

01:55.800 --> 02:03.280
constant. Now, the next row of rotors is added. The stator also makes sure that the

02:03.280 --> 02:06.600
flow coming out of it will be at an optimum angle of attack to the next

02:06.600 --> 02:15.240
rotor set. After that, another nozzle set is added. Many such sets are used in a

02:15.240 --> 02:21.120
steam turbine. There is an important term while designing steam turbines, namely

02:21.120 --> 02:25.440
degree of reaction. This term is calculated by dividing pressure and

02:25.440 --> 02:29.920
temperature energy by the total energy change in the rotor. Pressure and

02:29.920 --> 02:34.760
temperature energy together is called enthalpy. The degree of reaction decides

02:34.760 --> 02:40.840
what type of steam turbine it is. As the pressure of the steam undergoes a

02:40.840 --> 02:44.880
drastic reduction during steam turbine operation, its volume increases

02:44.880 --> 02:49.360
proportionally. To accommodate such an expanded steam, we have to increase the

02:49.360 --> 02:56.560
flow area. Otherwise, the flow speed will become too high. This is the reason why

02:56.560 --> 03:01.520
the steam turbine blades are too long towards the outlet. You can see how long

03:01.520 --> 03:06.480
the last stage turbine blades are compared to the first stage blades. The tips

03:06.480 --> 03:10.600
of such long blades will have very high velocity compared to the root. A twist is

03:10.600 --> 03:14.080
given to it so that all blade cross sections will remain at an optimum

03:14.120 --> 03:22.880
angle of attack. This kind of large turbine uses two such symmetrical units. You

03:22.880 --> 03:32.480
can see how the steam is equally divided between these units. High capacity

03:32.480 --> 03:36.400
power plants use different stages of steam turbines, such as high pressure

03:36.400 --> 03:44.640
turbine, intermediate pressure turbine, and low pressure turbines. All these

03:44.640 --> 03:51.360
units are attached to a single rotating shaft. The shaft in turn is connected to

03:51.360 --> 03:57.560
a generator. The reason for such different stages is quite interesting. With

03:57.560 --> 04:02.160
greater steam temperature comes greater power plant efficiency. This is

04:02.160 --> 04:07.960
according to the second law of thermodynamics. But we cannot have

04:07.960 --> 04:12.160
temperature greater than 600 degrees Celsius since the turbine blade material

04:12.160 --> 04:18.400
will not withstand temperature more than that. Temperature of the steam decreases

04:18.400 --> 04:23.440
as it flows along the rows of the blade. Consequently, a great way to increase

04:23.440 --> 04:29.080
power plant efficiency is to add more heat after the first stage. So after the

04:29.080 --> 04:36.280
first stage, the steam is bypassed to the boiler and more heat is added. This is

04:36.280 --> 04:41.080
known as reheating. This will increase the steam temperature again, leading to

04:41.080 --> 04:48.480
higher power plant efficiency and output. One challenging problem in power plant

04:48.480 --> 04:52.920
operation is to keep the speed of the steam turbine constant. This is important

04:52.920 --> 04:56.480
since frequency of the electricity produced is directly proportional to the

04:56.480 --> 05:01.160
generator speed. However, depending on the load or power demand, the steam turbine

05:01.160 --> 05:07.160
speed will vary. To keep the steam turbine speed constant, a steam flow governing

05:07.160 --> 05:13.460
mechanism is used. If the steam turbine rotates at a higher speed, the control

05:13.460 --> 05:17.400
valve will automatically reduce the steam flow rate to the turbine until the

05:17.400 --> 05:21.920
speed becomes normal. If the turbine rotates at a low speed, the inverse will

05:21.920 --> 05:27.200
be done. In this way, the balance of power demand and power supply will be

05:27.200 --> 05:31.640
perfectly synchronized. To learn more about degree of reaction and its

05:31.640 --> 05:36.800
implications, please check the next video. Please help us at patreon.com so that we
