00:00.000 --> 00:21.200
And capitalism isn't just there being pushed by neoliberal ideologues, it's in us as well.

00:22.200 --> 00:31.200
I think nothing illustrates this more clearly than the real widespread failure of so-called left,

00:31.200 --> 00:39.200
if there was any such thing anymore in parliamentary terms in Europe,

00:39.200 --> 00:47.200
to have taken advantage of the most spectacular failure of a political project ever, probably,

00:47.200 --> 00:55.200
which was the financial crisis and the bank bailouts of 2008.

00:56.200 --> 01:03.200
Living in a contemporary global capitalistic world, one that has siphoned out any radical economic dissent,

01:03.200 --> 01:08.200
the question looms, are we able to escape capitalism? Is there anything past it?

01:08.200 --> 01:15.200
Is any such endeavor even possible? To an arguable majority, they understand the looming issues with capitalism,

01:15.200 --> 01:20.200
even if it's something painful to admit. But this supposedly post-ideological world,

01:20.200 --> 01:25.200
a world with the end of the Soviet Union, of an actual communist Chinese government,

01:25.200 --> 01:31.200
is there any coherent vision past global capitalism? This is a central ethos of this book.

01:31.200 --> 01:38.200
Can we escape capitalism? What is capitalism? And what is this capitalist realism that Mark Fisher talks about?

01:38.200 --> 01:43.200
It should be noted before the body of the video, I have been told numerous times to read this book in its whole,

01:43.200 --> 01:49.200
and I regret I have not done it sooner. After reading this, this is hands down one of my favorite works of theory,

01:49.200 --> 01:53.200
and the greatest visualization of American capitalism I have ever seen.

01:53.200 --> 01:58.200
It is bleak, it is depressing, but more than anything, it is beautifully relevant.

01:58.200 --> 02:05.200
A relevancy from an author who fundamentally lived what he wrote, and who understood these very conditions to his core.

02:05.200 --> 02:12.200
I want these core points to be accessible to all, if possible, for these ideas to work into the collective unconsciousness,

02:12.200 --> 02:16.200
and to help break and understand this weird matrix that we are in.

02:16.200 --> 02:22.200
There has been numerous videos on capitalist realism, but I want this one to be the absolutely most ambitious one.

02:22.200 --> 02:28.200
I want it to completely encompass this book in its whole, and with an accessible form for all.

02:28.200 --> 02:35.200
More than anything, I want to do capitalist realism justice. This video is capitalist realism just in video form.

02:35.200 --> 02:52.200
After 1989, when capitalism loses its visible antagonists in the Soviet Empire, then capitalism doesn't have to defend itself as such.

02:52.200 --> 03:00.200
It just becomes the horizon of the imaginable. It doesn't have to be named anymore.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.200
It is all the more powerful because it is not named.

03:03.200 --> 03:07.200
Right from the start, Mark Fisher comes out swinging with the phrase,

03:07.200 --> 03:11.200
It's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.200
A phrase widely attributed to Frederick Jameson and Slavo Gizek.

03:15.200 --> 03:22.200
As shocking as this phrase is, it's undeniably true in almost every way that capitalism isn't a mere economic system.

03:22.200 --> 03:27.200
It's an imposed psychological reality in condition that has permanently altered our being.

03:27.200 --> 03:33.200
If post-mortem consciousness existed and we collectively destroyed our existence at the whims of capital,

03:33.200 --> 03:40.200
the very idea of restricting capitalism would possibly scare more than a very real apocalyptic scenario.

03:40.200 --> 03:45.200
In this context, capitalism is a mere system. It is us.

03:45.200 --> 03:50.200
This is why, when the impending threat of climate change is brought up, the reasonable response is,

03:50.200 --> 03:52.200
I just simply try not to think about it.

03:52.200 --> 03:57.200
To end capitalism is to end our contemporary human subjectivity today.

03:57.200 --> 04:03.200
But given the nature of this book, we must closely define what capitalism is and how it molds to us.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.200
Mark Fisher does just that with a whole host of prior theory.

04:06.200 --> 04:13.200
From the start, he elaborates on the traditional ethos of capitalism with a quote from Marx and Engels and the Communist Manifesto.

04:14.200 --> 04:22.200
Capital has drowned the most heavenly exceses of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of Philistine sentimentalism,

04:22.200 --> 04:25.200
and icy water of egotistical calculation.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.200
It has resolved personal worth into an exchange value,

04:28.200 --> 04:35.200
and in place of the numberless, indefensible, chartered freedoms has set up that single, unconscionable freedom, free trade.

04:35.200 --> 04:40.200
In one word for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions,

04:40.200 --> 04:45.200
it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.

04:45.200 --> 04:52.200
Capitalism is the human condition that is left after culture, ritual, and symbolic elaboration is dead.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.200
The new culture is now consumption and spectacle.

04:55.200 --> 05:02.200
It moves into the aesthetic realm, and as aesthetics and rational ideation go, we see capitalism as the ultimate purveyor.

05:02.200 --> 05:06.200
Humans do not merely go on military conquests like Genghis Khan.

05:06.200 --> 05:10.200
We do not merely kill and burn down villages for fundamental power and control.

05:10.200 --> 05:18.200
Instead, we set up camp in foreign countries and systematically set up shop and exploit human labor with the shiny facade of progress.

05:18.200 --> 05:24.200
But only when the exploited recognize the game they are being subjected to, they revolt and fight back.

05:24.200 --> 05:29.200
Then extreme brutality emerges, a brutality that is arguably worse than prior forms.

05:29.200 --> 05:36.200
Brutality like we saw in King Leopold II's Free State of Congo, plantation slavery in Cuba and in the Caribbean.

05:36.200 --> 05:42.200
Brutality doesn't cease to exist, it's simply massed, it's a more efficient and systemic endeavor.

05:42.200 --> 05:49.200
Capitalism sucks up culture, it sucks up history, turns the very things that often made us human into museum pieces.

05:49.200 --> 05:52.200
Everything is objectified, it's commodified.

05:52.200 --> 05:58.200
With Fukuyama's idea that we have reached the apex with liberal capitalism after the fall of the Berlin Wall,

05:58.200 --> 06:04.200
Mark Fisher believes that critical insight into late capitalism is often Nietzschean rather than Marxist.

06:04.200 --> 06:08.200
Nietzsche wrote about the overflow of history into the human condition.

06:08.200 --> 06:14.200
We have replaced human engagement in life, culture, and politics into spectatorship.

06:14.200 --> 06:17.200
We retroactively learn what it is to be human.

06:17.200 --> 06:22.200
We retroactively examine truth rather than engage into activities that make it so.

06:22.200 --> 06:29.200
Fisher quotes Nietzsche's most prescient pages are those in which he describes the over-saturation of an age with history.

06:29.200 --> 06:34.200
It leads an age into a dangerous mood of irony in regard to itself.

06:34.200 --> 06:40.200
He wrote in untimely meditations and subsequently into the even more dangerous mood of cynicism,

06:40.200 --> 06:47.200
in which cosmopolitan fingering, a detached spectatorialism, replaces engagement and involvement.

06:47.200 --> 06:56.200
This is the condition of Nietzsche's last man, who has seen everything but is decadently enfeebled precisely by this excess of self-awareness.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.200
This quote absolutely hit me to my core.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.200
Think about what we are doing right now.

07:01.200 --> 07:10.200
We are learning about something very abstract, theory-oriented, while simultaneously ignoring the very woes that we are learning about in reality.

07:10.200 --> 07:15.200
This learning, this education, this self-awareness simultaneously pacifies us.

07:15.200 --> 07:19.200
If this isn't one of the most scary insights, I have no clue what is.

07:19.200 --> 07:24.200
Moving on, Mark Fisher visualizes this living from history with Kurt Cobain.

07:24.200 --> 07:28.200
Kurt Cobain understood this new society of historical life.

07:28.200 --> 07:34.200
Kurt Cobain knew, as a star of MTV, he was just a prop, a prop that will eventually collapse.

07:34.200 --> 07:39.200
He was a spectacle, a newer mimic of stars like Jim Morrison and Hendricks.

07:39.200 --> 07:50.200
There's nothing more embarrassing than a group of people walking up to you and shaking and clamoring and praising you like you're some kind of fucking god or something.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.200
It's embarrassing.

07:51.200 --> 07:55.200
Further, even understanding this phenomenon to Cobain was a cliche.

07:55.200 --> 08:00.200
These anxieties he expressed further resulted in the nihilistic facade he portrayed.

08:00.200 --> 08:03.200
Why does it matter if I will be replaced by something greater?

08:03.200 --> 08:08.200
Why does it matter if I am just another spectacle, another object of desire?

08:08.200 --> 08:10.200
It's not fundamentally me anyway.

08:10.200 --> 08:15.200
This abundance of history creates a weird, new form of nihilism.

08:15.200 --> 08:20.200
If we know the results of our action, how time will repeat itself, why do anything at all?

08:20.200 --> 08:24.200
This is a nihilism that works perfectly within postmodern capitalism.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.200
This is often not a conscious nihilism either.

08:26.200 --> 08:36.200
The nihilism of the past, the very Nietzschean anxieties around the loss of culture, the loss of things that make us human, is child's play to this new form of nihilism today.

08:36.200 --> 08:39.200
And in many ways, it isn't just nihilism.

08:39.200 --> 08:43.200
It's a new, pernicious form of it, one that convinces you of the opposite.

08:43.200 --> 08:51.200
Fisher showcases this in the film WALL-E, a movie that shows an uninhabitable world from radical human consumption,

08:51.200 --> 08:57.200
a movie that actively decries the forms of capitalism we are subjected to and face right now.

08:57.200 --> 09:02.200
This movie isn't just spectacle, it invites us in to interact and participate in it.

09:02.200 --> 09:06.200
We gauge the world around us, how we are contributing to global disaster.

09:06.200 --> 09:13.200
Because of this, there is a mass outcry from right-wing observers for, quote-unquote, attacking its own audience.

09:13.200 --> 09:19.200
In many ways, WALL-E is a Marxian-like film, but there is one thing, there is one huge caveat at hand.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.200
This film ironically feeds this capitalist realism.

09:22.200 --> 09:27.200
The very film performs our anti-capitalist activism and education for us.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.200
We can consume this film with impunity.

09:29.200 --> 09:33.200
This corporate activism does all the work for us and perfectly pacifies us.

09:33.200 --> 09:39.200
Pacifies the very innate threat of human destruction into an ideal that we can pervasively enjoy.

09:39.200 --> 09:47.200
Where in other societies, propaganda is needed to cover up oppressive acts, the exact opposite is true with contemporary capitalism.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.200
Capitalism is strengthened by its own critiques.

09:50.200 --> 09:57.200
These corporate anti-capitalist critiques ironically act as a very reinforcement and an unconscious pacifying agent.

09:58.200 --> 10:03.200
As reinforcement goes, Fisher brings up the mode of mental health and contemporary capitalism.

10:03.200 --> 10:09.200
Marrying the work of Eros and Civilization by Herbert Marcuse, link right up above if you are interested.

10:09.200 --> 10:13.200
We see that mental health is a radically individualistic and internal problem.

10:13.200 --> 10:18.200
Psychology and mental healing are purely partitioned into an interpersonal thing.

10:18.200 --> 10:22.200
You have a chemical imbalance, you are super stressed, etc.

10:22.200 --> 10:26.200
Yet we recognize that external events play a role in this regardless.

10:26.200 --> 10:31.200
You go to therapy after a family member dies, after you are having a rough time in life,

10:31.200 --> 10:34.200
but the medical apparatus never touches work.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.200
It never touches economics.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.200
That is purely off limits.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.200
It's off limits because of capitalist realism.

10:40.200 --> 10:46.200
The idea that neoliberal contemporary capitalism is simply innately us.

10:46.200 --> 10:51.200
Therefore, it presents a depth that even psychology hasn't even been able to systematically penetrate.

10:51.200 --> 10:56.200
This moves us into the newer economic working conditions that affect the western subject.

10:56.200 --> 11:02.200
We used to live in a Fordist world, a capitalist framework that mirrored Henry Ford's production model.

11:02.200 --> 11:06.200
Line workers doing the same menial task over and over and over again.

11:06.200 --> 11:12.200
This is where traditional Marxists derive much of their ideas around alienation and the modern state of industrialized work.

11:12.200 --> 11:16.200
Yet today, we are living in something more pervasive and totally different.

11:16.200 --> 11:20.200
We are now in a very post-Fordist economic world.

11:20.200 --> 11:28.200
We see that in this post-Fordist world, flexibility, nomadism, and spontaneity are absolutely essential.

11:28.200 --> 11:32.200
You must be flexible, willing to stretch yourself to the absolute max.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.200
Hyper-individuality is now favorable.

11:35.200 --> 11:39.200
You must follow unfounded rules that are constantly made up on the spot.

11:39.200 --> 11:46.200
The main character of this film is in a constant state of useless menial task, sent from hyper-bureaucracy.

11:46.200 --> 11:52.200
The Reagan and Thatcher promises that neoliberalism, market capitalism would eliminate the very bureaucracy

11:52.200 --> 11:55.200
and false appearance of progress found in Stalin's Soviet Union.

11:55.200 --> 12:02.200
A bureaucracy that was supposedly only found in the public sector is ironically worse in today's post-modern capitalism.

12:02.200 --> 12:07.200
Today's capitalism has found itself in the same dilemma of ex-Soviet states,

12:07.200 --> 12:13.200
the pursuit of symbols and the appearance of productivity and progress, more than the actual progress itself.

12:13.200 --> 12:19.200
Teachers and professors are now tasked to adhering to strict curriculum where administrators will watch their lectures.

12:19.200 --> 12:26.200
These educators are now more concerned with fulfilling the appearance of education rather than the education itself.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.200
But this isn't a phenomenon found because education is within the public sector.

12:30.200 --> 12:36.200
This is a new phenomenon posited by neoliberal right-wing and hyper-capitalistic governments.

12:36.200 --> 12:44.200
A strategy that originally took place in private schools but then subsequently found its home in public schools from a neoliberal government.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.200
Mark Fisher quotes,

12:45.200 --> 12:53.200
This is in part a consequence of the inherent resistance of certain processes and services to marketization.

12:53.200 --> 12:59.200
The supposed marketization of education, for instance, rests on a confused and underdeveloped analogy.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.200
Are students the consumers of the service or its product?

13:02.200 --> 13:06.200
An idealized market was supposed to deliver friction-free exchanges,

13:06.200 --> 13:13.200
in which the desires of consumers would be met directly without the need for intervention or mediation by regulatory agencies.

13:13.200 --> 13:21.200
Yet the drive to assess the performance of workers and to measure forms of labor which, by their nature, are resistant to quantification,

13:21.200 --> 13:25.200
has inevitably required additional layers of management and bureaucracy.

13:25.200 --> 13:29.200
What we have is not a direct comparison of workers' performance or output,

13:29.200 --> 13:34.200
but a comparison between the audited representation of that performance and output.

13:34.200 --> 13:45.200
Inevitably, a short circuiting occurs and work becomes geared towards the generation and massaging of representations rather than to the social goals of the work itself.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.200
This is what capitalism is.

13:46.200 --> 13:51.200
It's an elastic system that adapts, that consumes our former subjectivity,

13:51.200 --> 13:55.200
that pacifies us into forms of entertainment and material idealism,

13:55.200 --> 14:00.200
evaporating the very prior subjectivity that made us human, for better or worse.

14:00.200 --> 14:05.200
The concept of this contemporary capitalism is one of profound ironic contradiction.

14:05.200 --> 14:11.200
Fisher quotes the French philosopher Alain Béryou on this very late 20th century postmodern capitalistic paradox.

14:12.200 --> 14:20.200
A brutal state of affairs, profoundly inegalitarian, where all existence is evaluated in terms of money alone, is presented to us as an ideal.

14:20.200 --> 14:27.200
To justify their conservatism, the partisans of the established order cannot really call it ideal or wonderful,

14:27.200 --> 14:31.200
so instead they have decided to say that all the rest is horrible.

14:31.200 --> 14:35.200
Sure, they say we may not live in a condition of perfect goodness,

14:35.200 --> 14:38.200
but we're lucky that we don't live in a condition of evil.

14:38.200 --> 14:42.200
Our democracy is not perfect, but it's better than the bloody dictatorships.

14:42.200 --> 14:46.200
Capitalism is unjust, but it's not criminal like Stalinism.

14:46.200 --> 14:52.200
We let millions of Africans die of AIDS, but we don't make racist nationalist declarations like Milosevic.

14:52.200 --> 14:58.200
We kill Iraqis with our airplanes, but we don't cut their throats with machetes like they do in Rwanda, etc.

14:58.200 --> 15:04.200
What separates today's capitalism of a post-Soviet world is one of postmodern capitalism,

15:04.200 --> 15:07.200
where universal values do not really exist.

15:07.200 --> 15:11.200
There is a rejection of responsibility outside of the pursuit of capital,

15:11.200 --> 15:15.200
but Fisher articulates that this realism he talks about isn't merely postmodernism.

15:15.200 --> 15:19.200
It's more intense than that. It's a form of postmodernism beyond itself.

15:19.200 --> 15:25.200
Fisher says capitalist realism no longer stages this kind of confrontation with modernism.

15:25.200 --> 15:30.200
On the contrary, it takes the vanquishing of modernism for granted.

15:30.200 --> 15:36.200
Modernism is now something that can periodically return, but only as a frozen aesthetic style.

15:36.200 --> 15:40.200
Never as an ideal for living. This is what capitalist realism is.

15:40.200 --> 15:45.200
It is a rejection of concepts of space and time, history, everything.

15:45.200 --> 15:50.200
Capitalist realism rejects absolutely everything except the pursuit of capital.

15:50.200 --> 15:54.200
And subsequently, we see a world that completely cries out for modernity,

15:54.200 --> 15:56.200
and of the very better days of the past.

15:56.200 --> 16:02.200
And in a very capitalist, realist society, this is what crying out for modernity looks like.

16:02.200 --> 16:08.200
Let vote now. Make sure you, in fact, let people know you're a senator.

16:08.200 --> 16:15.200
I'm not going to answer the question because the question is radical left.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.200
Who is on your list, Joe?

16:18.200 --> 16:22.200
This is so unprecedented.

16:22.200 --> 16:27.200
We have ended this segment. We're going to move on to the second segment.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.200
That was really a productive segment, wasn't it?

16:30.200 --> 16:36.200
Biden represents our prior tame postmodern capitalistic world, one just with a nice modern facade.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.200
This world still has a connection to modernity, though.

16:39.200 --> 16:46.200
He is a representation of normalcy, a horrid neoliberal normalcy, but he is a cry for a return to better days.

16:46.200 --> 16:50.200
Admittedly, still terrible days, yet better than the latter stages of this realism.

16:50.200 --> 16:56.200
But while there is a connection to modernity, this normalcy is still removed from modernity itself.

16:56.200 --> 17:00.200
With Trump, Trump is the very embodiment of elastic capitalist realism.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.200
He is the embodiment of the ultimate form of postmodernism.

17:03.200 --> 17:07.200
As capitalist realism really is a hyperpotent form of postmodernism.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.200
We've covered a bit of postmodern conservatism on this channel.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.200
Here's a link above if you are interested.

17:12.200 --> 17:18.200
Biden acknowledges the fact of climate change, student loan debt, and the woes affecting capitalist subjects.

17:18.200 --> 17:22.200
Yet it will still be a massive struggle for him to do anything of substance on these issues.

17:22.200 --> 17:26.200
He will fight tooth and nail to keep capital at the forefront of importance.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.200
Compared to Trump, Trump denies these issues altogether.

17:29.200 --> 17:33.200
It's as simple as him claiming these massive issues don't really exist.

17:33.200 --> 17:39.200
And like that, they quite honestly disappear from his sphere of responsibility, as his base simply follows along.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.200
He's a reverse of the former.

17:40.200 --> 17:45.200
He lies about the issues plaguing humanity, yet he's ironically honest about the result.

17:45.200 --> 17:50.200
See that? Where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters, okay?

17:50.200 --> 17:52.200
It's like incredible.

17:53.200 --> 17:57.200
You see, he is cryptically honest about the political reality we are residing in.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.200
In the very disturbing, yet true results of his action.

18:00.200 --> 18:04.200
But these actions, these desires for a return to modernity to normalcy,

18:04.200 --> 18:08.200
can be viewed through the psychoanalytic lens of the Lacanian reel.

18:08.200 --> 18:12.200
In this case, Fisher uses the reel as something that any reality must suppress.

18:12.200 --> 18:18.200
An unattainable void that can be viewed through the fractures and inconsistencies of what we perceive reality to be.

18:18.200 --> 18:24.200
And in more Lacanian psychoanalytic terms, the appearance of reality can be seen as a symbolic order in the imaginary.

18:24.200 --> 18:28.200
But of course, we'll have to refrain from doing a complete deep dive into Lacanian psychoanalysis.

18:28.200 --> 18:34.200
Yet through this lens of looking at the fractures within capitalism, fractures that give us a glimpse into the reel,

18:34.200 --> 18:40.200
the concept of the reel can be used as a tool to uncover the true reality of capitalism, capitalist realism.

18:40.200 --> 18:43.200
And the very psychological effects it attempts to cover up.

18:43.200 --> 18:47.200
Rather than using a more ontological or metaphysical approach to the reel,

18:47.200 --> 18:50.200
Mark Fisher is simply using the reel as an application.

18:50.200 --> 18:54.200
How the reel can kind of ironically be used and concepts symbolically.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.200
So with a very symbolic approach to the reel,

18:57.200 --> 19:01.200
Fisher gives environmental catastrophe as an example of a reel.

19:01.200 --> 19:06.200
It's impossible for capitalism to truly assimilate climate change induced apocalypse into a potential reality.

19:06.200 --> 19:12.200
This statement might be confusing to some, given we use the example of Wally, an ultimate critique of capitalism.

19:12.200 --> 19:19.200
Yet, even within the most cynical examples such as Wally, we don't even concede that human annihilation is actually possible.

19:19.200 --> 19:25.200
Within Wally, humans are still alive, with robots to do the fixing of human woes and mass consumption.

19:25.200 --> 19:32.200
Even the most cynical critiques within mass entertainment and media does not truly contend with absolute catastrophe.

19:32.200 --> 19:37.200
Rather, the idea of catastrophe is just ironically reinforced within the system of capitalism.

19:37.200 --> 19:43.200
Solutions are just repackaged within the commodity, packaged into advertising and marketing campaigns.

19:43.200 --> 19:48.200
In simpler terms, under this stage of capitalism, the solution to climate catastrophe,

19:48.200 --> 19:52.200
driven by capitalism, is repackaged into more capitalism.

19:52.200 --> 19:56.200
Fisher quotes, environmental catastrophe is one such reel.

19:56.200 --> 20:04.200
At one level, to be sure, it might look as if green issues are very far from being unrepresentable voids for capitalist culture.

20:04.200 --> 20:11.200
Climate change and the threat of resource depletion are not being repressed so much as incorporated into advertising and marketing.

20:11.200 --> 20:17.200
What this treatment of environmental catastrophe illustrates is the fantasy structure on which capitalist realism depends.

20:17.200 --> 20:22.200
A presupposition that resources are infinite, that the earth itself is merely a husk,

20:22.200 --> 20:29.200
which capital can at certain point, slow like a used skin, and that any problem can be solved by the market.

20:29.200 --> 20:38.200
In this case, the hidden reel in a capitalist system is the emergence of surface capitalist solutions to solve the very issues capitalism has created.

20:38.200 --> 20:43.200
The privatization of stress, a new emergence of neoliberal hyperbureaucracy,

20:43.200 --> 20:48.200
a very much worse audit-based version of bureaucracy neoliberalism promised to solve.

20:48.200 --> 20:56.200
Fisher describes this massive issue of mental health and how capitalism privatizes it and re-establishes mental health as purely internal.

20:56.200 --> 21:01.200
A natural occurrence. This mirrors the naturalism that neoliberalism espouses.

21:01.200 --> 21:08.200
When you ask the majority of Americans if they want socialized medicine, government-funded healthcare, universal healthcare, and the like,

21:08.200 --> 21:15.200
a likely majority show fear or shudder in confusion. That's because private healthcare is as natural as the trees around us.

21:15.200 --> 21:20.200
Not only this, but the private entity of any tangible service or product.

21:20.200 --> 21:26.200
Mark Fisher calls this existence people in the US are thrust into as a business ontology.

21:26.200 --> 21:36.200
Mark Fisher talks about how theorists like Foucault and Badiou have described potent and successful politics as something that explodes the very appearance of the natural order.

21:36.200 --> 21:41.200
To make their ideology, core beliefs, policies appear as something innate as nature.

21:41.200 --> 21:47.200
Fisher points out that the sheer amount of privatizations that took place in the 80s were unimaginable in 1975.

21:47.200 --> 21:56.200
Denationalization of utilities, railways, the existence of prisons as a profitable enterprise, these used to be things that were unimaginable.

21:56.200 --> 22:06.200
This changed because of the emergence of neoliberalism as something natural and with our new existence being centered around profit and finance, a complete business ontology as we see.

22:06.200 --> 22:17.200
This is why 21st century Americans still seem shocked at the idea that something isn't for sale, that something's existence isn't centered around profit, that being business and even people.

22:17.200 --> 22:21.200
Thus a world where our existence and ontology is centered around business.

22:21.200 --> 22:35.200
Despite a universal, a single-payer, not-for-profit healthcare system being statistically cheaper, more efficient, and an ultimate benefit to nearly everyone, many in the United States still shudder in fear or complete confusion at the prospect of it.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.200
Despite these findings.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.200
But this business ontology goes further than this.

22:39.200 --> 22:44.200
It's the prospect or hope that monetization can reach absolutely everything.

22:44.200 --> 22:49.200
It's a world and existence where commodity fetishism is at its highest point.

22:49.200 --> 22:55.200
Chapter 6 of the book brings us back into the new hyperbureaucracy that's present in 21st century capitalism.

22:55.200 --> 23:01.200
Fisher argues that the consequences of this new economic world is a world that melts into pure PR.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.200
Substance and progress is gone.

23:03.200 --> 23:06.200
Work now exists for the illusion of work.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.200
It's an ultimate anti-production work strategy.

23:08.200 --> 23:14.200
He sees this new phenomenon that marketizes Stalin's aesthetic approach to production.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.200
The irony in this is beyond comprehension.

23:16.200 --> 23:22.200
Neoliberalism has sought to become the most efficient system that would fight the Stalinist approach to the appearance of work.

23:22.200 --> 23:26.200
Fisher uses the example of Stalin's white sea canal.

23:26.200 --> 23:30.200
In the 1930s this canal was one of the most impressive feats in engineering.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.200
But only on the surface.

23:32.200 --> 23:36.200
The canal was too shallow to use for most 20th century cargo.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.200
Thus it was a symbol of production.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.200
And more importantly anti-production at that.

23:40.200 --> 23:44.200
Stalin's USSR would turn this canal into PR.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.200
People would photograph it.

23:45.200 --> 23:49.200
Whole Soviet public relation teams would be tasked with showcasing this canal.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.200
An empty canal that was really only pretty and useful on the outside.

23:53.200 --> 23:57.200
This is the very symbolic anti-production neoliberal capitalism sought to destroy.

23:57.200 --> 24:04.200
Yet neoliberal capitalism has made this PR business meta a more efficient endeavor under the use of constant auditing.

24:04.200 --> 24:08.200
Because of managers, bosses constantly breathing down your neck,

24:08.200 --> 24:11.200
workers are more concerned with the image of production.

24:11.200 --> 24:19.200
Teachers are more concerned with adhering to complete guidelines and the very appearance of education rather than education itself.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.200
This is what capitalist realism is.

24:21.200 --> 24:25.200
It's a post-fortis system where we cannot get too attached.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.200
We must move all the time.

24:26.200 --> 24:29.200
Sentimentalism is turned into pure profit motive.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.200
We are sucked into the end of history.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.200
An end of history that turns to new nihilism.

24:33.200 --> 24:37.200
A new nihilism that makes the old look like child's play.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.200
So can we get past this capitalist realism?

24:39.200 --> 24:41.200
Can we break through capitalism?

24:41.200 --> 24:44.200
To Fisher there isn't a huge tangible prescriptive answer.

24:44.200 --> 24:48.200
Seven eighths of the whole book is descriptive of our current capitalism.

24:48.200 --> 24:52.200
But there are prescriptive bits and pieces he gives us.

24:52.200 --> 24:55.200
The first is not to underestimate the system we are living in.

24:55.200 --> 25:00.200
It's arguable the traditional Marxist approach that capitalism will kill itself is far too optimistic.

25:00.200 --> 25:05.200
Marxist critiques of the past cannot hold a candle to the situation we are currently in.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.200
The reality is way more grim.

25:07.200 --> 25:12.200
Capitalism will kill itself by killing virtually all life via ecological disaster.

25:12.200 --> 25:19.200
The second is we must constructively approach neoliberalism, postmodern capitalism as a framework that is hyper artificial.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.200
Because it ultimately is.

25:21.200 --> 25:24.200
It's a massive ideological construct that isn't natural whatsoever.

25:24.200 --> 25:28.200
It's constructed for the benefit of a few oligarchs with the expense of the many.

25:28.200 --> 25:32.200
We need to point out that our capitalist realism relies on public funding.

25:32.200 --> 25:36.200
It relies on bailouts when it will ultimately fail every decade or so.

25:36.200 --> 25:40.200
Capitalist realism hides that collective intervention is necessary.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.200
We need to make this public.

25:42.200 --> 25:47.200
The existence of purely private enterprise is the artificial reality that has been implanted onto our being.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.200
Our approach should be new.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.200
It should be organic.

25:49.200 --> 25:52.200
It shouldn't be hyper fixated on ideology.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.200
It should be humane with the approach to mental health.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.200
The material conditions people face.

25:57.200 --> 26:03.200
And most of all, we must create new politics that exposes the prior reality as something purely artificial.

26:03.200 --> 26:07.200
As a world past capitalist realism is the natural order of things.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.200
Fisher ends the book with this.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.200
In this case, rationing of some sort is inevitable.

26:12.200 --> 26:18.200
The issue is whether it will be collectively managed or whether it will be imposed by authoritarian means when it is already too late.

26:18.200 --> 26:23.200
Quite what forms this collective management should take is, again, an open question.

26:23.200 --> 26:27.200
One that can only be resolved practically and experimentally.

26:27.200 --> 26:32.200
The long dark night of the end of history has to be grasped as an enormous opportunity.

26:32.200 --> 26:42.200
The very oppressive pervasiveness of capitalist realism means that even glimmers of alternate political and economic possibilities can have a disproportionately great effect.

26:42.200 --> 26:49.200
The tiniest event can tear a hole in the gray curtain of reaction which has marked the horizons of possibility under capitalist realism.

26:49.200 --> 26:54.200
From a situation in which nothing can happen, suddenly anything is possible again.

26:55.200 --> 26:58.200
Thank you guys so much for watching and making it to the end.

26:58.200 --> 27:05.200
Capitalist realism in my opinion is one of the most important books written in the 21st century and hopefully I was able to do it justice.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.200
As always guys, I have a huge request to make.

27:08.200 --> 27:12.200
These videos are only possible Patreon and without it this channel could not survive.

27:12.200 --> 27:18.200
So if possible, if you could pledge a couple dollars a month, this would absolutely ensure survival and would help me out immensely.

27:18.200 --> 27:23.200
And of course using our Amazon link for any purchases you make helps us immensely as well.

27:23.200 --> 27:28.200
Aside from that, feel free to follow me on Twitter, Instagram and come join the Discord and come hang out.

27:28.200 --> 27:32.200
Thank you guys so much, I thoroughly hope you enjoyed and hopefully I can see you in the next.
