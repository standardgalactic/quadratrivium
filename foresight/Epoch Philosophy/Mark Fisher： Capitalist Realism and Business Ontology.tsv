0	21200	And capitalism isn't just there being pushed by neoliberal ideologues, it's in us as well.
22200	31200	I think nothing illustrates this more clearly than the real widespread failure of so-called left,
31200	39200	if there was any such thing anymore in parliamentary terms in Europe,
39200	47200	to have taken advantage of the most spectacular failure of a political project ever, probably,
47200	55200	which was the financial crisis and the bank bailouts of 2008.
56200	63200	Living in a contemporary global capitalistic world, one that has siphoned out any radical economic dissent,
63200	68200	the question looms, are we able to escape capitalism? Is there anything past it?
68200	75200	Is any such endeavor even possible? To an arguable majority, they understand the looming issues with capitalism,
75200	80200	even if it's something painful to admit. But this supposedly post-ideological world,
80200	85200	a world with the end of the Soviet Union, of an actual communist Chinese government,
85200	91200	is there any coherent vision past global capitalism? This is a central ethos of this book.
91200	98200	Can we escape capitalism? What is capitalism? And what is this capitalist realism that Mark Fisher talks about?
98200	103200	It should be noted before the body of the video, I have been told numerous times to read this book in its whole,
103200	109200	and I regret I have not done it sooner. After reading this, this is hands down one of my favorite works of theory,
109200	113200	and the greatest visualization of American capitalism I have ever seen.
113200	118200	It is bleak, it is depressing, but more than anything, it is beautifully relevant.
118200	125200	A relevancy from an author who fundamentally lived what he wrote, and who understood these very conditions to his core.
125200	132200	I want these core points to be accessible to all, if possible, for these ideas to work into the collective unconsciousness,
132200	136200	and to help break and understand this weird matrix that we are in.
136200	142200	There has been numerous videos on capitalist realism, but I want this one to be the absolutely most ambitious one.
142200	148200	I want it to completely encompass this book in its whole, and with an accessible form for all.
148200	155200	More than anything, I want to do capitalist realism justice. This video is capitalist realism just in video form.
155200	172200	After 1989, when capitalism loses its visible antagonists in the Soviet Empire, then capitalism doesn't have to defend itself as such.
172200	180200	It just becomes the horizon of the imaginable. It doesn't have to be named anymore.
180200	183200	It is all the more powerful because it is not named.
183200	187200	Right from the start, Mark Fisher comes out swinging with the phrase,
187200	191200	It's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.
191200	195200	A phrase widely attributed to Frederick Jameson and Slavo Gizek.
195200	202200	As shocking as this phrase is, it's undeniably true in almost every way that capitalism isn't a mere economic system.
202200	207200	It's an imposed psychological reality in condition that has permanently altered our being.
207200	213200	If post-mortem consciousness existed and we collectively destroyed our existence at the whims of capital,
213200	220200	the very idea of restricting capitalism would possibly scare more than a very real apocalyptic scenario.
220200	225200	In this context, capitalism is a mere system. It is us.
225200	230200	This is why, when the impending threat of climate change is brought up, the reasonable response is,
230200	232200	I just simply try not to think about it.
232200	237200	To end capitalism is to end our contemporary human subjectivity today.
237200	243200	But given the nature of this book, we must closely define what capitalism is and how it molds to us.
243200	246200	Mark Fisher does just that with a whole host of prior theory.
246200	253200	From the start, he elaborates on the traditional ethos of capitalism with a quote from Marx and Engels and the Communist Manifesto.
254200	262200	Capital has drowned the most heavenly exceses of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of Philistine sentimentalism,
262200	265200	and icy water of egotistical calculation.
265200	268200	It has resolved personal worth into an exchange value,
268200	275200	and in place of the numberless, indefensible, chartered freedoms has set up that single, unconscionable freedom, free trade.
275200	280200	In one word for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions,
280200	285200	it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.
285200	292200	Capitalism is the human condition that is left after culture, ritual, and symbolic elaboration is dead.
292200	295200	The new culture is now consumption and spectacle.
295200	302200	It moves into the aesthetic realm, and as aesthetics and rational ideation go, we see capitalism as the ultimate purveyor.
302200	306200	Humans do not merely go on military conquests like Genghis Khan.
306200	310200	We do not merely kill and burn down villages for fundamental power and control.
310200	318200	Instead, we set up camp in foreign countries and systematically set up shop and exploit human labor with the shiny facade of progress.
318200	324200	But only when the exploited recognize the game they are being subjected to, they revolt and fight back.
324200	329200	Then extreme brutality emerges, a brutality that is arguably worse than prior forms.
329200	336200	Brutality like we saw in King Leopold II's Free State of Congo, plantation slavery in Cuba and in the Caribbean.
336200	342200	Brutality doesn't cease to exist, it's simply massed, it's a more efficient and systemic endeavor.
342200	349200	Capitalism sucks up culture, it sucks up history, turns the very things that often made us human into museum pieces.
349200	352200	Everything is objectified, it's commodified.
352200	358200	With Fukuyama's idea that we have reached the apex with liberal capitalism after the fall of the Berlin Wall,
358200	364200	Mark Fisher believes that critical insight into late capitalism is often Nietzschean rather than Marxist.
364200	368200	Nietzsche wrote about the overflow of history into the human condition.
368200	374200	We have replaced human engagement in life, culture, and politics into spectatorship.
374200	377200	We retroactively learn what it is to be human.
377200	382200	We retroactively examine truth rather than engage into activities that make it so.
382200	389200	Fisher quotes Nietzsche's most prescient pages are those in which he describes the over-saturation of an age with history.
389200	394200	It leads an age into a dangerous mood of irony in regard to itself.
394200	400200	He wrote in untimely meditations and subsequently into the even more dangerous mood of cynicism,
400200	407200	in which cosmopolitan fingering, a detached spectatorialism, replaces engagement and involvement.
407200	416200	This is the condition of Nietzsche's last man, who has seen everything but is decadently enfeebled precisely by this excess of self-awareness.
416200	419200	This quote absolutely hit me to my core.
419200	421200	Think about what we are doing right now.
421200	430200	We are learning about something very abstract, theory-oriented, while simultaneously ignoring the very woes that we are learning about in reality.
430200	435200	This learning, this education, this self-awareness simultaneously pacifies us.
435200	439200	If this isn't one of the most scary insights, I have no clue what is.
439200	444200	Moving on, Mark Fisher visualizes this living from history with Kurt Cobain.
444200	448200	Kurt Cobain understood this new society of historical life.
448200	454200	Kurt Cobain knew, as a star of MTV, he was just a prop, a prop that will eventually collapse.
454200	459200	He was a spectacle, a newer mimic of stars like Jim Morrison and Hendricks.
459200	470200	There's nothing more embarrassing than a group of people walking up to you and shaking and clamoring and praising you like you're some kind of fucking god or something.
470200	471200	It's embarrassing.
471200	475200	Further, even understanding this phenomenon to Cobain was a cliche.
475200	480200	These anxieties he expressed further resulted in the nihilistic facade he portrayed.
480200	483200	Why does it matter if I will be replaced by something greater?
483200	488200	Why does it matter if I am just another spectacle, another object of desire?
488200	490200	It's not fundamentally me anyway.
490200	495200	This abundance of history creates a weird, new form of nihilism.
495200	500200	If we know the results of our action, how time will repeat itself, why do anything at all?
500200	504200	This is a nihilism that works perfectly within postmodern capitalism.
504200	506200	This is often not a conscious nihilism either.
506200	516200	The nihilism of the past, the very Nietzschean anxieties around the loss of culture, the loss of things that make us human, is child's play to this new form of nihilism today.
516200	519200	And in many ways, it isn't just nihilism.
519200	523200	It's a new, pernicious form of it, one that convinces you of the opposite.
523200	531200	Fisher showcases this in the film WALL-E, a movie that shows an uninhabitable world from radical human consumption,
531200	537200	a movie that actively decries the forms of capitalism we are subjected to and face right now.
537200	542200	This movie isn't just spectacle, it invites us in to interact and participate in it.
542200	546200	We gauge the world around us, how we are contributing to global disaster.
546200	553200	Because of this, there is a mass outcry from right-wing observers for, quote-unquote, attacking its own audience.
553200	559200	In many ways, WALL-E is a Marxian-like film, but there is one thing, there is one huge caveat at hand.
559200	562200	This film ironically feeds this capitalist realism.
562200	567200	The very film performs our anti-capitalist activism and education for us.
567200	569200	We can consume this film with impunity.
569200	573200	This corporate activism does all the work for us and perfectly pacifies us.
573200	579200	Pacifies the very innate threat of human destruction into an ideal that we can pervasively enjoy.
579200	587200	Where in other societies, propaganda is needed to cover up oppressive acts, the exact opposite is true with contemporary capitalism.
587200	590200	Capitalism is strengthened by its own critiques.
590200	597200	These corporate anti-capitalist critiques ironically act as a very reinforcement and an unconscious pacifying agent.
598200	603200	As reinforcement goes, Fisher brings up the mode of mental health and contemporary capitalism.
603200	609200	Marrying the work of Eros and Civilization by Herbert Marcuse, link right up above if you are interested.
609200	613200	We see that mental health is a radically individualistic and internal problem.
613200	618200	Psychology and mental healing are purely partitioned into an interpersonal thing.
618200	622200	You have a chemical imbalance, you are super stressed, etc.
622200	626200	Yet we recognize that external events play a role in this regardless.
626200	631200	You go to therapy after a family member dies, after you are having a rough time in life,
631200	634200	but the medical apparatus never touches work.
634200	636200	It never touches economics.
636200	638200	That is purely off limits.
638200	640200	It's off limits because of capitalist realism.
640200	646200	The idea that neoliberal contemporary capitalism is simply innately us.
646200	651200	Therefore, it presents a depth that even psychology hasn't even been able to systematically penetrate.
651200	656200	This moves us into the newer economic working conditions that affect the western subject.
656200	662200	We used to live in a Fordist world, a capitalist framework that mirrored Henry Ford's production model.
662200	666200	Line workers doing the same menial task over and over and over again.
666200	672200	This is where traditional Marxists derive much of their ideas around alienation and the modern state of industrialized work.
672200	676200	Yet today, we are living in something more pervasive and totally different.
676200	680200	We are now in a very post-Fordist economic world.
680200	688200	We see that in this post-Fordist world, flexibility, nomadism, and spontaneity are absolutely essential.
688200	692200	You must be flexible, willing to stretch yourself to the absolute max.
692200	695200	Hyper-individuality is now favorable.
695200	699200	You must follow unfounded rules that are constantly made up on the spot.
699200	706200	The main character of this film is in a constant state of useless menial task, sent from hyper-bureaucracy.
706200	712200	The Reagan and Thatcher promises that neoliberalism, market capitalism would eliminate the very bureaucracy
712200	715200	and false appearance of progress found in Stalin's Soviet Union.
715200	722200	A bureaucracy that was supposedly only found in the public sector is ironically worse in today's post-modern capitalism.
722200	727200	Today's capitalism has found itself in the same dilemma of ex-Soviet states,
727200	733200	the pursuit of symbols and the appearance of productivity and progress, more than the actual progress itself.
733200	739200	Teachers and professors are now tasked to adhering to strict curriculum where administrators will watch their lectures.
739200	746200	These educators are now more concerned with fulfilling the appearance of education rather than the education itself.
746200	750200	But this isn't a phenomenon found because education is within the public sector.
750200	756200	This is a new phenomenon posited by neoliberal right-wing and hyper-capitalistic governments.
756200	764200	A strategy that originally took place in private schools but then subsequently found its home in public schools from a neoliberal government.
764200	765200	Mark Fisher quotes,
765200	773200	This is in part a consequence of the inherent resistance of certain processes and services to marketization.
773200	779200	The supposed marketization of education, for instance, rests on a confused and underdeveloped analogy.
779200	782200	Are students the consumers of the service or its product?
782200	786200	An idealized market was supposed to deliver friction-free exchanges,
786200	793200	in which the desires of consumers would be met directly without the need for intervention or mediation by regulatory agencies.
793200	801200	Yet the drive to assess the performance of workers and to measure forms of labor which, by their nature, are resistant to quantification,
801200	805200	has inevitably required additional layers of management and bureaucracy.
805200	809200	What we have is not a direct comparison of workers' performance or output,
809200	814200	but a comparison between the audited representation of that performance and output.
814200	825200	Inevitably, a short circuiting occurs and work becomes geared towards the generation and massaging of representations rather than to the social goals of the work itself.
825200	826200	This is what capitalism is.
826200	831200	It's an elastic system that adapts, that consumes our former subjectivity,
831200	835200	that pacifies us into forms of entertainment and material idealism,
835200	840200	evaporating the very prior subjectivity that made us human, for better or worse.
840200	845200	The concept of this contemporary capitalism is one of profound ironic contradiction.
845200	851200	Fisher quotes the French philosopher Alain Béryou on this very late 20th century postmodern capitalistic paradox.
852200	860200	A brutal state of affairs, profoundly inegalitarian, where all existence is evaluated in terms of money alone, is presented to us as an ideal.
860200	867200	To justify their conservatism, the partisans of the established order cannot really call it ideal or wonderful,
867200	871200	so instead they have decided to say that all the rest is horrible.
871200	875200	Sure, they say we may not live in a condition of perfect goodness,
875200	878200	but we're lucky that we don't live in a condition of evil.
878200	882200	Our democracy is not perfect, but it's better than the bloody dictatorships.
882200	886200	Capitalism is unjust, but it's not criminal like Stalinism.
886200	892200	We let millions of Africans die of AIDS, but we don't make racist nationalist declarations like Milosevic.
892200	898200	We kill Iraqis with our airplanes, but we don't cut their throats with machetes like they do in Rwanda, etc.
898200	904200	What separates today's capitalism of a post-Soviet world is one of postmodern capitalism,
904200	907200	where universal values do not really exist.
907200	911200	There is a rejection of responsibility outside of the pursuit of capital,
911200	915200	but Fisher articulates that this realism he talks about isn't merely postmodernism.
915200	919200	It's more intense than that. It's a form of postmodernism beyond itself.
919200	925200	Fisher says capitalist realism no longer stages this kind of confrontation with modernism.
925200	930200	On the contrary, it takes the vanquishing of modernism for granted.
930200	936200	Modernism is now something that can periodically return, but only as a frozen aesthetic style.
936200	940200	Never as an ideal for living. This is what capitalist realism is.
940200	945200	It is a rejection of concepts of space and time, history, everything.
945200	950200	Capitalist realism rejects absolutely everything except the pursuit of capital.
950200	954200	And subsequently, we see a world that completely cries out for modernity,
954200	956200	and of the very better days of the past.
956200	962200	And in a very capitalist, realist society, this is what crying out for modernity looks like.
962200	968200	Let vote now. Make sure you, in fact, let people know you're a senator.
968200	975200	I'm not going to answer the question because the question is radical left.
975200	978200	Who is on your list, Joe?
978200	982200	This is so unprecedented.
982200	987200	We have ended this segment. We're going to move on to the second segment.
987200	989200	That was really a productive segment, wasn't it?
990200	996200	Biden represents our prior tame postmodern capitalistic world, one just with a nice modern facade.
996200	999200	This world still has a connection to modernity, though.
999200	1006200	He is a representation of normalcy, a horrid neoliberal normalcy, but he is a cry for a return to better days.
1006200	1010200	Admittedly, still terrible days, yet better than the latter stages of this realism.
1010200	1016200	But while there is a connection to modernity, this normalcy is still removed from modernity itself.
1016200	1020200	With Trump, Trump is the very embodiment of elastic capitalist realism.
1020200	1023200	He is the embodiment of the ultimate form of postmodernism.
1023200	1027200	As capitalist realism really is a hyperpotent form of postmodernism.
1027200	1030200	We've covered a bit of postmodern conservatism on this channel.
1030200	1032200	Here's a link above if you are interested.
1032200	1038200	Biden acknowledges the fact of climate change, student loan debt, and the woes affecting capitalist subjects.
1038200	1042200	Yet it will still be a massive struggle for him to do anything of substance on these issues.
1042200	1046200	He will fight tooth and nail to keep capital at the forefront of importance.
1046200	1049200	Compared to Trump, Trump denies these issues altogether.
1049200	1053200	It's as simple as him claiming these massive issues don't really exist.
1053200	1059200	And like that, they quite honestly disappear from his sphere of responsibility, as his base simply follows along.
1059200	1060200	He's a reverse of the former.
1060200	1065200	He lies about the issues plaguing humanity, yet he's ironically honest about the result.
1065200	1070200	See that? Where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters, okay?
1070200	1072200	It's like incredible.
1073200	1077200	You see, he is cryptically honest about the political reality we are residing in.
1077200	1080200	In the very disturbing, yet true results of his action.
1080200	1084200	But these actions, these desires for a return to modernity to normalcy,
1084200	1088200	can be viewed through the psychoanalytic lens of the Lacanian reel.
1088200	1092200	In this case, Fisher uses the reel as something that any reality must suppress.
1092200	1098200	An unattainable void that can be viewed through the fractures and inconsistencies of what we perceive reality to be.
1098200	1104200	And in more Lacanian psychoanalytic terms, the appearance of reality can be seen as a symbolic order in the imaginary.
1104200	1108200	But of course, we'll have to refrain from doing a complete deep dive into Lacanian psychoanalysis.
1108200	1114200	Yet through this lens of looking at the fractures within capitalism, fractures that give us a glimpse into the reel,
1114200	1120200	the concept of the reel can be used as a tool to uncover the true reality of capitalism, capitalist realism.
1120200	1123200	And the very psychological effects it attempts to cover up.
1123200	1127200	Rather than using a more ontological or metaphysical approach to the reel,
1127200	1130200	Mark Fisher is simply using the reel as an application.
1130200	1134200	How the reel can kind of ironically be used and concepts symbolically.
1134200	1137200	So with a very symbolic approach to the reel,
1137200	1141200	Fisher gives environmental catastrophe as an example of a reel.
1141200	1146200	It's impossible for capitalism to truly assimilate climate change induced apocalypse into a potential reality.
1146200	1152200	This statement might be confusing to some, given we use the example of Wally, an ultimate critique of capitalism.
1152200	1159200	Yet, even within the most cynical examples such as Wally, we don't even concede that human annihilation is actually possible.
1159200	1165200	Within Wally, humans are still alive, with robots to do the fixing of human woes and mass consumption.
1165200	1172200	Even the most cynical critiques within mass entertainment and media does not truly contend with absolute catastrophe.
1172200	1177200	Rather, the idea of catastrophe is just ironically reinforced within the system of capitalism.
1177200	1183200	Solutions are just repackaged within the commodity, packaged into advertising and marketing campaigns.
1183200	1188200	In simpler terms, under this stage of capitalism, the solution to climate catastrophe,
1188200	1192200	driven by capitalism, is repackaged into more capitalism.
1192200	1196200	Fisher quotes, environmental catastrophe is one such reel.
1196200	1204200	At one level, to be sure, it might look as if green issues are very far from being unrepresentable voids for capitalist culture.
1204200	1211200	Climate change and the threat of resource depletion are not being repressed so much as incorporated into advertising and marketing.
1211200	1217200	What this treatment of environmental catastrophe illustrates is the fantasy structure on which capitalist realism depends.
1217200	1222200	A presupposition that resources are infinite, that the earth itself is merely a husk,
1222200	1229200	which capital can at certain point, slow like a used skin, and that any problem can be solved by the market.
1229200	1238200	In this case, the hidden reel in a capitalist system is the emergence of surface capitalist solutions to solve the very issues capitalism has created.
1238200	1243200	The privatization of stress, a new emergence of neoliberal hyperbureaucracy,
1243200	1248200	a very much worse audit-based version of bureaucracy neoliberalism promised to solve.
1248200	1256200	Fisher describes this massive issue of mental health and how capitalism privatizes it and re-establishes mental health as purely internal.
1256200	1261200	A natural occurrence. This mirrors the naturalism that neoliberalism espouses.
1261200	1268200	When you ask the majority of Americans if they want socialized medicine, government-funded healthcare, universal healthcare, and the like,
1268200	1275200	a likely majority show fear or shudder in confusion. That's because private healthcare is as natural as the trees around us.
1275200	1280200	Not only this, but the private entity of any tangible service or product.
1280200	1286200	Mark Fisher calls this existence people in the US are thrust into as a business ontology.
1286200	1296200	Mark Fisher talks about how theorists like Foucault and Badiou have described potent and successful politics as something that explodes the very appearance of the natural order.
1296200	1301200	To make their ideology, core beliefs, policies appear as something innate as nature.
1301200	1307200	Fisher points out that the sheer amount of privatizations that took place in the 80s were unimaginable in 1975.
1307200	1316200	Denationalization of utilities, railways, the existence of prisons as a profitable enterprise, these used to be things that were unimaginable.
1316200	1326200	This changed because of the emergence of neoliberalism as something natural and with our new existence being centered around profit and finance, a complete business ontology as we see.
1326200	1337200	This is why 21st century Americans still seem shocked at the idea that something isn't for sale, that something's existence isn't centered around profit, that being business and even people.
1337200	1341200	Thus a world where our existence and ontology is centered around business.
1341200	1355200	Despite a universal, a single-payer, not-for-profit healthcare system being statistically cheaper, more efficient, and an ultimate benefit to nearly everyone, many in the United States still shudder in fear or complete confusion at the prospect of it.
1355200	1357200	Despite these findings.
1357200	1359200	But this business ontology goes further than this.
1359200	1364200	It's the prospect or hope that monetization can reach absolutely everything.
1364200	1369200	It's a world and existence where commodity fetishism is at its highest point.
1369200	1375200	Chapter 6 of the book brings us back into the new hyperbureaucracy that's present in 21st century capitalism.
1375200	1381200	Fisher argues that the consequences of this new economic world is a world that melts into pure PR.
1381200	1383200	Substance and progress is gone.
1383200	1386200	Work now exists for the illusion of work.
1386200	1388200	It's an ultimate anti-production work strategy.
1388200	1394200	He sees this new phenomenon that marketizes Stalin's aesthetic approach to production.
1394200	1396200	The irony in this is beyond comprehension.
1396200	1402200	Neoliberalism has sought to become the most efficient system that would fight the Stalinist approach to the appearance of work.
1402200	1406200	Fisher uses the example of Stalin's white sea canal.
1406200	1410200	In the 1930s this canal was one of the most impressive feats in engineering.
1410200	1412200	But only on the surface.
1412200	1416200	The canal was too shallow to use for most 20th century cargo.
1416200	1418200	Thus it was a symbol of production.
1418200	1420200	And more importantly anti-production at that.
1420200	1424200	Stalin's USSR would turn this canal into PR.
1424200	1425200	People would photograph it.
1425200	1429200	Whole Soviet public relation teams would be tasked with showcasing this canal.
1429200	1433200	An empty canal that was really only pretty and useful on the outside.
1433200	1437200	This is the very symbolic anti-production neoliberal capitalism sought to destroy.
1437200	1444200	Yet neoliberal capitalism has made this PR business meta a more efficient endeavor under the use of constant auditing.
1444200	1448200	Because of managers, bosses constantly breathing down your neck,
1448200	1451200	workers are more concerned with the image of production.
1451200	1459200	Teachers are more concerned with adhering to complete guidelines and the very appearance of education rather than education itself.
1459200	1461200	This is what capitalist realism is.
1461200	1465200	It's a post-fortis system where we cannot get too attached.
1465200	1466200	We must move all the time.
1466200	1469200	Sentimentalism is turned into pure profit motive.
1469200	1471200	We are sucked into the end of history.
1471200	1473200	An end of history that turns to new nihilism.
1473200	1477200	A new nihilism that makes the old look like child's play.
1477200	1479200	So can we get past this capitalist realism?
1479200	1481200	Can we break through capitalism?
1481200	1484200	To Fisher there isn't a huge tangible prescriptive answer.
1484200	1488200	Seven eighths of the whole book is descriptive of our current capitalism.
1488200	1492200	But there are prescriptive bits and pieces he gives us.
1492200	1495200	The first is not to underestimate the system we are living in.
1495200	1500200	It's arguable the traditional Marxist approach that capitalism will kill itself is far too optimistic.
1500200	1505200	Marxist critiques of the past cannot hold a candle to the situation we are currently in.
1505200	1507200	The reality is way more grim.
1507200	1512200	Capitalism will kill itself by killing virtually all life via ecological disaster.
1512200	1519200	The second is we must constructively approach neoliberalism, postmodern capitalism as a framework that is hyper artificial.
1519200	1521200	Because it ultimately is.
1521200	1524200	It's a massive ideological construct that isn't natural whatsoever.
1524200	1528200	It's constructed for the benefit of a few oligarchs with the expense of the many.
1528200	1532200	We need to point out that our capitalist realism relies on public funding.
1532200	1536200	It relies on bailouts when it will ultimately fail every decade or so.
1536200	1540200	Capitalist realism hides that collective intervention is necessary.
1540200	1542200	We need to make this public.
1542200	1547200	The existence of purely private enterprise is the artificial reality that has been implanted onto our being.
1547200	1548200	Our approach should be new.
1548200	1549200	It should be organic.
1549200	1552200	It shouldn't be hyper fixated on ideology.
1552200	1555200	It should be humane with the approach to mental health.
1555200	1557200	The material conditions people face.
1557200	1563200	And most of all, we must create new politics that exposes the prior reality as something purely artificial.
1563200	1567200	As a world past capitalist realism is the natural order of things.
1567200	1569200	Fisher ends the book with this.
1569200	1572200	In this case, rationing of some sort is inevitable.
1572200	1578200	The issue is whether it will be collectively managed or whether it will be imposed by authoritarian means when it is already too late.
1578200	1583200	Quite what forms this collective management should take is, again, an open question.
1583200	1587200	One that can only be resolved practically and experimentally.
1587200	1592200	The long dark night of the end of history has to be grasped as an enormous opportunity.
1592200	1602200	The very oppressive pervasiveness of capitalist realism means that even glimmers of alternate political and economic possibilities can have a disproportionately great effect.
1602200	1609200	The tiniest event can tear a hole in the gray curtain of reaction which has marked the horizons of possibility under capitalist realism.
1609200	1614200	From a situation in which nothing can happen, suddenly anything is possible again.
1615200	1618200	Thank you guys so much for watching and making it to the end.
1618200	1625200	Capitalist realism in my opinion is one of the most important books written in the 21st century and hopefully I was able to do it justice.
1625200	1628200	As always guys, I have a huge request to make.
