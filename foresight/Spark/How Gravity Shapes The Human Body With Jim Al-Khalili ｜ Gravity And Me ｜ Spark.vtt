00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Would you like to lose a little bit of weight

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
without doing any exercise or dieting?

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Would you like to age just a bit more slowly than your friends?

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Well, you might be surprised to hear the laws of physics can help.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
The key to unlocking these everyday questions is gravity.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
It sculpts the universe.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
It warps space and time.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
It's a fundamental force of nature.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
But gravity's strange powers, discovered by Albert Einstein,

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
also affect our daily lives in the most unexpected ways.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
In this film, we'll be using cutting-edge scientific techniques

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
to investigate how gravity changes your weight.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
It's got up.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Your height.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I really have shrunk.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
And even your posture.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
And with the help of thousands of volunteers,

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
I'll show you how gravity makes us all age at different rates.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Throughout the day, I've just been logging on to the phone, logging on to the app.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
As a physicist, gravity is central to my work.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Oh, wow.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
And in exploring it, I'll be challenged on how I understand this most mysterious force.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Wow. OK. I need to go and write this one down.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
And I'll have to tackle the very nature of reality itself.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Gravity.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
It binds together all the matter in the universe.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
And it makes our existence here possible.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
But in the end, it all boils down to one simple question.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
What happens if I drop an object?

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Gravity's many mysteries are all contained in this single action.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
How an object falls.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Here's the first puzzle.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Why does a hammer fall faster than a feather?

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
You might think it's because the hammer is heavier.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
But that's not the real reason.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
The answer is air resistance.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
It's not the weight of the objects that matters.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
It's their shape.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
And I can demonstrate this very easily with these two umbrellas.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
They both have exactly the same weight.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
But if I open one of them,

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
you can be pretty sure it'll drop more slowly than the other one.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
In fact, all objects would fall at the same rate

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
if you could only remove the air.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
The first person to realise this was the 16th-century mathematician Galileo Galilei.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
Famously, it said he worked it out by dropping objects off the leaning tower of Pisa.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
And he was spectacularly proven right.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
In an experiment carried out on the moon in 1971.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Well, in my left hand, I have a feather.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
In my right hand, a hammer.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
And I'll drop the two of them here, and hopefully,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
they'll hit the ground at the same time.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
It worked perfectly.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Now Galileo was obsessed with a second question, too.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
When you drop an object, it's actually quite hard to tell

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
if it falls at a constant speed or picks up speed as it drops.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Even in slow motion, it's pretty hard to tell.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
But Galileo realised this.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
First, drop an object a very short distance.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
It lands with very little impact.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
But of course, drop it from higher up.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
This time, the ball easily breaks the tile,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
which means it must have accelerated,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
gaining in speed and momentum as it dropped.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
Galileo had identified something fundamental to all falling objects.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
They accelerate.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
He realised there might be a way to measure

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
how much falling objects gain in speed.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
What he devised was the first ever attempt to measure gravity itself.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
He built a long wooden ramp, rather like this,

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
that he had sloping at a shallow angle.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
The idea was to roll balls down the ramp

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
and measure their acceleration.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
The crucial thing is that the ramp had to be at the shallow angle

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
to reduce the effects of wind resistance.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
It also meant that the balls would roll down slowly enough

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
to give him time to measure their speed.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
But the big problem was this.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
How do you measure time accurately,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
in an age when there are no accurate timepieces,

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
let alone stopwatches?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Well, Galileo came up with an ingenious idea

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
involving the flow of water,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
essentially measuring time from the amount of water

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
collected in a cup.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
So, we're going to try and repeat Galileo's experiment.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
I say we, because I have a couple of willing volunteers,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Gavin and Joanna.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Three, two, one, go.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Stop.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
OK, there's one.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
Now, if you come down a quarter with a way down the ramp, go.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Stop.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
OK, so now half of the way down, go.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Stop.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Oh, just in time.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
OK, and then three-quarters of the way down, go.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Stop.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Right, turn the tap off.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
OK, so we have our four measurements

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
and I can see a progression from fuller to emptier.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
But what we need to do now is find the mathematical pattern

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
by weighing carefully the water in each glass.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Weighing the water should give us an idea

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
of how long each roll took.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
And in our experiment, these were the results.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Now, there's one immediate thing you can tell.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
The ball really sped up the longer it rolled.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
In fact, our results seem to show

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
that the time it took to cover the first quarter of the ramp

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
was about the same time it took to cover the next three-quarters.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Right.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
So we have a strong hint of a mathematical pattern.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
Now we'll see if we're right by placing bells along the ramp

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
at intervals which are based on the results.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
OK.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
This arrangement looks a bit strange

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
because the gap between the first two bells

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
is much shorter than the gap between the third and fourth bells.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
But that's OK because if we've got our calculations right,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
the ball starts off slowly, so it covers a shorter distance

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
and as it picks up pace,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
it'll cover longer and longer distances.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
So we should hear the bells ringing at equal intervals in time.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Go.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Beautiful.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
So what does this all mean?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
What's the mathematical formula?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Well, this is something that Galileo worked out.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Let's say, from the start,

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
the ball covers a distance of one metre in the first second.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
After two seconds, it'll have covered four metres.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
After three seconds, nine metres.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
After four seconds, 16 metres and so on.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
If you recognise this progression,

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
you'll see that distance goes like the square of time.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
Galileo had found the rate at which gravity speeds up objects.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
And he'd found another fundamental principle.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
You can measure the strength of gravity

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
by how much it causes falling objects to accelerate.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Detecting gravity has become exceptionally sophisticated these days,

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
but still uses exactly the same principle.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
This is Hearst Monso Castle in Sussex,

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
and in its grounds lies the space geodyssey facility.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Here, Vicky uses an astonishingly sensitive instrument

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
to detect the exact strength of gravity on this one spot.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
OK, so Vicky, tell me about this incredible gravity meter that you work with.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
OK, so this is the dropping chamber in a stripped-down version.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
So essentially, what happens is you've got a cart that gets raised to the top

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
and then the cart accelerates away from a mass in the middle,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
and so this section here lifts off,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
and as it drops, it drops under freefall.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
So this component in the middle, as it drops,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
is basically just Newton's apple falling to the ground.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Yes.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
So this is a stripped-down version, but that's the real thing.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
This is the real thing.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
How does it actually work?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
In here, it's a vacuum.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
So there's no wind resistance as it falls, right?

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
Inside, a laser is used to measure exactly how fast the mass is accelerating.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
This is the 21st-century version of Galileo's ramp

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
and the balls rolling down.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
So can we get it going?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Of course.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
If you'd just like to press the button on the laptop.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
This one?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yep.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
OK.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
So it's now communicating with it.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Oh, here we go.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
There we go.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
So it waits five seconds, then takes a measurement of gravity.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
And again.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
Oh, and you can see the results appearing now.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Yep.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Each of those green dots is measurement of gravity

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
with the actual number that it's getting for each one.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
The unit Vicki uses has a familiar ring.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
I see that the number up at the top here,

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
so you've got this unit, micro-gal.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
Yes, gal is essentially one centimetre per second squared.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
The gal was named after Galileo.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
So we've just taken the measurement of gravity here today,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
and it's this highly accurate number,

10:59.000 --> 11:08.000
981124007 micro-gal.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
The reading means that the Earth's gravity

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
speeds up a falling object by around 9.81 metres per second

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
for every second it drops.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Vicki tells me something intriguing.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
She takes a reading here every week,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
and she's found that the strength of gravity

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
changes by tiny amounts over time.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Heavy rainfall, for example,

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
can cause gravity to increase slightly.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
Presumably if gravity is changing here in one spot,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
it'll have different values all around the world,

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
and so you can have a gravity map of the entire planet.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
That's right, yeah.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
So what's the reason for these strange fluctuations?

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
That's what I want to investigate next.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
So, gravity changes as we move across the surface of the Earth.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Well, this lies at the heart of a challenge

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
that I've set two young volunteers.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
I've given them a task to try and find the place in Britain

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
where gravity is at its weakest,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
so where objects would weigh the least,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
and I've given them just three days to try and find it.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
The volunteers are Estrella Sendra, a PhD student.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
I've been living in London for five, six years,

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
and I'm originally from Seville in Spain.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
I'm very interested in taking part in this project

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
because I would really like to know more about how this world works.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
And Poppy Begum, a journalist who lives in London.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
I did my degree in biomedical science,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
and I did biology and chemistry for my A-levels,

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
but I haven't done any physics since I left school.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I'm fascinated to find out more about gravity,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
and I actually enjoy a puzzle. I like a challenge.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Now, the team can't just weigh themselves to see changes in gravity.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
Body weight fluctuates naturally by a couple of kilos over the course of a day,

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
whereas changes due to gravity, as they travel around the country,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
are going to be tiny in comparison, a matter of a few grams.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
So they're going to have to use sophisticated scientific methods

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
if they want to measure gravity accurately.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
And that's why the volunteers will be joined by three specialists in gravity science.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
PhD student Sonak Bose.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
He'll be in charge of some very sensitive measuring apparatus

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
from the National Physical Laboratory.

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
Sean Hughes, a geologist, who'll be using a portable gravity meter.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
And Andrew Ponson, a cosmologist at University College London,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
who'll help interpret the results.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
We've taken a collective weight for the team before they set off.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
It's 380 kilograms.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
So can they find the place in Britain where that'll decrease?

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
They're setting out in Snowdonia National Park in North Wales.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
The railway climbs from here to the 1,000-metre summit of Snowden.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Sean takes his first gravity reading.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
The inside is a mass on a beam,

14:21.000 --> 14:28.000
and you turn this counter, this dial, until you get the beam central.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
By counting the number of turns of the dial,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Sean can calculate the downward pull of gravity

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
acting on the mass inside the machine.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Sonak has a simpler method.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
So inside the box is a 2 kilogram mass,

14:44.000 --> 14:50.000
and it's supposed to be sort of as perfectly 2 kilograms as it's possible to get.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
All right, and place it here.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Ooh, it's just coming under, isn't it?

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
1,998.2 grams.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
So it was 2 kilos in the laboratory, but now here it's a bit less.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
It's the first puzzle.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
Why does a 2 kilo mass tip the scales at just under 2 kilos?

15:12.000 --> 15:20.000
And it's one which gets straight to the heart of what the challenge is really about.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
Mass is often confused with the related quantity weight.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
The mass of these dumbbells is fixed, it doesn't change.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
It's a measure of how much stuff they contain.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Weight is different.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
It's a measure of the effect of gravity on these dumbbells,

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
the downward force pulling them to the ground

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
in the same way that it's keeping my feet firmly stuck to the ground.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
The crucial difference is this.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
If I was holding these dumbbells on the moon,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
they'd still have exactly the same mass,

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
but they would weigh six times less

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
because the moon's gravity is so much weaker than the Earth's.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
So that's why Sonax bringing along the 2 kilo mass.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
If it changes weight, then this should mean that gravity itself has changed.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
Ahead of them is the summit of the highest mountain in England and Wales,

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
famed for its stunning scenery.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Or it would be stunning if you could see it.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
And this is what we came all the way up here for,

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
this amazing view at the top of Snowdon.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
You wouldn't know it, but honestly, we are here.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
So we're now near the summit of Snowdon

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
and I've set up the gravimeter again

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
and we're going to see what the difference in the reading is.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
He has to turn the dial again and again to try and get a reading.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
Its clear gravity has changed, but which way?

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Has it got stronger or weaker?

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
The team leaves Sean to work out his results

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
and tries to position the scales as close as possible to the summit.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
But the reading is all over the place.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
It's got up!

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
It's fluctuating quite a lot due to the wind.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
I have to say, this is what science is always like, isn't it?

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
It's never quite what you want it to be.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
So they head inside to the cafe next to the summit.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
The wind was being a bit naughty, but hopefully...

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
I mean, now it's in 0-0, so should be alright.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
1,998.2 down there.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
1,997.8!

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
We've got it.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
That's 0.4 of a gram off.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
The mass weighs a tiny bit less.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
It's lost about 1,500 of its weight.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
And Sean's found that gravity itself has reduced.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
At the top of the mountain, we took the measurement

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
and we discovered that the pull of gravity had gone down.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
It had gone down in equivalent to 206 turns of the dial

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
and we worked out that that's equivalent to 219 milligals.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
So it's clear from the team's measurements,

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
gravity weakens as you go higher and you get a bit lighter.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
It's just an excuse to say where we like the lightest.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Who cares?

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
But in the sense that it's actually really interesting.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
It's like an illustrative example of seeing how this is actually fluctuating,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
depending on different factors.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Absolutely.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
And that we could measure it and we could see it with our own eyes.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
It actually makes you think about gravity in a very active way.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
It's such a fundamental force phenomenon in nature,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
but we don't know much about it.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
But why does gravity change with altitude?

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
To understand that question, you have to get to grips

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
with the extraordinary discoveries of the next scientific giant in our story,

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Isaac Newton.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Born in England in the middle of the 17th century,

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
he spent his life wrestling with so many apparently separate questions,

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
from why things fall to the ground to why planets orbit the sun.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
It took the genius of Newton to realise that there was one single equation

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
that could answer all these questions.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
And here it is, his famous law of gravity.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
It might look complicated, but this is one of the most important equations

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
in the whole of science.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
F here is the force.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Newton said there's an attractive force between any two objects in the universe.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
On this side of the equation, G, we call the gravitational constant.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
Newton knew it had to be there, but he didn't know what its value was.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
M1 and M2 represent the two objects,

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
and R is the distance between them.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
The equation tells us that the more massive the objects are,

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
the bigger M1 and M2, the greater the attractive force.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
But the further apart they are, the bigger the value of R here,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
the weaker the gravitational force.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
With Newton, what was once mysterious now became clear.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
Newton's equation describes why an object falls to the ground,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
including his famous apple.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
But it's true genius is that it applies to any object, anywhere in the universe.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
So it's a very simple and elegant way of describing

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
some of the seemingly most complicated phenomena in the cosmos.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
His law of gravitation can still be used today

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
to explain how orbits work,

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
to predict when a comet will return,

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
to describe why galaxies spin,

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
or to slingshot spacecraft around planets.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
Newton tells us to look for the underlying simplicity and natural phenomena,

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
for instance, how the moon orbits the Earth.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
If I let go of this apple, it'll fall straight down

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
because of the pull of Earth's gravity.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
But if I throw it to begin with, it travels in a horizontal direction,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
that's the direction of travel,

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
but Earth's gravity is still pulling it downwards,

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
without following a curved path.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
Now, if I throw it harder, it'll travel further before it hits the ground.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
And in principle, if I could throw it hard enough,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I could put it into orbit.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
And that's exactly what's happening with the moon in orbit around the Earth.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
It's a combination of wanting to travel in a straight line,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
but also being pulled down by the Earth's gravity.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
It turns up constantly falling around the Earth,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
and constantly missing.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
Newton's famous equation also explains the strange effect

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
which the road trip team has discovered,

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
that objects get lighter as you gain an altitude.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
When I weigh myself, I'm represented by the first mass, M1.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
The second mass, M2, is the Earth itself.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
And the force pulling me down, my weight, depends on the distance

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
between me and the centre of the Earth.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
And that's the secret of the road trip.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
If you want to find a place where you weigh the least,

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
then you have to get as far away as you can from the Earth's core.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
So it's the afternoon of day one,

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
and the road trip team have to work out where to go next.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Poppy and Australia have a good idea.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
Find somewhere higher than Mount Snowden.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
From the measurements that you guys did at Mount Snowden,

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
altitude clearly plays an important part in gravity.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
So with that in mind, we've got to go to the highest point in the UK,

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
which is Ben Nevis.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
OK, but there's just one thing that we haven't shown you so far.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
We actually brought along an extra experiment.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Can we please show you this before you make the final decision?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Yes.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Sonak actually has the other part of this experiment.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
We always carry around...

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Some power tools, as physicists always do.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
So let's start off nice and gentle.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
OK, and then try and pick up some pace.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Spitter.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
And...

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
You got some friends out there.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Point proven.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
The point is that when something is spinning,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
it kind of gets flung outwards.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
And you can actually use that to make a nice flat piece of pizza.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
But this also applies to the Earth.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
The Earth isn't perfectly round.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
It's what's known as an oblate spheroid.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
It bulges at the equator where the spin is greatest.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
We've kind of got two competing effects now.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
We're trying to get away from the centre, the actual core of the Earth,

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
the point at the very centre of this ball.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
But now we can do it in two ways.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
We can either kind of go up something tall

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
or we can just go down towards the equator.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
That's what we find when we're doing gravity surveys,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
is that as you move south,

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
there tends to be an effect from latitude,

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
which is often usually larger than the effect from altitude.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
So the closer to the equator you go,

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
the further you get from the Earth's core

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
and the lighter you get.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
So, guys, the sun's setting just behind me here.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
This is north.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
From the conversations we've just had,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
it sounds like we've got to go that way down south.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Is that right?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Yep. OK. Let's go.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
The team is starting to uncover the reasons

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
why gravity changes as you cross the surface of the Earth.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Our planet is defined and shaped

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
by the complicated forces which act upon it.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
And detecting tiny fluctuations in its gravity field

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
can give us important clues.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
It can help us understand how our world is changing.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
The Space Geodosy Facility at Hearst-Monseau

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
is one small part in an enormous global network

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
which uses satellites to detect the tiniest of changes

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
in the Earth's gravity field.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
Tell me what exactly your job is here.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
What we're doing with this telescope

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
is measuring very accurately the distances of satellites from here.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
So we're using very short laser pulses

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
which we direct towards the satellite.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
On the satellite there are reflecting cubes

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
which return some of that light to us.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
And we measure how long it takes the light

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
to go to the satellite and back.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
And how far away is the satellite typically?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
The one we're tracking now is one of the Galileo satellites

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
which is about 20,000 kilometres.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
20,000 kilometres away.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Yes.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
OK, so we've got it aimed at the Galileo satellite

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
and you're going to turn the laser on now.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Yes.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Oh, wow.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
And that laser beam that's being fired up

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
towards the satellite,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
the time it'll take to get there and come back again,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
it's a fraction of a second, isn't it?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
It is. It's about 150,000th of a second,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
150 milliseconds.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
And we're sending about 1,000 of those per second.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
This strange-looking object is based on satellite readings.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
It's a highly exaggerated representation

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
of how Earth's gravity field varies over time.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Fluctuations like these

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
can give us important insights into climate change.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Ice caps melting,

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
sea levels rising,

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
changes in groundwater.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
All of these have an effect on the local strength of gravity.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
So something as important as climate change,

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
in order to understand it and do something about it,

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
we need to know the distribution of the gravitational field

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
of the Earth very accurately.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Absolutely, yes. And it's a global measure that we need.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
For the roadtrippers, it's the start of day two.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
And they're heading for the south coast.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
They're stopping off in Herefordshire.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
It's a good location, as it's the same altitude

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
as the base of Snowden,

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
but they've moved about 80 miles further south.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
So if they find gravity changes here,

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
it must be due to latitude.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
It's not a huge difference, but it's noticeable.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
Our counter-reading at the bottom of the mountain was 4,840.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Yeah.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
Our counter-reading here is 4,717.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
All right, so we do get to see a difference.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
So we're actually at the same altitude as the base of Mount Snowden,

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
but because we've travelled further down south overnight,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
gravity's less here. Yeah.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
They push on.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
And by sunset, they reach Sidmouth on the south coast.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
Shaun takes the second gravity reading of the day.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
And Poppy improvises a map.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Well, sort of a map.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Can we write not to scale at the top there?

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
So I drew this map.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Scotland's a bit squashed.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Wales is quite high up, and Cornwall is...

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Get the idea. Is there?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
But you get the idea.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
So, Shaun, we've been travelling with you.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
You've done quite a few gravity meter readings.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
Can you plot them on this not-to-scale badly drawn map, please?

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Sure.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
So if you remember, we started off in Mount Snowden about here,

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
and that was the zero measurement for our survey.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
And then we've come all the way down here to the south coast.

29:19.000 --> 29:26.000
The difference from the base of Snowden is minus 212 milligals.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
Wow.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
So the difference between going measuring gravity

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
at the base of the mountain and the top of the mountain

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
is about the same as here at this latitude

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
and down here at this latitude.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
They're quite clearly at sea level,

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
yet gravity here is roughly the same as it is at the top of Snowden.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
But where next?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
We are here.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
If we want to find out where we are the lightest,

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
why don't we travel all the way to the most southernly point

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
in the UK, which is here?

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Well, altitude can also help us.

30:03.000 --> 30:09.000
So why not find a place in the country that is both low in latitude

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
but also is high in altitude in terms of height above sea level?

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
Because that will get us somewhere that is really far away

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
from the core of the Earth while staying good in the country.

30:25.000 --> 30:32.000
So the answer to the puzzle lies in a combination of two factors.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
How much further south should they go and how much higher?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
At the end of day two,

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
Sean's results show that the team weighs about 80 grams lighter

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
in total than back at the base of Snowden.

30:55.000 --> 31:01.000
The way that weight changes is just one example

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
of Newton's famous equation in action.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
But Newton had left his masterpiece incomplete.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
He didn't know the value of G, the gravitational constant,

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
which sets the size of the force.

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
To harness the full power of the equation, you need to know G

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
and the vital clue came with an incredible experiment

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
conducted in London at the end of the 18th century.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
It was an attempt to work out the mass of the Earth itself

31:38.000 --> 31:44.000
and it was carried out by an eccentric, extravagantly rich aristocrat,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Henry Cavendish.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
Cavendish was a chronically shy, deeply solitary man

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
living in total isolation in his house in Clapham.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
The story goes that one day

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
he accidentally bumped into a female servant on his staircase.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
He was so traumatised by this event

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
that he had a new staircase built just for him

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
so this horrible incident could never happen again.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Cavendish had inherited vast fortunes

32:12.000 --> 32:17.000
and was able to dedicate his life to devising pioneering experiments,

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
including one particularly extraordinary piece of equipment.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
He set up something a bit like this.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
It's called a torsion balance.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
It involves four lead spheres, two large heavy ones,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
which are held fixed in place

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
and suspended by a very thin wire,

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
is a wooden rod, six feet long,

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
with two smaller balls on either end.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
Now, the crux of the experiment is the relationship

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
between the large ball and the small ball.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
Now, of course, there's a gravitational pull downwards

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
on both of the balls due to the Earth's gravity,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
but Newton also tells us that there should be

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
a very weak gravitational pull between the balls

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
and this is effectively what Cavendish was trying to measure.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
Any slight movement of the small ball towards the large one

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
should cause a twist in the torsion wire

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
and that's what Cavendish was trying to detect.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
Of course, this is all much easier said than done.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
The experiment was incredibly sensitive.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
The tiniest of vibrations, the slightest breeze,

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
changes in temperature could all influence the measurements,

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
so Cavendish had to isolate the apparatus inside a box

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
and the box within a shed.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
He even realised that his mere presence

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
next to the apparatus could influence things,

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
so he had to remove himself outside the shed.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
What he then did was sit outside the shed

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
and through a small hole in the shed wall

33:49.000 --> 33:54.000
looked through a telescope to detect the tiniest of twists in the wire.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
It was an incredibly difficult process,

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
but after many months, he finally felt confident enough

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
that he had a reliable result.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
MUSIC

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
Cavendish found that the small balls did move.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
A tiny four millimetres.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
He calculated his results by comparing the density of the balls

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
with the density of water.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
In the end, the result of Cavendish's experiment

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
and subsequent calculations was that the density of the earth

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
was about five and a half times that of water,

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
or put another way, the mass of the earth

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
was 5.9 trillion, trillion kilograms.

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
What's most remarkable is that Cavendish got this number right

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
to within an accuracy of 1%.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
With Cavendish's astonishing result,

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
scientists were able to work out G.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Then the equation could be used

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
to determine the mass of any celestial body

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
in orbit around another.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
So astronomers were able to calculate the mass of the sun

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
and the planets and the moon

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
and eventually even distant galaxies.

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
And, of course, back on earth, we never escaped gravity.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
Over the course of the day, it actually squeezes your spine,

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
an effect you can see for yourself if you use a measuring rod.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
OK, so it's half past seven in the morning.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
I've just gone up and I'm going to see how tall I am

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
before gravity drags me down.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
MUSIC

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
That's 178 centimetres, or just over 5'10".

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Over the course of the day,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
gravity compresses the fluids in your spine.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Right, it is just past 11 p.m.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
I've been standing up for most of the day,

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
so let's see if gravity has had an effect on my height.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
That is 176 centimetres,

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
so I really have shrunk by just over half an inch

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
over the course of today.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
In the longer term, gravity can affect your posture permanently,

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
but there are exercises you can do to counteract this effect.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
Part of my research has been looking at the effects of gravity

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
on the human body, so people might not be aware

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
or they might not always think about the effect of gravity

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
on our physical state, on our health, and particularly on our posture.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
However, because it's such a constant force,

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
gravity has a massive impact over the course of our lifetime.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
As you get older, you can develop a stoop,

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
which is damaging to your mobility.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Gothel here has actually got a very good posture,

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
but I'd like you to just show not so good posture.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
So when poor posture is really rounded shoulders

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
and then loss of the curve on the back as well,

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
I can't ask you to raise up your arms when you're in that posture,

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
so...

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
No, and then just come back down, shoulders back in and then raise your arms.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
You can see the effect of posture on function.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
Ironically, the exercises which many gym goers do

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
actually make your posture worse.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
That's if you only exercise the frontal muscles,

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
like the chest and abdominals.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
So it's recommended you exercise the back muscles just as much

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
to straighten you out and counteract the effects of gravity.

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
MUSIC

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
Meanwhile, it's the end of day two for the road trip,

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
and they've reached Sidmouth on the south coast,

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
looking for the place in Britain where they'll weigh the least.

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
They've worked out the answer lies in a combination of two factors,

38:20.000 --> 38:26.000
the right mix of going south and being higher up.

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
And for the final leg of the journey, I'm going to meet up with them.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
I asked them to drive a short distance west

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
to one of the most remote areas in mainland Britain,

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
Dartmoor National Park.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
It's only 40 miles from the southernmost tip of Britain.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
Hello. Hi, Andrew. Nice to see you.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
And it's very high, very hilly territory.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
Jim, the team got to the south coast yesterday

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
where we defined gravity at its weakest,

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
but we haven't quite figured out whether it's altitude or latitude.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
Do we go further south or do we go higher up?

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
You're right to ask, do we go as far south as possible

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
or as high as possible?

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
That's why I've brought you here to Dartmoor,

39:13.000 --> 39:18.000
and we've charted the most important points on this map here.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
All right. Let's have a look.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
We are here, two bridges.

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
These four dots represent these hills up there behind us,

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
which are at about 500 metres above sea level,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
so that's what we want to check out.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
These hills are close to the south coast,

39:35.000 --> 39:40.000
and they're also the highest in the whole of the south of England.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
So logic suggests there must be the right combination

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
of latitude and altitude.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Well, there's another reason why this makes perfect sense,

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
one which we haven't looked at yet,

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
and that is the effect of the underlying rocks on gravity.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
And I've got a map here that shows...

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
You're going to trump my map, aren't you?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Here we are, down here.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
These blue areas are the lowest areas

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
according to the density of the rocks underneath.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
The rocks around here are made of granite,

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
which will make gravity weaker still.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
So that's helping as well as the altitude

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
and the fact that we're further south.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Yep, it's also playing a part.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Well, we have a plausible theory,

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
but now we need to test it.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
If I'm right, then at the top,

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
our gravity reading should be by far the lowest reading of the trip.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
Of course, there's another effect of gravity to deal with now.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
It's knackering when you head uphill.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
OK, so I think this is pretty much the start of the hills

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
we've located on the map.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
So let's see if this is the lightest place.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Sean, if you want to get the gravity meter out,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
and we'll take another reading here.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
OK.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
Sean sets up his equipment one more time.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
What's the news?

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
Well, the bottom of Mount Snowden was our zero for this test.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
We found we lost a certain amount by going up to the top of Mount Snowden.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
We found we lost a certain amount coming south to the south coast.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
Not only have we beaten that, we've smashed it.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Brilliant.

41:23.000 --> 41:29.000
We were minus 219 milligals lower at the top of Mount Snowden.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
Here on Darkmoor, we're minus 347 milligals lower.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Brilliant.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
So it is a combination of three things.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
We're far south, so that's the latitude.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
We're at altitude, we're at high up,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
and we're surrounded by all this granite rock,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
which is low density anyway.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
I hope you all think it was worth the climb up here anyway.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
There you go.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Boom science.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
Now, we already know that the altitude of these hills

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
takes us much further from the Earth's core

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
than anywhere else further south in Britain,

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
so gravity must be weakest here.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
There's extra evidence too.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
The British Geological Survey has compiled tens of thousands

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
of gravity readings made in the UK,

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
and the lowest readings ever recorded were all taken around here,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
on the high hills of Darkmoor.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
What do we do to celebrate?

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
We weigh ourselves, of course.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
We affect the weight of that imagine.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
It's all them Nutella pancakes from breakfast.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
24-75.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
I need to leave, right?

42:38.000 --> 42:43.000
I can tell you that you should weigh something like 20 grams less

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
than you did at the base of Mount Snowden.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
Guys, I'm guessing something like 25 to 30 grams less.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
So if you want to weigh as little as possible,

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
this is the place in Britain to come.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
But in any case, it's such a tiny amount

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
that it's going to be wiped out entirely

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
by whatever it was you had for breakfast this morning.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
In episode 2, I'll investigate how Albert Einstein's

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
theory of gravity completely changed our understanding

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
of space and time.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I'll travel to Louisiana in the USA

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
to listen to the sound of black holes colliding.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
The biggest source of energy in the universe,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
one of the biggest events you'd ever measure,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
and we just barely saw it.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
And with the help of thousands of volunteers

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
and a smartphone app,

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I'll explore how the science of gravity

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
can help you age slower.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Thank you for watching.
