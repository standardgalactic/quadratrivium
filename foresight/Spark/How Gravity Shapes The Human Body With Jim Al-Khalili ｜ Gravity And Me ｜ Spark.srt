1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Would you like to lose a little bit of weight

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
without doing any exercise or dieting?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Would you like to age just a bit more slowly than your friends?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Well, you might be surprised to hear the laws of physics can help.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The key to unlocking these everyday questions is gravity.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It sculpts the universe.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It warps space and time.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's a fundamental force of nature.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But gravity's strange powers, discovered by Albert Einstein,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
also affect our daily lives in the most unexpected ways.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In this film, we'll be using cutting-edge scientific techniques

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to investigate how gravity changes your weight.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's got up.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Your height.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I really have shrunk.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And even your posture.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And with the help of thousands of volunteers,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll show you how gravity makes us all age at different rates.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Throughout the day, I've just been logging on to the phone, logging on to the app.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
As a physicist, gravity is central to my work.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh, wow.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And in exploring it, I'll be challenged on how I understand this most mysterious force.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Wow. OK. I need to go and write this one down.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And I'll have to tackle the very nature of reality itself.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Gravity.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It binds together all the matter in the universe.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And it makes our existence here possible.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But in the end, it all boils down to one simple question.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What happens if I drop an object?

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Gravity's many mysteries are all contained in this single action.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How an object falls.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Here's the first puzzle.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why does a hammer fall faster than a feather?

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You might think it's because the hammer is heavier.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But that's not the real reason.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The answer is air resistance.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's not the weight of the objects that matters.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's their shape.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And I can demonstrate this very easily with these two umbrellas.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They both have exactly the same weight.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But if I open one of them,

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
you can be pretty sure it'll drop more slowly than the other one.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
In fact, all objects would fall at the same rate

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
if you could only remove the air.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The first person to realise this was the 16th-century mathematician Galileo Galilei.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Famously, it said he worked it out by dropping objects off the leaning tower of Pisa.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And he was spectacularly proven right.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
In an experiment carried out on the moon in 1971.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, in my left hand, I have a feather.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
In my right hand, a hammer.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And I'll drop the two of them here, and hopefully,

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
they'll hit the ground at the same time.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It worked perfectly.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now Galileo was obsessed with a second question, too.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
When you drop an object, it's actually quite hard to tell

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
if it falls at a constant speed or picks up speed as it drops.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Even in slow motion, it's pretty hard to tell.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But Galileo realised this.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
First, drop an object a very short distance.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It lands with very little impact.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But of course, drop it from higher up.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This time, the ball easily breaks the tile,

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
which means it must have accelerated,

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
gaining in speed and momentum as it dropped.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Galileo had identified something fundamental to all falling objects.

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
They accelerate.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He realised there might be a way to measure

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
how much falling objects gain in speed.

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What he devised was the first ever attempt to measure gravity itself.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He built a long wooden ramp, rather like this,

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
that he had sloping at a shallow angle.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The idea was to roll balls down the ramp

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and measure their acceleration.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The crucial thing is that the ramp had to be at the shallow angle

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
to reduce the effects of wind resistance.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It also meant that the balls would roll down slowly enough

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
to give him time to measure their speed.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But the big problem was this.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How do you measure time accurately,

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
in an age when there are no accurate timepieces,

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
let alone stopwatches?

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, Galileo came up with an ingenious idea

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
involving the flow of water,

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
essentially measuring time from the amount of water

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
collected in a cup.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So, we're going to try and repeat Galileo's experiment.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I say we, because I have a couple of willing volunteers,

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Gavin and Joanna.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Three, two, one, go.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Stop.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
OK, there's one.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Now, if you come down a quarter with a way down the ramp, go.

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Stop.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
OK, so now half of the way down, go.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Stop.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh, just in time.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
OK, and then three-quarters of the way down, go.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Stop.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Right, turn the tap off.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
OK, so we have our four measurements

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and I can see a progression from fuller to emptier.

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But what we need to do now is find the mathematical pattern

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
by weighing carefully the water in each glass.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Weighing the water should give us an idea

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
of how long each roll took.

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And in our experiment, these were the results.

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Now, there's one immediate thing you can tell.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The ball really sped up the longer it rolled.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
In fact, our results seem to show

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
that the time it took to cover the first quarter of the ramp

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
was about the same time it took to cover the next three-quarters.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Right.

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So we have a strong hint of a mathematical pattern.

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Now we'll see if we're right by placing bells along the ramp

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
at intervals which are based on the results.

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
OK.

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This arrangement looks a bit strange

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
because the gap between the first two bells

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
is much shorter than the gap between the third and fourth bells.

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But that's OK because if we've got our calculations right,

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
the ball starts off slowly, so it covers a shorter distance

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and as it picks up pace,

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
it'll cover longer and longer distances.

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So we should hear the bells ringing at equal intervals in time.

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Go.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Beautiful.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So what does this all mean?

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What's the mathematical formula?

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, this is something that Galileo worked out.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's say, from the start,

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
the ball covers a distance of one metre in the first second.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
After two seconds, it'll have covered four metres.

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
After three seconds, nine metres.

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
After four seconds, 16 metres and so on.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If you recognise this progression,

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
you'll see that distance goes like the square of time.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Galileo had found the rate at which gravity speeds up objects.

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And he'd found another fundamental principle.

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You can measure the strength of gravity

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
by how much it causes falling objects to accelerate.

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Detecting gravity has become exceptionally sophisticated these days,

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
but still uses exactly the same principle.

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This is Hearst Monso Castle in Sussex,

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and in its grounds lies the space geodyssey facility.

145
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Here, Vicky uses an astonishingly sensitive instrument

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
to detect the exact strength of gravity on this one spot.

147
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
OK, so Vicky, tell me about this incredible gravity meter that you work with.

148
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
OK, so this is the dropping chamber in a stripped-down version.

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So essentially, what happens is you've got a cart that gets raised to the top

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and then the cart accelerates away from a mass in the middle,

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and so this section here lifts off,

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and as it drops, it drops under freefall.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So this component in the middle, as it drops,

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
is basically just Newton's apple falling to the ground.

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes.

156
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So this is a stripped-down version, but that's the real thing.

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This is the real thing.

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How does it actually work?

159
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
In here, it's a vacuum.

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So there's no wind resistance as it falls, right?

161
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Inside, a laser is used to measure exactly how fast the mass is accelerating.

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This is the 21st-century version of Galileo's ramp

163
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and the balls rolling down.

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So can we get it going?

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Of course.

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If you'd just like to press the button on the laptop.

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This one?

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yep.

169
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
OK.

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So it's now communicating with it.

171
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, here we go.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There we go.

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So it waits five seconds, then takes a measurement of gravity.

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And again.

175
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh, and you can see the results appearing now.

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yep.

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Each of those green dots is measurement of gravity

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
with the actual number that it's getting for each one.

179
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The unit Vicki uses has a familiar ring.

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I see that the number up at the top here,

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
so you've got this unit, micro-gal.

182
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes, gal is essentially one centimetre per second squared.

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The gal was named after Galileo.

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So we've just taken the measurement of gravity here today,

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and it's this highly accurate number,

186
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:08,000
981124007 micro-gal.

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The reading means that the Earth's gravity

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
speeds up a falling object by around 9.81 metres per second

189
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
for every second it drops.

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Vicki tells me something intriguing.

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
She takes a reading here every week,

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and she's found that the strength of gravity

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
changes by tiny amounts over time.

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Heavy rainfall, for example,

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
can cause gravity to increase slightly.

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Presumably if gravity is changing here in one spot,

197
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
it'll have different values all around the world,

198
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and so you can have a gravity map of the entire planet.

199
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's right, yeah.

200
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So what's the reason for these strange fluctuations?

201
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's what I want to investigate next.

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So, gravity changes as we move across the surface of the Earth.

203
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Well, this lies at the heart of a challenge

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that I've set two young volunteers.

205
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I've given them a task to try and find the place in Britain

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
where gravity is at its weakest,

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
so where objects would weigh the least,

208
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and I've given them just three days to try and find it.

209
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The volunteers are Estrella Sendra, a PhD student.

210
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I've been living in London for five, six years,

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and I'm originally from Seville in Spain.

212
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm very interested in taking part in this project

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
because I would really like to know more about how this world works.

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And Poppy Begum, a journalist who lives in London.

215
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I did my degree in biomedical science,

216
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and I did biology and chemistry for my A-levels,

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
but I haven't done any physics since I left school.

218
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm fascinated to find out more about gravity,

219
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and I actually enjoy a puzzle. I like a challenge.

220
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Now, the team can't just weigh themselves to see changes in gravity.

221
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Body weight fluctuates naturally by a couple of kilos over the course of a day,

222
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
whereas changes due to gravity, as they travel around the country,

223
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
are going to be tiny in comparison, a matter of a few grams.

224
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So they're going to have to use sophisticated scientific methods

225
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
if they want to measure gravity accurately.

226
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And that's why the volunteers will be joined by three specialists in gravity science.

227
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
PhD student Sonak Bose.

228
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He'll be in charge of some very sensitive measuring apparatus

229
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
from the National Physical Laboratory.

230
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Sean Hughes, a geologist, who'll be using a portable gravity meter.

231
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And Andrew Ponson, a cosmologist at University College London,

232
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
who'll help interpret the results.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We've taken a collective weight for the team before they set off.

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's 380 kilograms.

235
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So can they find the place in Britain where that'll decrease?

236
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
They're setting out in Snowdonia National Park in North Wales.

237
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The railway climbs from here to the 1,000-metre summit of Snowden.

238
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Sean takes his first gravity reading.

239
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The inside is a mass on a beam,

240
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and you turn this counter, this dial, until you get the beam central.

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
By counting the number of turns of the dial,

242
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Sean can calculate the downward pull of gravity

243
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
acting on the mass inside the machine.

244
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Sonak has a simpler method.

245
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So inside the box is a 2 kilogram mass,

246
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and it's supposed to be sort of as perfectly 2 kilograms as it's possible to get.

247
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
All right, and place it here.

248
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Ooh, it's just coming under, isn't it?

249
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
1,998.2 grams.

250
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So it was 2 kilos in the laboratory, but now here it's a bit less.

251
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's the first puzzle.

252
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Why does a 2 kilo mass tip the scales at just under 2 kilos?

253
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And it's one which gets straight to the heart of what the challenge is really about.

254
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Mass is often confused with the related quantity weight.

255
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The mass of these dumbbells is fixed, it doesn't change.

256
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's a measure of how much stuff they contain.

257
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Weight is different.

258
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's a measure of the effect of gravity on these dumbbells,

259
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
the downward force pulling them to the ground

260
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
in the same way that it's keeping my feet firmly stuck to the ground.

261
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The crucial difference is this.

262
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If I was holding these dumbbells on the moon,

263
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
they'd still have exactly the same mass,

264
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
but they would weigh six times less

265
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
because the moon's gravity is so much weaker than the Earth's.

266
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So that's why Sonax bringing along the 2 kilo mass.

267
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If it changes weight, then this should mean that gravity itself has changed.

268
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Ahead of them is the summit of the highest mountain in England and Wales,

269
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
famed for its stunning scenery.

270
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Or it would be stunning if you could see it.

271
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And this is what we came all the way up here for,

272
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
this amazing view at the top of Snowdon.

273
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You wouldn't know it, but honestly, we are here.

274
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So we're now near the summit of Snowdon

275
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and I've set up the gravimeter again

276
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and we're going to see what the difference in the reading is.

277
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
He has to turn the dial again and again to try and get a reading.

278
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Its clear gravity has changed, but which way?

279
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Has it got stronger or weaker?

280
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The team leaves Sean to work out his results

281
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and tries to position the scales as close as possible to the summit.

282
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But the reading is all over the place.

283
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's got up!

284
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's fluctuating quite a lot due to the wind.

285
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I have to say, this is what science is always like, isn't it?

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's never quite what you want it to be.

287
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So they head inside to the cafe next to the summit.

288
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The wind was being a bit naughty, but hopefully...

289
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I mean, now it's in 0-0, so should be alright.

290
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
1,998.2 down there.

291
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
1,997.8!

292
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We've got it.

293
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That's 0.4 of a gram off.

294
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The mass weighs a tiny bit less.

295
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's lost about 1,500 of its weight.

296
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And Sean's found that gravity itself has reduced.

297
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
At the top of the mountain, we took the measurement

298
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and we discovered that the pull of gravity had gone down.

299
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It had gone down in equivalent to 206 turns of the dial

300
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and we worked out that that's equivalent to 219 milligals.

301
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So it's clear from the team's measurements,

302
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
gravity weakens as you go higher and you get a bit lighter.

303
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's just an excuse to say where we like the lightest.

304
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Who cares?

305
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But in the sense that it's actually really interesting.

306
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's like an illustrative example of seeing how this is actually fluctuating,

307
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
depending on different factors.

308
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Absolutely.

309
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And that we could measure it and we could see it with our own eyes.

310
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It actually makes you think about gravity in a very active way.

311
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's such a fundamental force phenomenon in nature,

312
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
but we don't know much about it.

313
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But why does gravity change with altitude?

314
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
To understand that question, you have to get to grips

315
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
with the extraordinary discoveries of the next scientific giant in our story,

316
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Isaac Newton.

317
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Born in England in the middle of the 17th century,

318
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
he spent his life wrestling with so many apparently separate questions,

319
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
from why things fall to the ground to why planets orbit the sun.

320
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It took the genius of Newton to realise that there was one single equation

321
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
that could answer all these questions.

322
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And here it is, his famous law of gravity.

323
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It might look complicated, but this is one of the most important equations

324
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
in the whole of science.

325
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
F here is the force.

326
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Newton said there's an attractive force between any two objects in the universe.

327
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
On this side of the equation, G, we call the gravitational constant.

328
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Newton knew it had to be there, but he didn't know what its value was.

329
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
M1 and M2 represent the two objects,

330
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and R is the distance between them.

331
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The equation tells us that the more massive the objects are,

332
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
the bigger M1 and M2, the greater the attractive force.

333
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But the further apart they are, the bigger the value of R here,

334
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
the weaker the gravitational force.

335
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
With Newton, what was once mysterious now became clear.

336
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Newton's equation describes why an object falls to the ground,

337
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
including his famous apple.

338
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But it's true genius is that it applies to any object, anywhere in the universe.

339
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So it's a very simple and elegant way of describing

340
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
some of the seemingly most complicated phenomena in the cosmos.

341
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
His law of gravitation can still be used today

342
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
to explain how orbits work,

343
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
to predict when a comet will return,

344
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
to describe why galaxies spin,

345
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
or to slingshot spacecraft around planets.

346
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Newton tells us to look for the underlying simplicity and natural phenomena,

347
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
for instance, how the moon orbits the Earth.

348
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
If I let go of this apple, it'll fall straight down

349
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
because of the pull of Earth's gravity.

350
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But if I throw it to begin with, it travels in a horizontal direction,

351
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
that's the direction of travel,

352
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
but Earth's gravity is still pulling it downwards,

353
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
without following a curved path.

354
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Now, if I throw it harder, it'll travel further before it hits the ground.

355
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And in principle, if I could throw it hard enough,

356
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I could put it into orbit.

357
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And that's exactly what's happening with the moon in orbit around the Earth.

358
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's a combination of wanting to travel in a straight line,

359
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
but also being pulled down by the Earth's gravity.

360
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It turns up constantly falling around the Earth,

361
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
and constantly missing.

362
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Newton's famous equation also explains the strange effect

363
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
which the road trip team has discovered,

364
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
that objects get lighter as you gain an altitude.

365
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
When I weigh myself, I'm represented by the first mass, M1.

366
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The second mass, M2, is the Earth itself.

367
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And the force pulling me down, my weight, depends on the distance

368
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
between me and the centre of the Earth.

369
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And that's the secret of the road trip.

370
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
If you want to find a place where you weigh the least,

371
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
then you have to get as far away as you can from the Earth's core.

372
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So it's the afternoon of day one,

373
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and the road trip team have to work out where to go next.

374
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Poppy and Australia have a good idea.

375
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Find somewhere higher than Mount Snowden.

376
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
From the measurements that you guys did at Mount Snowden,

377
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
altitude clearly plays an important part in gravity.

378
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So with that in mind, we've got to go to the highest point in the UK,

379
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
which is Ben Nevis.

380
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
OK, but there's just one thing that we haven't shown you so far.

381
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
We actually brought along an extra experiment.

382
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Can we please show you this before you make the final decision?

383
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yes.

384
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Sonak actually has the other part of this experiment.

385
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
We always carry around...

386
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Some power tools, as physicists always do.

387
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So let's start off nice and gentle.

388
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
OK, and then try and pick up some pace.

389
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Spitter.

390
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And...

391
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You got some friends out there.

392
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Point proven.

393
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The point is that when something is spinning,

394
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
it kind of gets flung outwards.

395
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And you can actually use that to make a nice flat piece of pizza.

396
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But this also applies to the Earth.

397
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The Earth isn't perfectly round.

398
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's what's known as an oblate spheroid.

399
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It bulges at the equator where the spin is greatest.

400
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
We've kind of got two competing effects now.

401
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
We're trying to get away from the centre, the actual core of the Earth,

402
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
the point at the very centre of this ball.

403
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But now we can do it in two ways.

404
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
We can either kind of go up something tall

405
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
or we can just go down towards the equator.

406
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That's what we find when we're doing gravity surveys,

407
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
is that as you move south,

408
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
there tends to be an effect from latitude,

409
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
which is often usually larger than the effect from altitude.

410
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So the closer to the equator you go,

411
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
the further you get from the Earth's core

412
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and the lighter you get.

413
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So, guys, the sun's setting just behind me here.

414
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
This is north.

415
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
From the conversations we've just had,

416
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
it sounds like we've got to go that way down south.

417
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Is that right?

418
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Yep. OK. Let's go.

419
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
The team is starting to uncover the reasons

420
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
why gravity changes as you cross the surface of the Earth.

421
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Our planet is defined and shaped

422
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
by the complicated forces which act upon it.

423
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And detecting tiny fluctuations in its gravity field

424
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
can give us important clues.

425
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It can help us understand how our world is changing.

426
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The Space Geodosy Facility at Hearst-Monseau

427
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
is one small part in an enormous global network

428
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
which uses satellites to detect the tiniest of changes

429
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
in the Earth's gravity field.

430
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Tell me what exactly your job is here.

431
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What we're doing with this telescope

432
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
is measuring very accurately the distances of satellites from here.

433
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So we're using very short laser pulses

434
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
which we direct towards the satellite.

435
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
On the satellite there are reflecting cubes

436
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
which return some of that light to us.

437
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And we measure how long it takes the light

438
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
to go to the satellite and back.

439
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And how far away is the satellite typically?

440
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
The one we're tracking now is one of the Galileo satellites

441
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
which is about 20,000 kilometres.

442
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
20,000 kilometres away.

443
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yes.

444
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
OK, so we've got it aimed at the Galileo satellite

445
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
and you're going to turn the laser on now.

446
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Yes.

447
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Oh, wow.

448
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And that laser beam that's being fired up

449
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
towards the satellite,

450
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
the time it'll take to get there and come back again,

451
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
it's a fraction of a second, isn't it?

452
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It is. It's about 150,000th of a second,

453
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
150 milliseconds.

454
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And we're sending about 1,000 of those per second.

455
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
This strange-looking object is based on satellite readings.

456
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's a highly exaggerated representation

457
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
of how Earth's gravity field varies over time.

458
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Fluctuations like these

459
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
can give us important insights into climate change.

460
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Ice caps melting,

461
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
sea levels rising,

462
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
changes in groundwater.

463
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
All of these have an effect on the local strength of gravity.

464
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So something as important as climate change,

465
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
in order to understand it and do something about it,

466
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
we need to know the distribution of the gravitational field

467
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
of the Earth very accurately.

468
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Absolutely, yes. And it's a global measure that we need.

469
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
For the roadtrippers, it's the start of day two.

470
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And they're heading for the south coast.

471
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
They're stopping off in Herefordshire.

472
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It's a good location, as it's the same altitude

473
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
as the base of Snowden,

474
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
but they've moved about 80 miles further south.

475
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So if they find gravity changes here,

476
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
it must be due to latitude.

477
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's not a huge difference, but it's noticeable.

478
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Our counter-reading at the bottom of the mountain was 4,840.

479
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yeah.

480
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Our counter-reading here is 4,717.

481
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
All right, so we do get to see a difference.

482
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So we're actually at the same altitude as the base of Mount Snowden,

483
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
but because we've travelled further down south overnight,

484
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
gravity's less here. Yeah.

485
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
They push on.

486
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And by sunset, they reach Sidmouth on the south coast.

487
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Shaun takes the second gravity reading of the day.

488
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And Poppy improvises a map.

489
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Well, sort of a map.

490
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Can we write not to scale at the top there?

491
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So I drew this map.

492
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Scotland's a bit squashed.

493
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Wales is quite high up, and Cornwall is...

494
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Get the idea. Is there?

495
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But you get the idea.

496
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So, Shaun, we've been travelling with you.

497
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You've done quite a few gravity meter readings.

498
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Can you plot them on this not-to-scale badly drawn map, please?

499
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Sure.

500
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So if you remember, we started off in Mount Snowden about here,

501
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and that was the zero measurement for our survey.

502
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And then we've come all the way down here to the south coast.

503
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,000
The difference from the base of Snowden is minus 212 milligals.

504
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Wow.

505
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So the difference between going measuring gravity

506
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
at the base of the mountain and the top of the mountain

507
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
is about the same as here at this latitude

508
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and down here at this latitude.

509
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
They're quite clearly at sea level,

510
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
yet gravity here is roughly the same as it is at the top of Snowden.

511
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But where next?

512
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We are here.

513
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
If we want to find out where we are the lightest,

514
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
why don't we travel all the way to the most southernly point

515
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
in the UK, which is here?

516
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Well, altitude can also help us.

517
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So why not find a place in the country that is both low in latitude

518
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
but also is high in altitude in terms of height above sea level?

519
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Because that will get us somewhere that is really far away

520
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
from the core of the Earth while staying good in the country.

521
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So the answer to the puzzle lies in a combination of two factors.

522
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
How much further south should they go and how much higher?

523
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
At the end of day two,

524
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Sean's results show that the team weighs about 80 grams lighter

525
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
in total than back at the base of Snowden.

526
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
The way that weight changes is just one example

527
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
of Newton's famous equation in action.

528
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But Newton had left his masterpiece incomplete.

529
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
He didn't know the value of G, the gravitational constant,

530
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
which sets the size of the force.

531
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
To harness the full power of the equation, you need to know G

532
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
and the vital clue came with an incredible experiment

533
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
conducted in London at the end of the 18th century.

534
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It was an attempt to work out the mass of the Earth itself

535
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and it was carried out by an eccentric, extravagantly rich aristocrat,

536
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Henry Cavendish.

537
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Cavendish was a chronically shy, deeply solitary man

538
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
living in total isolation in his house in Clapham.

539
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
The story goes that one day

540
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
he accidentally bumped into a female servant on his staircase.

541
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
He was so traumatised by this event

542
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
that he had a new staircase built just for him

543
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
so this horrible incident could never happen again.

544
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Cavendish had inherited vast fortunes

545
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
and was able to dedicate his life to devising pioneering experiments,

546
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
including one particularly extraordinary piece of equipment.

547
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
He set up something a bit like this.

548
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's called a torsion balance.

549
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
It involves four lead spheres, two large heavy ones,

550
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
which are held fixed in place

551
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
and suspended by a very thin wire,

552
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
is a wooden rod, six feet long,

553
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
with two smaller balls on either end.

554
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Now, the crux of the experiment is the relationship

555
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
between the large ball and the small ball.

556
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Now, of course, there's a gravitational pull downwards

557
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
on both of the balls due to the Earth's gravity,

558
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
but Newton also tells us that there should be

559
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
a very weak gravitational pull between the balls

560
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and this is effectively what Cavendish was trying to measure.

561
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Any slight movement of the small ball towards the large one

562
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
should cause a twist in the torsion wire

563
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
and that's what Cavendish was trying to detect.

564
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Of course, this is all much easier said than done.

565
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
The experiment was incredibly sensitive.

566
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
The tiniest of vibrations, the slightest breeze,

567
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
changes in temperature could all influence the measurements,

568
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
so Cavendish had to isolate the apparatus inside a box

569
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
and the box within a shed.

570
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
He even realised that his mere presence

571
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
next to the apparatus could influence things,

572
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
so he had to remove himself outside the shed.

573
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
What he then did was sit outside the shed

574
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
and through a small hole in the shed wall

575
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
looked through a telescope to detect the tiniest of twists in the wire.

576
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It was an incredibly difficult process,

577
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
but after many months, he finally felt confident enough

578
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
that he had a reliable result.

579
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
MUSIC

580
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Cavendish found that the small balls did move.

581
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
A tiny four millimetres.

582
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
He calculated his results by comparing the density of the balls

583
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
with the density of water.

584
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
In the end, the result of Cavendish's experiment

585
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
and subsequent calculations was that the density of the earth

586
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
was about five and a half times that of water,

587
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
or put another way, the mass of the earth

588
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
was 5.9 trillion, trillion kilograms.

589
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
What's most remarkable is that Cavendish got this number right

590
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
to within an accuracy of 1%.

591
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
With Cavendish's astonishing result,

592
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
scientists were able to work out G.

593
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Then the equation could be used

594
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
to determine the mass of any celestial body

595
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
in orbit around another.

596
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So astronomers were able to calculate the mass of the sun

597
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and the planets and the moon

598
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and eventually even distant galaxies.

599
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And, of course, back on earth, we never escaped gravity.

600
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Over the course of the day, it actually squeezes your spine,

601
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
an effect you can see for yourself if you use a measuring rod.

602
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
OK, so it's half past seven in the morning.

603
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I've just gone up and I'm going to see how tall I am

604
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
before gravity drags me down.

605
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
MUSIC

606
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That's 178 centimetres, or just over 5'10".

607
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Over the course of the day,

608
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
gravity compresses the fluids in your spine.

609
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Right, it is just past 11 p.m.

610
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I've been standing up for most of the day,

611
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
so let's see if gravity has had an effect on my height.

612
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That is 176 centimetres,

613
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
so I really have shrunk by just over half an inch

614
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
over the course of today.

615
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
In the longer term, gravity can affect your posture permanently,

616
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
but there are exercises you can do to counteract this effect.

617
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Part of my research has been looking at the effects of gravity

618
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
on the human body, so people might not be aware

619
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
or they might not always think about the effect of gravity

620
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
on our physical state, on our health, and particularly on our posture.

621
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
However, because it's such a constant force,

622
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
gravity has a massive impact over the course of our lifetime.

623
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
As you get older, you can develop a stoop,

624
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
which is damaging to your mobility.

625
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Gothel here has actually got a very good posture,

626
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
but I'd like you to just show not so good posture.

627
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So when poor posture is really rounded shoulders

628
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
and then loss of the curve on the back as well,

629
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I can't ask you to raise up your arms when you're in that posture,

630
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
so...

631
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
No, and then just come back down, shoulders back in and then raise your arms.

632
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You can see the effect of posture on function.

633
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Ironically, the exercises which many gym goers do

634
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
actually make your posture worse.

635
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
That's if you only exercise the frontal muscles,

636
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
like the chest and abdominals.

637
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So it's recommended you exercise the back muscles just as much

638
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
to straighten you out and counteract the effects of gravity.

639
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
MUSIC

640
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Meanwhile, it's the end of day two for the road trip,

641
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and they've reached Sidmouth on the south coast,

642
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
looking for the place in Britain where they'll weigh the least.

643
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
They've worked out the answer lies in a combination of two factors,

644
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,000
the right mix of going south and being higher up.

645
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And for the final leg of the journey, I'm going to meet up with them.

646
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I asked them to drive a short distance west

647
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
to one of the most remote areas in mainland Britain,

648
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Dartmoor National Park.

649
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It's only 40 miles from the southernmost tip of Britain.

650
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Hello. Hi, Andrew. Nice to see you.

651
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And it's very high, very hilly territory.

652
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Jim, the team got to the south coast yesterday

653
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
where we defined gravity at its weakest,

654
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
but we haven't quite figured out whether it's altitude or latitude.

655
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Do we go further south or do we go higher up?

656
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You're right to ask, do we go as far south as possible

657
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
or as high as possible?

658
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
That's why I've brought you here to Dartmoor,

659
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and we've charted the most important points on this map here.

660
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
All right. Let's have a look.

661
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
We are here, two bridges.

662
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
These four dots represent these hills up there behind us,

663
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
which are at about 500 metres above sea level,

664
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
so that's what we want to check out.

665
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
These hills are close to the south coast,

666
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
and they're also the highest in the whole of the south of England.

667
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So logic suggests there must be the right combination

668
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
of latitude and altitude.

669
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Well, there's another reason why this makes perfect sense,

670
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
one which we haven't looked at yet,

671
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and that is the effect of the underlying rocks on gravity.

672
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And I've got a map here that shows...

673
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You're going to trump my map, aren't you?

674
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Here we are, down here.

675
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
These blue areas are the lowest areas

676
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
according to the density of the rocks underneath.

677
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
The rocks around here are made of granite,

678
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
which will make gravity weaker still.

679
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So that's helping as well as the altitude

680
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
and the fact that we're further south.

681
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yep, it's also playing a part.

682
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Well, we have a plausible theory,

683
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
but now we need to test it.

684
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
If I'm right, then at the top,

685
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
our gravity reading should be by far the lowest reading of the trip.

686
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Of course, there's another effect of gravity to deal with now.

687
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It's knackering when you head uphill.

688
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
OK, so I think this is pretty much the start of the hills

689
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
we've located on the map.

690
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So let's see if this is the lightest place.

691
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Sean, if you want to get the gravity meter out,

692
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and we'll take another reading here.

693
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
OK.

694
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Sean sets up his equipment one more time.

695
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
What's the news?

696
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Well, the bottom of Mount Snowden was our zero for this test.

697
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
We found we lost a certain amount by going up to the top of Mount Snowden.

698
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
We found we lost a certain amount coming south to the south coast.

699
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Not only have we beaten that, we've smashed it.

700
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Brilliant.

701
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
We were minus 219 milligals lower at the top of Mount Snowden.

702
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Here on Darkmoor, we're minus 347 milligals lower.

703
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Brilliant.

704
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So it is a combination of three things.

705
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
We're far south, so that's the latitude.

706
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
We're at altitude, we're at high up,

707
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
and we're surrounded by all this granite rock,

708
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
which is low density anyway.

709
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I hope you all think it was worth the climb up here anyway.

710
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
There you go.

711
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Boom science.

712
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Now, we already know that the altitude of these hills

713
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
takes us much further from the Earth's core

714
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
than anywhere else further south in Britain,

715
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
so gravity must be weakest here.

716
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
There's extra evidence too.

717
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
The British Geological Survey has compiled tens of thousands

718
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
of gravity readings made in the UK,

719
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
and the lowest readings ever recorded were all taken around here,

720
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
on the high hills of Darkmoor.

721
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
What do we do to celebrate?

722
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
We weigh ourselves, of course.

723
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
We affect the weight of that imagine.

724
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
It's all them Nutella pancakes from breakfast.

725
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
24-75.

726
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I need to leave, right?

727
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I can tell you that you should weigh something like 20 grams less

728
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
than you did at the base of Mount Snowden.

729
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Guys, I'm guessing something like 25 to 30 grams less.

730
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
So if you want to weigh as little as possible,

731
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
this is the place in Britain to come.

732
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
But in any case, it's such a tiny amount

733
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
that it's going to be wiped out entirely

734
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
by whatever it was you had for breakfast this morning.

735
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
In episode 2, I'll investigate how Albert Einstein's

736
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
theory of gravity completely changed our understanding

737
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
of space and time.

738
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'll travel to Louisiana in the USA

739
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
to listen to the sound of black holes colliding.

740
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
The biggest source of energy in the universe,

741
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
one of the biggest events you'd ever measure,

742
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
and we just barely saw it.

743
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And with the help of thousands of volunteers

744
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
and a smartphone app,

745
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'll explore how the science of gravity

746
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
can help you age slower.

747
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Thank you for watching.
