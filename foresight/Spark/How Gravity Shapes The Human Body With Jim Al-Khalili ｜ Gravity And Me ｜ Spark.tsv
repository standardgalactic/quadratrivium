0	3000	Would you like to lose a little bit of weight
3000	5000	without doing any exercise or dieting?
5000	9000	Would you like to age just a bit more slowly than your friends?
9000	13000	Well, you might be surprised to hear the laws of physics can help.
15000	20000	The key to unlocking these everyday questions is gravity.
21000	24000	It sculpts the universe.
24000	27000	It warps space and time.
28000	31000	It's a fundamental force of nature.
33000	37000	But gravity's strange powers, discovered by Albert Einstein,
37000	41000	also affect our daily lives in the most unexpected ways.
45000	49000	In this film, we'll be using cutting-edge scientific techniques
49000	53000	to investigate how gravity changes your weight.
53000	55000	It's got up.
55000	57000	Your height.
57000	59000	I really have shrunk.
59000	61000	And even your posture.
61000	64000	And with the help of thousands of volunteers,
64000	69000	I'll show you how gravity makes us all age at different rates.
72000	75000	Throughout the day, I've just been logging on to the phone, logging on to the app.
75000	78000	As a physicist, gravity is central to my work.
78000	80000	Oh, wow.
80000	86000	And in exploring it, I'll be challenged on how I understand this most mysterious force.
86000	89000	Wow. OK. I need to go and write this one down.
90000	94000	And I'll have to tackle the very nature of reality itself.
104000	106000	Gravity.
107000	111000	It binds together all the matter in the universe.
111000	114000	And it makes our existence here possible.
117000	122000	But in the end, it all boils down to one simple question.
122000	125000	What happens if I drop an object?
129000	133000	Gravity's many mysteries are all contained in this single action.
133000	136000	How an object falls.
137000	139000	Here's the first puzzle.
139000	143000	Why does a hammer fall faster than a feather?
143000	146000	You might think it's because the hammer is heavier.
146000	149000	But that's not the real reason.
149000	152000	The answer is air resistance.
152000	155000	It's not the weight of the objects that matters.
155000	157000	It's their shape.
157000	160000	And I can demonstrate this very easily with these two umbrellas.
161000	164000	They both have exactly the same weight.
164000	167000	But if I open one of them,
167000	171000	you can be pretty sure it'll drop more slowly than the other one.
173000	177000	In fact, all objects would fall at the same rate
177000	180000	if you could only remove the air.
182000	188000	The first person to realise this was the 16th-century mathematician Galileo Galilei.
189000	194000	Famously, it said he worked it out by dropping objects off the leaning tower of Pisa.
198000	201000	And he was spectacularly proven right.
201000	206000	In an experiment carried out on the moon in 1971.
206000	209000	Well, in my left hand, I have a feather.
209000	211000	In my right hand, a hammer.
211000	214000	And I'll drop the two of them here, and hopefully,
214000	216000	they'll hit the ground at the same time.
216000	218000	It worked perfectly.
228000	232000	Now Galileo was obsessed with a second question, too.
232000	236000	When you drop an object, it's actually quite hard to tell
236000	240000	if it falls at a constant speed or picks up speed as it drops.
242000	245000	Even in slow motion, it's pretty hard to tell.
250000	253000	But Galileo realised this.
253000	257000	First, drop an object a very short distance.
258000	261000	It lands with very little impact.
262000	265000	But of course, drop it from higher up.
268000	272000	This time, the ball easily breaks the tile,
272000	275000	which means it must have accelerated,
275000	279000	gaining in speed and momentum as it dropped.
280000	285000	Galileo had identified something fundamental to all falling objects.
285000	287000	They accelerate.
288000	291000	He realised there might be a way to measure
291000	294000	how much falling objects gain in speed.
294000	300000	What he devised was the first ever attempt to measure gravity itself.
300000	304000	He built a long wooden ramp, rather like this,
304000	307000	that he had sloping at a shallow angle.
307000	310000	The idea was to roll balls down the ramp
310000	312000	and measure their acceleration.
312000	315000	The crucial thing is that the ramp had to be at the shallow angle
315000	318000	to reduce the effects of wind resistance.
318000	321000	It also meant that the balls would roll down slowly enough
321000	324000	to give him time to measure their speed.
324000	326000	But the big problem was this.
326000	328000	How do you measure time accurately,
328000	331000	in an age when there are no accurate timepieces,
331000	333000	let alone stopwatches?
333000	335000	Well, Galileo came up with an ingenious idea
335000	337000	involving the flow of water,
337000	340000	essentially measuring time from the amount of water
340000	342000	collected in a cup.
343000	346000	So, we're going to try and repeat Galileo's experiment.
346000	349000	I say we, because I have a couple of willing volunteers,
349000	351000	Gavin and Joanna.
351000	354000	Three, two, one, go.
360000	361000	Stop.
361000	363000	OK, there's one.
363000	368000	Now, if you come down a quarter with a way down the ramp, go.
373000	374000	Stop.
374000	377000	OK, so now half of the way down, go.
380000	381000	Stop.
381000	383000	Oh, just in time.
385000	389000	OK, and then three-quarters of the way down, go.
391000	392000	Stop.
392000	395000	Right, turn the tap off.
395000	397000	OK, so we have our four measurements
397000	401000	and I can see a progression from fuller to emptier.
401000	404000	But what we need to do now is find the mathematical pattern
404000	408000	by weighing carefully the water in each glass.
408000	410000	Weighing the water should give us an idea
410000	413000	of how long each roll took.
413000	417000	And in our experiment, these were the results.
417000	420000	Now, there's one immediate thing you can tell.
420000	424000	The ball really sped up the longer it rolled.
427000	429000	In fact, our results seem to show
429000	432000	that the time it took to cover the first quarter of the ramp
432000	437000	was about the same time it took to cover the next three-quarters.
437000	438000	Right.
438000	443000	So we have a strong hint of a mathematical pattern.
443000	448000	Now we'll see if we're right by placing bells along the ramp
448000	451000	at intervals which are based on the results.
451000	452000	OK.
452000	455000	This arrangement looks a bit strange
455000	457000	because the gap between the first two bells
457000	461000	is much shorter than the gap between the third and fourth bells.
461000	464000	But that's OK because if we've got our calculations right,
464000	467000	the ball starts off slowly, so it covers a shorter distance
467000	469000	and as it picks up pace,
469000	472000	it'll cover longer and longer distances.
472000	477000	So we should hear the bells ringing at equal intervals in time.
477000	478000	Go.
485000	486000	Beautiful.
488000	490000	So what does this all mean?
490000	492000	What's the mathematical formula?
492000	494000	Well, this is something that Galileo worked out.
494000	496000	Let's say, from the start,
496000	500000	the ball covers a distance of one metre in the first second.
500000	503000	After two seconds, it'll have covered four metres.
503000	505000	After three seconds, nine metres.
505000	509000	After four seconds, 16 metres and so on.
509000	511000	If you recognise this progression,
511000	516000	you'll see that distance goes like the square of time.
518000	523000	Galileo had found the rate at which gravity speeds up objects.
523000	526000	And he'd found another fundamental principle.
526000	529000	You can measure the strength of gravity
529000	533000	by how much it causes falling objects to accelerate.
536000	540000	Detecting gravity has become exceptionally sophisticated these days,
540000	544000	but still uses exactly the same principle.
545000	548000	This is Hearst Monso Castle in Sussex,
548000	552000	and in its grounds lies the space geodyssey facility.
554000	557000	Here, Vicky uses an astonishingly sensitive instrument
557000	563000	to detect the exact strength of gravity on this one spot.
563000	567000	OK, so Vicky, tell me about this incredible gravity meter that you work with.
567000	571000	OK, so this is the dropping chamber in a stripped-down version.
571000	575000	So essentially, what happens is you've got a cart that gets raised to the top
575000	578000	and then the cart accelerates away from a mass in the middle,
578000	580000	and so this section here lifts off,
580000	583000	and as it drops, it drops under freefall.
583000	585000	So this component in the middle, as it drops,
585000	588000	is basically just Newton's apple falling to the ground.
588000	589000	Yes.
589000	592000	So this is a stripped-down version, but that's the real thing.
592000	593000	This is the real thing.
593000	594000	How does it actually work?
594000	596000	In here, it's a vacuum.
596000	599000	So there's no wind resistance as it falls, right?
599000	605000	Inside, a laser is used to measure exactly how fast the mass is accelerating.
605000	609000	This is the 21st-century version of Galileo's ramp
609000	610000	and the balls rolling down.
610000	611000	So can we get it going?
611000	612000	Of course.
612000	614000	If you'd just like to press the button on the laptop.
614000	615000	This one?
615000	616000	Yep.
617000	618000	OK.
618000	619000	So it's now communicating with it.
619000	620000	Oh, here we go.
620000	621000	There we go.
621000	624000	So it waits five seconds, then takes a measurement of gravity.
624000	625000	And again.
626000	631000	Oh, and you can see the results appearing now.
631000	632000	Yep.
632000	634000	Each of those green dots is measurement of gravity
634000	637000	with the actual number that it's getting for each one.
637000	640000	The unit Vicki uses has a familiar ring.
640000	644000	I see that the number up at the top here,
644000	647000	so you've got this unit, micro-gal.
647000	651000	Yes, gal is essentially one centimetre per second squared.
651000	653000	The gal was named after Galileo.
653000	657000	So we've just taken the measurement of gravity here today,
657000	659000	and it's this highly accurate number,
659000	668000	981124007 micro-gal.
668000	670000	The reading means that the Earth's gravity
670000	676000	speeds up a falling object by around 9.81 metres per second
676000	678000	for every second it drops.
680000	682000	Vicki tells me something intriguing.
682000	685000	She takes a reading here every week,
685000	687000	and she's found that the strength of gravity
687000	691000	changes by tiny amounts over time.
691000	693000	Heavy rainfall, for example,
693000	697000	can cause gravity to increase slightly.
697000	701000	Presumably if gravity is changing here in one spot,
701000	704000	it'll have different values all around the world,
704000	707000	and so you can have a gravity map of the entire planet.
707000	709000	That's right, yeah.
710000	714000	So what's the reason for these strange fluctuations?
714000	718000	That's what I want to investigate next.
718000	723000	So, gravity changes as we move across the surface of the Earth.
723000	726000	Well, this lies at the heart of a challenge
726000	728000	that I've set two young volunteers.
728000	732000	I've given them a task to try and find the place in Britain
732000	735000	where gravity is at its weakest,
735000	738000	so where objects would weigh the least,
738000	741000	and I've given them just three days to try and find it.
742000	746000	The volunteers are Estrella Sendra, a PhD student.
746000	749000	I've been living in London for five, six years,
749000	752000	and I'm originally from Seville in Spain.
752000	755000	I'm very interested in taking part in this project
755000	759000	because I would really like to know more about how this world works.
759000	763000	And Poppy Begum, a journalist who lives in London.
763000	766000	I did my degree in biomedical science,
767000	770000	and I did biology and chemistry for my A-levels,
770000	773000	but I haven't done any physics since I left school.
773000	776000	I'm fascinated to find out more about gravity,
776000	779000	and I actually enjoy a puzzle. I like a challenge.
779000	783000	Now, the team can't just weigh themselves to see changes in gravity.
783000	788000	Body weight fluctuates naturally by a couple of kilos over the course of a day,
788000	792000	whereas changes due to gravity, as they travel around the country,
792000	795000	are going to be tiny in comparison, a matter of a few grams.
795000	799000	So they're going to have to use sophisticated scientific methods
799000	802000	if they want to measure gravity accurately.
802000	807000	And that's why the volunteers will be joined by three specialists in gravity science.
809000	812000	PhD student Sonak Bose.
812000	816000	He'll be in charge of some very sensitive measuring apparatus
816000	819000	from the National Physical Laboratory.
819000	825000	Sean Hughes, a geologist, who'll be using a portable gravity meter.
825000	829000	And Andrew Ponson, a cosmologist at University College London,
829000	832000	who'll help interpret the results.
832000	836000	We've taken a collective weight for the team before they set off.
836000	839000	It's 380 kilograms.
839000	844000	So can they find the place in Britain where that'll decrease?
845000	850000	They're setting out in Snowdonia National Park in North Wales.
850000	855000	The railway climbs from here to the 1,000-metre summit of Snowden.
855000	858000	Sean takes his first gravity reading.
858000	861000	The inside is a mass on a beam,
861000	868000	and you turn this counter, this dial, until you get the beam central.
868000	871000	By counting the number of turns of the dial,
871000	874000	Sean can calculate the downward pull of gravity
874000	878000	acting on the mass inside the machine.
878000	880000	Sonak has a simpler method.
880000	884000	So inside the box is a 2 kilogram mass,
884000	890000	and it's supposed to be sort of as perfectly 2 kilograms as it's possible to get.
890000	894000	All right, and place it here.
894000	897000	Ooh, it's just coming under, isn't it?
897000	900000	1,998.2 grams.
900000	905000	So it was 2 kilos in the laboratory, but now here it's a bit less.
905000	907000	It's the first puzzle.
907000	912000	Why does a 2 kilo mass tip the scales at just under 2 kilos?
912000	920000	And it's one which gets straight to the heart of what the challenge is really about.
920000	924000	Mass is often confused with the related quantity weight.
924000	929000	The mass of these dumbbells is fixed, it doesn't change.
929000	932000	It's a measure of how much stuff they contain.
932000	934000	Weight is different.
934000	938000	It's a measure of the effect of gravity on these dumbbells,
938000	941000	the downward force pulling them to the ground
941000	945000	in the same way that it's keeping my feet firmly stuck to the ground.
945000	947000	The crucial difference is this.
947000	950000	If I was holding these dumbbells on the moon,
950000	952000	they'd still have exactly the same mass,
952000	955000	but they would weigh six times less
955000	961000	because the moon's gravity is so much weaker than the Earth's.
961000	965000	So that's why Sonax bringing along the 2 kilo mass.
965000	972000	If it changes weight, then this should mean that gravity itself has changed.
972000	977000	Ahead of them is the summit of the highest mountain in England and Wales,
977000	981000	famed for its stunning scenery.
981000	985000	Or it would be stunning if you could see it.
985000	989000	And this is what we came all the way up here for,
989000	992000	this amazing view at the top of Snowdon.
992000	997000	You wouldn't know it, but honestly, we are here.
997000	999000	So we're now near the summit of Snowdon
999000	1001000	and I've set up the gravimeter again
1001000	1007000	and we're going to see what the difference in the reading is.
1007000	1011000	He has to turn the dial again and again to try and get a reading.
1011000	1015000	Its clear gravity has changed, but which way?
1015000	1018000	Has it got stronger or weaker?
1018000	1021000	The team leaves Sean to work out his results
1021000	1026000	and tries to position the scales as close as possible to the summit.
1026000	1028000	But the reading is all over the place.
1028000	1031000	It's got up!
1031000	1034000	It's fluctuating quite a lot due to the wind.
1034000	1037000	I have to say, this is what science is always like, isn't it?
1037000	1040000	It's never quite what you want it to be.
1040000	1045000	So they head inside to the cafe next to the summit.
1045000	1047000	The wind was being a bit naughty, but hopefully...
1047000	1050000	I mean, now it's in 0-0, so should be alright.
1050000	1053000	1,998.2 down there.
1053000	1057000	1,997.8!
1057000	1058000	We've got it.
1058000	1061000	That's 0.4 of a gram off.
1061000	1064000	The mass weighs a tiny bit less.
1064000	1068000	It's lost about 1,500 of its weight.
1068000	1073000	And Sean's found that gravity itself has reduced.
1073000	1076000	At the top of the mountain, we took the measurement
1076000	1081000	and we discovered that the pull of gravity had gone down.
1081000	1084000	It had gone down in equivalent to 206 turns of the dial
1084000	1089000	and we worked out that that's equivalent to 219 milligals.
1092000	1094000	So it's clear from the team's measurements,
1094000	1099000	gravity weakens as you go higher and you get a bit lighter.
1101000	1104000	It's just an excuse to say where we like the lightest.
1104000	1105000	Who cares?
1105000	1108000	But in the sense that it's actually really interesting.
1108000	1113000	It's like an illustrative example of seeing how this is actually fluctuating,
1113000	1115000	depending on different factors.
1115000	1116000	Absolutely.
1116000	1119000	And that we could measure it and we could see it with our own eyes.
1119000	1122000	It actually makes you think about gravity in a very active way.
1122000	1125000	It's such a fundamental force phenomenon in nature,
1125000	1127000	but we don't know much about it.
1129000	1133000	But why does gravity change with altitude?
1133000	1136000	To understand that question, you have to get to grips
1136000	1141000	with the extraordinary discoveries of the next scientific giant in our story,
1141000	1144000	Isaac Newton.
1144000	1146000	Born in England in the middle of the 17th century,
1146000	1151000	he spent his life wrestling with so many apparently separate questions,
1151000	1156000	from why things fall to the ground to why planets orbit the sun.
1159000	1163000	It took the genius of Newton to realise that there was one single equation
1163000	1165000	that could answer all these questions.
1168000	1171000	And here it is, his famous law of gravity.
1171000	1175000	It might look complicated, but this is one of the most important equations
1175000	1177000	in the whole of science.
1177000	1179000	F here is the force.
1179000	1184000	Newton said there's an attractive force between any two objects in the universe.
1184000	1189000	On this side of the equation, G, we call the gravitational constant.
1189000	1193000	Newton knew it had to be there, but he didn't know what its value was.
1193000	1197000	M1 and M2 represent the two objects,
1197000	1200000	and R is the distance between them.
1200000	1204000	The equation tells us that the more massive the objects are,
1204000	1209000	the bigger M1 and M2, the greater the attractive force.
1209000	1213000	But the further apart they are, the bigger the value of R here,
1213000	1216000	the weaker the gravitational force.
1216000	1221000	With Newton, what was once mysterious now became clear.
1221000	1226000	Newton's equation describes why an object falls to the ground,
1226000	1228000	including his famous apple.
1228000	1233000	But it's true genius is that it applies to any object, anywhere in the universe.
1233000	1237000	So it's a very simple and elegant way of describing
1237000	1242000	some of the seemingly most complicated phenomena in the cosmos.
1246000	1250000	His law of gravitation can still be used today
1250000	1253000	to explain how orbits work,
1253000	1257000	to predict when a comet will return,
1257000	1262000	to describe why galaxies spin,
1262000	1266000	or to slingshot spacecraft around planets.
1266000	1271000	Newton tells us to look for the underlying simplicity and natural phenomena,
1271000	1276000	for instance, how the moon orbits the Earth.
1276000	1279000	If I let go of this apple, it'll fall straight down
1279000	1282000	because of the pull of Earth's gravity.
1282000	1286000	But if I throw it to begin with, it travels in a horizontal direction,
1286000	1288000	that's the direction of travel,
1288000	1291000	but Earth's gravity is still pulling it downwards,
1291000	1294000	without following a curved path.
1300000	1304000	Now, if I throw it harder, it'll travel further before it hits the ground.
1304000	1307000	And in principle, if I could throw it hard enough,
1307000	1309000	I could put it into orbit.
1309000	1313000	And that's exactly what's happening with the moon in orbit around the Earth.
1313000	1316000	It's a combination of wanting to travel in a straight line,
1316000	1319000	but also being pulled down by the Earth's gravity.
1319000	1322000	It turns up constantly falling around the Earth,
1322000	1324000	and constantly missing.
1326000	1330000	Newton's famous equation also explains the strange effect
1330000	1332000	which the road trip team has discovered,
1332000	1337000	that objects get lighter as you gain an altitude.
1337000	1341000	When I weigh myself, I'm represented by the first mass, M1.
1341000	1345000	The second mass, M2, is the Earth itself.
1345000	1349000	And the force pulling me down, my weight, depends on the distance
1349000	1352000	between me and the centre of the Earth.
1352000	1354000	And that's the secret of the road trip.
1354000	1357000	If you want to find a place where you weigh the least,
1357000	1361000	then you have to get as far away as you can from the Earth's core.
1369000	1372000	So it's the afternoon of day one,
1372000	1376000	and the road trip team have to work out where to go next.
1376000	1378000	Poppy and Australia have a good idea.
1378000	1382000	Find somewhere higher than Mount Snowden.
1382000	1386000	From the measurements that you guys did at Mount Snowden,
1386000	1389000	altitude clearly plays an important part in gravity.
1389000	1392000	So with that in mind, we've got to go to the highest point in the UK,
1392000	1393000	which is Ben Nevis.
1393000	1398000	OK, but there's just one thing that we haven't shown you so far.
1398000	1401000	We actually brought along an extra experiment.
1401000	1404000	Can we please show you this before you make the final decision?
1404000	1405000	Yes.
1405000	1408000	Sonak actually has the other part of this experiment.
1408000	1410000	We always carry around...
1410000	1412000	Some power tools, as physicists always do.
1412000	1414000	So let's start off nice and gentle.
1416000	1420000	OK, and then try and pick up some pace.
1420000	1422000	Spitter.
1422000	1424000	And...
1424000	1426000	You got some friends out there.
1426000	1427000	Point proven.
1427000	1429000	The point is that when something is spinning,
1429000	1431000	it kind of gets flung outwards.
1431000	1435000	And you can actually use that to make a nice flat piece of pizza.
1435000	1437000	But this also applies to the Earth.
1437000	1440000	The Earth isn't perfectly round.
1440000	1443000	It's what's known as an oblate spheroid.
1443000	1448000	It bulges at the equator where the spin is greatest.
1448000	1450000	We've kind of got two competing effects now.
1450000	1454000	We're trying to get away from the centre, the actual core of the Earth,
1454000	1457000	the point at the very centre of this ball.
1457000	1459000	But now we can do it in two ways.
1459000	1461000	We can either kind of go up something tall
1461000	1465000	or we can just go down towards the equator.
1465000	1467000	That's what we find when we're doing gravity surveys,
1467000	1469000	is that as you move south,
1469000	1472000	there tends to be an effect from latitude,
1472000	1477000	which is often usually larger than the effect from altitude.
1477000	1480000	So the closer to the equator you go,
1480000	1483000	the further you get from the Earth's core
1483000	1485000	and the lighter you get.
1486000	1490000	So, guys, the sun's setting just behind me here.
1490000	1492000	This is north.
1492000	1494000	From the conversations we've just had,
1494000	1496000	it sounds like we've got to go that way down south.
1496000	1497000	Is that right?
1497000	1499000	Yep. OK. Let's go.
1501000	1504000	The team is starting to uncover the reasons
1504000	1508000	why gravity changes as you cross the surface of the Earth.
1510000	1512000	Our planet is defined and shaped
1512000	1516000	by the complicated forces which act upon it.
1516000	1520000	And detecting tiny fluctuations in its gravity field
1520000	1523000	can give us important clues.
1523000	1528000	It can help us understand how our world is changing.
1528000	1531000	The Space Geodosy Facility at Hearst-Monseau
1531000	1535000	is one small part in an enormous global network
1535000	1538000	which uses satellites to detect the tiniest of changes
1538000	1541000	in the Earth's gravity field.
1541000	1544000	Tell me what exactly your job is here.
1544000	1546000	What we're doing with this telescope
1546000	1550000	is measuring very accurately the distances of satellites from here.
1550000	1552000	So we're using very short laser pulses
1552000	1554000	which we direct towards the satellite.
1554000	1557000	On the satellite there are reflecting cubes
1557000	1559000	which return some of that light to us.
1559000	1561000	And we measure how long it takes the light
1561000	1563000	to go to the satellite and back.
1563000	1565000	And how far away is the satellite typically?
1565000	1567000	The one we're tracking now is one of the Galileo satellites
1567000	1569000	which is about 20,000 kilometres.
1569000	1571000	20,000 kilometres away.
1571000	1572000	Yes.
1572000	1574000	OK, so we've got it aimed at the Galileo satellite
1574000	1576000	and you're going to turn the laser on now.
1576000	1578000	Yes.
1578000	1581000	Oh, wow.
1581000	1584000	And that laser beam that's being fired up
1584000	1586000	towards the satellite,
1586000	1588000	the time it'll take to get there and come back again,
1588000	1590000	it's a fraction of a second, isn't it?
1590000	1592000	It is. It's about 150,000th of a second,
1592000	1594000	150 milliseconds.
1594000	1597000	And we're sending about 1,000 of those per second.
1600000	1604000	This strange-looking object is based on satellite readings.
1604000	1607000	It's a highly exaggerated representation
1607000	1612000	of how Earth's gravity field varies over time.
1612000	1614000	Fluctuations like these
1614000	1618000	can give us important insights into climate change.
1618000	1620000	Ice caps melting,
1620000	1623000	sea levels rising,
1623000	1626000	changes in groundwater.
1626000	1630000	All of these have an effect on the local strength of gravity.
1630000	1633000	So something as important as climate change,
1633000	1636000	in order to understand it and do something about it,
1636000	1640000	we need to know the distribution of the gravitational field
1640000	1642000	of the Earth very accurately.
1642000	1645000	Absolutely, yes. And it's a global measure that we need.
1650000	1654000	For the roadtrippers, it's the start of day two.
1654000	1657000	And they're heading for the south coast.
1658000	1661000	They're stopping off in Herefordshire.
1661000	1664000	It's a good location, as it's the same altitude
1664000	1666000	as the base of Snowden,
1666000	1669000	but they've moved about 80 miles further south.
1669000	1672000	So if they find gravity changes here,
1672000	1674000	it must be due to latitude.
1674000	1676000	It's not a huge difference, but it's noticeable.
1676000	1680000	Our counter-reading at the bottom of the mountain was 4,840.
1680000	1681000	Yeah.
1681000	1684000	Our counter-reading here is 4,717.
1684000	1687000	All right, so we do get to see a difference.
1687000	1690000	So we're actually at the same altitude as the base of Mount Snowden,
1690000	1693000	but because we've travelled further down south overnight,
1693000	1695000	gravity's less here. Yeah.
1698000	1700000	They push on.
1705000	1709000	And by sunset, they reach Sidmouth on the south coast.
1711000	1715000	Shaun takes the second gravity reading of the day.
1715000	1718000	And Poppy improvises a map.
1718000	1720000	Well, sort of a map.
1720000	1723000	Can we write not to scale at the top there?
1726000	1728000	So I drew this map.
1728000	1730000	Scotland's a bit squashed.
1730000	1732000	Wales is quite high up, and Cornwall is...
1732000	1734000	Get the idea. Is there?
1734000	1735000	But you get the idea.
1735000	1738000	So, Shaun, we've been travelling with you.
1738000	1741000	You've done quite a few gravity meter readings.
1741000	1745000	Can you plot them on this not-to-scale badly drawn map, please?
1745000	1746000	Sure.
1746000	1750000	So if you remember, we started off in Mount Snowden about here,
1750000	1754000	and that was the zero measurement for our survey.
1754000	1757000	And then we've come all the way down here to the south coast.
1759000	1766000	The difference from the base of Snowden is minus 212 milligals.
1766000	1767000	Wow.
1767000	1770000	So the difference between going measuring gravity
1770000	1773000	at the base of the mountain and the top of the mountain
1773000	1777000	is about the same as here at this latitude
1777000	1779000	and down here at this latitude.
1779000	1782000	They're quite clearly at sea level,
1782000	1787000	yet gravity here is roughly the same as it is at the top of Snowden.
1787000	1789000	But where next?
1789000	1791000	We are here.
1791000	1794000	If we want to find out where we are the lightest,
1794000	1798000	why don't we travel all the way to the most southernly point
1798000	1801000	in the UK, which is here?
1801000	1803000	Well, altitude can also help us.
1803000	1809000	So why not find a place in the country that is both low in latitude
1809000	1814000	but also is high in altitude in terms of height above sea level?
1814000	1817000	Because that will get us somewhere that is really far away
1817000	1821000	from the core of the Earth while staying good in the country.
1825000	1832000	So the answer to the puzzle lies in a combination of two factors.
1832000	1836000	How much further south should they go and how much higher?
1838000	1840000	At the end of day two,
1840000	1844000	Sean's results show that the team weighs about 80 grams lighter
1844000	1847000	in total than back at the base of Snowden.
1855000	1861000	The way that weight changes is just one example
1861000	1864000	of Newton's famous equation in action.
1866000	1869000	But Newton had left his masterpiece incomplete.
1869000	1874000	He didn't know the value of G, the gravitational constant,
1874000	1877000	which sets the size of the force.
1878000	1883000	To harness the full power of the equation, you need to know G
1883000	1887000	and the vital clue came with an incredible experiment
1887000	1890000	conducted in London at the end of the 18th century.
1893000	1898000	It was an attempt to work out the mass of the Earth itself
1898000	1904000	and it was carried out by an eccentric, extravagantly rich aristocrat,
1904000	1906000	Henry Cavendish.
1907000	1911000	Cavendish was a chronically shy, deeply solitary man
1911000	1914000	living in total isolation in his house in Clapham.
1914000	1916000	The story goes that one day
1916000	1920000	he accidentally bumped into a female servant on his staircase.
1920000	1922000	He was so traumatised by this event
1922000	1925000	that he had a new staircase built just for him
1925000	1928000	so this horrible incident could never happen again.
1930000	1932000	Cavendish had inherited vast fortunes
1932000	1937000	and was able to dedicate his life to devising pioneering experiments,
1938000	1942000	including one particularly extraordinary piece of equipment.
1946000	1948000	He set up something a bit like this.
1948000	1950000	It's called a torsion balance.
1950000	1954000	It involves four lead spheres, two large heavy ones,
1954000	1956000	which are held fixed in place
1956000	1959000	and suspended by a very thin wire,
1959000	1962000	is a wooden rod, six feet long,
1962000	1965000	with two smaller balls on either end.
1965000	1968000	Now, the crux of the experiment is the relationship
1968000	1971000	between the large ball and the small ball.
1971000	1974000	Now, of course, there's a gravitational pull downwards
1974000	1977000	on both of the balls due to the Earth's gravity,
1977000	1979000	but Newton also tells us that there should be
1979000	1982000	a very weak gravitational pull between the balls
1982000	1986000	and this is effectively what Cavendish was trying to measure.
1986000	1990000	Any slight movement of the small ball towards the large one
1990000	1993000	should cause a twist in the torsion wire
1993000	1996000	and that's what Cavendish was trying to detect.
1996000	1999000	Of course, this is all much easier said than done.
1999000	2001000	The experiment was incredibly sensitive.
2001000	2005000	The tiniest of vibrations, the slightest breeze,
2005000	2008000	changes in temperature could all influence the measurements,
2008000	2012000	so Cavendish had to isolate the apparatus inside a box
2012000	2015000	and the box within a shed.
2015000	2017000	He even realised that his mere presence
2017000	2020000	next to the apparatus could influence things,
2020000	2024000	so he had to remove himself outside the shed.
2024000	2027000	What he then did was sit outside the shed
2027000	2029000	and through a small hole in the shed wall
2029000	2034000	looked through a telescope to detect the tiniest of twists in the wire.
2034000	2036000	It was an incredibly difficult process,
2036000	2039000	but after many months, he finally felt confident enough
2039000	2042000	that he had a reliable result.

2047000	2051000	Cavendish found that the small balls did move.
2051000	2055000	A tiny four millimetres.
2057000	2061000	He calculated his results by comparing the density of the balls
2061000	2064000	with the density of water.
2064000	2067000	In the end, the result of Cavendish's experiment
2067000	2071000	and subsequent calculations was that the density of the earth
2071000	2075000	was about five and a half times that of water,
2075000	2078000	or put another way, the mass of the earth
2078000	2082000	was 5.9 trillion, trillion kilograms.
2082000	2087000	What's most remarkable is that Cavendish got this number right
2087000	2091000	to within an accuracy of 1%.
2091000	2093000	With Cavendish's astonishing result,
2093000	2097000	scientists were able to work out G.
2097000	2099000	Then the equation could be used
2099000	2102000	to determine the mass of any celestial body
2102000	2106000	in orbit around another.
2106000	2110000	So astronomers were able to calculate the mass of the sun
2110000	2113000	and the planets and the moon
2113000	2117000	and eventually even distant galaxies.
2121000	2126000	And, of course, back on earth, we never escaped gravity.
2126000	2130000	Over the course of the day, it actually squeezes your spine,
2130000	2134000	an effect you can see for yourself if you use a measuring rod.
2134000	2137000	OK, so it's half past seven in the morning.
2137000	2140000	I've just gone up and I'm going to see how tall I am
2140000	2143000	before gravity drags me down.
2143000	2147000	MUSIC
2150000	2155000	That's 178 centimetres, or just over 5'10".
2158000	2160000	Over the course of the day,
2160000	2163000	gravity compresses the fluids in your spine.
2166000	2169000	Right, it is just past 11 p.m.
2169000	2171000	I've been standing up for most of the day,
2171000	2175000	so let's see if gravity has had an effect on my height.
2181000	2185000	That is 176 centimetres,
2185000	2189000	so I really have shrunk by just over half an inch
2189000	2191000	over the course of today.
2195000	2199000	In the longer term, gravity can affect your posture permanently,
2199000	2204000	but there are exercises you can do to counteract this effect.
2204000	2207000	Part of my research has been looking at the effects of gravity
2207000	2210000	on the human body, so people might not be aware
2210000	2213000	or they might not always think about the effect of gravity
2213000	2217000	on our physical state, on our health, and particularly on our posture.
2217000	2220000	However, because it's such a constant force,
2220000	2224000	gravity has a massive impact over the course of our lifetime.
2224000	2227000	As you get older, you can develop a stoop,
2227000	2230000	which is damaging to your mobility.
2230000	2232000	Gothel here has actually got a very good posture,
2232000	2236000	but I'd like you to just show not so good posture.
2236000	2240000	So when poor posture is really rounded shoulders
2240000	2244000	and then loss of the curve on the back as well,
2244000	2247000	I can't ask you to raise up your arms when you're in that posture,
2247000	2248000	so...
2248000	2253000	No, and then just come back down, shoulders back in and then raise your arms.
2253000	2256000	You can see the effect of posture on function.
2257000	2260000	Ironically, the exercises which many gym goers do
2260000	2263000	actually make your posture worse.
2263000	2266000	That's if you only exercise the frontal muscles,
2266000	2269000	like the chest and abdominals.
2269000	2273000	So it's recommended you exercise the back muscles just as much
2273000	2277000	to straighten you out and counteract the effects of gravity.
2277000	2282000	MUSIC
2286000	2289000	Meanwhile, it's the end of day two for the road trip,
2289000	2292000	and they've reached Sidmouth on the south coast,
2292000	2296000	looking for the place in Britain where they'll weigh the least.
2296000	2300000	They've worked out the answer lies in a combination of two factors,
2300000	2306000	the right mix of going south and being higher up.
2306000	2311000	And for the final leg of the journey, I'm going to meet up with them.
2311000	2314000	I asked them to drive a short distance west
2314000	2318000	to one of the most remote areas in mainland Britain,
2318000	2322000	Dartmoor National Park.
2322000	2326000	It's only 40 miles from the southernmost tip of Britain.
2326000	2329000	Hello. Hi, Andrew. Nice to see you.
2329000	2332000	And it's very high, very hilly territory.
2332000	2335000	Jim, the team got to the south coast yesterday
2335000	2338000	where we defined gravity at its weakest,
2338000	2342000	but we haven't quite figured out whether it's altitude or latitude.
2342000	2345000	Do we go further south or do we go higher up?
2345000	2348000	You're right to ask, do we go as far south as possible
2348000	2350000	or as high as possible?
2350000	2353000	That's why I've brought you here to Dartmoor,
2353000	2358000	and we've charted the most important points on this map here.
2358000	2360000	All right. Let's have a look.
2360000	2363000	We are here, two bridges.
2363000	2368000	These four dots represent these hills up there behind us,
2368000	2371000	which are at about 500 metres above sea level,
2371000	2373000	so that's what we want to check out.
2373000	2375000	These hills are close to the south coast,
2375000	2380000	and they're also the highest in the whole of the south of England.
2380000	2384000	So logic suggests there must be the right combination
2384000	2387000	of latitude and altitude.
2387000	2389000	Well, there's another reason why this makes perfect sense,
2389000	2391000	one which we haven't looked at yet,
2391000	2394000	and that is the effect of the underlying rocks on gravity.
2394000	2396000	And I've got a map here that shows...
2396000	2398000	You're going to trump my map, aren't you?
2398000	2400000	Here we are, down here.
2400000	2404000	These blue areas are the lowest areas
2404000	2408000	according to the density of the rocks underneath.
2408000	2411000	The rocks around here are made of granite,
2411000	2414000	which will make gravity weaker still.
2414000	2418000	So that's helping as well as the altitude
2418000	2420000	and the fact that we're further south.
2420000	2422000	Yep, it's also playing a part.
2424000	2426000	Well, we have a plausible theory,
2426000	2428000	but now we need to test it.
2430000	2432000	If I'm right, then at the top,
2432000	2437000	our gravity reading should be by far the lowest reading of the trip.
2439000	2442000	Of course, there's another effect of gravity to deal with now.
2442000	2446000	It's knackering when you head uphill.
2446000	2449000	OK, so I think this is pretty much the start of the hills
2449000	2451000	we've located on the map.
2451000	2454000	So let's see if this is the lightest place.
2454000	2456000	Sean, if you want to get the gravity meter out,
2456000	2458000	and we'll take another reading here.
2458000	2459000	OK.
2461000	2465000	Sean sets up his equipment one more time.
2465000	2467000	What's the news?
2467000	2472000	Well, the bottom of Mount Snowden was our zero for this test.
2472000	2475000	We found we lost a certain amount by going up to the top of Mount Snowden.
2475000	2479000	We found we lost a certain amount coming south to the south coast.
2479000	2482000	Not only have we beaten that, we've smashed it.
2482000	2483000	Brilliant.
2483000	2489000	We were minus 219 milligals lower at the top of Mount Snowden.
2489000	2493000	Here on Darkmoor, we're minus 347 milligals lower.
2493000	2494000	Brilliant.
2494000	2496000	So it is a combination of three things.
2496000	2498000	We're far south, so that's the latitude.
2498000	2500000	We're at altitude, we're at high up,
2500000	2502000	and we're surrounded by all this granite rock,
2502000	2504000	which is low density anyway.
2504000	2507000	I hope you all think it was worth the climb up here anyway.
2507000	2508000	There you go.
2508000	2510000	Boom science.
2514000	2517000	Now, we already know that the altitude of these hills
2517000	2520000	takes us much further from the Earth's core
2520000	2523000	than anywhere else further south in Britain,
2523000	2526000	so gravity must be weakest here.
2526000	2528000	There's extra evidence too.
2528000	2532000	The British Geological Survey has compiled tens of thousands
2532000	2535000	of gravity readings made in the UK,
2535000	2539000	and the lowest readings ever recorded were all taken around here,
2539000	2541000	on the high hills of Darkmoor.
2543000	2545000	What do we do to celebrate?
2545000	2547000	We weigh ourselves, of course.
2547000	2549000	We affect the weight of that imagine.
2551000	2554000	It's all them Nutella pancakes from breakfast.
2554000	2556000	24-75.
2556000	2558000	I need to leave, right?
2558000	2563000	I can tell you that you should weigh something like 20 grams less
2563000	2566000	than you did at the base of Mount Snowden.
2566000	2570000	Guys, I'm guessing something like 25 to 30 grams less.
2570000	2573000	So if you want to weigh as little as possible,
2573000	2575000	this is the place in Britain to come.
2575000	2577000	But in any case, it's such a tiny amount
2577000	2579000	that it's going to be wiped out entirely
2579000	2582000	by whatever it was you had for breakfast this morning.
2589000	2592000	In episode 2, I'll investigate how Albert Einstein's
2592000	2596000	theory of gravity completely changed our understanding
2596000	2598000	of space and time.
2610000	2612000	I'll travel to Louisiana in the USA
2612000	2615000	to listen to the sound of black holes colliding.
2618000	2620000	The biggest source of energy in the universe,
2620000	2622000	one of the biggest events you'd ever measure,
2622000	2624000	and we just barely saw it.
2624000	2627000	And with the help of thousands of volunteers
2627000	2629000	and a smartphone app,
2629000	2631000	I'll explore how the science of gravity
2631000	2633000	can help you age slower.
2648000	2650000	Thank you for watching.
