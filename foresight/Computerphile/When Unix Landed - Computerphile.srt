1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
We're talking late 70s over to early 80s. A crucial period actually for computers in many

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,000
regards, yes. There was definitely a British's best Britain first purchasing policy, either

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,880
for government institutions like radar establishments, like the police, all this kind of stuff,

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,720
and particularly for educational establishments. The feeling was computers are expensive,

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,520
so if we can spend a lot of money it might as well be fell back into the British economy

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,280
by buying British. Certainly applied to universities, one or two were allowed to escape. I think the

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,080
University of Newcastle on the computer science front was allowed to have an IBM, so of course

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,840
was the University of Cambridge. Can't remember what happened at Oxford.

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:56,240
It was a way for me to find out by the back door about the advantages in a way of sharing a

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:03,120
hardware platform with not just other universities but other government institutions. And in one

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,440
of the previous videos I've talked about how we only felt able to use ALGOL 68 as a teaching

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,240
language because that well-known government institution blessed them, the Royal Radar

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,640
establishment, that actually put a huge amount of effort into setting up a very good ALGOL 68

14
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,280
compiler. And of course it had to be on ICO machinery, they were a government establishment,

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,400
so were we, so we benefited from that a lot. How did you get into UNIX? You went over to the

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,760
States didn't you? Can you tell me about that? Yes, I was true. I went over to the States in 1978

17
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,920
for the whole calendar year and visited in short order and it was all highly educational, a visit

18
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,920
to Oklahoma State University where they'd written an ALGOL 68 compiler, so given my interest in

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,640
those days that was a no-brainer. But I then thought no, no, if I'm going to be away for a year

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,920
I want the California experience and so I finagled my way into doing some teaching at UCLA of course

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,240
in Los Angeles. But also in the Cal State system, Cal State Northridge is a well-known California

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,960
state thing and I did, I lectured all sorts of computer things, I taught FORTRAN in Oklahoma

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,080
and so on. It was weird actually that in some ways at Nottingham we were a little bit ahead

24
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,040
of the curve there because before I left we'd taken our first tentative steps into getting this

25
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:36,080
thing called UNIX which enabled you on a underpowered PDP 11 to sort of run your own programming

26
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,920
experience, multi-user but only on dumb terminals, multi-user multi-tasking operating system,

27
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,840
hopelessly underpowered machinery but it sort of worked and this was, must have been about 76

28
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,720
when we bought, first of all a PDP 1105 just to get used to having our own computer of some sort

29
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,560
could do a similar programming but I think just more or less as I got in the plane from America

30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:11,520
my colleagues told me that no we're going to get that upgraded to a PDP 1135 as quickly as possible

31
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:22,160
and that when we do we will be ready to receive this operating system called UNIX done by Bell Labs

32
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:30,000
and people said to me Dave you'll find just like why did a radar establishment have to support your

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,800
compiler you'll now be saying why does a telephone company have to be the people that provides me

34
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,480
with a little operating system that I feel happy with and it was, it was as Yogi Berrow once said

35
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,880
like deja vu all over again, okay I'm going to say wow you know you're ahead of us we want to go to

36
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:59,840
UNIX we can't get approval all this kind of stuff so when I came back 1979 very cold winter

37
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,640
all that it really was a liberation to know that while we might have to rely on the computing

38
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,520
centre for a lot of bulk teaching and running programs nevertheless we could start to do

39
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:17,120
our own thing on PDP 11's with an eye to the future but even so we couldn't on a PDP 1135

40
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:27,520
give a bulk service to our COMPSI undergrads we continued running ALGOL 68 on ICL machinery

41
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,240
with a huge extended overlap with us getting UNIX because we couldn't become self-hosting on UNIX

42
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,680
or have enough big powerful machines until well after this era we were made very aware

43
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,520
that we were getting this for a few hundred dollars because it came from Bell Labs Bell Labs was a so

44
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,120
called regulated monopoly and that meant they were caught in the crossfire from everywhere

45
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,600
they must not be seen to be using their massive leverage and obscene telephone bills

46
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,320
to squash little startup telcos they must not get in the way of IBM

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,760
because there was a suspicion that you know when people said to Bell I was well what are you doing

48
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,040
for the public good they thought it was a nice cool idea to say look we've got basically a

49
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,920
computer science research department we're not a computer company but these researchers

50
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,920
it really was a bit like Malvern's radar defense establishment we are not a computing company

51
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,080
absolutely not but we have developed some software that universities might find interesting

52
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,560
so we're proposing for the public good to virtually give away this software if anybody's

53
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:47,680
interested and it's a start and IBM won't see it as a threat so we're all right you can get hold

54
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,080
of this so long as you are a bona fide degree giving institution you can get hold of this UNIX

55
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,960
you must have of course a pdp11 got to keep America's balance of payments in the black and it must be

56
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,800
at least a pdp1135 not the most minimal you could get if you do that this UNIX will get you started

57
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,480
in the great world of multi-user on simple terminals you can do your own thing you'll

58
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:21,040
run out of steam after about four or five users but nevertheless it's all yours so we

59
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,560
cheerfully signed up for this and this as I say it was back in 1979 it's all about to happen

60
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,160
version seven of UNIX I think we did somehow get hold of the previous one version six

61
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,000
but serious usage started with version seven to find out more about this version seven that we

62
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,520
were getting how did you find out let me be boring and oldy and say yet again there was no internet

63
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:55,840
there were no web pages to tell you about this there was not even email you had to send out posters

64
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,200
to departments you had to use letters you could send faxes right and you had to say

65
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:11,120
we are the UK UNIX user group principally populated by representatives from computer science

66
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:19,120
departments in UK universities we are almost all of us absolutely long to have UNIX we have

67
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:27,120
persuaded the American master UNIX user group and AT&T the ultimate owners of Bell Labs who ran

68
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,320
all the patents and licensing they're going to come over and tell us how to get licensed

69
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:40,400
for an academic use only licensed for UNIX and what's it all about and it was a superb chat shop

70
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,680
and ideas swap shop as it were enjoyed it hugely the star of the show was a visitor from AT&T

71
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:59,040
Paterson licensing Frank J. Riffle Jr. I remember his name and oh boy did he have the job from hell

72
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,280
trying to keep everybody happy and he said I want to license you all you're wonderful you know

73
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,240
we love universities and I'm in charge of Paterson licensing but I got to warn you you must not do

74
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,960
any commercial usage with this it is purely for degree giving teaching only right and he kept on

75
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,920
muttering to himself there were a lot of gray areas and it's my job to stamp them out and what a

76
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,920
heck of a job it was he said just remember you must be a bona fide degree giving university

77
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:35,760
institution then you will be licensed no others a hand goes up from the audience a guy I got to

78
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,080
know quite well later on but he really was the odd man out hand goes up and said well how about me

79
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,720
you've licensed me for version six but I'm not at the university where are you from sir and he said

80
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,400
Marcus Gray this guy's name was he said I'm just a college I'm pre-university you know from

81
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:03,920
basically we concentrate from 11 to 18 I'm Marlborough College I'm a public school now I

82
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,480
think even the Americans know that there's nothing more badly named than an English public school

83
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,920
it is not available to the poor and the needy as it probably should be or was originally no

84
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,200
some public schools are so expensive you need serious money to attend them principally Eaton

85
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,200
is the most famous but Marlborough College isn't far behind I mean the tuition fees at Marlborough

86
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,320
College will make your eyes water so this guy said no no I'm not I'm pre-university I'm Marlborough

87
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,480
College but sir over here you know most colleges are like universities and Marcus said no it's not

88
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,840
the case with me and riffle was getting more and more ruffled that's a joke and said sir let me

89
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,560
try and summarize are you trying to tell me that you are more or less a very expensive version of

90
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,160
what I would call a high school and Margaret said that's what I'm about to say yeah that's roughly

91
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,800
right he just looked at Margaret and said sir you should not have been licensed and he didn't say

92
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,880
but in parentheses I could hear it going on in the background oh boy somebody's going to be in deep

93
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,040
trouble when I get back to Murray Hill New Jersey he said sir you should not have been licensed but

94
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,520
Frank J riffle is a man of his word I will not take your license away sir truly it did change

95
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,080
everything and I do remember very well we had a lot of conversations at the UK units group saying

96
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,320
those guys at Bellab's are just so good the two of them obviously Dennis and Ken we've

97
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,440
talked about them many a time they've invented the C language for system implementation they've

98
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,520
developed unix and it does things sensibly and this is absolutely great aren't we lucky I thought

99
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:56,720
as a community to have them being on our side and I did think I wonder if they'll ever get any

100
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,320
recognition from the ACM shall we say about what they've done and I was very pleased it took till

101
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:10,160
1983 I think but eventually so many academics in the US and all over the world were using unix that

102
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:17,680
Dennis and Ken were given the ACM Turing Award it was actually awarded to them in 84 it was

103
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:28,800
won and achieved in 83 so in 1984 they had to give a talk about what their work meant

104
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,680
and normally when you write a paper to go with your presentation you thank everybody which you did

105
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,600
but then you go on to say here's how unix came about here's the nuts and bolts of what it's

106
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,600
like to really run it we didn't get that at all we've got thank yous from Ken in cryptic terms

107
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,160
but very heartfelt to a lot of people so he said I now just want to point out something to you

108
00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:00,240
effectively you've got something here where we you see as a system programming language

109
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,000
so the operating system is written in a high-level language have you any idea the problems that is

110
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,400
going to open up to the potential flaws security holds let me just demonstrate one of these to you

111
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:19,200
you'll be amazed and amused and I mean you know what standards we have on computer file we don't

112
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:27,520
swear so I'll allow myself to say that one of the rather celebrated people that we're going to

113
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:35,440
point you at in the next video just described Ken's contribution as a total effing bombshell

114
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,480
and he wasn't wrong a lot of people couldn't understand why it was a bombshell but it really

115
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:48,080
really is and I'd like to do my best to explain to you just how what a fundamental earthquake

116
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:54,880
this caused once people understood what he was trying to say a few seconds or half a second of

117
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,920
time then give him a half and then give her a little bit and just go round and round the people who

118
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,800
wanted to do some kind of computing and because computers were even the signal is moving in so

119
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,600
the speed of those pulses tell us the rate we know which direction it is because we know which

120
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
roll is coming from and we can look at those
