00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
We're talking late 70s over to early 80s. A crucial period actually for computers in many

00:05.440 --> 00:12.000
regards, yes. There was definitely a British's best Britain first purchasing policy, either

00:12.000 --> 00:18.880
for government institutions like radar establishments, like the police, all this kind of stuff,

00:18.880 --> 00:24.720
and particularly for educational establishments. The feeling was computers are expensive,

00:25.520 --> 00:31.520
so if we can spend a lot of money it might as well be fell back into the British economy

00:31.520 --> 00:37.280
by buying British. Certainly applied to universities, one or two were allowed to escape. I think the

00:37.280 --> 00:42.080
University of Newcastle on the computer science front was allowed to have an IBM, so of course

00:42.080 --> 00:45.840
was the University of Cambridge. Can't remember what happened at Oxford.

00:46.160 --> 00:56.240
It was a way for me to find out by the back door about the advantages in a way of sharing a

00:56.240 --> 01:03.120
hardware platform with not just other universities but other government institutions. And in one

01:03.120 --> 01:09.440
of the previous videos I've talked about how we only felt able to use ALGOL 68 as a teaching

01:09.440 --> 01:14.240
language because that well-known government institution blessed them, the Royal Radar

01:14.320 --> 01:20.640
establishment, that actually put a huge amount of effort into setting up a very good ALGOL 68

01:20.640 --> 01:25.280
compiler. And of course it had to be on ICO machinery, they were a government establishment,

01:25.280 --> 01:30.400
so were we, so we benefited from that a lot. How did you get into UNIX? You went over to the

01:30.400 --> 01:37.760
States didn't you? Can you tell me about that? Yes, I was true. I went over to the States in 1978

01:37.760 --> 01:43.920
for the whole calendar year and visited in short order and it was all highly educational, a visit

01:43.920 --> 01:49.920
to Oklahoma State University where they'd written an ALGOL 68 compiler, so given my interest in

01:49.920 --> 01:54.640
those days that was a no-brainer. But I then thought no, no, if I'm going to be away for a year

01:54.640 --> 02:01.920
I want the California experience and so I finagled my way into doing some teaching at UCLA of course

02:01.920 --> 02:08.240
in Los Angeles. But also in the Cal State system, Cal State Northridge is a well-known California

02:08.240 --> 02:14.960
state thing and I did, I lectured all sorts of computer things, I taught FORTRAN in Oklahoma

02:14.960 --> 02:20.080
and so on. It was weird actually that in some ways at Nottingham we were a little bit ahead

02:20.080 --> 02:27.040
of the curve there because before I left we'd taken our first tentative steps into getting this

02:27.040 --> 02:36.080
thing called UNIX which enabled you on a underpowered PDP 11 to sort of run your own programming

02:36.080 --> 02:43.920
experience, multi-user but only on dumb terminals, multi-user multi-tasking operating system,

02:43.920 --> 02:49.840
hopelessly underpowered machinery but it sort of worked and this was, must have been about 76

02:49.840 --> 02:56.720
when we bought, first of all a PDP 1105 just to get used to having our own computer of some sort

02:56.720 --> 03:02.560
could do a similar programming but I think just more or less as I got in the plane from America

03:02.560 --> 03:11.520
my colleagues told me that no we're going to get that upgraded to a PDP 1135 as quickly as possible

03:11.520 --> 03:22.160
and that when we do we will be ready to receive this operating system called UNIX done by Bell Labs

03:22.160 --> 03:30.000
and people said to me Dave you'll find just like why did a radar establishment have to support your

03:30.000 --> 03:36.800
compiler you'll now be saying why does a telephone company have to be the people that provides me

03:36.800 --> 03:44.480
with a little operating system that I feel happy with and it was, it was as Yogi Berrow once said

03:44.480 --> 03:50.880
like deja vu all over again, okay I'm going to say wow you know you're ahead of us we want to go to

03:50.880 --> 03:59.840
UNIX we can't get approval all this kind of stuff so when I came back 1979 very cold winter

03:59.840 --> 04:04.640
all that it really was a liberation to know that while we might have to rely on the computing

04:04.640 --> 04:09.520
centre for a lot of bulk teaching and running programs nevertheless we could start to do

04:09.520 --> 04:17.120
our own thing on PDP 11's with an eye to the future but even so we couldn't on a PDP 1135

04:17.120 --> 04:27.520
give a bulk service to our COMPSI undergrads we continued running ALGOL 68 on ICL machinery

04:27.520 --> 04:34.240
with a huge extended overlap with us getting UNIX because we couldn't become self-hosting on UNIX

04:34.240 --> 04:41.680
or have enough big powerful machines until well after this era we were made very aware

04:41.680 --> 04:47.520
that we were getting this for a few hundred dollars because it came from Bell Labs Bell Labs was a so

04:47.520 --> 04:53.120
called regulated monopoly and that meant they were caught in the crossfire from everywhere

04:53.760 --> 04:59.600
they must not be seen to be using their massive leverage and obscene telephone bills

05:00.480 --> 05:06.320
to squash little startup telcos they must not get in the way of IBM

05:08.000 --> 05:13.760
because there was a suspicion that you know when people said to Bell I was well what are you doing

05:13.760 --> 05:19.040
for the public good they thought it was a nice cool idea to say look we've got basically a

05:19.040 --> 05:23.920
computer science research department we're not a computer company but these researchers

05:23.920 --> 05:29.920
it really was a bit like Malvern's radar defense establishment we are not a computing company

05:29.920 --> 05:34.080
absolutely not but we have developed some software that universities might find interesting

05:34.080 --> 05:38.560
so we're proposing for the public good to virtually give away this software if anybody's

05:38.560 --> 05:47.680
interested and it's a start and IBM won't see it as a threat so we're all right you can get hold

05:47.680 --> 05:54.080
of this so long as you are a bona fide degree giving institution you can get hold of this UNIX

05:54.080 --> 06:00.960
you must have of course a pdp11 got to keep America's balance of payments in the black and it must be

06:00.960 --> 06:08.800
at least a pdp1135 not the most minimal you could get if you do that this UNIX will get you started

06:08.800 --> 06:14.480
in the great world of multi-user on simple terminals you can do your own thing you'll

06:14.480 --> 06:21.040
run out of steam after about four or five users but nevertheless it's all yours so we

06:21.040 --> 06:26.560
cheerfully signed up for this and this as I say it was back in 1979 it's all about to happen

06:26.560 --> 06:32.160
version seven of UNIX I think we did somehow get hold of the previous one version six

06:33.120 --> 06:40.000
but serious usage started with version seven to find out more about this version seven that we

06:40.000 --> 06:47.520
were getting how did you find out let me be boring and oldy and say yet again there was no internet

06:47.520 --> 06:55.840
there were no web pages to tell you about this there was not even email you had to send out posters

06:56.880 --> 07:03.200
to departments you had to use letters you could send faxes right and you had to say

07:03.920 --> 07:11.120
we are the UK UNIX user group principally populated by representatives from computer science

07:11.120 --> 07:19.120
departments in UK universities we are almost all of us absolutely long to have UNIX we have

07:19.120 --> 07:27.120
persuaded the American master UNIX user group and AT&T the ultimate owners of Bell Labs who ran

07:27.120 --> 07:32.320
all the patents and licensing they're going to come over and tell us how to get licensed

07:32.400 --> 07:40.400
for an academic use only licensed for UNIX and what's it all about and it was a superb chat shop

07:40.400 --> 07:47.680
and ideas swap shop as it were enjoyed it hugely the star of the show was a visitor from AT&T

07:47.680 --> 07:59.040
Paterson licensing Frank J. Riffle Jr. I remember his name and oh boy did he have the job from hell

07:59.040 --> 08:03.280
trying to keep everybody happy and he said I want to license you all you're wonderful you know

08:04.080 --> 08:10.240
we love universities and I'm in charge of Paterson licensing but I got to warn you you must not do

08:10.240 --> 08:16.960
any commercial usage with this it is purely for degree giving teaching only right and he kept on

08:16.960 --> 08:21.920
muttering to himself there were a lot of gray areas and it's my job to stamp them out and what a

08:21.920 --> 08:27.920
heck of a job it was he said just remember you must be a bona fide degree giving university

08:27.920 --> 08:35.760
institution then you will be licensed no others a hand goes up from the audience a guy I got to

08:35.760 --> 08:42.080
know quite well later on but he really was the odd man out hand goes up and said well how about me

08:42.080 --> 08:48.720
you've licensed me for version six but I'm not at the university where are you from sir and he said

08:49.440 --> 08:56.400
Marcus Gray this guy's name was he said I'm just a college I'm pre-university you know from

08:56.960 --> 09:03.920
basically we concentrate from 11 to 18 I'm Marlborough College I'm a public school now I

09:03.920 --> 09:10.480
think even the Americans know that there's nothing more badly named than an English public school

09:10.480 --> 09:17.920
it is not available to the poor and the needy as it probably should be or was originally no

09:17.920 --> 09:23.200
some public schools are so expensive you need serious money to attend them principally Eaton

09:23.200 --> 09:29.200
is the most famous but Marlborough College isn't far behind I mean the tuition fees at Marlborough

09:29.200 --> 09:34.320
College will make your eyes water so this guy said no no I'm not I'm pre-university I'm Marlborough

09:34.320 --> 09:40.480
College but sir over here you know most colleges are like universities and Marcus said no it's not

09:40.480 --> 09:47.840
the case with me and riffle was getting more and more ruffled that's a joke and said sir let me

09:47.920 --> 09:54.560
try and summarize are you trying to tell me that you are more or less a very expensive version of

09:54.560 --> 10:00.160
what I would call a high school and Margaret said that's what I'm about to say yeah that's roughly

10:00.160 --> 10:06.800
right he just looked at Margaret and said sir you should not have been licensed and he didn't say

10:06.800 --> 10:12.880
but in parentheses I could hear it going on in the background oh boy somebody's going to be in deep

10:12.880 --> 10:19.040
trouble when I get back to Murray Hill New Jersey he said sir you should not have been licensed but

10:19.040 --> 10:25.520
Frank J riffle is a man of his word I will not take your license away sir truly it did change

10:25.520 --> 10:32.080
everything and I do remember very well we had a lot of conversations at the UK units group saying

10:32.640 --> 10:38.320
those guys at Bellab's are just so good the two of them obviously Dennis and Ken we've

10:38.320 --> 10:43.440
talked about them many a time they've invented the C language for system implementation they've

10:43.440 --> 10:49.520
developed unix and it does things sensibly and this is absolutely great aren't we lucky I thought

10:49.520 --> 10:56.720
as a community to have them being on our side and I did think I wonder if they'll ever get any

10:56.720 --> 11:02.320
recognition from the ACM shall we say about what they've done and I was very pleased it took till

11:02.320 --> 11:10.160
1983 I think but eventually so many academics in the US and all over the world were using unix that

11:10.160 --> 11:17.680
Dennis and Ken were given the ACM Turing Award it was actually awarded to them in 84 it was

11:18.880 --> 11:28.800
won and achieved in 83 so in 1984 they had to give a talk about what their work meant

11:29.360 --> 11:35.680
and normally when you write a paper to go with your presentation you thank everybody which you did

11:35.680 --> 11:39.600
but then you go on to say here's how unix came about here's the nuts and bolts of what it's

11:39.600 --> 11:45.600
like to really run it we didn't get that at all we've got thank yous from Ken in cryptic terms

11:45.600 --> 11:52.160
but very heartfelt to a lot of people so he said I now just want to point out something to you

11:52.160 --> 12:00.240
effectively you've got something here where we you see as a system programming language

12:00.240 --> 12:06.000
so the operating system is written in a high-level language have you any idea the problems that is

12:06.000 --> 12:12.400
going to open up to the potential flaws security holds let me just demonstrate one of these to you

12:12.400 --> 12:19.200
you'll be amazed and amused and I mean you know what standards we have on computer file we don't

12:19.280 --> 12:27.520
swear so I'll allow myself to say that one of the rather celebrated people that we're going to

12:27.520 --> 12:35.440
point you at in the next video just described Ken's contribution as a total effing bombshell

12:35.440 --> 12:40.480
and he wasn't wrong a lot of people couldn't understand why it was a bombshell but it really

12:40.480 --> 12:48.080
really is and I'd like to do my best to explain to you just how what a fundamental earthquake

12:48.080 --> 12:54.880
this caused once people understood what he was trying to say a few seconds or half a second of

12:54.880 --> 12:59.920
time then give him a half and then give her a little bit and just go round and round the people who

12:59.920 --> 13:04.800
wanted to do some kind of computing and because computers were even the signal is moving in so

13:04.800 --> 13:09.600
the speed of those pulses tell us the rate we know which direction it is because we know which

13:09.600 --> 13:11.600
roll is coming from and we can look at those
