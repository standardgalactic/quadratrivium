0	8720	So before getting into detail into the various quantum technologies past and present and
8720	13280	future, I think it's important for all of us to be able to be on the same footing regarding
13280	19080	what quantum effects are behind them and really kind of have a thorough sort of list of all
19080	22120	these quantum effects that really I think at this point everybody should know about
22120	27040	because they're really kind of prominent in many of the technologies that we already use.
27040	33400	So here's the four quantum effects for the layperson.
33400	38480	The first is probably one that everybody already knows about because it's almost something
38480	46800	that defines quantum mechanics and your first conversations about it and that's discreteness
46800	54160	of quantum states or discreteness of energies of quantum states and it basically just says
54160	62000	that a quantum state that you can pick from does not occupy arbitrary energy.
62000	67760	You can only have a set of states that occupy certain quantized or discreet energies.
67760	72240	The word quantum even comes from this one simple system that we can demonstrate this
72240	74800	with is called a particle in a box.
74800	80920	There's some box here, there's some position X here that we can denote and this is very
80960	81960	similar.
81960	85280	The states of the system are very similar to the slinky that Professor Moriarty and
85280	91640	his monkey were dangling next to the wall and if you imagine that you know a slinky
91640	98240	you can sort of drive it to have to be in a standing wave with no nodes.
98240	102560	You can have it be in a wave with one node.
102560	108720	You can have it be in a wave with two nodes, etc.
108720	115080	The energies of this are one, two, and four for this quantum system.
115080	117640	The point is that here the energies are indeed quantized.
117640	122360	What is the reason why you've got energy levels one, two, and four, no three?
122360	128760	A particle in a box, the energy is proportional to the square of the number.
128760	131680	Energy is proportional to n squared where n is the number.
132440	133120	Do we see this?
133120	134800	Do we see this in the real world?
134800	137080	Are my hand positions quantized?
137080	142800	Is your mashed potatoes in the microwave come at quantized temperatures when you measure
142800	144000	the temperature?
144000	145600	Not really.
145600	152200	You need to have for the most part a small and a cold system to be able to start to see
152200	157320	or resolve these different energies because sometimes the unit of quantization is pretty
157320	158820	small.
158820	165260	This is maybe at first seems really strange because in our world we're at such coarse
165260	171540	grained scales and there's so much energy around us that we don't really see any of
171540	174420	this minuscule microscopic quantization.
174420	180820	But it's definitely there and it's extremely precise, namely that we use this quantization
180820	184900	of energies to determine many of our fundamental constants.
184900	187980	We've been doing that for a while now.
187980	194780	So we're basically certain that all of this is kind of there if you know where to look.
194780	201500	So for a quantum system going forward, you want to just have some system of writing these
201500	203900	states and denoting their quantum.
203900	205740	And what we do is we put them in a cat.
205740	207620	So this is called a cat.
207620	212500	And inside the cat we put in the picture or some symbol or a number denoting which state
212500	213500	we're talking about here.
213500	217420	So we're talking about here the no-note state, so I'll just draw a picture of the no-note
217420	218620	state.
218620	219620	Same here.
219620	224180	Here's the cat for that one and then there's another cat for this one.
224180	228020	And you know, the stuff inside these cats can be whatever you want to denote the quantum
228020	229020	system.
229020	231700	It could be a cat that's alive or dead, you know, the famous example.
231700	233860	It can be some real number, etc.
233860	238620	It can be a binary string, a string of zeros and ones to denote the state of qubits of
238620	239980	a quantum computer.
239980	244700	Even though the set of states occupy discrete specific energies that are spaced apart in
244700	249460	some energy difference that's very precise, there can still be infinitely many of them.
249460	254820	And as you can see here, you know, this is no-note, one-note, two-note, three-note, etc.
254820	259060	So quantum systems can be in arbitrarily high energy states, but, you know, as you crank
259060	264260	up the energy, you lose a lot of the control and so for the most technologies we really
264260	270180	use just the few low-lying energy states and the simplest case is just two states, hence
270180	271460	the name qubit.
271460	276680	The second principle is the principle of superposition and collapse.
276680	281020	This to me is probably the weirdest one, even though this is something that you also
281020	288220	see in wave mechanics, for example, dropping pebbles in a pond.
288220	293820	You have some fixed types of waves that you have in the pond and if you drop multiple
293820	299180	pebbles, you can, these waves will interfere superpose with each other.
299180	304100	Similarly, the states of this quantum system that I have, say this no-note and this one-note
304100	308260	state can be in quantum superposition with each other.
308260	315460	Now what's different between the superposition of waves in a pond from, say, one pebble
315460	319860	and another pebble and this quantum superposition?
319860	322340	Well, two things.
322340	327420	Number one, there's a source of intrinsic randomness here.
327420	332860	So we really don't know which state that this system is in.
332860	335020	Let's say, why is this intrinsic?
335020	337500	Well, let me compare this to ordinary randomness.
337500	341540	Let's say I flip a coin and I put it down in my hand and I don't show it to you.
341540	348420	So you don't know what the outcome is, the coin is, is it heads, is it tails.
348420	351940	And does that mean that to you the coin is in quantum superposition?
351940	354340	No, because somebody knows.
354340	359300	Let's say I look, I know, but even if I don't look, the skin in my hand knows whether it's
359300	362140	touching the heads or the tail side of the coin.
362140	365780	So this state of the system has been predetermined, you just happen to not know it.
365780	372220	The tree's already fallen in the woods, it made a sound, you just didn't hear it.
372220	376740	The difference here is that this is in truly a quantum superposition, namely nobody knows
376740	378580	which state this is in.
378580	383300	And the second part that's different is that you change the state by looking at it.
383300	389660	So the principle of collapse here says that if you say look at it, look at the state,
389660	395380	you will project onto some set of states with some probabilities associated with them.
395380	398660	And this will be intrinsically random, you don't know the outcome a priori.
398660	402820	And once you look at it, it'll immediately collapse to one or the other outcome.
402820	408380	Let's say here, just as an example, I can collapse to this state with 50% probability
408380	413380	and to this state with 50% probability.
413380	416820	Now if I go back to my pebbles in the pond, I throw a bunch of pebbles in the pond and
416820	420500	I look at them, the waves could care less if I'm looking at them or not.
420500	422660	So there's going to be no collapse happening.
422660	428180	So the wave mechanics part is the same, however, there is something that happens when you look
428180	436580	at the system and what you get is intrinsically a random outcome.
436580	442260	And as you may suspect, this intrinsic randomness that's true for quantum, that happens in quantum
442260	446940	systems can be used to generate certified random numbers, which is one application of
446940	448400	this principle.
448400	454420	Another application you can maybe infer is trying to do computation in parallel because
454420	458980	you have the ability to generate a state that has multiple different components in
458980	459980	it.
459980	463860	However, this is kind of misleading because it's not as powerful as you might think.
463860	467980	And the reason being here is that, yes, you can generate superpositions.
467980	470820	In that sense, there's some parallelization.
470820	478060	But you get to look at these things and they immediately collapse, for ruining the superposition.
478060	483660	And even though you can look at them from all sides and directions and you can perform
483940	489060	different types of quantum measurements, you still only get a one-shot look at partially
489060	490940	what the state is.
490940	494500	So you have to look at it in multiple times from, say, many different directions to really
494500	495940	get a feel for what the state is.
495940	501860	And so it's not like you have this bona fide state that you can really observe as a live
501860	503260	superposition.
503260	507620	So the principle of parallelization here is not quite the right analogy.
507620	509820	Third principle is uncertainty.
510380	515380	Here I can demonstrate it using the ingredients we have in our quantum system.
515380	520020	And I want to immediately say that this is also a principle that you see or hear more
520020	525060	precisely when you hear a classical music concert or any music concert.
525060	531420	And this just has to do with the fact that being precise in one variable or parameter
531420	534660	comes at the expense or price of being in precise in another.
534660	537580	Let's use our ingredients here for our particle in a box.
537620	542860	And the two parameters we're interested in are frequency and position.
542860	544420	I'm going to measure these things.
544420	548060	And how come I can use the word frequency here?
548060	552300	Well, because if I, let's say, start with a super high energy state that has lots of
552300	561300	these nodes here, then this state that almost fills up the well, and I'm trying to make
561300	563140	these all look the same.
563140	566260	So pardon the artistic rendition.
566260	572220	These types of high energy states, they basically start to look like waves for high enough energy,
572220	576780	especially if you ignore the ends of the box or make the box really big, really wide.
576780	580980	So when they start to look like waves, then they begin to gain a notion of frequency.
580980	586380	And you can see that if you fit a lot of repetitions of this wave in here for a high
586380	591500	frequency this can happen for a fixed size of the well, then you can see that you can
591500	595780	more or less discern the frequency with relative certainty.
596180	600020	Now, conversely, if you were to try to look at where the position of the particle is,
600020	604780	remember, the position here is X for us.
604780	606860	So where is this particle?
606860	610540	Can we pin it down to a precise position by looking at it in a way that measures the,
610540	612180	collapses it onto a position?
612180	615220	Well, then we would be more or less uniformly distributed.
615220	620020	Our guess as to where this particle will be if we look at it is more or less uniform.
620020	623260	We don't, it's kind of all spread out all over the well.
623260	627620	And in that sense, this particle doesn't have a very precise position when it is in
627620	630220	this high energy state.
630220	634140	So relative to the frequency that we can already see by just looking at the studying
634140	639500	the wave function here, the position is less certain of this particle.
639500	645060	Okay, now let's look at the sort of the converse state or the closest counter example to this
645060	649460	type of behavior by looking at the ground state, the one with no nodes.
649460	656100	And here, if you even consider thinking of it as a wave, which, you know, you don't even
656100	659900	have a single wavelength fit in here, you have half a wavelength fit in here.
659900	664180	So because you don't have a lot of repetition, you can't really discern any repetitive behavior.
664180	671700	And so any notion of frequency here is very much less certain.
671700	677740	Conversely, if you were to try to guess, you know, pick a, pick some range of numbers where
677740	683500	this position would be, in contrast to this case where it's very delocalized here, you
683500	687660	know, it's more or less kind of focused on the center.
687660	692500	And it tends to ignore, you know, it doesn't like being near the ends as much as it does
692500	693500	near the center.
693500	699700	Now, granted, this is not as sharply, as sharply peaked as I would like in this analogy, but
699700	702980	it's sort of the ingredient we have for this specific system.
702980	706140	So I don't want to make things more complicated by drawing something that we don't have out
706140	707140	of these.
707540	711900	In principle, it's possible to engineer something like that by superposing a bunch of these.
711900	717460	And there are videos on Fourier analysis that you can, you know, look a number file.
717460	724020	And so now if we look at this position, right, it kind of tries to avoid the ends a little
724020	725020	bit.
725020	728740	And so you can say that relative to, you know, having any notion of frequency, it definitely
728740	731940	has a clearer notion of position.
731940	733100	So what is the point here?
733100	738340	Well, the point is that you can create states of quantum systems that are more precise,
738340	743940	have more precisely determinable values of one parameter at the price of being less precise
743940	746460	in another parameter.
746460	751380	And this is useful for sensing quantum or quantum sensing or quantum metrology or quantum
751380	758060	imaging, because creating a state that has a very precisely centered and a sharp distribution
758060	762220	of one parameter allows you to sense shifts in that parameter very nicely.
762220	766220	Let's say I wanted to sense the kicks in position, say I have some probe that kicks
766220	768780	my particle a little bit, changes its position.
768780	770140	Which state would I want to use?
770140	774860	Well, I want to use the state that a priori has a well-defined position to begin with
774860	780300	so that when there's a small shift, the position for a sufficiently small shift will also remain
780300	785340	more or less, you know, focused and we'll be able to measure it precisely just by looking
785340	786620	at the position.
786620	790700	If we are trying to kick a position of a state whose position is smeared out all over
790700	793180	the well, that's not going to work.
793180	798180	And what's interesting is that this sort of total uncertainty between one variable and
798180	800260	another is constant.
800260	804700	And so you can smear it around, you can make one variable more precise at the expense of
804700	806580	making the other one less precise.
806580	811460	And this is something that people have utilized in detection of gravitational waves.
811460	814100	The fourth effect is entanglement.
814100	821940	And this is something that there's also misconceptions about, but it's not really nothing but the
821940	826260	upgrade of the superposition principle to multiple systems, multiple quantum systems.
826260	830460	So far I've looked at one quantum system and I've showed you that it has different states.
830460	838500	But now let's consider we have, you know, two systems or two particles and we want to
838500	841300	study what states they have.
842060	847540	To draw a ket of two particles, we need to have some way of denoting which state the
847540	849700	first one is in and which state the second one is in.
849700	853420	So we need to have basically comma separated symbols.
853420	858660	And let's say we have some, the state of the first system or first particle is in the
858660	861700	no-node state and the state of the second one is in this one-node state.
861700	865300	And now to demonstrate entanglement, we just apply the principle of superposition and just
865300	868180	superpose it with another two-body state.
868180	869820	Let's say now where things are the opposite.
869820	874180	You have the first system in the one-node state and second in the no-node state.
874180	877300	So this is an entangled state and what is entangled about it?
877300	883460	Well, the point is here that the two particles are following some rule which leads to them
883460	884900	being correlated in a way.
884900	885900	So what is this rule?
885900	890940	Well, the rule is that if you have two states they can be in, but if one of them is in one
890940	895180	of the states, the no-node state, the other one automatically is not in the no-node state,
895180	897620	which means it's in the other state, the one-node state.
897740	901700	Likewise, if the first particle is in the one-node state, the other one, the second
901700	906100	particle is in the no-node state because it cannot be in the one-node state.
906100	912980	So this type of rule makes these particles correlated in this way and because these are
912980	918020	in quantum superposition, this correlation is intrinsically quantum and this is what's
918020	919100	called entanglement.
919100	923180	The rule though is something that again you see in classical physics because the rule
923180	926180	is something that I can demonstrate using socks.
926180	932980	If I promise you that I wear opposite colored socks, red and blue, then if you see a red
932980	936940	sock on my right foot, then you're going to see a blue sock on the left foot.
936940	938940	And there's nothing spooky about that or anything.
938940	943700	It's just set up by the rule, by the sort of the type of state that I'm looking at here.
943700	948180	So what's cool about the quantum version of this is that you can infer the state of the
948180	951460	other system just by looking at the first system because of this rule.
951460	959340	If I collapse the first state in this way onto one of these or the other no-node or
959340	964260	one-node state, I will be able to infer what state the other system is in.
964260	967980	If I get the no-node outcome for the collapse of the first system, I know the other one
967980	969380	will be in the one-node state.
969380	972060	It doesn't matter how far separated these are.
972060	977340	The rule has a priori determined the correlation that they're going to have and it's only
977340	983180	up to now the collapse principle to figure out which one of these states they're in.
983180	992100	And this powerful notion of quantum correlations or entanglement is useful for quantum computing.
992100	998740	And while it's pretty simple for two systems, as we scale it up for n being greater than
998740	1002460	2, 3, 4, etc., this gets pretty complicated.
1002460	1007900	And it's really because for two states per system, you have two to the n states for n
1007900	1014620	systems and meaning that the number of states doubles every time you add one more particle.
1014620	1018460	And you have a nice video about that demonstrating that and the usefulness of that in quantum
1018460	1019460	computing.
1019460	1022060	Each qubit itself is doubling.
1022060	1024680	So you have to think of that number of doublings each time.
1024680	1026460	These are basically the four quantum effects.
1026460	1030140	The hope is really that everybody will know them because they've really been utilized
1030220	1037140	for metrology, being utilized now for computing, utilized for gravitational waves, MRI, lasers,
1037140	1040940	etc., but really all four are necessary for modern quantum technologies.
1043940	1047340	It's a superposition of waves on that string.
1047340	1052220	This string can be in a range of different types, variety of different types of molds
1052220	1053900	of oscillation, waves of vibrating.
1053900	1057580	They've never written it onto this file, but it's left the rest of this file intact
1057580	1059180	because it's not truncated the file.
1059180	1060220	It's really truncated.
