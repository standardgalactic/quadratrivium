1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
So before getting into detail into the various quantum technologies past and present and

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,280
future, I think it's important for all of us to be able to be on the same footing regarding

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,080
what quantum effects are behind them and really kind of have a thorough sort of list of all

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,120
these quantum effects that really I think at this point everybody should know about

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,040
because they're really kind of prominent in many of the technologies that we already use.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,400
So here's the four quantum effects for the layperson.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,480
The first is probably one that everybody already knows about because it's almost something

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:46,800
that defines quantum mechanics and your first conversations about it and that's discreteness

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,160
of quantum states or discreteness of energies of quantum states and it basically just says

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:02,000
that a quantum state that you can pick from does not occupy arbitrary energy.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,760
You can only have a set of states that occupy certain quantized or discreet energies.

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,240
The word quantum even comes from this one simple system that we can demonstrate this

13
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,800
with is called a particle in a box.

14
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,920
There's some box here, there's some position X here that we can denote and this is very

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
similar.

16
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,280
The states of the system are very similar to the slinky that Professor Moriarty and

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,640
his monkey were dangling next to the wall and if you imagine that you know a slinky

18
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:38,240
you can sort of drive it to have to be in a standing wave with no nodes.

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,560
You can have it be in a wave with one node.

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,720
You can have it be in a wave with two nodes, etc.

21
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,080
The energies of this are one, two, and four for this quantum system.

22
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,640
The point is that here the energies are indeed quantized.

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,360
What is the reason why you've got energy levels one, two, and four, no three?

24
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,760
A particle in a box, the energy is proportional to the square of the number.

25
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,680
Energy is proportional to n squared where n is the number.

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,120
Do we see this?

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
Do we see this in the real world?

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,080
Are my hand positions quantized?

29
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,800
Is your mashed potatoes in the microwave come at quantized temperatures when you measure

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
the temperature?

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,600
Not really.

32
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:32,200
You need to have for the most part a small and a cold system to be able to start to see

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,320
or resolve these different energies because sometimes the unit of quantization is pretty

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,820
small.

35
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:45,260
This is maybe at first seems really strange because in our world we're at such coarse

36
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,540
grained scales and there's so much energy around us that we don't really see any of

37
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,420
this minuscule microscopic quantization.

38
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,820
But it's definitely there and it's extremely precise, namely that we use this quantization

39
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,900
of energies to determine many of our fundamental constants.

40
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,980
We've been doing that for a while now.

41
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:14,780
So we're basically certain that all of this is kind of there if you know where to look.

42
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:21,500
So for a quantum system going forward, you want to just have some system of writing these

43
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,900
states and denoting their quantum.

44
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,740
And what we do is we put them in a cat.

45
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,620
So this is called a cat.

46
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,500
And inside the cat we put in the picture or some symbol or a number denoting which state

47
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
we're talking about here.

48
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,420
So we're talking about here the no-note state, so I'll just draw a picture of the no-note

49
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,620
state.

50
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,620
Same here.

51
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,180
Here's the cat for that one and then there's another cat for this one.

52
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,020
And you know, the stuff inside these cats can be whatever you want to denote the quantum

53
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,020
system.

54
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,700
It could be a cat that's alive or dead, you know, the famous example.

55
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,860
It can be some real number, etc.

56
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,620
It can be a binary string, a string of zeros and ones to denote the state of qubits of

57
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,980
a quantum computer.

58
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,700
Even though the set of states occupy discrete specific energies that are spaced apart in

59
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,460
some energy difference that's very precise, there can still be infinitely many of them.

60
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,820
And as you can see here, you know, this is no-note, one-note, two-note, three-note, etc.

61
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,060
So quantum systems can be in arbitrarily high energy states, but, you know, as you crank

62
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,260
up the energy, you lose a lot of the control and so for the most technologies we really

63
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:30,180
use just the few low-lying energy states and the simplest case is just two states, hence

64
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,460
the name qubit.

65
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,680
The second principle is the principle of superposition and collapse.

66
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,020
This to me is probably the weirdest one, even though this is something that you also

67
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:48,220
see in wave mechanics, for example, dropping pebbles in a pond.

68
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,820
You have some fixed types of waves that you have in the pond and if you drop multiple

69
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,180
pebbles, you can, these waves will interfere superpose with each other.

70
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,100
Similarly, the states of this quantum system that I have, say this no-note and this one-note

71
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,260
state can be in quantum superposition with each other.

72
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:15,460
Now what's different between the superposition of waves in a pond from, say, one pebble

73
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,860
and another pebble and this quantum superposition?

74
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,340
Well, two things.

75
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,420
Number one, there's a source of intrinsic randomness here.

76
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:32,860
So we really don't know which state that this system is in.

77
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,020
Let's say, why is this intrinsic?

78
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,500
Well, let me compare this to ordinary randomness.

79
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,540
Let's say I flip a coin and I put it down in my hand and I don't show it to you.

80
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:48,420
So you don't know what the outcome is, the coin is, is it heads, is it tails.

81
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,940
And does that mean that to you the coin is in quantum superposition?

82
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,340
No, because somebody knows.

83
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,300
Let's say I look, I know, but even if I don't look, the skin in my hand knows whether it's

84
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,140
touching the heads or the tail side of the coin.

85
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,780
So this state of the system has been predetermined, you just happen to not know it.

86
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:12,220
The tree's already fallen in the woods, it made a sound, you just didn't hear it.

87
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,740
The difference here is that this is in truly a quantum superposition, namely nobody knows

88
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,580
which state this is in.

89
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,300
And the second part that's different is that you change the state by looking at it.

90
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:29,660
So the principle of collapse here says that if you say look at it, look at the state,

91
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,380
you will project onto some set of states with some probabilities associated with them.

92
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,660
And this will be intrinsically random, you don't know the outcome a priori.

93
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,820
And once you look at it, it'll immediately collapse to one or the other outcome.

94
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:48,380
Let's say here, just as an example, I can collapse to this state with 50% probability

95
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,380
and to this state with 50% probability.

96
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,820
Now if I go back to my pebbles in the pond, I throw a bunch of pebbles in the pond and

97
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,500
I look at them, the waves could care less if I'm looking at them or not.

98
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,660
So there's going to be no collapse happening.

99
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:08,180
So the wave mechanics part is the same, however, there is something that happens when you look

100
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:16,580
at the system and what you get is intrinsically a random outcome.

101
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,260
And as you may suspect, this intrinsic randomness that's true for quantum, that happens in quantum

102
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,940
systems can be used to generate certified random numbers, which is one application of

103
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,400
this principle.

104
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,420
Another application you can maybe infer is trying to do computation in parallel because

105
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,980
you have the ability to generate a state that has multiple different components in

106
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,980
it.

107
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,860
However, this is kind of misleading because it's not as powerful as you might think.

108
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,980
And the reason being here is that, yes, you can generate superpositions.

109
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,820
In that sense, there's some parallelization.

110
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:58,060
But you get to look at these things and they immediately collapse, for ruining the superposition.

111
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:03,660
And even though you can look at them from all sides and directions and you can perform

112
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,060
different types of quantum measurements, you still only get a one-shot look at partially

113
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,940
what the state is.

114
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,500
So you have to look at it in multiple times from, say, many different directions to really

115
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,940
get a feel for what the state is.

116
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,860
And so it's not like you have this bona fide state that you can really observe as a live

117
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,260
superposition.

118
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,620
So the principle of parallelization here is not quite the right analogy.

119
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,820
Third principle is uncertainty.

120
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,380
Here I can demonstrate it using the ingredients we have in our quantum system.

121
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,020
And I want to immediately say that this is also a principle that you see or hear more

122
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:45,060
precisely when you hear a classical music concert or any music concert.

123
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:51,420
And this just has to do with the fact that being precise in one variable or parameter

124
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,660
comes at the expense or price of being in precise in another.

125
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,580
Let's use our ingredients here for our particle in a box.

126
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,860
And the two parameters we're interested in are frequency and position.

127
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,420
I'm going to measure these things.

128
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,060
And how come I can use the word frequency here?

129
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,300
Well, because if I, let's say, start with a super high energy state that has lots of

130
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:21,300
these nodes here, then this state that almost fills up the well, and I'm trying to make

131
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,140
these all look the same.

132
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,260
So pardon the artistic rendition.

133
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:32,220
These types of high energy states, they basically start to look like waves for high enough energy,

134
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,780
especially if you ignore the ends of the box or make the box really big, really wide.

135
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,980
So when they start to look like waves, then they begin to gain a notion of frequency.

136
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,380
And you can see that if you fit a lot of repetitions of this wave in here for a high

137
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,500
frequency this can happen for a fixed size of the well, then you can see that you can

138
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,780
more or less discern the frequency with relative certainty.

139
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,020
Now, conversely, if you were to try to look at where the position of the particle is,

140
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,780
remember, the position here is X for us.

141
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,860
So where is this particle?

142
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,540
Can we pin it down to a precise position by looking at it in a way that measures the,

143
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,180
collapses it onto a position?

144
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,220
Well, then we would be more or less uniformly distributed.

145
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,020
Our guess as to where this particle will be if we look at it is more or less uniform.

146
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,260
We don't, it's kind of all spread out all over the well.

147
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,620
And in that sense, this particle doesn't have a very precise position when it is in

148
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,220
this high energy state.

149
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,140
So relative to the frequency that we can already see by just looking at the studying

150
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,500
the wave function here, the position is less certain of this particle.

151
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:45,060
Okay, now let's look at the sort of the converse state or the closest counter example to this

152
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,460
type of behavior by looking at the ground state, the one with no nodes.

153
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:56,100
And here, if you even consider thinking of it as a wave, which, you know, you don't even

154
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,900
have a single wavelength fit in here, you have half a wavelength fit in here.

155
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,180
So because you don't have a lot of repetition, you can't really discern any repetitive behavior.

156
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:11,700
And so any notion of frequency here is very much less certain.

157
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,740
Conversely, if you were to try to guess, you know, pick a, pick some range of numbers where

158
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,500
this position would be, in contrast to this case where it's very delocalized here, you

159
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,660
know, it's more or less kind of focused on the center.

160
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,500
And it tends to ignore, you know, it doesn't like being near the ends as much as it does

161
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
near the center.

162
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,700
Now, granted, this is not as sharply, as sharply peaked as I would like in this analogy, but

163
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,980
it's sort of the ingredient we have for this specific system.

164
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,140
So I don't want to make things more complicated by drawing something that we don't have out

165
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,140
of these.

166
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,900
In principle, it's possible to engineer something like that by superposing a bunch of these.

167
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:57,460
And there are videos on Fourier analysis that you can, you know, look a number file.

168
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:04,020
And so now if we look at this position, right, it kind of tries to avoid the ends a little

169
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,020
bit.

170
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,740
And so you can say that relative to, you know, having any notion of frequency, it definitely

171
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,940
has a clearer notion of position.

172
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,100
So what is the point here?

173
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,340
Well, the point is that you can create states of quantum systems that are more precise,

174
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,940
have more precisely determinable values of one parameter at the price of being less precise

175
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,460
in another parameter.

176
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,380
And this is useful for sensing quantum or quantum sensing or quantum metrology or quantum

177
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:38,060
imaging, because creating a state that has a very precisely centered and a sharp distribution

178
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,220
of one parameter allows you to sense shifts in that parameter very nicely.

179
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,220
Let's say I wanted to sense the kicks in position, say I have some probe that kicks

180
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,780
my particle a little bit, changes its position.

181
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,140
Which state would I want to use?

182
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,860
Well, I want to use the state that a priori has a well-defined position to begin with

183
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:00,300
so that when there's a small shift, the position for a sufficiently small shift will also remain

184
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,340
more or less, you know, focused and we'll be able to measure it precisely just by looking

185
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,620
at the position.

186
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,700
If we are trying to kick a position of a state whose position is smeared out all over

187
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,180
the well, that's not going to work.

188
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,180
And what's interesting is that this sort of total uncertainty between one variable and

189
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,260
another is constant.

190
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,700
And so you can smear it around, you can make one variable more precise at the expense of

191
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,580
making the other one less precise.

192
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,460
And this is something that people have utilized in detection of gravitational waves.

193
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,100
The fourth effect is entanglement.

194
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:41,940
And this is something that there's also misconceptions about, but it's not really nothing but the

195
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,260
upgrade of the superposition principle to multiple systems, multiple quantum systems.

196
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,460
So far I've looked at one quantum system and I've showed you that it has different states.

197
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:58,500
But now let's consider we have, you know, two systems or two particles and we want to

198
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,300
study what states they have.

199
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,540
To draw a ket of two particles, we need to have some way of denoting which state the

200
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,700
first one is in and which state the second one is in.

201
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,420
So we need to have basically comma separated symbols.

202
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:18,660
And let's say we have some, the state of the first system or first particle is in the

203
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,700
no-node state and the state of the second one is in this one-node state.

204
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,300
And now to demonstrate entanglement, we just apply the principle of superposition and just

205
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,180
superpose it with another two-body state.

206
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,820
Let's say now where things are the opposite.

207
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,180
You have the first system in the one-node state and second in the no-node state.

208
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,300
So this is an entangled state and what is entangled about it?

209
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:43,460
Well, the point is here that the two particles are following some rule which leads to them

210
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,900
being correlated in a way.

211
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,900
So what is this rule?

212
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,940
Well, the rule is that if you have two states they can be in, but if one of them is in one

213
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,180
of the states, the no-node state, the other one automatically is not in the no-node state,

214
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,620
which means it's in the other state, the one-node state.

215
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,700
Likewise, if the first particle is in the one-node state, the other one, the second

216
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,100
particle is in the no-node state because it cannot be in the one-node state.

217
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:12,980
So this type of rule makes these particles correlated in this way and because these are

218
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:18,020
in quantum superposition, this correlation is intrinsically quantum and this is what's

219
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,100
called entanglement.

220
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,180
The rule though is something that again you see in classical physics because the rule

221
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,180
is something that I can demonstrate using socks.

222
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:32,980
If I promise you that I wear opposite colored socks, red and blue, then if you see a red

223
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,940
sock on my right foot, then you're going to see a blue sock on the left foot.

224
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,940
And there's nothing spooky about that or anything.

225
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,700
It's just set up by the rule, by the sort of the type of state that I'm looking at here.

226
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,180
So what's cool about the quantum version of this is that you can infer the state of the

227
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,460
other system just by looking at the first system because of this rule.

228
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:59,340
If I collapse the first state in this way onto one of these or the other no-node or

229
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:04,260
one-node state, I will be able to infer what state the other system is in.

230
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,980
If I get the no-node outcome for the collapse of the first system, I know the other one

231
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,380
will be in the one-node state.

232
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,060
It doesn't matter how far separated these are.

233
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,340
The rule has a priori determined the correlation that they're going to have and it's only

234
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:23,180
up to now the collapse principle to figure out which one of these states they're in.

235
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:32,100
And this powerful notion of quantum correlations or entanglement is useful for quantum computing.

236
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,740
And while it's pretty simple for two systems, as we scale it up for n being greater than

237
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,460
2, 3, 4, etc., this gets pretty complicated.

238
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,900
And it's really because for two states per system, you have two to the n states for n

239
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:54,620
systems and meaning that the number of states doubles every time you add one more particle.

240
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,460
And you have a nice video about that demonstrating that and the usefulness of that in quantum

241
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,460
computing.

242
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,060
Each qubit itself is doubling.

243
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,680
So you have to think of that number of doublings each time.

244
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,460
These are basically the four quantum effects.

245
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,140
The hope is really that everybody will know them because they've really been utilized

246
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:17,140
for metrology, being utilized now for computing, utilized for gravitational waves, MRI, lasers,

247
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,940
etc., but really all four are necessary for modern quantum technologies.

248
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,340
It's a superposition of waves on that string.

249
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:32,220
This string can be in a range of different types, variety of different types of molds

250
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,900
of oscillation, waves of vibrating.

251
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,580
They've never written it onto this file, but it's left the rest of this file intact

252
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,180
because it's not truncated the file.

253
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,220
It's really truncated.
