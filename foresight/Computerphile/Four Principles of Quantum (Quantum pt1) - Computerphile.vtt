00:00.000 --> 00:08.720
So before getting into detail into the various quantum technologies past and present and

00:08.720 --> 00:13.280
future, I think it's important for all of us to be able to be on the same footing regarding

00:13.280 --> 00:19.080
what quantum effects are behind them and really kind of have a thorough sort of list of all

00:19.080 --> 00:22.120
these quantum effects that really I think at this point everybody should know about

00:22.120 --> 00:27.040
because they're really kind of prominent in many of the technologies that we already use.

00:27.040 --> 00:33.400
So here's the four quantum effects for the layperson.

00:33.400 --> 00:38.480
The first is probably one that everybody already knows about because it's almost something

00:38.480 --> 00:46.800
that defines quantum mechanics and your first conversations about it and that's discreteness

00:46.800 --> 00:54.160
of quantum states or discreteness of energies of quantum states and it basically just says

00:54.160 --> 01:02.000
that a quantum state that you can pick from does not occupy arbitrary energy.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.760
You can only have a set of states that occupy certain quantized or discreet energies.

01:07.760 --> 01:12.240
The word quantum even comes from this one simple system that we can demonstrate this

01:12.240 --> 01:14.800
with is called a particle in a box.

01:14.800 --> 01:20.920
There's some box here, there's some position X here that we can denote and this is very

01:20.960 --> 01:21.960
similar.

01:21.960 --> 01:25.280
The states of the system are very similar to the slinky that Professor Moriarty and

01:25.280 --> 01:31.640
his monkey were dangling next to the wall and if you imagine that you know a slinky

01:31.640 --> 01:38.240
you can sort of drive it to have to be in a standing wave with no nodes.

01:38.240 --> 01:42.560
You can have it be in a wave with one node.

01:42.560 --> 01:48.720
You can have it be in a wave with two nodes, etc.

01:48.720 --> 01:55.080
The energies of this are one, two, and four for this quantum system.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.640
The point is that here the energies are indeed quantized.

01:57.640 --> 02:02.360
What is the reason why you've got energy levels one, two, and four, no three?

02:02.360 --> 02:08.760
A particle in a box, the energy is proportional to the square of the number.

02:08.760 --> 02:11.680
Energy is proportional to n squared where n is the number.

02:12.440 --> 02:13.120
Do we see this?

02:13.120 --> 02:14.800
Do we see this in the real world?

02:14.800 --> 02:17.080
Are my hand positions quantized?

02:17.080 --> 02:22.800
Is your mashed potatoes in the microwave come at quantized temperatures when you measure

02:22.800 --> 02:24.000
the temperature?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.600
Not really.

02:25.600 --> 02:32.200
You need to have for the most part a small and a cold system to be able to start to see

02:32.200 --> 02:37.320
or resolve these different energies because sometimes the unit of quantization is pretty

02:37.320 --> 02:38.820
small.

02:38.820 --> 02:45.260
This is maybe at first seems really strange because in our world we're at such coarse

02:45.260 --> 02:51.540
grained scales and there's so much energy around us that we don't really see any of

02:51.540 --> 02:54.420
this minuscule microscopic quantization.

02:54.420 --> 03:00.820
But it's definitely there and it's extremely precise, namely that we use this quantization

03:00.820 --> 03:04.900
of energies to determine many of our fundamental constants.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.980
We've been doing that for a while now.

03:07.980 --> 03:14.780
So we're basically certain that all of this is kind of there if you know where to look.

03:14.780 --> 03:21.500
So for a quantum system going forward, you want to just have some system of writing these

03:21.500 --> 03:23.900
states and denoting their quantum.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.740
And what we do is we put them in a cat.

03:25.740 --> 03:27.620
So this is called a cat.

03:27.620 --> 03:32.500
And inside the cat we put in the picture or some symbol or a number denoting which state

03:32.500 --> 03:33.500
we're talking about here.

03:33.500 --> 03:37.420
So we're talking about here the no-note state, so I'll just draw a picture of the no-note

03:37.420 --> 03:38.620
state.

03:38.620 --> 03:39.620
Same here.

03:39.620 --> 03:44.180
Here's the cat for that one and then there's another cat for this one.

03:44.180 --> 03:48.020
And you know, the stuff inside these cats can be whatever you want to denote the quantum

03:48.020 --> 03:49.020
system.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.700
It could be a cat that's alive or dead, you know, the famous example.

03:51.700 --> 03:53.860
It can be some real number, etc.

03:53.860 --> 03:58.620
It can be a binary string, a string of zeros and ones to denote the state of qubits of

03:58.620 --> 03:59.980
a quantum computer.

03:59.980 --> 04:04.700
Even though the set of states occupy discrete specific energies that are spaced apart in

04:04.700 --> 04:09.460
some energy difference that's very precise, there can still be infinitely many of them.

04:09.460 --> 04:14.820
And as you can see here, you know, this is no-note, one-note, two-note, three-note, etc.

04:14.820 --> 04:19.060
So quantum systems can be in arbitrarily high energy states, but, you know, as you crank

04:19.060 --> 04:24.260
up the energy, you lose a lot of the control and so for the most technologies we really

04:24.260 --> 04:30.180
use just the few low-lying energy states and the simplest case is just two states, hence

04:30.180 --> 04:31.460
the name qubit.

04:31.460 --> 04:36.680
The second principle is the principle of superposition and collapse.

04:36.680 --> 04:41.020
This to me is probably the weirdest one, even though this is something that you also

04:41.020 --> 04:48.220
see in wave mechanics, for example, dropping pebbles in a pond.

04:48.220 --> 04:53.820
You have some fixed types of waves that you have in the pond and if you drop multiple

04:53.820 --> 04:59.180
pebbles, you can, these waves will interfere superpose with each other.

04:59.180 --> 05:04.100
Similarly, the states of this quantum system that I have, say this no-note and this one-note

05:04.100 --> 05:08.260
state can be in quantum superposition with each other.

05:08.260 --> 05:15.460
Now what's different between the superposition of waves in a pond from, say, one pebble

05:15.460 --> 05:19.860
and another pebble and this quantum superposition?

05:19.860 --> 05:22.340
Well, two things.

05:22.340 --> 05:27.420
Number one, there's a source of intrinsic randomness here.

05:27.420 --> 05:32.860
So we really don't know which state that this system is in.

05:32.860 --> 05:35.020
Let's say, why is this intrinsic?

05:35.020 --> 05:37.500
Well, let me compare this to ordinary randomness.

05:37.500 --> 05:41.540
Let's say I flip a coin and I put it down in my hand and I don't show it to you.

05:41.540 --> 05:48.420
So you don't know what the outcome is, the coin is, is it heads, is it tails.

05:48.420 --> 05:51.940
And does that mean that to you the coin is in quantum superposition?

05:51.940 --> 05:54.340
No, because somebody knows.

05:54.340 --> 05:59.300
Let's say I look, I know, but even if I don't look, the skin in my hand knows whether it's

05:59.300 --> 06:02.140
touching the heads or the tail side of the coin.

06:02.140 --> 06:05.780
So this state of the system has been predetermined, you just happen to not know it.

06:05.780 --> 06:12.220
The tree's already fallen in the woods, it made a sound, you just didn't hear it.

06:12.220 --> 06:16.740
The difference here is that this is in truly a quantum superposition, namely nobody knows

06:16.740 --> 06:18.580
which state this is in.

06:18.580 --> 06:23.300
And the second part that's different is that you change the state by looking at it.

06:23.300 --> 06:29.660
So the principle of collapse here says that if you say look at it, look at the state,

06:29.660 --> 06:35.380
you will project onto some set of states with some probabilities associated with them.

06:35.380 --> 06:38.660
And this will be intrinsically random, you don't know the outcome a priori.

06:38.660 --> 06:42.820
And once you look at it, it'll immediately collapse to one or the other outcome.

06:42.820 --> 06:48.380
Let's say here, just as an example, I can collapse to this state with 50% probability

06:48.380 --> 06:53.380
and to this state with 50% probability.

06:53.380 --> 06:56.820
Now if I go back to my pebbles in the pond, I throw a bunch of pebbles in the pond and

06:56.820 --> 07:00.500
I look at them, the waves could care less if I'm looking at them or not.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.660
So there's going to be no collapse happening.

07:02.660 --> 07:08.180
So the wave mechanics part is the same, however, there is something that happens when you look

07:08.180 --> 07:16.580
at the system and what you get is intrinsically a random outcome.

07:16.580 --> 07:22.260
And as you may suspect, this intrinsic randomness that's true for quantum, that happens in quantum

07:22.260 --> 07:26.940
systems can be used to generate certified random numbers, which is one application of

07:26.940 --> 07:28.400
this principle.

07:28.400 --> 07:34.420
Another application you can maybe infer is trying to do computation in parallel because

07:34.420 --> 07:38.980
you have the ability to generate a state that has multiple different components in

07:38.980 --> 07:39.980
it.

07:39.980 --> 07:43.860
However, this is kind of misleading because it's not as powerful as you might think.

07:43.860 --> 07:47.980
And the reason being here is that, yes, you can generate superpositions.

07:47.980 --> 07:50.820
In that sense, there's some parallelization.

07:50.820 --> 07:58.060
But you get to look at these things and they immediately collapse, for ruining the superposition.

07:58.060 --> 08:03.660
And even though you can look at them from all sides and directions and you can perform

08:03.940 --> 08:09.060
different types of quantum measurements, you still only get a one-shot look at partially

08:09.060 --> 08:10.940
what the state is.

08:10.940 --> 08:14.500
So you have to look at it in multiple times from, say, many different directions to really

08:14.500 --> 08:15.940
get a feel for what the state is.

08:15.940 --> 08:21.860
And so it's not like you have this bona fide state that you can really observe as a live

08:21.860 --> 08:23.260
superposition.

08:23.260 --> 08:27.620
So the principle of parallelization here is not quite the right analogy.

08:27.620 --> 08:29.820
Third principle is uncertainty.

08:30.380 --> 08:35.380
Here I can demonstrate it using the ingredients we have in our quantum system.

08:35.380 --> 08:40.020
And I want to immediately say that this is also a principle that you see or hear more

08:40.020 --> 08:45.060
precisely when you hear a classical music concert or any music concert.

08:45.060 --> 08:51.420
And this just has to do with the fact that being precise in one variable or parameter

08:51.420 --> 08:54.660
comes at the expense or price of being in precise in another.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.580
Let's use our ingredients here for our particle in a box.

08:57.620 --> 09:02.860
And the two parameters we're interested in are frequency and position.

09:02.860 --> 09:04.420
I'm going to measure these things.

09:04.420 --> 09:08.060
And how come I can use the word frequency here?

09:08.060 --> 09:12.300
Well, because if I, let's say, start with a super high energy state that has lots of

09:12.300 --> 09:21.300
these nodes here, then this state that almost fills up the well, and I'm trying to make

09:21.300 --> 09:23.140
these all look the same.

09:23.140 --> 09:26.260
So pardon the artistic rendition.

09:26.260 --> 09:32.220
These types of high energy states, they basically start to look like waves for high enough energy,

09:32.220 --> 09:36.780
especially if you ignore the ends of the box or make the box really big, really wide.

09:36.780 --> 09:40.980
So when they start to look like waves, then they begin to gain a notion of frequency.

09:40.980 --> 09:46.380
And you can see that if you fit a lot of repetitions of this wave in here for a high

09:46.380 --> 09:51.500
frequency this can happen for a fixed size of the well, then you can see that you can

09:51.500 --> 09:55.780
more or less discern the frequency with relative certainty.

09:56.180 --> 10:00.020
Now, conversely, if you were to try to look at where the position of the particle is,

10:00.020 --> 10:04.780
remember, the position here is X for us.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.860
So where is this particle?

10:06.860 --> 10:10.540
Can we pin it down to a precise position by looking at it in a way that measures the,

10:10.540 --> 10:12.180
collapses it onto a position?

10:12.180 --> 10:15.220
Well, then we would be more or less uniformly distributed.

10:15.220 --> 10:20.020
Our guess as to where this particle will be if we look at it is more or less uniform.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.260
We don't, it's kind of all spread out all over the well.

10:23.260 --> 10:27.620
And in that sense, this particle doesn't have a very precise position when it is in

10:27.620 --> 10:30.220
this high energy state.

10:30.220 --> 10:34.140
So relative to the frequency that we can already see by just looking at the studying

10:34.140 --> 10:39.500
the wave function here, the position is less certain of this particle.

10:39.500 --> 10:45.060
Okay, now let's look at the sort of the converse state or the closest counter example to this

10:45.060 --> 10:49.460
type of behavior by looking at the ground state, the one with no nodes.

10:49.460 --> 10:56.100
And here, if you even consider thinking of it as a wave, which, you know, you don't even

10:56.100 --> 10:59.900
have a single wavelength fit in here, you have half a wavelength fit in here.

10:59.900 --> 11:04.180
So because you don't have a lot of repetition, you can't really discern any repetitive behavior.

11:04.180 --> 11:11.700
And so any notion of frequency here is very much less certain.

11:11.700 --> 11:17.740
Conversely, if you were to try to guess, you know, pick a, pick some range of numbers where

11:17.740 --> 11:23.500
this position would be, in contrast to this case where it's very delocalized here, you

11:23.500 --> 11:27.660
know, it's more or less kind of focused on the center.

11:27.660 --> 11:32.500
And it tends to ignore, you know, it doesn't like being near the ends as much as it does

11:32.500 --> 11:33.500
near the center.

11:33.500 --> 11:39.700
Now, granted, this is not as sharply, as sharply peaked as I would like in this analogy, but

11:39.700 --> 11:42.980
it's sort of the ingredient we have for this specific system.

11:42.980 --> 11:46.140
So I don't want to make things more complicated by drawing something that we don't have out

11:46.140 --> 11:47.140
of these.

11:47.540 --> 11:51.900
In principle, it's possible to engineer something like that by superposing a bunch of these.

11:51.900 --> 11:57.460
And there are videos on Fourier analysis that you can, you know, look a number file.

11:57.460 --> 12:04.020
And so now if we look at this position, right, it kind of tries to avoid the ends a little

12:04.020 --> 12:05.020
bit.

12:05.020 --> 12:08.740
And so you can say that relative to, you know, having any notion of frequency, it definitely

12:08.740 --> 12:11.940
has a clearer notion of position.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.100
So what is the point here?

12:13.100 --> 12:18.340
Well, the point is that you can create states of quantum systems that are more precise,

12:18.340 --> 12:23.940
have more precisely determinable values of one parameter at the price of being less precise

12:23.940 --> 12:26.460
in another parameter.

12:26.460 --> 12:31.380
And this is useful for sensing quantum or quantum sensing or quantum metrology or quantum

12:31.380 --> 12:38.060
imaging, because creating a state that has a very precisely centered and a sharp distribution

12:38.060 --> 12:42.220
of one parameter allows you to sense shifts in that parameter very nicely.

12:42.220 --> 12:46.220
Let's say I wanted to sense the kicks in position, say I have some probe that kicks

12:46.220 --> 12:48.780
my particle a little bit, changes its position.

12:48.780 --> 12:50.140
Which state would I want to use?

12:50.140 --> 12:54.860
Well, I want to use the state that a priori has a well-defined position to begin with

12:54.860 --> 13:00.300
so that when there's a small shift, the position for a sufficiently small shift will also remain

13:00.300 --> 13:05.340
more or less, you know, focused and we'll be able to measure it precisely just by looking

13:05.340 --> 13:06.620
at the position.

13:06.620 --> 13:10.700
If we are trying to kick a position of a state whose position is smeared out all over

13:10.700 --> 13:13.180
the well, that's not going to work.

13:13.180 --> 13:18.180
And what's interesting is that this sort of total uncertainty between one variable and

13:18.180 --> 13:20.260
another is constant.

13:20.260 --> 13:24.700
And so you can smear it around, you can make one variable more precise at the expense of

13:24.700 --> 13:26.580
making the other one less precise.

13:26.580 --> 13:31.460
And this is something that people have utilized in detection of gravitational waves.

13:31.460 --> 13:34.100
The fourth effect is entanglement.

13:34.100 --> 13:41.940
And this is something that there's also misconceptions about, but it's not really nothing but the

13:41.940 --> 13:46.260
upgrade of the superposition principle to multiple systems, multiple quantum systems.

13:46.260 --> 13:50.460
So far I've looked at one quantum system and I've showed you that it has different states.

13:50.460 --> 13:58.500
But now let's consider we have, you know, two systems or two particles and we want to

13:58.500 --> 14:01.300
study what states they have.

14:02.060 --> 14:07.540
To draw a ket of two particles, we need to have some way of denoting which state the

14:07.540 --> 14:09.700
first one is in and which state the second one is in.

14:09.700 --> 14:13.420
So we need to have basically comma separated symbols.

14:13.420 --> 14:18.660
And let's say we have some, the state of the first system or first particle is in the

14:18.660 --> 14:21.700
no-node state and the state of the second one is in this one-node state.

14:21.700 --> 14:25.300
And now to demonstrate entanglement, we just apply the principle of superposition and just

14:25.300 --> 14:28.180
superpose it with another two-body state.

14:28.180 --> 14:29.820
Let's say now where things are the opposite.

14:29.820 --> 14:34.180
You have the first system in the one-node state and second in the no-node state.

14:34.180 --> 14:37.300
So this is an entangled state and what is entangled about it?

14:37.300 --> 14:43.460
Well, the point is here that the two particles are following some rule which leads to them

14:43.460 --> 14:44.900
being correlated in a way.

14:44.900 --> 14:45.900
So what is this rule?

14:45.900 --> 14:50.940
Well, the rule is that if you have two states they can be in, but if one of them is in one

14:50.940 --> 14:55.180
of the states, the no-node state, the other one automatically is not in the no-node state,

14:55.180 --> 14:57.620
which means it's in the other state, the one-node state.

14:57.740 --> 15:01.700
Likewise, if the first particle is in the one-node state, the other one, the second

15:01.700 --> 15:06.100
particle is in the no-node state because it cannot be in the one-node state.

15:06.100 --> 15:12.980
So this type of rule makes these particles correlated in this way and because these are

15:12.980 --> 15:18.020
in quantum superposition, this correlation is intrinsically quantum and this is what's

15:18.020 --> 15:19.100
called entanglement.

15:19.100 --> 15:23.180
The rule though is something that again you see in classical physics because the rule

15:23.180 --> 15:26.180
is something that I can demonstrate using socks.

15:26.180 --> 15:32.980
If I promise you that I wear opposite colored socks, red and blue, then if you see a red

15:32.980 --> 15:36.940
sock on my right foot, then you're going to see a blue sock on the left foot.

15:36.940 --> 15:38.940
And there's nothing spooky about that or anything.

15:38.940 --> 15:43.700
It's just set up by the rule, by the sort of the type of state that I'm looking at here.

15:43.700 --> 15:48.180
So what's cool about the quantum version of this is that you can infer the state of the

15:48.180 --> 15:51.460
other system just by looking at the first system because of this rule.

15:51.460 --> 15:59.340
If I collapse the first state in this way onto one of these or the other no-node or

15:59.340 --> 16:04.260
one-node state, I will be able to infer what state the other system is in.

16:04.260 --> 16:07.980
If I get the no-node outcome for the collapse of the first system, I know the other one

16:07.980 --> 16:09.380
will be in the one-node state.

16:09.380 --> 16:12.060
It doesn't matter how far separated these are.

16:12.060 --> 16:17.340
The rule has a priori determined the correlation that they're going to have and it's only

16:17.340 --> 16:23.180
up to now the collapse principle to figure out which one of these states they're in.

16:23.180 --> 16:32.100
And this powerful notion of quantum correlations or entanglement is useful for quantum computing.

16:32.100 --> 16:38.740
And while it's pretty simple for two systems, as we scale it up for n being greater than

16:38.740 --> 16:42.460
2, 3, 4, etc., this gets pretty complicated.

16:42.460 --> 16:47.900
And it's really because for two states per system, you have two to the n states for n

16:47.900 --> 16:54.620
systems and meaning that the number of states doubles every time you add one more particle.

16:54.620 --> 16:58.460
And you have a nice video about that demonstrating that and the usefulness of that in quantum

16:58.460 --> 16:59.460
computing.

16:59.460 --> 17:02.060
Each qubit itself is doubling.

17:02.060 --> 17:04.680
So you have to think of that number of doublings each time.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.460
These are basically the four quantum effects.

17:06.460 --> 17:10.140
The hope is really that everybody will know them because they've really been utilized

17:10.220 --> 17:17.140
for metrology, being utilized now for computing, utilized for gravitational waves, MRI, lasers,

17:17.140 --> 17:20.940
etc., but really all four are necessary for modern quantum technologies.

17:23.940 --> 17:27.340
It's a superposition of waves on that string.

17:27.340 --> 17:32.220
This string can be in a range of different types, variety of different types of molds

17:32.220 --> 17:33.900
of oscillation, waves of vibrating.

17:33.900 --> 17:37.580
They've never written it onto this file, but it's left the rest of this file intact

17:37.580 --> 17:39.180
because it's not truncated the file.

17:39.180 --> 17:40.220
It's really truncated.
