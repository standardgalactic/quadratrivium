1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Most children don't even know what the traditional virtues are, courage, for example.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,160
These are virtues, these are things that you can actually cultivate as habits.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,920
And because education is supposed to be value neutral,

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,720
and you know, it's left to people's religion or private conscience or family or something,

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:24,280
most people don't get any religious teaching anymore at home or in a church or anywhere else.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:31,080
And some school teachers would be afraid to teach any of these things for fear of being accused

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,600
of imposing their personal subjective values or ideology on children.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,720
So the result is there's a kind of moral vacuum.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,880
And it's very harmful, I think.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,880
Welcome to Rethinking Education.

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Education's critical friend.

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,880
Rupert Sheldrake, welcome to the Rethinking Education podcast.

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,880
Good to be with you.

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,880
It's great to have you with me. It's making me smile, sort of, saying that out loud,

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,880
because I've been very immersed in your books recently.

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,880
I've read a few of them and listened to quite a few, and I've listened to quite a few of your podcasts

17
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,880
and other podcasts that you've been on.

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,880
And so it feels a little bit surreal to be speaking with you.

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,880
So it's lovely to be able to spend some time.

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,880
So I reached out because I've been, as I say, I've been reading lots of your work and really enjoying it.

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,880
And there were a couple of books that you wrote quite recently, one called Science and Spiritual Practices

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,880
and Ways to Go Beyond and Why They Work.

23
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,880
And although they don't really speak directly to education,

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,880
it feels to me like there are some sorts of educational implications to the things that you're writing about.

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,880
And so I'm quite curious to see where this conversation goes, but yeah, we'll see what happens.

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,880
But what I often like to do in this podcast is to get to know the guests,

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,880
and obviously for our listeners and viewers to get to know you if they're not familiar with you.

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,880
So could you please firstly just give a very sort of brief introduction to yourself

29
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,880
for anybody who may not be aware of your work so far?

30
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:26,880
I'm a biologist and I spent my, almost my entire career as a practicing scientist.

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,880
I was educated at Cambridge to start with.

32
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,880
I did history and philosophy of science at Harvard.

33
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Then I did a PhD in Plant Biochemistry at Cambridge and I was a Don and Director of Studies,

34
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,880
a fellow of Clare College in Cambridge.

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,880
So I had a kind of academic science training and practice.

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Then I felt I wanted a rather more adventurous life than just going on being a Don at Cambridge.

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,880
And I had a job in India in an International Agricultural Institute,

38
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,880
working on the improvement of chickpeas and pigeon peas.

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,880
I was called the principal plant physiologist and I was running field experiments

40
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,880
and working with a team on crop improvement plant breeding

41
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,880
to improve agriculture for some of the poorest farmers in the world.

42
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,880
When I was in India, I was got very interested in Indian traditions.

43
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,880
I did yoga and meditation.

44
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,880
I had a Sufi teacher for a while in Hyderabad, which is where I lived.

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,880
And then one is at Cambridge, I had an idea called Morphic Resonance.

46
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,880
I'll come back to that, the idea of memory and nature.

47
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
I wanted to write a book on it.

48
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,880
So I left my job for a while and lived two years in an ashram,

49
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:56,880
a Christian Benedictine ashram on the bank of a sacred river in Tamil Nadu in South India.

50
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,880
So I lived in this, I had a very happy time living in this, very simply in this community.

51
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Then I came back to England basically and worked part-time in India.

52
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,880
My first book, A New Science of Life, came out in 1981, was quite controversial.

53
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Since then I've been doing research, mainly in biology,

54
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,880
but also in rather underexplored areas of psychology, including parapsychology.

55
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,880
I've written quite a number of books.

56
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,880
I'm still very active in scientific research.

57
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,880
I think six or seven papers last year in peer-reviewed scientific journals.

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,880
I'm working on two or three more at the moment.

59
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,880
So I'm very active in this area.

60
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Right, thank you. That's really interesting.

61
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,880
So yeah, you're right. We will come back to that stuff later on.

62
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,880
I think that it makes sense, in your case, to start at the beginning.

63
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,880
And so I'd like to take you back to your own experience of school.

64
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Where did you go to school? What kind of school did you go to?

65
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,880
I was born and bred in Newarkon Trent in Nottinghamshire.

66
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,880
And my father was a pharmacist and a herbalist.

67
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,880
And when I was born in 1942, and so soon after the war,

68
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,880
he and a group of other parents set up an independent school,

69
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,880
because they didn't think that the state one was very good,

70
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,880
and started an independent day school, a primary school,

71
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,880
which I went to called Highfields, called Newark Preparatory School.

72
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,880
So I think I was well taught in sort of basic education there,

73
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,880
sort of all the basic things you do at primary school.

74
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,880
And then at the age of 10, when I've done the 11 plus and so on,

75
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,880
but my parents sent me to a boarding prep school,

76
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,880
which was the preparatory school for works on college,

77
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,880
an independent school in Nottinghamshire.

78
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,880
So I was at this prep school called Ranby House for three years,

79
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,880
which being away from home at the age of 10 seemed normal at the time,

80
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,880
but now I think of it as really rather odd.

81
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,880
And then I was an all boys boarding school,

82
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,880
works on college, 50 boys sleeping in the same room,

83
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,880
in a big dormitory, somewhat military type discipline,

84
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,880
corporal punishment, compulsory cadet force,

85
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,880
compulsory rugby six days a week, whatever the weather.

86
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,880
So it was a classic minor public school,

87
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,880
authoritarian, disciplinarian, fagging, prefects,

88
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,880
you know, all that sort of thing.

89
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,880
And how did you find that?

90
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Because for lots of people now,

91
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,880
that would sound just horrendously austere

92
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,880
and that it might be considered to be borderline abusive.

93
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Yes, well, I just took it for granted.

94
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
This is how it was.

95
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,880
This is in the 1950s.

96
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,880
I left school in 1959.

97
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,880
And at the time, most schools had corporal punishment

98
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,880
and boarding schools.

99
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,880
Basically, it was soon after the war.

100
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,880
Many of the masters, it was a boys-only school.

101
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,880
Many of the masters had been in the war,

102
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,880
you know, the army or the air force.

103
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,880
And so there was definitely this post-war feeling about it

104
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,880
and discipline was important, you know.

105
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,880
And so, well, I didn't particularly like all that

106
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,880
and it didn't suit me temperamentally very well.

107
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,880
The emphasis in the school was on the highest prestige.

108
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,880
Went to boys who were good at rugby and games

109
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,880
and it was rather anti-intellectual, the atmosphere.

110
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,880
I got very well taught, though,

111
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,880
because most of the teachers,

112
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,880
when they found someone who was actually interested

113
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,880
in learning and curious and wanted to know more,

114
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,880
which I did,

115
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,880
they responded in a way that I felt had got a really good teaching

116
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,880
from really good teachers.

117
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,880
So I felt I was very well taught there.

118
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,880
The social atmosphere of the school and stuff

119
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
didn't suit me very well.

120
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,880
You know, I wasn't very keen on compulsory rugby

121
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,880
on days when it was, the ground was frozen.

122
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
And when you were tackled,

123
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,880
you sort of, the frozen earth cut into causing bleeding and stuff.

124
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
I mean, all that stuff.

125
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
It was designed to toughen us up.

126
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,880
And into building they would have called it, hey.

127
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Yes, they called it character building, yes.

128
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
And toughening us up.

129
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
And I think it did toughen me up.

130
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,880
You know, a lot of things in life after that

131
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,880
seemed pretty mild by comparison with school.

132
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
However, once I got,

133
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
I won a scholarship to Cambridge

134
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
and in those days,

135
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
you had to stay on for a third year in the sixth form

136
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,880
to do Cambridge scholarship or entrance exams.

137
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
But as soon as I got that,

138
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,880
I left and I got a job in London as a lab technician

139
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,880
and like a gap here before I went to Cambridge.

140
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,880
So, you know, I had a kind of classic education

141
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,880
of that very old fashioned or boys type.

142
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Yes.

143
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,880
And was it always going to be science for you?

144
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Was it science from a young age?

145
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Yes.

146
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,880
My father was an amateur microscopist.

147
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,880
He had a microscope lab at home.

148
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
He taught me the names of plants.

149
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,880
I kept lots of pets, animals, tortoises, pigeons,

150
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,880
a rabbit, mice, hamster, a jack door.

151
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,880
You know, I had a lot of animals,

152
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
pets, budgerigars.

153
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
We had a dog.

154
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,880
So, I was very really into plants and animals.

155
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,880
That's why I did biology.

156
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,880
And then through my, actually,

157
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,880
a kind of brought out kind of rebellious streak in me

158
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,880
because I noticed that the first thing we did

159
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,880
in biology classes was to kill things we were studying

160
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
and then cut them up.

161
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,880
There was a lot of dissection in those days in biology.

162
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
And then the job I had in the lab,

163
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
I was so keen to get experience.

164
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,880
I wanted to be a scientist, lab experience.

165
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
For my gap, nine months,

166
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
I wrote round various drug companies saying,

167
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
who got a job for a temporary lab technician?

168
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,880
And one of them wrote back and said,

169
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,880
yes, someone's just left.

170
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,880
And so I got the job.

171
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,880
And then I found I was the most junior technician

172
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,880
in a vivisection facility.

173
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,880
And it was my job to gas all the animals that survived

174
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,880
the experimentation and toxicity tests at the end of every day.

175
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,880
And so I was basically operating a gas oven

176
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,880
for a kind of animal holocaust,

177
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,880
which was appalling because I'd gone and loved animals.

178
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
And so it set up a tension in me

179
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,880
between kind of mechanistic science.

180
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,880
Animals are just machines.

181
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Plants are just machines.

182
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,880
We're just objectively dealing with mechanisms.

183
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
And the fact I actually loved animals,

184
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
that's why I was doing biology.

185
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
So it made me much more questioning

186
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
of what I was taught when I got to Cambridge

187
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
than I might otherwise have been.

188
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
Yeah, interesting.

189
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
I had a very similar experience.

190
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
I worked as a lab technician while I was at university.

191
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
And it was in a very sort of non-scientific role,

192
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,880
but it was a lab at UCL where...

193
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Actually, that was when I very first saw you

194
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,880
because you did a talk at UCL back in the 90s.

195
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,880
But yeah, I had to go and collect the animals

196
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,880
from the animal house and dispose of their carcasses.

197
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,880
And I used to see them on electrophysiology rigs,

198
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
like a wrap with its sort of brain open

199
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
and loads of wires going into it.

200
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
And it's sort of anesthetized.

201
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
And it's really just...

202
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,880
I don't even know what word you could describe.

203
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,880
It's sort of just grotesque.

204
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,880
It's really an unpleasant thing to see happening.

205
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
And in just such an everyday thing,

206
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,880
you just go through dozens of animals a day in that way.

207
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,880
Exactly. Well, you see, there's something about the...

208
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,880
It was like a rite of passage.

209
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,880
I mean, like medical students at university, you have to dissect.

210
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,880
I think they still do it, dissect a human corpse.

211
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,880
It forces you to become emotionally detached

212
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,880
in a way that most biologists and medics

213
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
have done something they've gone through,

214
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,880
produces this kind of unnaturally detached attitude to life,

215
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,880
which is necessary if you're going to have a mechanistic theory of life.

216
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Well, even if you're a non-mechanistic doctor,

217
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
it's good to know the anatomy.

218
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,880
And I suppose doing dissections is the best way of learning it.

219
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,880
But anyway, for me, this was...

220
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
It plays an important part.

221
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
I liked the practical exams on the whole.

222
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
I liked practical...

223
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
I mean, practical, lab practicals in physics and chemistry very much,

224
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,880
because I really enjoyed learning through doing.

225
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,880
And there's less of that in science education now than there used to be.

226
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,880
But learning through doing seems to be really, really important.

227
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
And science was almost the only thing,

228
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
apart from physical education,

229
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,880
where you could learn through doing when I was at school.

230
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Yes. Yeah, absolutely.

231
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,880
It's something that I resonate with as a former science teacher.

232
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,880
We just had this brief conversation before we started recording.

233
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,880
But yeah, the learning through doing...

234
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
The kids would love practicals.

235
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
They would always turn up to a lesson and say,

236
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
oh, we're doing a practical today.

237
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,880
And then your heart would think, well, you are doing a practical.

238
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,880
But that practical involves following a series of five instructions.

239
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
And there's no mystery in it.

240
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,880
It's not really learning by experientially finding stuff out.

241
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
It's just that you're following a preset procedure,

242
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
and then you need to wash your equipment away

243
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,880
and go and write it up in this pre-specified way.

244
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,880
And so the learning by doing stuff really wasn't happening.

245
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Yeah, I agree.

246
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,880
That's not happening to the extent that it should.

247
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,880
Incidentally, the writing up thing,

248
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,880
again, the traditional way of writing scientific papers,

249
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,880
a test tube was taken, the passive voice.

250
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
I was taught to do that.

251
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
I learned how to do it.

252
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,880
But when I got to Cambridge as writing real scientific papers,

253
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,880
I found that most of my colleagues didn't do that anymore.

254
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
It had gone out of fashion.

255
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,880
But when my son Merlin, who is now a well-known mycologist,

256
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
wrote a wonderful book called Entangled Life.

257
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Yes, Merlin.

258
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,880
It's a school here in Hampstead at University College School.

259
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,880
He wrote brilliant science reports when he was in primary school.

260
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
He got to secondary school.

261
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
They were all written.

262
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,880
They actually said a test tube was taken.

263
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,880
It was carefully heated with the substance in it,

264
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
and then smelled.

265
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,880
And so, you know, as if some disembodied being had smelled it.

266
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,880
And so I said, Tim, why is your science report written

267
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,880
in this incredibly artificial old-fashioned style?

268
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,880
Because that's where you got to write science reports.

269
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,880
And he showed me a specimen sheet his teacher had given them.

270
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
And he learned it.

271
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,880
And I then took this up with the science teacher

272
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
and said, you don't really need to do this.

273
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
You know, real scientists don't do this.

274
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
And he didn't know that.

275
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,880
He's a water relief and started teaching the active voice.

276
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,880
I then did a survey of secondary schools in Britain

277
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,880
of the heads of science, about 200 schools.

278
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,880
And of them, about 30% of state schools

279
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,880
were teaching enforcing the passive voice.

280
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,880
About 60% of independent schools.

281
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,880
And some state school teachers said, you know,

282
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,880
it's hard enough to get my students to write anything at all.

283
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
He said, so I can't force them to.

284
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Unfortunately, I can't force them to use the passive voice

285
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,880
because they wouldn't understand what it is.

286
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,880
He felt he was a failure for not enforcing the passive voice.

287
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,880
And I showed this to the president of the Royal Society,

288
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,880
Lord May, who was president at the time.

289
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
He was appalled.

290
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,880
He said, no one should be forced to write in the passive voice.

291
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
He said, in this day and age,

292
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,880
it's a sure hallmark of second grade science.

293
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,880
And nature started editing scientific papers

294
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,880
into the active voice at least 30 years ago.

295
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,880
And almost all, I did a survey of scientific journals.

296
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,880
I only found one out of 50 that insisted on the passive voice.

297
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,880
And that was a minor and rather obscure journal.

298
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Isn't it interesting?

299
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,880
And I've noticed a similar pattern.

300
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,880
I now read more social science than natural science,

301
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,880
but that same sort of format where people, for example,

302
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
if they refer to their own previous work,

303
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,880
they would say Manian 2019 wrote such and such as though Manian

304
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
was somebody else rather than me.

305
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
And it feels like you're trying to create this illusion

306
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,880
that you are an impassive pair of eyeballs or consciousness

307
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,880
that is just sort of objectively noting down reality

308
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,880
and your own situated nature is just sort of erased out

309
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
of it.

310
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,880
And it just seems like it's a ludicrous conceit

311
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,880
and that it's unhelpful, really.

312
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
It is.

313
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
It is a ludicrous conceit.

314
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,880
And I mean, science is done by people.

315
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,880
And an experiment is something you actively do.

316
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,880
It's not something that unfolds in front of you,

317
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,880
that passive observer looking at nature

318
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,880
through a plate glass window.

319
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Yeah.

320
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,880
So anyway, I think one thing that there is still,

321
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,880
I did another survey just about five years ago

322
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,880
and I found there were still a lot of teachers enforcing this,

323
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
not because they believe in it,

324
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
but because they think they ought to.

325
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,880
And I checked with all the examination boards,

326
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,880
you know, ed, Excel, you know, whatever,

327
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,880
RSA or whatever they are,

328
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
the different examination boards,

329
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Oxford and Cambridge,

330
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,880
and not one of them required passive reports.

331
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Most of them said they were neutral.

332
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
And so no one's insisting on it.

333
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Certainly journal editors aren't insisting on it.

334
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,880
And yet there are still a quite a number of science teachers

335
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
who are insisting on it.

336
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Those who gave it up as a result of our surveys

337
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,880
and an article I wrote in the school science review

338
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
and a new scientist about this,

339
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
a lot of them gave up doing it and said,

340
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
what a relief.

341
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Yeah.

342
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,880
There's a sort of, there's a new version of this one.

343
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
And there's sort of slight variation on it,

344
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,880
which is that there's this endless focus in school science

345
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,880
about independent and dependent variables

346
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
and control variables.

347
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,880
And we try to sort of to teach this from year seven upwards,

348
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
that, you know, there's the thing you change

349
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
and that's the independent variable.

350
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
And then there's the thing you measure.

351
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
That's the dependent.

352
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
And then there's the control variables.

353
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
And as an adult, it's quite easy to grasp that.

354
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
But as an 11 year old, it's really not.

355
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,880
And you spend absolutely hours and hours and hours

356
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
going over this.

357
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,880
And, you know, I later worked at Harvard Medical School

358
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
in a big multi-disciplinary lab.

359
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Nobody ever once mentioned like independent,

360
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
what's the independent variable in this?

361
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
It's just not what people,

362
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
it's just not the language that people talk about.

363
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,880
And it was just turning people off, off science.

364
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,880
And I came across a really interesting thing a while ago.

365
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,880
I don't know if you've come across a guy called Ivor Goodson,

366
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,880
who is an education social researcher.

367
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,880
And he uncovered this really interesting bit of history.

368
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,880
That was in the 19th century,

369
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,880
there was a thing called the science of common things.

370
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,880
And it was very much sort of, you know,

371
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,880
about exploring the local fauna and flora and, you know,

372
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
just doing hands-on practical stuff,

373
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
learning by doing, like you say.

374
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
And there was Lord somebody or other.

375
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
I'll send you the link to this thing

376
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
after this quality fight,

377
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,880
because it's really interesting to read.

378
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Who did a report and a survey and he went around schools

379
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,880
and he went to a school where,

380
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,880
and was speaking to this young, to this,

381
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,880
a kid not from a public school,

382
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,880
who had been doing this science of common things.

383
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,880
And he said that this child issued forth an answer

384
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,880
of such eloquence and insight

385
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,880
that far exceeded his station in life, you know,

386
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
because he was this sort of emaciated little oink

387
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
from the street corner.

388
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,880
And so he went back and wrote this report

389
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
and essentially said,

390
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,880
we need to change the language

391
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,880
and to change the way that science education is presented.

392
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,880
And it's now this sort of that is watered down version

393
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
of laboratory science,

394
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
using things like the passive voice like you say.

395
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
And there's lots of stuff about test tubes

396
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
and conical flasks and things that don't exist

397
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
in people's kitchens or lives.

398
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
And it sort of all became removed

399
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,880
and we still have that to this day, you know.

400
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
I know very much the detriment

401
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,880
of actual understanding of nature.

402
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,880
You know, one thing I mentioned,

403
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,880
you mentioned in our preliminary conversation is that,

404
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,880
you know, when learning about the stars

405
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,880
and learning about the heavens,

406
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,880
most children learn about it from textbooks

407
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,880
and there's pictures of rockets and things.

408
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
But they don't actually go out at night

409
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,880
and lie down and look at the stars.

410
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
And I suppose because it's after school hours,

411
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,880
but in the winter when, you know, it gets dark at four,

412
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,880
wouldn't be very after school hours to look at the stars.

413
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,880
And I was at an adult education centre in Canada

414
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
about 20 years ago

415
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,880
and they had a naturalist there on the staff.

416
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,880
And he said, let's do a star talk.

417
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,880
And I thought, OK, I've never been to something like this.

418
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,880
And we went out and he had blankets lay down on the beach.

419
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,880
It was near the sea and it was a nice warm evening,

420
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
clear sky.

421
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,880
And he just with a torch, a strong torch like a pointer,

422
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,880
you know, just took us through the constellations

423
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,880
and the planets.

424
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,880
I'd never had that education.

425
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,880
You know, I got a PhD in science

426
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,880
and I've never, ever had anyone explain to me the night sky.

427
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,880
And because most modern astronomy is radio astronomy

428
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,880
and it's all based on sums and calculations.

429
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,880
I was once at a party with the then astronomer royal at Cambridge

430
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,880
and there was some particularly brilliant heavenly body

431
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
that I didn't know what it was.

432
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,880
And I said to him, you know, what's that?

433
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
He's an astronomer royal.

434
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,880
He said, don't ask me, I'm only an astronomer.

435
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,880
He said, I do radio astronomy.

436
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,880
He didn't know the constellations.

437
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,880
He didn't know it.

438
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,880
No, celestial navigators, you know,

439
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,880
and even they don't learn it anymore, you know, people on yachts and things

440
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
because they've got sap naps.

441
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,880
So just learning about the stars by seeing them and being at night

442
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
and learning about plants and animals

443
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,880
and learning about the soil by digging things up and looking at roots

444
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,880
and this kind of basic learning when my children went to school,

445
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,880
this kind of thing stopped at the end of their reception year.

446
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
In reception, they had a nature table

447
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,880
and it was all right to sort of put bird's nest that had fallen out of trees there

448
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,880
and things that children had found and stuff.

449
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,880
But from then on, it was all about the body as a machine

450
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,880
and you've got to learn, you know, how the hearts of pump and that sort of thing.

451
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,880
So I think a huge amount more nature learning

452
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,880
would be really helpful.

453
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,880
I mean, because then it brings it close to real living animals and plants

454
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
which is what biology is meant to be about.

455
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Yeah, absolutely.

456
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,880
And also there's something else that we spoke about of air

457
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,880
which was about the atomized nature of the school curriculum

458
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
and we see that across the curriculum

459
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,880
where you have geography, history, art, maths, drama

460
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
as though they're all separate things

461
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,880
when actually in the world they all overlap

462
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,880
and there's very little, well, really not any interdisciplinary learning

463
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,880
that happens in schools, at least not officially.

464
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,880
There's an interdisciplinary university that's just opened up,

465
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,880
LIS, London Interdisciplinary School, which is really interesting.

466
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,880
But that's largely absent from schools.

467
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,880
But we see the same phenomenon as well within science education

468
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,880
and it often you sort of rotate around biology, chemistry and physics.

469
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,880
So you do forces one minute and then you do, you know, like the alkali metals

470
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,880
the next topic and then you're doing, you know, whatever it might be,

471
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,880
the proto-synthesis.

472
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,880
And again, it's all really atomized and sort of disconnected.

473
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,880
And I know that you've spoken before about how you describe your worldview

474
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,880
as holistic or your understanding of biology is holistic.

475
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Please, could you explain what that means

476
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,880
and how that is distinct from the sort of the mechanistic model

477
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
that you were just describing?

478
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Well, the mechanistic model which is still the dominant paradigm

479
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,880
or model of reality that's taught in science and practiced in science

480
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:46,880
is that nature is a machine that basically causes a by-pushing and pulling

481
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,880
and there's no purpose in nature, no purpose in evolution.

482
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,880
The mind's nothing but the brain, the body's a machine, the hearts a pump,

483
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,880
the lungs are like bellows, the eyes a camera, like a camera.

484
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,880
All these things are true as far as they go,

485
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,880
but it just involves looking at everything through the lens of the machine metaphor.

486
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,880
And it's only a metaphor, it's not a testable hypothesis.

487
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,880
You couldn't do an experiment that would prove or refute the idea of nature as just a machine.

488
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,880
It's just a metaphor, it's not a scientific hypothesis as such,

489
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,880
but it's become deeply embedded ever since the 17th century.

490
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,880
It's been the fundamental metaphor of science.

491
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,880
But it's not the way nature actually is.

492
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,880
And if you look at the way nature is, first of all,

493
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,880
it's obvious that animals and plants aren't machines, they're living organisms.

494
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,880
And they do have purposes, you know, if a dog's hungry it looks for food.

495
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:53,880
And it's also clear that nature's organized in a series of levels.

496
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,880
If you look at the small level then you have subatomic particles in atoms,

497
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
nuclei and electrons.

498
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,880
And then you have molecules which contain atoms in the molecule.

499
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,880
And the molecule is more than the sum of the atoms.

500
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,880
The water molecule is more than the sum of hydrogen and oxygen.

501
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,880
And then you have crystals which are more than just the molecules.

502
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,880
Ice is more, you know, especially snowflake with this beautiful six-fold symmetry,

503
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,880
is more than just hydrogen and oxygen atoms or even more than just water molecules.

504
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,880
And then when you get living cells, a cell is more than the proteins and DNA

505
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,880
and lipids and things within it.

506
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,880
And a tissue is more than just the cells because it's got more structure and organization

507
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
and organs more than the tissues.

508
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,880
An organism is more than the sum of its organs.

509
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,880
They all work together harmoniously in an overall form with overall purpose.

510
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,880
And then a group of organisms like a flock of birds or a hive of bees

511
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
is more than just individual animals.

512
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,880
It's the whole unit functions together.

513
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,880
And then ecosystems and then planets and then solar systems.

514
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,880
A solar system is more than just planets and the sun.

515
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,880
They're all working together.

516
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,880
And then a galaxy made of stars is more than just a bundle of solar systems.

517
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,880
It has a structure, a pattern.

518
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,880
So everywhere you look in nature there's levels of wholeness more than the sum of the parts.

519
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,880
And each of the parts is a whole at its own level.

520
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,880
So that's basically the holistic worldview.

521
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,880
And there are certain properties that holes have, that all holes have at all levels.

522
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
They're always more than the sum of the parts.

523
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,880
And the wholeness somehow organizes and coordinates the parts.

524
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,880
So they work together harmoniously.

525
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,880
So that, I think, is the basic way nature is constituted.

526
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,880
And when we look at it that way, then we can see physics deals with very small holes,

527
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:58,880
atoms and subatomic particles, and basic forces like gravity and light.

528
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:06,880
And also with very large things like cosmology, you know, the cosmos, galaxies, stars and stuff.

529
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Chemistry deals with sort of bigger holes than atoms and in molecules and ions and crystals and things.

530
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:23,880
And biology deals with living holes from bacteria and microorganisms up to the most sophisticated animals.

531
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,880
So I think when you look at it that way, it's easier to see how things fit together

532
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,880
and it's easier to see how there's a common pattern to the way everything's organized.

533
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:39,880
And we're used to it in, you know, when I was a child, I used to write those addresses, you know,

534
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:47,880
like our house, our street, our town, you know, Nottinghamshire, England, the United Kingdom, Europe, you know, the world.

535
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
The Altsastral Arm of the Milky Way.

536
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
Yes, yes.

537
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:58,880
So, you know, every child understands that this, and each, the higher level isn't just arbitrarily a higher level

538
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,880
as if some level's been arbitrarily promoted.

539
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,880
So it's in charge like a kind of someone who's jumped up a dictator or something.

540
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,880
It's a higher level because it actually includes the low ones.

541
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:17,880
The solar system includes all the planets within it and, you know, a tissue includes all the cells within it.

542
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,880
So these higher levels are inclusive levels of organization.

543
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Yeah, I see.

544
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:39,880
And so let's talk about, about morphic resonance and about how this sort of, as I mentioned earlier, this idea of significant learning, the big ideas that have shaped our lives.

545
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,880
I think that that's probably the one that has most shaped your life.

546
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,880
So can we, can you take us back to the origins of it? You said that you had the idea while you were at Cambridge.

547
00:30:47,880 --> 00:31:02,880
And what was the, what was the sort of the gap, if you like, in the mechanistic worldview that you thought that there's something that's missing here that you think that morphic resonance is, is an explanation as to how things are the way that they are.

548
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,880
In Cambridge, I was working on plants and plant development.

549
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:20,880
The reason I was working on plants is partly because I love plants, but also because I didn't want to spend my career guillotining rats and, and, and killing animals which research in zoology or medicine would have involved.

550
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,880
So botany or plant biochemistry were for me much more attractive fields to go into.

551
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:41,880
So I was working on how plant form develops. And I worked out, there's a, there's a hormone called auxin, AUXIN, indolacetic acid is its chemical nature, which is a key hormone in plant growth and development.

552
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:58,880
And I worked out how AUXIN is made. And I discovered it was made by dying cells, that when cells die, the proteins break down, or tonicists, they have proteolytic enzymes, and the levels of free amino acids go up because the proteins are breaking down.

553
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:09,880
And then just a amino acid destroying enzymes kick in and break those down. And one of the amino acids is tryptophan, it's present in animals and plants and bacteria.

554
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:26,880
And when it's broken down, it's transaminated or deaminated to give indolpyruvic acid. And indolpyruvic acid breaks down spontaneously or by fairly non specific oxidases to give AUXIN, indolacetic acid.

555
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:36,880
So dying cells make AUXIN. The main dying cells in plants are the wood cells, which become dead empty tubes. And as they differentiate, they produce AUXIN.

556
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:46,880
And then it's transported from the shoots towards the roots via polar AUXIN transport system. And at Cambridge, I worked out how that works too with a colleague called Philip Rubrie.

557
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:54,880
This is in textbooks now on polar AUXIN transport. We worked out the means by which it happened.

558
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:05,880
So I was very pleased and excited. And we were ahead of anyone in animal studies. We knew what the key chemical was. We knew how it was transported. We knew the chemistry of its production.

559
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,880
No one in animal development knew those kinds of things at the time.

560
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:25,880
But then I realized that it's explained too much. All plants have AUXIN and polar AUXIN transport systems, you know, ferns, conifers, palms, cabbages, roses, you know, beach trees.

561
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:33,880
And all parts of the plant have the same AUXIN production and transport system, the leaves, the flowers, the shoots, the roots.

562
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,880
Yet the leaves are different from the flowers and a beach tree is different from an ash tree.

563
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:46,880
And so this, which everyone said the molecular basis of development, everyone's hopes were pinned on AUXIN to explain it all.

564
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:54,880
And I realized it just can't explain why they're different. It explains why they're similar, why there's a coordination of the tubes that conduct water,

565
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:02,880
the right number of tubes to feed the growing leaves, etc. But it doesn't explain the specific form.

566
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Then I got interested in an idea put forward first in the 1920s of morphogenetic fields, form shaping fields,

567
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:18,880
that there are fields that shape form like an invisible mould around a developing leaf that would cause it to be a leaf shape

568
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,880
or around a developing petal that would cause it to be a petal shape.

569
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:29,880
Like a magnetic field has invisible lines of force and shapes the space around it.

570
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:36,880
The idea was that in plants and animals there are these form shaping fields which help to shape form.

571
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:43,880
And I thought they're top down, the field causes it's not just bottom up molecules bumping into each other,

572
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:54,880
somehow creating the form just from genes and proteins, which the reductionist approach still insists is the way forward.

573
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,880
But there has to be a top down organizing system, these fields.

574
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,880
So then the question is, how are these fields inherited?

575
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:12,880
Because they can't be inherited by genes, genes just code for the sequence of amino acids and proteins or for switching on and off other genes.

576
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,880
So I always thought genes were overrated. You know, I was teaching this stuff at Cambridge.

577
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,880
Sorry to interrupt. I was quite sort of pleased to hear you say that because as a biology teacher,

578
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,880
my degree was biology and psychology.

579
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,880
And I was doing it in the late 90s around the time of the Human Genome Project and there was all this fanfare.

580
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,880
And then I was teaching this stuff as a biology teacher shortly afterwards.

581
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:46,880
And protein synthesis, like you say, DNA just codes for amino acids which string together into proteins.

582
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:55,880
And how does that describe a biological organism, organ systems.

583
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:03,880
There seems to be like layers of organization that you were saying in this nested hierarchy, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms,

584
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,880
and then societal levels of that behavior and so on.

585
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:14,880
There are just the genetic explanation that this is the brain of the cell and that this controls all of life.

586
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,880
There's just lots and lots of leaps in that chain of explanation.

587
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:28,880
Exactly. It doesn't make sense when you think it through, but most people still take it for granted.

588
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,880
So anyway, when I was trying to think how could these be inherited, they couldn't be inherited through genes.

589
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:44,880
And I didn't think they could be eternal mathematical equations because, you know, biology is all about evolution and changes with time.

590
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:53,880
So some biologists, theoretical biologists who switch from being mathematicians, believe that everything is governed by eternal mathematical laws.

591
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:00,880
And mathematicians tend to be Platonists. They believe that out there there's a kind of eternal mathematical realm on which everything depends.

592
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:08,880
So I couldn't believe that dinosaurs had eternal dinosaur equations there at the moment of the Big Bang and still present today,

593
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,880
but, you know, it was only a matter of accident or chance that dinosaurs actually existed.

594
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,880
You know, this way of thinking that it's all about the maths didn't appeal to me.

595
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,880
So then I thought, well, how could they be inherited?

596
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:31,880
And at that stage I read a book by the French philosopher Henri Bergson called Matter and Memory, written in 1898 or 96,

597
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:39,880
where he argued that memories are not stored in the brain and that there's a kind of causation, a memory causation, directly across time,

598
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,880
not necessarily anything in between.

599
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,880
And then I realized that if there was a kind of resonance across time,

600
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,880
each organism could have a kind of collective memory of form and of instinct,

601
00:37:51,880 --> 00:38:04,880
and that many mysteries to do with instinct, inheritance, and indeed memory itself, collective memory, would be explainable.

602
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,880
So this was my hypothesis of morphic resonance.

603
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,880
The idea is that at each level the wholeness is governed by a field, an organizing field.

604
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,880
The generic name for these is morphic fields.

605
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,880
Morphic means form, so as to do with fields of form.

606
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,880
And that these fields of form got their structure through a kind of memory from previous similar systems.

607
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:31,880
So a giraffe morphogenetic field be like an invisible blueprint for a giraffe,

608
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,880
and giraffe embryo would grow in accordance with it.

609
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,880
That field would be like a collective memory of the actual form of past giraffes.

610
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:47,880
So basically, in its general form, this idea is that the so-called laws of nature are actually more like habits.

611
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,880
There's a memory in nature.

612
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,880
Just in case anybody, because the first time you hear this idea, the first time you come across it,

613
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,880
it sounds like it's so far removed from the mechanistic understanding that, like you say,

614
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,880
most people sort of accept without really thinking about it, that it's hard to grasp.

615
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:13,880
Could you share just a couple of sort of examples of what types of phenomena we see in reality

616
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,880
that this field, this idea of morphogenetic fields, explains in a way that materialist,

617
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,880
sort of billiard ball, nuts and bolts, science doesn't.

618
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Well, for example, the theory predicts that if you train lab rats to learn a new trick in London,

619
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,880
then as soon as they've learned it in London, similar rats all around the world in America,

620
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,880
in Australia, in India and elsewhere would be able to learn the same trick quicker,

621
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,880
just because the rats here have learned it by morphic resonance, kind of collective memory.

622
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,880
And there's actually evidence that happens.

623
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:58,880
And to put it even more close to home, the theory predicts that when the wordal puzzle,

624
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,880
the five-letter wordal puzzle, is published every morning by the New York Times,

625
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,880
as the day goes on, as millions of people solve this particular five-letter puzzle,

626
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,880
it should get easier to solve.

627
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,880
So it should be easier to solve the wordal puzzle in the evening than it is in the morning,

628
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
other things being equal.

629
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,880
And there's an MSc student actually doing a project on wordal from this point of view as we speak,

630
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,880
you know, as a test for morphic resonance.

631
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,880
In the realm of chemistry, it means if you make a new chemical for the first time and you crystallize it,

632
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,880
there won't be a morphic field for that crystal lattice structure before,

633
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,880
it hasn't happened before in the universe, as far as we know.

634
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,880
You may wait years before one appears.

635
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,880
Often it takes months or years to get a thing to crystallize.

636
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,880
Once it's crystallized, it should be easier for that chemical to crystallize all over the world.

637
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:01,880
And actually, there's many examples from chemistry of where compounds are very difficult to crystallize,

638
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,880
but once they've started crystallizing, they get easier all over the world.

639
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,880
And chemists usually say, well, yes, of course that happens,

640
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,880
but it happens because fragments of previous crystals nucleate the crystallizations elsewhere

641
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,880
because they get wafted around the world as invisible dust particles.

642
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,880
So what I'm saying is that filter out invisible dust particles,

643
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,880
it should still happen because of morphic resonance.

644
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,880
So basically, the so-called laws of nature, I'm saying are more like habits.

645
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,880
And although in the West, this is a very hard idea for people to grasp,

646
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,880
when I was working in India, I already was thinking about morphic resonance.

647
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,880
When I explained it to my Hindu colleagues, instead of shock and horror or just puzzlement,

648
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,880
they said, oh, of course, that is the way nature is.

649
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:55,880
The influence of the past, Hindu and Buddhist philosophy has this idea of a memory in nature.

650
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,880
That's just standard.

651
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,880
I'd meet people on trains in India after they ask you what is your name,

652
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,880
whereas your family, that kind of thing.

653
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,880
They then start on what is your view of the world or the universe.

654
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,880
Indians like these conversations and got train journeys lasting hours.

655
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,880
So I'd explain about morphic resonance and almost always people would just say, oh, yes,

656
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,880
that is what we think.

657
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,880
We've always thought that, our philosophy and so on.

658
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,880
So it was far from shocking in India.

659
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:36,880
And it's a peculiarity of our Western world view that this has got bakes in to science.

660
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
Yeah, it's interesting.

661
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,880
And lots of the questions that you ask seem to me to be just really reasonable questions.

662
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:50,880
For example, in the science delusion and in your TED talk, which was famously banned,

663
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,880
you were talking about Big G, the gravitational constant and how the accepted value of Big G,

664
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,880
considered to be a universal constant, the value for it has fluctuated over time quite considerably.

665
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,880
And the official argument is that we've just got better at measuring it and that that's instrument errors

666
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,880
rather than you're suggesting that, well, what if Big G is actually fluctuating,

667
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:21,880
which just seems like a really reasonable question to ask, but people seem to be outraged by the question even.

668
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,880
Yes.

669
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,880
Well, I mean, some people are intrigued by it, but people who people who've made science into a kind of religion,

670
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:37,880
scientism, you know, people who've made Richard Dawkins is an example of someone who's made science into a kind of religion.

671
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,880
They're usually militant atheists.

672
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:50,880
And, you know, lots of atheists who aren't militant and but the militant type tend to be believers in scientism.

673
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,880
And it's become for them a belief system as part of their identity and any challenge to it makes them angry.

674
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:04,880
I get this reaction a lot, of course, because I do a lot of challenging of it.

675
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:12,880
But whether you see with Big G, yes, they get more and more precise and the measurements they publish have these tiny error bars.

676
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,880
But then when someone else comes along with a precise measurement with tiny error bars and it's somewhere up here,

677
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,880
you know, then you know what's going on.

678
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:30,880
So my proposal was simply instead of publishing the average value from a lab over months or years, they published the raw data.

679
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:37,880
And it could be that all around the world on a particular day, Big G is higher and all around the world, it may be lower on another day.

680
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:44,880
Yeah, because isn't there some sort of a there's a they call metrologist, the people who collect all these measurements and then they do do stuff to the data.

681
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,880
They average it out and they do sort of adjustments to take account of what they think is real and what's not.

682
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,880
And so you arrive at this figure that like you say it's not it's not raw data.

683
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,880
No, no, it's not raw data.

684
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:04,880
It's average in each lab and then there's an international committee averages for the ones from different labs around the world, waiting ones that they think are more valid.

685
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,880
If it comes from Cambridge or Harvard and counts more than if it comes from the Ivory Coast or something.

686
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:19,880
So, so they end up with these average values and next time the committee meets in five years time, the average values are different.

687
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:28,880
So they're always changing them and in those handbooks of physical constants, which are constantly being updated, they have the new values of the constants.

688
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:36,880
So my point was not that, you know, just simply that what if the earth as it travels through space.

689
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,880
Maybe there's, you know, some physicists now believe in dark matter mysterious matter.

690
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,880
We don't know what it is.

691
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,880
What if we pass through a cloud of dark matter.

692
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:53,880
This would affect measurements of G and maybe it's telling us something about the earth's environment is moved through space.

693
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,880
But by refusing to look at the fluctuations because it's got to be a constant.

694
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,880
This is just narrowing down science and that's why in my book, the science delusion.

695
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:14,880
I take the 10 fundamental dogmas and turn them into questions and say, well, what happens if we look at these scientifically instead of just saying they must be true.

696
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,880
Yeah.

697
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,880
And then science opens up it gets so much more interesting.

698
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:26,880
My favorite question is that book in that book is there's a chapter on on consciousness.

699
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:34,880
And you were talking about that materialist philosophers and people like Daniel Dennett who who wrote consciousness explained but it was really sort of consciousness explained away.

700
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,880
They said that it's just, you know, it's not really a thing.

701
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,880
It's just, it's just, you know, it's almost like a Darwinian.

702
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:47,880
You know that there are things that we attend to and the stream of attention is just the stream of winners in that Darwinian race.

703
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,880
But there's nothing really to see here. And that it again that it's just this sort of explain in that billiard ball mechanism.

704
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:01,880
And at the end of that, that chapter you ask a question and you say so do you think that your views on materialism on your views on consciousness.

705
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:10,880
I determined on this billiard ball level or do you feel like you've arrived at them through reason and argument and creativity and what have you.

706
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,880
And it's a really, really good question.

707
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:24,880
Because, you know, they don't seem to be applying the same the same principles to what it is to be a materialist it seems to it seems to it sort of eats itself.

708
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:34,880
You see what they they managed to imagine that they're on the side of this plate glass windows and objective observer of reality somehow detached from it.

709
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,880
And they were taught to write in the passive voice.

710
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,880
A disembodied mind. Yes.

711
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,880
But somehow everything else is mechanistic and materialist and stuff, except for them.

712
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,880
People like them.

713
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:59,880
I think that's one reason why Stephen Hawking became so iconic for people who are not scientists and indeed for scientists because he was the closest you can get through no fault of his own.

714
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:06,880
But through his own misfortune, he was the closest you can get to a disembodied mind as a human.

715
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:13,880
And he became iconic of the scientific quest on his book a brief history of time on the dust jacket.

716
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:24,880
Time magazine is quoted by saying, even as he sits helpless in his wheelchair, his mind soars through space and time to unlock the mysteries of the universe.

717
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:40,880
So the idea that a disembodied mind could somehow saw through space and time to unlock the mysteries from a vantage point outside nature, somehow a God's eye view is somehow baked into the view.

718
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,880
So it's not consistent.

719
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:53,880
I mean, from the point of view of science education, you know, I think the questions that I deal with in the science of delusion be really good questions.

720
00:48:53,880 --> 00:49:01,880
The trouble is that no science teacher I know has taken them up in school because it's not on the national curriculum.

721
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:10,880
It probably do more harm than good to, you know, a level rankings or or GCSE rankings so they don't do it.

722
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:22,880
I do occasionally I'm asked to talk about these things in schools and the last two or three years, the school that's most into what I'm doing and where I've given talks are is eaten.

723
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,880
And I've dressed the whole of the low six that eaten for the last few years on the science delusion.

724
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,880
And they're really up for it there.

725
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:43,880
Whereas when I've tried to do this at other schools, you know, people are frightened of disorienting the children or confusing them or they've got enough confidence at eating to do this.

726
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,880
I don't talk at eating because I'm in favor of hyper privilege.

727
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,880
I do it because it's the only schools.

728
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:58,880
Oh, I was just wondering I'd like to come back to the educational implications of those books that I mentioned earlier but just just while we're on this.

729
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:11,880
How have you found it. I wondered a few times as I've been sort of reading your work you said earlier that you know the toughness of being a very very austere school that was nothing compared to what came later.

730
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:22,880
You know, for example, you know, we talked about your Ted talk, you know, attracting controversy, your book that you said that was described as a, there was a review in nature wasn't there that said a book for burning.

731
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,880
Yes.

732
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,880
Your ideas are considered.

733
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,880
Sorry, what was that.

734
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,880
It was an editorial on the front page.

735
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:43,880
Yes. And, and I wonder how you found that like it kind of been easy to have to have sort of had your ideas received in such a sort of an aggressive way.

736
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:51,880
Well, you know, first I felt this was completely unjust because I played science by the rules I publish all my stuff in peer reviewed journals.

737
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:57,880
I, you know, I make rational arguments and stuff and I prepared to debate them with anyone.

738
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:14,880
And so, you know, I thought I'm playing by the rules and then suddenly I found that actually the rules don't apply if you try and challenge some of these dogmas, you know, it's so the editor of nature basically said that my work should be, you know, in the end he said the book shouldn't be burned but

739
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:23,880
put in protected shelf of the library and that he compared unfavorably with other dangerous books like mine camp by Hitler.

740
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:34,880
I mean, that was his, then basically what he was trying to do was ex communicate me and the result is from then on I couldn't get a grant, I couldn't get a job.

741
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:42,880
And whenever I was invited to give talks and universities, whoever invited me always had a problem with people who tried to cancel me.

742
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,880
I've been cancelled many times.

743
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,880
Cancel culture is nothing new, it's been going on in science for decades.

744
00:51:48,880 --> 00:52:02,880
And so anyway, at first I found this rather annoying and I just thought it was unfair, you know, because I was playing the game by the rules and they weren't and yet they claimed to be upholding the rules of proper science.

745
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,880
Then I came to see that actually these are not evil people.

746
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,880
These are people who just really believe that they know the truth.

747
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:14,880
They believe that science has revealed the mechanistic sciences revealed the truth.

748
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:22,880
All other approaches to truth like religion, philosophy, etc. are, you know, muddled superstitious old fashioned.

749
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:29,880
The only thing that's right up there with the leading edge of human understanding is science and they really believe in this.

750
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:41,880
They're basically fanatics or bigots because of their belief system, not because they've been bribed by drug companies, not because they're conspiracies, but they really believe it.

751
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,880
And they're really fighting for the truth.

752
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,880
The only trouble is they have such a narrow view of the truth.

753
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,880
So I'm in favor of fighting for the truth.

754
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:56,880
But I just think it's a shame if one fights for a half truth or a partial truth.

755
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,880
Yes. Yeah, I mean, thank you for that.

756
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,880
He always strikes me that you seem to deal with it really quite well.

757
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:17,880
You seem very sort of unflappable in the face of beliefs of contradicting views and you sort of say, well, you know, here's what we were talking earlier about that fascinating conversation that you had with with Daniel Dennett and Oliver Sacks.

758
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:25,880
Stephen Jay Gould, Stephen Jay Gould, five or six of you sitting around a table that is about a three and a half hour video on YouTube.

759
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:32,880
It's really, really interesting and it's worth but you really sort of hold yourself well in those in those conversations.

760
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:41,880
And maybe those maybe all of that rugby and stuff and that character building stuff in your formative years was sort of helpful in giving you this unflappable demeanor.

761
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,880
I don't know.

762
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:52,880
Well, I think it was partly, I mean, I'm not totally unflappable, some things get at me, but not.

763
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,880
Yes, partly, I mean, partly that character building stuff, I think has actually served me in good stead.

764
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,880
Partly, you know, I'm a Christian and I pray.

765
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:08,880
I used to be an atheist when I was converted to mechanistic materialism as a teenager.

766
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:17,880
But, you know, one of the big things about the Lord's Prayer, which I say every day is, you know, forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us.

767
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:25,880
Well, I definitely think some people have trespassed against me through these kinds of unfair attacks.

768
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,880
So I just asked for the grace not to keep these burning resentments.

769
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,880
I mean, resentment is a kind of corrosive thing.

770
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,880
It corrodes the soul.

771
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,880
And so every day I just try and let go.

772
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,880
And, you know, if you pray for the grace to do it, I find it's much easier to do.

773
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:51,880
So I don't wake up in the morning feeling resentful and angry and it's just a much nicer way of living.

774
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:57,880
And it's also effective in dealing with people who are against what I'm saying.

775
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:03,880
It's more effective not to get angry. It's much more effective to try and discuss it with them.

776
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:16,880
And I studied martial arts at one stage and I like the idea of sort of going with the flow of what they're saying and trying to take it further, you know, so that it rather than opposing it.

777
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,880
Yes.

778
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:26,880
I, you know, when you compare the sort of brute force method of American football with Japanese martial arts, you know, it's a very different style.

779
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,880
And I prefer the martial arts style.

780
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,880
Absolutely. Be like water and all that.

781
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:44,880
And yes, and lots of those the practices that you write in those two more recent books that you that you wrote, science and spiritual practices and ways to go beyond and why they work.

782
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:56,880
I imagine have sort of been very helpful for you as well and they're all they're all practices that you engage in and I know we've only got a couple of minutes to end on just for the benefit of viewers and listeners.

783
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:03,880
There's a number of these ideas you talk about meditation, fasting, interacting with animals and so on.

784
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:17,880
There was one chapter that I think really triggered me in terms of reaching out to you and that was the chapter on cultivating good habits about virtues and about, you know, the sort of these universal ideas around around how to be a good person.

785
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:27,880
And I don't know whether you have any sort of this is a bit of a vague final question but what are your thoughts and I know that you mentioned pilgrimages as well earlier.

786
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:40,880
I just wanted to sort of just to land on a on an educational note. What do you think that education that we should be doing more of or less of in education to cultivate these, these good habits.

787
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:53,880
Well, in the traditional education in middle ages, you know, the people were taught that vices and virtues are habits basically their habits that habits you acquire and they become unconscious.

788
00:56:53,880 --> 00:57:05,880
And the seven deadly sins, the worst vices, you know, cultivating greed, envy, lust, gluttony, avarice, pride, and so on anger.

789
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:16,880
These are bad things to cultivate. And yet the modern advertising industry and social media actually make things like greed and envy virtues and anger and stuff.

790
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:29,880
And then they taught you the good things to cultivate the virtues, you know, including prudence, temperance, wisdom, you know, love, faith, hope.

791
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:35,880
So I think teaching most children don't even know what the traditional virtues are courage.

792
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:40,880
These are virtues. These are things that you can actually cultivate as habits.

793
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:49,880
And because education is supposed to be value neutral, and you know, it's left to people's religion or private conscience or family or something.

794
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:55,880
Most people don't get any religious teaching anymore at home, or in a church or anywhere else.

795
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:08,880
And, and some school teachers be afraid to teach any of these things for fear of being accused of imposing their personal subjective values or ideology on children.

796
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:16,880
So the result is there's a kind of moral vacuum. And it's very harmful, I think.

797
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,880
But one thing to end on, I'd love to just mention pilgrimage, because there's something I'm very keen on.

798
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:30,880
And the revival of pilgrimage, which is going on all over Europe at the moment, and here in Britain through the British Pilgrimage Trust,

799
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:41,880
is reopening ancient footpath pilgrimage routes, walking through the countryside on footpaths to holy places, which can be springs, wells, mountain tops,

800
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:49,880
and also our great cathedrals and churches and, and or pre-Christian stone circles and so on.

801
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:58,880
That it's a wonderful thing to do. I do it myself, and I did it every year with a godson, a teenage godson, until recently when he stopped being a teenager.

802
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:10,880
Every year we went on a one day pilgrimage, five or six miles through the countryside to one of the great cathedrals, Lincoln, Wells, Ely, Winchester.

803
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:20,880
Each year we did a different cathedral. And now one of the things the British Pilgrimage Trust is doing is trying to open up the idea of school pilgrimages.

804
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:30,880
There's a few schools that already do them. There's a school near here in London where I live. In year three, their teacher, their religious teacher,

805
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:39,880
who's also Anglican priest, takes them to Westminster Abbey. Year four, St Paul's. Year five, they spend three days at Walsingham in Norfolk,

806
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:47,880
and visit the shrine of Our Lady, and they walk barefoot. 30% of these children are Muslim. They love going on these pilgrimages.

807
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:59,880
And then year five, six, they go to St Albans Cathedral. And the chap who leads this, who's called Father Graham, is very...

808
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:05,880
He's quite charismatic with the children, and he says the children absolutely love it, because it's learning by doing.

809
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:12,880
They're learning about history. They're learning about nature. They're learning about sacred places.

810
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,880
When they get there, they light a candle and say a prayer, their own prayer, whatever they want to pray for.

811
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:23,880
And he says, when he goes to Walsingham, sometimes he sees school groups there where they're dressed up in fake medieval outfits,

812
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:32,880
pretending to be pilgrims. And he says that his children find it so much more satisfying, because they actually are pilgrims.

813
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:40,880
And I think that school pilgrimage is a wonderful educational, experiential way of learning, and it's fun.

814
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,880
So I'm really keen on that at the moment.

815
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:52,880
There's a website called BritishPilgrimage.org, which gives all these different routes.

816
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:59,880
So if anyone's interested, they can look at that, and they can get in touch too, because there's a coordinator now

817
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,880
who's helping to coordinate school pilgrimages.

818
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:10,880
Right. Thank you for that. I'll look into it, and I'll put a link to it in the show notes and recommend it to my school-based friends.

819
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:18,880
And thank you for that as well, because I think it was a recent podcast that I heard, the podcast you do with Mark Vernon.

820
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,880
Is it Mark?

821
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,880
Yes.

822
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:29,880
And there's quite a few about these issues, and about just how sort of hidden, how forgotten and in decline churches are,

823
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,880
and people don't go to churches, don't go to cathedrals, don't go to even song, there are all these amazing things.

824
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:41,880
And I've started to re-engage with those things in my local community, so thank you for that, because it's really opened things up for me.

825
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:50,880
I was raised in a Christian tradition, and then sort of like many people like yourself became a scientist later on and sort of fell out of the habit of it.

826
01:01:50,880 --> 01:02:02,880
But, you know, there's all kinds of interesting things that people do, people of faith, they sing together, they pray, they do things that are really good for you,

827
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,880
that those militant atheists are missing out on.

828
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,880
So thank you for reopening my eyes to that side of life.

829
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:17,880
Good. Well, it's great you're doing what you're doing, and I'm very pleased we had this chance to chat.

830
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,880
Yes, yeah, me too. Well, thank you very much. I know that you need to head off now.

831
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,880
So, yeah, thank you very much. I've really enjoyed this conversation.

832
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,880
All right, thanks so much for today.

833
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,880
Bye for now then, James.

834
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,880
Take care. Bye bye.

835
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:37,880
Let's do what's right and not what is right.

836
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:44,880
Let's let them, let's explore.

837
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:51,880
Let's bring back the love to get the fear of being fight.

838
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:57,880
We're forced to wreck the children as nothing wrecks the schools.

839
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:03,880
So let's rethink education.

840
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:10,880
We have a lack of agency. We're trapped inside the system.

841
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,880
So let's rethink education.

842
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:23,880
A place of transformation that embraces community.

843
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:29,880
School is the heart.

844
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:36,880
A place to dream, a place to play, a place to think and love.

845
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:45,880
Feeling free.

846
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:52,880
So let's trust, let's be brave.

847
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:58,880
Let's do what's right and not what is required.

848
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:04,880
Let's have fun, let's explore.

849
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:11,880
Let's bring back the love to get the fear of being fight.

850
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:17,880
Let's trust, let's be brave.

851
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:23,880
Let's do what's right and not what is required.

852
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:29,880
Let's have fun, let's explore.

853
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:37,880
Let's bring back the love to get the fear of being fight.

854
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:46,880
Thank you for watching.
