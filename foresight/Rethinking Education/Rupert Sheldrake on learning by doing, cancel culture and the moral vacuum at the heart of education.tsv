0	4960	Most children don't even know what the traditional virtues are, courage, for example.
4960	9160	These are virtues, these are things that you can actually cultivate as habits.
9160	12920	And because education is supposed to be value neutral,
12920	17720	and you know, it's left to people's religion or private conscience or family or something,
17720	24280	most people don't get any religious teaching anymore at home or in a church or anywhere else.
24280	31080	And some school teachers would be afraid to teach any of these things for fear of being accused
31080	36600	of imposing their personal subjective values or ideology on children.
36600	40720	So the result is there's a kind of moral vacuum.
40720	42880	And it's very harmful, I think.
45880	48880	Welcome to Rethinking Education.
49880	53880	Education's critical friend.
55880	60880	Rupert Sheldrake, welcome to the Rethinking Education podcast.
60880	62880	Good to be with you.
62880	67880	It's great to have you with me. It's making me smile, sort of, saying that out loud,
67880	71880	because I've been very immersed in your books recently.
71880	77880	I've read a few of them and listened to quite a few, and I've listened to quite a few of your podcasts
77880	79880	and other podcasts that you've been on.
79880	82880	And so it feels a little bit surreal to be speaking with you.
82880	86880	So it's lovely to be able to spend some time.
86880	93880	So I reached out because I've been, as I say, I've been reading lots of your work and really enjoying it.
93880	99880	And there were a couple of books that you wrote quite recently, one called Science and Spiritual Practices
99880	102880	and Ways to Go Beyond and Why They Work.
102880	106880	And although they don't really speak directly to education,
106880	113880	it feels to me like there are some sorts of educational implications to the things that you're writing about.
113880	120880	And so I'm quite curious to see where this conversation goes, but yeah, we'll see what happens.
120880	124880	But what I often like to do in this podcast is to get to know the guests,
124880	129880	and obviously for our listeners and viewers to get to know you if they're not familiar with you.
129880	134880	So could you please firstly just give a very sort of brief introduction to yourself
134880	138880	for anybody who may not be aware of your work so far?
138880	146880	I'm a biologist and I spent my, almost my entire career as a practicing scientist.
146880	151880	I was educated at Cambridge to start with.
151880	154880	I did history and philosophy of science at Harvard.
154880	160880	Then I did a PhD in Plant Biochemistry at Cambridge and I was a Don and Director of Studies,
160880	164880	a fellow of Clare College in Cambridge.
164880	169880	So I had a kind of academic science training and practice.
169880	176880	Then I felt I wanted a rather more adventurous life than just going on being a Don at Cambridge.
176880	180880	And I had a job in India in an International Agricultural Institute,
180880	184880	working on the improvement of chickpeas and pigeon peas.
184880	189880	I was called the principal plant physiologist and I was running field experiments
189880	194880	and working with a team on crop improvement plant breeding
194880	200880	to improve agriculture for some of the poorest farmers in the world.
200880	205880	When I was in India, I was got very interested in Indian traditions.
205880	208880	I did yoga and meditation.
208880	213880	I had a Sufi teacher for a while in Hyderabad, which is where I lived.
213880	219880	And then one is at Cambridge, I had an idea called Morphic Resonance.
219880	222880	I'll come back to that, the idea of memory and nature.
222880	224880	I wanted to write a book on it.
224880	229880	So I left my job for a while and lived two years in an ashram,
229880	236880	a Christian Benedictine ashram on the bank of a sacred river in Tamil Nadu in South India.
236880	243880	So I lived in this, I had a very happy time living in this, very simply in this community.
243880	248880	Then I came back to England basically and worked part-time in India.
248880	255880	My first book, A New Science of Life, came out in 1981, was quite controversial.
255880	259880	Since then I've been doing research, mainly in biology,
259880	265880	but also in rather underexplored areas of psychology, including parapsychology.
265880	268880	I've written quite a number of books.
268880	272880	I'm still very active in scientific research.
272880	277880	I think six or seven papers last year in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
277880	279880	I'm working on two or three more at the moment.
279880	284880	So I'm very active in this area.
284880	288880	Right, thank you. That's really interesting.
288880	292880	So yeah, you're right. We will come back to that stuff later on.
292880	296880	I think that it makes sense, in your case, to start at the beginning.
296880	301880	And so I'd like to take you back to your own experience of school.
301880	306880	Where did you go to school? What kind of school did you go to?
306880	311880	I was born and bred in Newarkon Trent in Nottinghamshire.
311880	314880	And my father was a pharmacist and a herbalist.
314880	321880	And when I was born in 1942, and so soon after the war,
321880	325880	he and a group of other parents set up an independent school,
325880	328880	because they didn't think that the state one was very good,
328880	334880	and started an independent day school, a primary school,
334880	338880	which I went to called Highfields, called Newark Preparatory School.
338880	345880	So I think I was well taught in sort of basic education there,
345880	348880	sort of all the basic things you do at primary school.
348880	355880	And then at the age of 10, when I've done the 11 plus and so on,
355880	360880	but my parents sent me to a boarding prep school,
360880	363880	which was the preparatory school for works on college,
363880	366880	an independent school in Nottinghamshire.
367880	372880	So I was at this prep school called Ranby House for three years,
372880	378880	which being away from home at the age of 10 seemed normal at the time,
378880	381880	but now I think of it as really rather odd.
381880	384880	And then I was an all boys boarding school,
384880	388880	works on college, 50 boys sleeping in the same room,
388880	393880	in a big dormitory, somewhat military type discipline,
393880	399880	corporal punishment, compulsory cadet force,
399880	404880	compulsory rugby six days a week, whatever the weather.
404880	408880	So it was a classic minor public school,
408880	415880	authoritarian, disciplinarian, fagging, prefects,
415880	417880	you know, all that sort of thing.
417880	419880	And how did you find that?
419880	421880	Because for lots of people now,
421880	424880	that would sound just horrendously austere
424880	428880	and that it might be considered to be borderline abusive.
428880	432880	Yes, well, I just took it for granted.
432880	434880	This is how it was.
434880	437880	This is in the 1950s.
437880	440880	I left school in 1959.
440880	444880	And at the time, most schools had corporal punishment
444880	447880	and boarding schools.
447880	449880	Basically, it was soon after the war.
449880	453880	Many of the masters, it was a boys-only school.
453880	456880	Many of the masters had been in the war,
456880	460880	you know, the army or the air force.
460880	465880	And so there was definitely this post-war feeling about it
465880	468880	and discipline was important, you know.
468880	473880	And so, well, I didn't particularly like all that
473880	477880	and it didn't suit me temperamentally very well.
477880	481880	The emphasis in the school was on the highest prestige.
481880	484880	Went to boys who were good at rugby and games
484880	487880	and it was rather anti-intellectual, the atmosphere.
487880	489880	I got very well taught, though,
489880	491880	because most of the teachers,
491880	494880	when they found someone who was actually interested
494880	498880	in learning and curious and wanted to know more,
498880	500880	which I did,
501880	507880	they responded in a way that I felt had got a really good teaching
507880	509880	from really good teachers.
509880	512880	So I felt I was very well taught there.
512880	515880	The social atmosphere of the school and stuff
515880	517880	didn't suit me very well.
517880	520880	You know, I wasn't very keen on compulsory rugby
520880	523880	on days when it was, the ground was frozen.
523880	524880	And when you were tackled,
524880	528880	you sort of, the frozen earth cut into causing bleeding and stuff.
528880	530880	I mean, all that stuff.
530880	532880	It was designed to toughen us up.
532880	535880	And into building they would have called it, hey.
535880	538880	Yes, they called it character building, yes.
538880	540880	And toughening us up.
540880	542880	And I think it did toughen me up.
542880	545880	You know, a lot of things in life after that
545880	548880	seemed pretty mild by comparison with school.
550880	552880	However, once I got,
552880	554880	I won a scholarship to Cambridge
554880	556880	and in those days,
556880	558880	you had to stay on for a third year in the sixth form
558880	562880	to do Cambridge scholarship or entrance exams.
562880	564880	But as soon as I got that,
564880	568880	I left and I got a job in London as a lab technician
568880	572880	and like a gap here before I went to Cambridge.
572880	575880	So, you know, I had a kind of classic education
575880	579880	of that very old fashioned or boys type.
580880	581880	Yes.
581880	583880	And was it always going to be science for you?
583880	585880	Was it science from a young age?
585880	586880	Yes.
586880	589880	My father was an amateur microscopist.
589880	591880	He had a microscope lab at home.
591880	593880	He taught me the names of plants.
593880	598880	I kept lots of pets, animals, tortoises, pigeons,
598880	603880	a rabbit, mice, hamster, a jack door.
603880	606880	You know, I had a lot of animals,
606880	608880	pets, budgerigars.
608880	610880	We had a dog.
610880	613880	So, I was very really into plants and animals.
613880	616880	That's why I did biology.
616880	619880	And then through my, actually,
619880	622880	a kind of brought out kind of rebellious streak in me
622880	625880	because I noticed that the first thing we did
625880	628880	in biology classes was to kill things we were studying
628880	630880	and then cut them up.
630880	634880	There was a lot of dissection in those days in biology.
634880	636880	And then the job I had in the lab,
636880	638880	I was so keen to get experience.
638880	641880	I wanted to be a scientist, lab experience.
641880	643880	For my gap, nine months,
643880	645880	I wrote round various drug companies saying,
645880	647880	who got a job for a temporary lab technician?
647880	649880	And one of them wrote back and said,
649880	651880	yes, someone's just left.
651880	654880	And so I got the job.
654880	657880	And then I found I was the most junior technician
657880	660880	in a vivisection facility.
660880	664880	And it was my job to gas all the animals that survived
664880	668880	the experimentation and toxicity tests at the end of every day.
668880	671880	And so I was basically operating a gas oven
671880	674880	for a kind of animal holocaust,
674880	678880	which was appalling because I'd gone and loved animals.
678880	680880	And so it set up a tension in me
680880	683880	between kind of mechanistic science.
683880	685880	Animals are just machines.
685880	687880	Plants are just machines.
687880	690880	We're just objectively dealing with mechanisms.
690880	692880	And the fact I actually loved animals,
692880	694880	that's why I was doing biology.
694880	696880	So it made me much more questioning
696880	698880	of what I was taught when I got to Cambridge
698880	700880	than I might otherwise have been.
700880	702880	Yeah, interesting.
702880	704880	I had a very similar experience.
704880	706880	I worked as a lab technician while I was at university.
706880	708880	And it was in a very sort of non-scientific role,
708880	711880	but it was a lab at UCL where...
711880	713880	Actually, that was when I very first saw you
713880	717880	because you did a talk at UCL back in the 90s.
717880	721880	But yeah, I had to go and collect the animals
721880	725880	from the animal house and dispose of their carcasses.
725880	728880	And I used to see them on electrophysiology rigs,
728880	730880	like a wrap with its sort of brain open
730880	732880	and loads of wires going into it.
732880	734880	And it's sort of anesthetized.
734880	737880	And it's really just...
737880	740880	I don't even know what word you could describe.
740880	743880	It's sort of just grotesque.
743880	748880	It's really an unpleasant thing to see happening.
748880	750880	And in just such an everyday thing,
750880	754880	you just go through dozens of animals a day in that way.
754880	757880	Exactly. Well, you see, there's something about the...
757880	759880	It was like a rite of passage.
759880	762880	I mean, like medical students at university, you have to dissect.
762880	765880	I think they still do it, dissect a human corpse.
765880	770880	It forces you to become emotionally detached
770880	775880	in a way that most biologists and medics
775880	777880	have done something they've gone through,
777880	781880	produces this kind of unnaturally detached attitude to life,
781880	786880	which is necessary if you're going to have a mechanistic theory of life.
786880	788880	Well, even if you're a non-mechanistic doctor,
788880	790880	it's good to know the anatomy.
790880	794880	And I suppose doing dissections is the best way of learning it.
794880	799880	But anyway, for me, this was...
799880	801880	It plays an important part.
801880	803880	I liked the practical exams on the whole.
803880	804880	I liked practical...
804880	808880	I mean, practical, lab practicals in physics and chemistry very much,
808880	811880	because I really enjoyed learning through doing.
811880	816880	And there's less of that in science education now than there used to be.
816880	820880	But learning through doing seems to be really, really important.
820880	822880	And science was almost the only thing,
822880	824880	apart from physical education,
824880	827880	where you could learn through doing when I was at school.
827880	830880	Yes. Yeah, absolutely.
830880	835880	It's something that I resonate with as a former science teacher.
835880	838880	We just had this brief conversation before we started recording.
838880	841880	But yeah, the learning through doing...
841880	843880	The kids would love practicals.
843880	844880	They would always turn up to a lesson and say,
844880	846880	oh, we're doing a practical today.
846880	850880	And then your heart would think, well, you are doing a practical.
850880	854880	But that practical involves following a series of five instructions.
854880	856880	And there's no mystery in it.
856880	861880	It's not really learning by experientially finding stuff out.
861880	863880	It's just that you're following a preset procedure,
864880	866880	and then you need to wash your equipment away
866880	869880	and go and write it up in this pre-specified way.
869880	874880	And so the learning by doing stuff really wasn't happening.
874880	876880	Yeah, I agree.
876880	879880	That's not happening to the extent that it should.
879880	882880	Incidentally, the writing up thing,
882880	886880	again, the traditional way of writing scientific papers,
886880	890880	a test tube was taken, the passive voice.
891880	893880	I was taught to do that.
893880	894880	I learned how to do it.
894880	897880	But when I got to Cambridge as writing real scientific papers,
897880	900880	I found that most of my colleagues didn't do that anymore.
900880	902880	It had gone out of fashion.
902880	906880	But when my son Merlin, who is now a well-known mycologist,
906880	908880	wrote a wonderful book called Entangled Life.
908880	909880	Yes, Merlin.
909880	913880	It's a school here in Hampstead at University College School.
913880	918880	He wrote brilliant science reports when he was in primary school.
918880	920880	He got to secondary school.
920880	921880	They were all written.
921880	924880	They actually said a test tube was taken.
924880	927880	It was carefully heated with the substance in it,
927880	929880	and then smelled.
929880	934880	And so, you know, as if some disembodied being had smelled it.
934880	937880	And so I said, Tim, why is your science report written
937880	941880	in this incredibly artificial old-fashioned style?
941880	943880	Because that's where you got to write science reports.
943880	947880	And he showed me a specimen sheet his teacher had given them.
947880	949880	And he learned it.
949880	952880	And I then took this up with the science teacher
952880	954880	and said, you don't really need to do this.
954880	956880	You know, real scientists don't do this.
956880	958880	And he didn't know that.
958880	962880	He's a water relief and started teaching the active voice.
962880	965880	I then did a survey of secondary schools in Britain
965880	969880	of the heads of science, about 200 schools.
969880	973880	And of them, about 30% of state schools
973880	976880	were teaching enforcing the passive voice.
976880	979880	About 60% of independent schools.
979880	982880	And some state school teachers said, you know,
982880	985880	it's hard enough to get my students to write anything at all.
985880	987880	He said, so I can't force them to.
987880	990880	Unfortunately, I can't force them to use the passive voice
990880	992880	because they wouldn't understand what it is.
992880	997880	He felt he was a failure for not enforcing the passive voice.
997880	1000880	And I showed this to the president of the Royal Society,
1000880	1004880	Lord May, who was president at the time.
1004880	1005880	He was appalled.
1005880	1008880	He said, no one should be forced to write in the passive voice.
1008880	1009880	He said, in this day and age,
1009880	1012880	it's a sure hallmark of second grade science.
1012880	1015880	And nature started editing scientific papers
1015880	1019880	into the active voice at least 30 years ago.
1019880	1022880	And almost all, I did a survey of scientific journals.
1022880	1026880	I only found one out of 50 that insisted on the passive voice.
1026880	1029880	And that was a minor and rather obscure journal.
1029880	1030880	Isn't it interesting?
1030880	1032880	And I've noticed a similar pattern.
1032880	1035880	I now read more social science than natural science,
1035880	1038880	but that same sort of format where people, for example,
1038880	1040880	if they refer to their own previous work,
1040880	1044880	they would say Manian 2019 wrote such and such as though Manian
1044880	1046880	was somebody else rather than me.
1046880	1049880	And it feels like you're trying to create this illusion
1049880	1053880	that you are an impassive pair of eyeballs or consciousness
1053880	1057880	that is just sort of objectively noting down reality
1057880	1061880	and your own situated nature is just sort of erased out
1061880	1062880	of it.
1062880	1065880	And it just seems like it's a ludicrous conceit
1065880	1068880	and that it's unhelpful, really.
1068880	1069880	It is.
1069880	1070880	It is a ludicrous conceit.
1070880	1073880	And I mean, science is done by people.
1073880	1076880	And an experiment is something you actively do.
1076880	1079880	It's not something that unfolds in front of you,
1079880	1081880	that passive observer looking at nature
1081880	1083880	through a plate glass window.
1083880	1084880	Yeah.
1084880	1088880	So anyway, I think one thing that there is still,
1088880	1091880	I did another survey just about five years ago
1091880	1094880	and I found there were still a lot of teachers enforcing this,
1094880	1096880	not because they believe in it,
1096880	1098880	but because they think they ought to.
1098880	1101880	And I checked with all the examination boards,
1101880	1105880	you know, ed, Excel, you know, whatever,
1105880	1109880	RSA or whatever they are,
1109880	1111880	the different examination boards,
1111880	1112880	Oxford and Cambridge,
1112880	1115880	and not one of them required passive reports.
1115880	1118880	Most of them said they were neutral.
1118880	1120880	And so no one's insisting on it.
1120880	1123880	Certainly journal editors aren't insisting on it.
1123880	1126880	And yet there are still a quite a number of science teachers
1126880	1128880	who are insisting on it.
1128880	1130880	Those who gave it up as a result of our surveys
1130880	1133880	and an article I wrote in the school science review
1133880	1135880	and a new scientist about this,
1135880	1137880	a lot of them gave up doing it and said,
1137880	1139880	what a relief.
1139880	1141880	Yeah.
1141880	1144880	There's a sort of, there's a new version of this one.
1144880	1146880	And there's sort of slight variation on it,
1146880	1149880	which is that there's this endless focus in school science
1149880	1152880	about independent and dependent variables
1152880	1154880	and control variables.
1154880	1158880	And we try to sort of to teach this from year seven upwards,
1158880	1160880	that, you know, there's the thing you change
1160880	1162880	and that's the independent variable.
1162880	1163880	And then there's the thing you measure.
1163880	1164880	That's the dependent.
1164880	1166880	And then there's the control variables.
1166880	1168880	And as an adult, it's quite easy to grasp that.
1168880	1170880	But as an 11 year old, it's really not.
1170880	1174880	And you spend absolutely hours and hours and hours
1174880	1175880	going over this.
1175880	1178880	And, you know, I later worked at Harvard Medical School
1178880	1180880	in a big multi-disciplinary lab.
1180880	1183880	Nobody ever once mentioned like independent,
1183880	1185880	what's the independent variable in this?
1185880	1186880	It's just not what people,
1186880	1188880	it's just not the language that people talk about.
1188880	1192880	And it was just turning people off, off science.
1192880	1195880	And I came across a really interesting thing a while ago.
1195880	1198880	I don't know if you've come across a guy called Ivor Goodson,
1198880	1203880	who is an education social researcher.
1203880	1207880	And he uncovered this really interesting bit of history.
1207880	1209880	That was in the 19th century,
1209880	1212880	there was a thing called the science of common things.
1212880	1215880	And it was very much sort of, you know,
1215880	1219880	about exploring the local fauna and flora and, you know,
1219880	1221880	just doing hands-on practical stuff,
1221880	1223880	learning by doing, like you say.
1223880	1225880	And there was Lord somebody or other.
1225880	1227880	I'll send you the link to this thing
1227880	1228880	after this quality fight,
1228880	1231880	because it's really interesting to read.
1231880	1234880	Who did a report and a survey and he went around schools
1234880	1236880	and he went to a school where,
1236880	1239880	and was speaking to this young, to this,
1239880	1243880	a kid not from a public school,
1243880	1246880	who had been doing this science of common things.
1246880	1249880	And he said that this child issued forth an answer
1249880	1251880	of such eloquence and insight
1251880	1254880	that far exceeded his station in life, you know,
1254880	1256880	because he was this sort of emaciated little oink
1256880	1257880	from the street corner.
1257880	1259880	And so he went back and wrote this report
1259880	1260880	and essentially said,
1260880	1263880	we need to change the language
1263880	1266880	and to change the way that science education is presented.
1266880	1269880	And it's now this sort of that is watered down version
1269880	1270880	of laboratory science,
1270880	1272880	using things like the passive voice like you say.
1272880	1274880	And there's lots of stuff about test tubes
1274880	1276880	and conical flasks and things that don't exist
1276880	1278880	in people's kitchens or lives.
1278880	1280880	And it sort of all became removed
1280880	1283880	and we still have that to this day, you know.
1284880	1286880	I know very much the detriment
1286880	1289880	of actual understanding of nature.
1289880	1292880	You know, one thing I mentioned,
1292880	1295880	you mentioned in our preliminary conversation is that,
1295880	1297880	you know, when learning about the stars
1297880	1299880	and learning about the heavens,
1299880	1302880	most children learn about it from textbooks
1302880	1305880	and there's pictures of rockets and things.
1305880	1307880	But they don't actually go out at night
1307880	1310880	and lie down and look at the stars.
1310880	1312880	And I suppose because it's after school hours,
1312880	1315880	but in the winter when, you know, it gets dark at four,
1315880	1318880	wouldn't be very after school hours to look at the stars.
1318880	1322880	And I was at an adult education centre in Canada
1322880	1324880	about 20 years ago
1324880	1327880	and they had a naturalist there on the staff.
1327880	1330880	And he said, let's do a star talk.
1330880	1333880	And I thought, OK, I've never been to something like this.
1333880	1337880	And we went out and he had blankets lay down on the beach.
1337880	1340880	It was near the sea and it was a nice warm evening,
1340880	1342880	clear sky.
1342880	1346880	And he just with a torch, a strong torch like a pointer,
1346880	1349880	you know, just took us through the constellations
1349880	1351880	and the planets.
1351880	1353880	I'd never had that education.
1353880	1355880	You know, I got a PhD in science
1355880	1360880	and I've never, ever had anyone explain to me the night sky.
1360880	1364880	And because most modern astronomy is radio astronomy
1364880	1367880	and it's all based on sums and calculations.
1367880	1372880	I was once at a party with the then astronomer royal at Cambridge
1372880	1376880	and there was some particularly brilliant heavenly body
1376880	1378880	that I didn't know what it was.
1378880	1381880	And I said to him, you know, what's that?
1381880	1383880	He's an astronomer royal.
1383880	1386880	He said, don't ask me, I'm only an astronomer.
1386880	1390880	He said, I do radio astronomy.
1390880	1393880	He didn't know the constellations.
1393880	1395880	He didn't know it.
1395880	1398880	No, celestial navigators, you know,
1398880	1402880	and even they don't learn it anymore, you know, people on yachts and things
1402880	1404880	because they've got sap naps.
1404880	1409880	So just learning about the stars by seeing them and being at night
1409880	1411880	and learning about plants and animals
1411880	1415880	and learning about the soil by digging things up and looking at roots
1415880	1419880	and this kind of basic learning when my children went to school,
1419880	1423880	this kind of thing stopped at the end of their reception year.
1423880	1425880	In reception, they had a nature table
1425880	1429880	and it was all right to sort of put bird's nest that had fallen out of trees there
1429880	1433880	and things that children had found and stuff.
1433880	1438880	But from then on, it was all about the body as a machine
1438880	1442880	and you've got to learn, you know, how the hearts of pump and that sort of thing.
1442880	1447880	So I think a huge amount more nature learning
1447880	1449880	would be really helpful.
1449880	1454880	I mean, because then it brings it close to real living animals and plants
1454880	1456880	which is what biology is meant to be about.
1456880	1458880	Yeah, absolutely.
1458880	1461880	And also there's something else that we spoke about of air
1461880	1465880	which was about the atomized nature of the school curriculum
1465880	1467880	and we see that across the curriculum
1467880	1470880	where you have geography, history, art, maths, drama
1470880	1472880	as though they're all separate things
1472880	1475880	when actually in the world they all overlap
1475880	1480880	and there's very little, well, really not any interdisciplinary learning
1480880	1483880	that happens in schools, at least not officially.
1483880	1487880	There's an interdisciplinary university that's just opened up,
1487880	1490880	LIS, London Interdisciplinary School, which is really interesting.
1490880	1492880	But that's largely absent from schools.
1492880	1496880	But we see the same phenomenon as well within science education
1496880	1499880	and it often you sort of rotate around biology, chemistry and physics.
1499880	1504880	So you do forces one minute and then you do, you know, like the alkali metals
1504880	1509880	the next topic and then you're doing, you know, whatever it might be,
1509880	1511880	the proto-synthesis.
1511880	1514880	And again, it's all really atomized and sort of disconnected.
1514880	1518880	And I know that you've spoken before about how you describe your worldview
1518880	1522880	as holistic or your understanding of biology is holistic.
1522880	1525880	Please, could you explain what that means
1525880	1530880	and how that is distinct from the sort of the mechanistic model
1530880	1532880	that you were just describing?
1532880	1535880	Well, the mechanistic model which is still the dominant paradigm
1535880	1539880	or model of reality that's taught in science and practiced in science
1539880	1546880	is that nature is a machine that basically causes a by-pushing and pulling
1546880	1553880	and there's no purpose in nature, no purpose in evolution.
1553880	1557880	The mind's nothing but the brain, the body's a machine, the hearts a pump,
1557880	1561880	the lungs are like bellows, the eyes a camera, like a camera.
1561880	1564880	All these things are true as far as they go,
1564880	1569880	but it just involves looking at everything through the lens of the machine metaphor.
1569880	1573880	And it's only a metaphor, it's not a testable hypothesis.
1573880	1578880	You couldn't do an experiment that would prove or refute the idea of nature as just a machine.
1578880	1583880	It's just a metaphor, it's not a scientific hypothesis as such,
1583880	1587880	but it's become deeply embedded ever since the 17th century.
1587880	1590880	It's been the fundamental metaphor of science.
1590880	1593880	But it's not the way nature actually is.
1593880	1596880	And if you look at the way nature is, first of all,
1596880	1600880	it's obvious that animals and plants aren't machines, they're living organisms.
1600880	1605880	And they do have purposes, you know, if a dog's hungry it looks for food.
1605880	1613880	And it's also clear that nature's organized in a series of levels.
1613880	1618880	If you look at the small level then you have subatomic particles in atoms,
1618880	1620880	nuclei and electrons.
1620880	1624880	And then you have molecules which contain atoms in the molecule.
1624880	1627880	And the molecule is more than the sum of the atoms.
1627880	1631880	The water molecule is more than the sum of hydrogen and oxygen.
1631880	1635880	And then you have crystals which are more than just the molecules.
1635880	1640880	Ice is more, you know, especially snowflake with this beautiful six-fold symmetry,
1640880	1646880	is more than just hydrogen and oxygen atoms or even more than just water molecules.
1646880	1652880	And then when you get living cells, a cell is more than the proteins and DNA
1652880	1654880	and lipids and things within it.
1654880	1658880	And a tissue is more than just the cells because it's got more structure and organization
1658880	1660880	and organs more than the tissues.
1660880	1663880	An organism is more than the sum of its organs.
1663880	1668880	They all work together harmoniously in an overall form with overall purpose.
1668880	1673880	And then a group of organisms like a flock of birds or a hive of bees
1673880	1675880	is more than just individual animals.
1675880	1678880	It's the whole unit functions together.
1678880	1682880	And then ecosystems and then planets and then solar systems.
1682880	1686880	A solar system is more than just planets and the sun.
1686880	1688880	They're all working together.
1688880	1692880	And then a galaxy made of stars is more than just a bundle of solar systems.
1692880	1695880	It has a structure, a pattern.
1695880	1700880	So everywhere you look in nature there's levels of wholeness more than the sum of the parts.
1700880	1703880	And each of the parts is a whole at its own level.
1703880	1706880	So that's basically the holistic worldview.
1706880	1711880	And there are certain properties that holes have, that all holes have at all levels.
1711880	1713880	They're always more than the sum of the parts.
1713880	1718880	And the wholeness somehow organizes and coordinates the parts.
1718880	1721880	So they work together harmoniously.
1721880	1726880	So that, I think, is the basic way nature is constituted.
1726880	1731880	And when we look at it that way, then we can see physics deals with very small holes,
1731880	1738880	atoms and subatomic particles, and basic forces like gravity and light.
1738880	1746880	And also with very large things like cosmology, you know, the cosmos, galaxies, stars and stuff.
1746880	1754880	Chemistry deals with sort of bigger holes than atoms and in molecules and ions and crystals and things.
1755880	1763880	And biology deals with living holes from bacteria and microorganisms up to the most sophisticated animals.
1763880	1768880	So I think when you look at it that way, it's easier to see how things fit together
1768880	1773880	and it's easier to see how there's a common pattern to the way everything's organized.
1773880	1779880	And we're used to it in, you know, when I was a child, I used to write those addresses, you know,
1779880	1787880	like our house, our street, our town, you know, Nottinghamshire, England, the United Kingdom, Europe, you know, the world.
1787880	1789880	The Altsastral Arm of the Milky Way.
1789880	1791880	Yes, yes.
1791880	1798880	So, you know, every child understands that this, and each, the higher level isn't just arbitrarily a higher level
1798880	1802880	as if some level's been arbitrarily promoted.
1802880	1806880	So it's in charge like a kind of someone who's jumped up a dictator or something.
1806880	1809880	It's a higher level because it actually includes the low ones.
1809880	1817880	The solar system includes all the planets within it and, you know, a tissue includes all the cells within it.
1817880	1823880	So these higher levels are inclusive levels of organization.
1823880	1825880	Yeah, I see.
1826880	1839880	And so let's talk about, about morphic resonance and about how this sort of, as I mentioned earlier, this idea of significant learning, the big ideas that have shaped our lives.
1839880	1842880	I think that that's probably the one that has most shaped your life.
1842880	1847880	So can we, can you take us back to the origins of it? You said that you had the idea while you were at Cambridge.
1847880	1862880	And what was the, what was the sort of the gap, if you like, in the mechanistic worldview that you thought that there's something that's missing here that you think that morphic resonance is, is an explanation as to how things are the way that they are.
1862880	1866880	In Cambridge, I was working on plants and plant development.
1866880	1880880	The reason I was working on plants is partly because I love plants, but also because I didn't want to spend my career guillotining rats and, and, and killing animals which research in zoology or medicine would have involved.
1880880	1886880	So botany or plant biochemistry were for me much more attractive fields to go into.
1886880	1901880	So I was working on how plant form develops. And I worked out, there's a, there's a hormone called auxin, AUXIN, indolacetic acid is its chemical nature, which is a key hormone in plant growth and development.
1901880	1918880	And I worked out how AUXIN is made. And I discovered it was made by dying cells, that when cells die, the proteins break down, or tonicists, they have proteolytic enzymes, and the levels of free amino acids go up because the proteins are breaking down.
1918880	1929880	And then just a amino acid destroying enzymes kick in and break those down. And one of the amino acids is tryptophan, it's present in animals and plants and bacteria.
1929880	1946880	And when it's broken down, it's transaminated or deaminated to give indolpyruvic acid. And indolpyruvic acid breaks down spontaneously or by fairly non specific oxidases to give AUXIN, indolacetic acid.
1946880	1956880	So dying cells make AUXIN. The main dying cells in plants are the wood cells, which become dead empty tubes. And as they differentiate, they produce AUXIN.
1956880	1966880	And then it's transported from the shoots towards the roots via polar AUXIN transport system. And at Cambridge, I worked out how that works too with a colleague called Philip Rubrie.
1966880	1974880	This is in textbooks now on polar AUXIN transport. We worked out the means by which it happened.
1974880	1985880	So I was very pleased and excited. And we were ahead of anyone in animal studies. We knew what the key chemical was. We knew how it was transported. We knew the chemistry of its production.
1985880	1990880	No one in animal development knew those kinds of things at the time.
1991880	2005880	But then I realized that it's explained too much. All plants have AUXIN and polar AUXIN transport systems, you know, ferns, conifers, palms, cabbages, roses, you know, beach trees.
2005880	2013880	And all parts of the plant have the same AUXIN production and transport system, the leaves, the flowers, the shoots, the roots.
2013880	2019880	Yet the leaves are different from the flowers and a beach tree is different from an ash tree.
2019880	2026880	And so this, which everyone said the molecular basis of development, everyone's hopes were pinned on AUXIN to explain it all.
2026880	2034880	And I realized it just can't explain why they're different. It explains why they're similar, why there's a coordination of the tubes that conduct water,
2034880	2042880	the right number of tubes to feed the growing leaves, etc. But it doesn't explain the specific form.
2042880	2050880	Then I got interested in an idea put forward first in the 1920s of morphogenetic fields, form shaping fields,
2050880	2058880	that there are fields that shape form like an invisible mould around a developing leaf that would cause it to be a leaf shape
2058880	2062880	or around a developing petal that would cause it to be a petal shape.
2062880	2069880	Like a magnetic field has invisible lines of force and shapes the space around it.
2069880	2076880	The idea was that in plants and animals there are these form shaping fields which help to shape form.
2076880	2083880	And I thought they're top down, the field causes it's not just bottom up molecules bumping into each other,
2083880	2094880	somehow creating the form just from genes and proteins, which the reductionist approach still insists is the way forward.
2094880	2099880	But there has to be a top down organizing system, these fields.
2099880	2103880	So then the question is, how are these fields inherited?
2103880	2112880	Because they can't be inherited by genes, genes just code for the sequence of amino acids and proteins or for switching on and off other genes.
2112880	2118880	So I always thought genes were overrated. You know, I was teaching this stuff at Cambridge.
2118880	2124880	Sorry to interrupt. I was quite sort of pleased to hear you say that because as a biology teacher,
2124880	2126880	my degree was biology and psychology.
2126880	2133880	And I was doing it in the late 90s around the time of the Human Genome Project and there was all this fanfare.
2133880	2138880	And then I was teaching this stuff as a biology teacher shortly afterwards.
2138880	2146880	And protein synthesis, like you say, DNA just codes for amino acids which string together into proteins.
2146880	2155880	And how does that describe a biological organism, organ systems.
2155880	2163880	There seems to be like layers of organization that you were saying in this nested hierarchy, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms,
2163880	2167880	and then societal levels of that behavior and so on.
2167880	2174880	There are just the genetic explanation that this is the brain of the cell and that this controls all of life.
2174880	2181880	There's just lots and lots of leaps in that chain of explanation.
2181880	2188880	Exactly. It doesn't make sense when you think it through, but most people still take it for granted.
2188880	2194880	So anyway, when I was trying to think how could these be inherited, they couldn't be inherited through genes.
2194880	2204880	And I didn't think they could be eternal mathematical equations because, you know, biology is all about evolution and changes with time.
2204880	2213880	So some biologists, theoretical biologists who switch from being mathematicians, believe that everything is governed by eternal mathematical laws.
2213880	2220880	And mathematicians tend to be Platonists. They believe that out there there's a kind of eternal mathematical realm on which everything depends.
2220880	2228880	So I couldn't believe that dinosaurs had eternal dinosaur equations there at the moment of the Big Bang and still present today,
2228880	2233880	but, you know, it was only a matter of accident or chance that dinosaurs actually existed.
2233880	2238880	You know, this way of thinking that it's all about the maths didn't appeal to me.
2238880	2242880	So then I thought, well, how could they be inherited?
2242880	2251880	And at that stage I read a book by the French philosopher Henri Bergson called Matter and Memory, written in 1898 or 96,
2251880	2259880	where he argued that memories are not stored in the brain and that there's a kind of causation, a memory causation, directly across time,
2259880	2262880	not necessarily anything in between.
2262880	2266880	And then I realized that if there was a kind of resonance across time,
2266880	2271880	each organism could have a kind of collective memory of form and of instinct,
2271880	2284880	and that many mysteries to do with instinct, inheritance, and indeed memory itself, collective memory, would be explainable.
2284880	2287880	So this was my hypothesis of morphic resonance.
2287880	2292880	The idea is that at each level the wholeness is governed by a field, an organizing field.
2292880	2295880	The generic name for these is morphic fields.
2295880	2299880	Morphic means form, so as to do with fields of form.
2299880	2305880	And that these fields of form got their structure through a kind of memory from previous similar systems.
2305880	2311880	So a giraffe morphogenetic field be like an invisible blueprint for a giraffe,
2311880	2314880	and giraffe embryo would grow in accordance with it.
2314880	2319880	That field would be like a collective memory of the actual form of past giraffes.
2319880	2327880	So basically, in its general form, this idea is that the so-called laws of nature are actually more like habits.
2327880	2330880	There's a memory in nature.
2330880	2337880	Just in case anybody, because the first time you hear this idea, the first time you come across it,
2337880	2342880	it sounds like it's so far removed from the mechanistic understanding that, like you say,
2342880	2347880	most people sort of accept without really thinking about it, that it's hard to grasp.
2347880	2353880	Could you share just a couple of sort of examples of what types of phenomena we see in reality
2353880	2359880	that this field, this idea of morphogenetic fields, explains in a way that materialist,
2359880	2364880	sort of billiard ball, nuts and bolts, science doesn't.
2364880	2371880	Well, for example, the theory predicts that if you train lab rats to learn a new trick in London,
2371880	2376880	then as soon as they've learned it in London, similar rats all around the world in America,
2376880	2383880	in Australia, in India and elsewhere would be able to learn the same trick quicker,
2383880	2388880	just because the rats here have learned it by morphic resonance, kind of collective memory.
2388880	2391880	And there's actually evidence that happens.
2391880	2398880	And to put it even more close to home, the theory predicts that when the wordal puzzle,
2398880	2403880	the five-letter wordal puzzle, is published every morning by the New York Times,
2403880	2408880	as the day goes on, as millions of people solve this particular five-letter puzzle,
2408880	2410880	it should get easier to solve.
2410880	2415880	So it should be easier to solve the wordal puzzle in the evening than it is in the morning,
2416880	2418880	other things being equal.
2418880	2424880	And there's an MSc student actually doing a project on wordal from this point of view as we speak,
2424880	2428880	you know, as a test for morphic resonance.
2428880	2435880	In the realm of chemistry, it means if you make a new chemical for the first time and you crystallize it,
2435880	2440880	there won't be a morphic field for that crystal lattice structure before,
2440880	2443880	it hasn't happened before in the universe, as far as we know.
2443880	2445880	You may wait years before one appears.
2445880	2449880	Often it takes months or years to get a thing to crystallize.
2449880	2454880	Once it's crystallized, it should be easier for that chemical to crystallize all over the world.
2454880	2461880	And actually, there's many examples from chemistry of where compounds are very difficult to crystallize,
2461880	2465880	but once they've started crystallizing, they get easier all over the world.
2465880	2468880	And chemists usually say, well, yes, of course that happens,
2468880	2473880	but it happens because fragments of previous crystals nucleate the crystallizations elsewhere
2473880	2477880	because they get wafted around the world as invisible dust particles.
2477880	2481880	So what I'm saying is that filter out invisible dust particles,
2481880	2484880	it should still happen because of morphic resonance.
2484880	2489880	So basically, the so-called laws of nature, I'm saying are more like habits.
2489880	2495880	And although in the West, this is a very hard idea for people to grasp,
2495880	2499880	when I was working in India, I already was thinking about morphic resonance.
2499880	2505880	When I explained it to my Hindu colleagues, instead of shock and horror or just puzzlement,
2505880	2508880	they said, oh, of course, that is the way nature is.
2508880	2515880	The influence of the past, Hindu and Buddhist philosophy has this idea of a memory in nature.
2515880	2517880	That's just standard.
2517880	2522880	I'd meet people on trains in India after they ask you what is your name,
2523880	2525880	whereas your family, that kind of thing.
2525880	2529880	They then start on what is your view of the world or the universe.
2529880	2534880	Indians like these conversations and got train journeys lasting hours.
2534880	2539880	So I'd explain about morphic resonance and almost always people would just say, oh, yes,
2539880	2541880	that is what we think.
2541880	2544880	We've always thought that, our philosophy and so on.
2544880	2548880	So it was far from shocking in India.
2549880	2556880	And it's a peculiarity of our Western world view that this has got bakes in to science.
2556880	2558880	Yeah, it's interesting.
2558880	2563880	And lots of the questions that you ask seem to me to be just really reasonable questions.
2563880	2570880	For example, in the science delusion and in your TED talk, which was famously banned,
2570880	2576880	you were talking about Big G, the gravitational constant and how the accepted value of Big G,
2576880	2583880	considered to be a universal constant, the value for it has fluctuated over time quite considerably.
2583880	2589880	And the official argument is that we've just got better at measuring it and that that's instrument errors
2589880	2594880	rather than you're suggesting that, well, what if Big G is actually fluctuating,
2594880	2601880	which just seems like a really reasonable question to ask, but people seem to be outraged by the question even.
2601880	2602880	Yes.
2602880	2608880	Well, I mean, some people are intrigued by it, but people who people who've made science into a kind of religion,
2608880	2617880	scientism, you know, people who've made Richard Dawkins is an example of someone who's made science into a kind of religion.
2617880	2621880	They're usually militant atheists.
2621880	2630880	And, you know, lots of atheists who aren't militant and but the militant type tend to be believers in scientism.
2630880	2636880	And it's become for them a belief system as part of their identity and any challenge to it makes them angry.
2636880	2644880	I get this reaction a lot, of course, because I do a lot of challenging of it.
2644880	2652880	But whether you see with Big G, yes, they get more and more precise and the measurements they publish have these tiny error bars.
2652880	2657880	But then when someone else comes along with a precise measurement with tiny error bars and it's somewhere up here,
2657880	2660880	you know, then you know what's going on.
2660880	2670880	So my proposal was simply instead of publishing the average value from a lab over months or years, they published the raw data.
2670880	2677880	And it could be that all around the world on a particular day, Big G is higher and all around the world, it may be lower on another day.
2677880	2684880	Yeah, because isn't there some sort of a there's a they call metrologist, the people who collect all these measurements and then they do do stuff to the data.
2684880	2689880	They average it out and they do sort of adjustments to take account of what they think is real and what's not.
2689880	2693880	And so you arrive at this figure that like you say it's not it's not raw data.
2693880	2695880	No, no, it's not raw data.
2695880	2704880	It's average in each lab and then there's an international committee averages for the ones from different labs around the world, waiting ones that they think are more valid.
2704880	2710880	If it comes from Cambridge or Harvard and counts more than if it comes from the Ivory Coast or something.
2710880	2719880	So, so they end up with these average values and next time the committee meets in five years time, the average values are different.
2719880	2728880	So they're always changing them and in those handbooks of physical constants, which are constantly being updated, they have the new values of the constants.
2729880	2736880	So my point was not that, you know, just simply that what if the earth as it travels through space.
2736880	2742880	Maybe there's, you know, some physicists now believe in dark matter mysterious matter.
2742880	2743880	We don't know what it is.
2743880	2746880	What if we pass through a cloud of dark matter.
2746880	2753880	This would affect measurements of G and maybe it's telling us something about the earth's environment is moved through space.
2753880	2759880	But by refusing to look at the fluctuations because it's got to be a constant.
2759880	2765880	This is just narrowing down science and that's why in my book, the science delusion.
2765880	2774880	I take the 10 fundamental dogmas and turn them into questions and say, well, what happens if we look at these scientifically instead of just saying they must be true.
2774880	2775880	Yeah.
2775880	2779880	And then science opens up it gets so much more interesting.
2779880	2786880	My favorite question is that book in that book is there's a chapter on on consciousness.
2786880	2794880	And you were talking about that materialist philosophers and people like Daniel Dennett who who wrote consciousness explained but it was really sort of consciousness explained away.
2794880	2797880	They said that it's just, you know, it's not really a thing.
2797880	2800880	It's just, it's just, you know, it's almost like a Darwinian.
2800880	2807880	You know that there are things that we attend to and the stream of attention is just the stream of winners in that Darwinian race.
2807880	2813880	But there's nothing really to see here. And that it again that it's just this sort of explain in that billiard ball mechanism.
2813880	2821880	And at the end of that, that chapter you ask a question and you say so do you think that your views on materialism on your views on consciousness.
2822880	2830880	I determined on this billiard ball level or do you feel like you've arrived at them through reason and argument and creativity and what have you.
2830880	2833880	And it's a really, really good question.
2833880	2844880	Because, you know, they don't seem to be applying the same the same principles to what it is to be a materialist it seems to it seems to it sort of eats itself.
2845880	2854880	You see what they they managed to imagine that they're on the side of this plate glass windows and objective observer of reality somehow detached from it.
2854880	2856880	And they were taught to write in the passive voice.
2856880	2858880	A disembodied mind. Yes.
2858880	2863880	But somehow everything else is mechanistic and materialist and stuff, except for them.
2863880	2865880	People like them.
2866880	2879880	I think that's one reason why Stephen Hawking became so iconic for people who are not scientists and indeed for scientists because he was the closest you can get through no fault of his own.
2879880	2886880	But through his own misfortune, he was the closest you can get to a disembodied mind as a human.
2886880	2893880	And he became iconic of the scientific quest on his book a brief history of time on the dust jacket.
2893880	2904880	Time magazine is quoted by saying, even as he sits helpless in his wheelchair, his mind soars through space and time to unlock the mysteries of the universe.
2904880	2920880	So the idea that a disembodied mind could somehow saw through space and time to unlock the mysteries from a vantage point outside nature, somehow a God's eye view is somehow baked into the view.
2920880	2923880	So it's not consistent.
2923880	2933880	I mean, from the point of view of science education, you know, I think the questions that I deal with in the science of delusion be really good questions.
2933880	2941880	The trouble is that no science teacher I know has taken them up in school because it's not on the national curriculum.
2941880	2950880	It probably do more harm than good to, you know, a level rankings or or GCSE rankings so they don't do it.
2950880	2962880	I do occasionally I'm asked to talk about these things in schools and the last two or three years, the school that's most into what I'm doing and where I've given talks are is eaten.
2962880	2968880	And I've dressed the whole of the low six that eaten for the last few years on the science delusion.
2968880	2971880	And they're really up for it there.
2971880	2983880	Whereas when I've tried to do this at other schools, you know, people are frightened of disorienting the children or confusing them or they've got enough confidence at eating to do this.
2983880	2987880	I don't talk at eating because I'm in favor of hyper privilege.
2987880	2991880	I do it because it's the only schools.
2991880	2998880	Oh, I was just wondering I'd like to come back to the educational implications of those books that I mentioned earlier but just just while we're on this.
2998880	3011880	How have you found it. I wondered a few times as I've been sort of reading your work you said earlier that you know the toughness of being a very very austere school that was nothing compared to what came later.
3012880	3022880	You know, for example, you know, we talked about your Ted talk, you know, attracting controversy, your book that you said that was described as a, there was a review in nature wasn't there that said a book for burning.
3022880	3023880	Yes.
3023880	3024880	Your ideas are considered.
3024880	3025880	Sorry, what was that.
3025880	3029880	It was an editorial on the front page.
3029880	3043880	Yes. And, and I wonder how you found that like it kind of been easy to have to have sort of had your ideas received in such a sort of an aggressive way.
3043880	3051880	Well, you know, first I felt this was completely unjust because I played science by the rules I publish all my stuff in peer reviewed journals.
3051880	3057880	I, you know, I make rational arguments and stuff and I prepared to debate them with anyone.
3057880	3074880	And so, you know, I thought I'm playing by the rules and then suddenly I found that actually the rules don't apply if you try and challenge some of these dogmas, you know, it's so the editor of nature basically said that my work should be, you know, in the end he said the book shouldn't be burned but
3074880	3083880	put in protected shelf of the library and that he compared unfavorably with other dangerous books like mine camp by Hitler.
3083880	3094880	I mean, that was his, then basically what he was trying to do was ex communicate me and the result is from then on I couldn't get a grant, I couldn't get a job.
3094880	3102880	And whenever I was invited to give talks and universities, whoever invited me always had a problem with people who tried to cancel me.
3102880	3104880	I've been cancelled many times.
3104880	3108880	Cancel culture is nothing new, it's been going on in science for decades.
3108880	3122880	And so anyway, at first I found this rather annoying and I just thought it was unfair, you know, because I was playing the game by the rules and they weren't and yet they claimed to be upholding the rules of proper science.
3122880	3125880	Then I came to see that actually these are not evil people.
3125880	3129880	These are people who just really believe that they know the truth.
3129880	3134880	They believe that science has revealed the mechanistic sciences revealed the truth.
3134880	3142880	All other approaches to truth like religion, philosophy, etc. are, you know, muddled superstitious old fashioned.
3142880	3149880	The only thing that's right up there with the leading edge of human understanding is science and they really believe in this.
3149880	3161880	They're basically fanatics or bigots because of their belief system, not because they've been bribed by drug companies, not because they're conspiracies, but they really believe it.
3161880	3164880	And they're really fighting for the truth.
3164880	3167880	The only trouble is they have such a narrow view of the truth.
3167880	3169880	So I'm in favor of fighting for the truth.
3169880	3176880	But I just think it's a shame if one fights for a half truth or a partial truth.
3176880	3179880	Yes. Yeah, I mean, thank you for that.
3179880	3183880	He always strikes me that you seem to deal with it really quite well.
3183880	3197880	You seem very sort of unflappable in the face of beliefs of contradicting views and you sort of say, well, you know, here's what we were talking earlier about that fascinating conversation that you had with with Daniel Dennett and Oliver Sacks.
3198880	3205880	Stephen Jay Gould, Stephen Jay Gould, five or six of you sitting around a table that is about a three and a half hour video on YouTube.
3205880	3212880	It's really, really interesting and it's worth but you really sort of hold yourself well in those in those conversations.
3212880	3221880	And maybe those maybe all of that rugby and stuff and that character building stuff in your formative years was sort of helpful in giving you this unflappable demeanor.
3221880	3223880	I don't know.
3223880	3232880	Well, I think it was partly, I mean, I'm not totally unflappable, some things get at me, but not.
3232880	3238880	Yes, partly, I mean, partly that character building stuff, I think has actually served me in good stead.
3238880	3241880	Partly, you know, I'm a Christian and I pray.
3241880	3248880	I used to be an atheist when I was converted to mechanistic materialism as a teenager.
3248880	3257880	But, you know, one of the big things about the Lord's Prayer, which I say every day is, you know, forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us.
3257880	3265880	Well, I definitely think some people have trespassed against me through these kinds of unfair attacks.
3265880	3270880	So I just asked for the grace not to keep these burning resentments.
3270880	3273880	I mean, resentment is a kind of corrosive thing.
3273880	3275880	It corrodes the soul.
3275880	3278880	And so every day I just try and let go.
3278880	3283880	And, you know, if you pray for the grace to do it, I find it's much easier to do.
3283880	3291880	So I don't wake up in the morning feeling resentful and angry and it's just a much nicer way of living.
3291880	3297880	And it's also effective in dealing with people who are against what I'm saying.
3297880	3303880	It's more effective not to get angry. It's much more effective to try and discuss it with them.
3303880	3316880	And I studied martial arts at one stage and I like the idea of sort of going with the flow of what they're saying and trying to take it further, you know, so that it rather than opposing it.
3316880	3317880	Yes.
3317880	3326880	I, you know, when you compare the sort of brute force method of American football with Japanese martial arts, you know, it's a very different style.
3326880	3329880	And I prefer the martial arts style.
3329880	3332880	Absolutely. Be like water and all that.
3332880	3344880	And yes, and lots of those the practices that you write in those two more recent books that you that you wrote, science and spiritual practices and ways to go beyond and why they work.
3345880	3356880	I imagine have sort of been very helpful for you as well and they're all they're all practices that you engage in and I know we've only got a couple of minutes to end on just for the benefit of viewers and listeners.
3356880	3363880	There's a number of these ideas you talk about meditation, fasting, interacting with animals and so on.
3363880	3377880	There was one chapter that I think really triggered me in terms of reaching out to you and that was the chapter on cultivating good habits about virtues and about, you know, the sort of these universal ideas around around how to be a good person.
3377880	3387880	And I don't know whether you have any sort of this is a bit of a vague final question but what are your thoughts and I know that you mentioned pilgrimages as well earlier.
3388880	3400880	I just wanted to sort of just to land on a on an educational note. What do you think that education that we should be doing more of or less of in education to cultivate these, these good habits.
3400880	3413880	Well, in the traditional education in middle ages, you know, the people were taught that vices and virtues are habits basically their habits that habits you acquire and they become unconscious.
3413880	3425880	And the seven deadly sins, the worst vices, you know, cultivating greed, envy, lust, gluttony, avarice, pride, and so on anger.
3425880	3436880	These are bad things to cultivate. And yet the modern advertising industry and social media actually make things like greed and envy virtues and anger and stuff.
3436880	3449880	And then they taught you the good things to cultivate the virtues, you know, including prudence, temperance, wisdom, you know, love, faith, hope.
3449880	3455880	So I think teaching most children don't even know what the traditional virtues are courage.
3455880	3460880	These are virtues. These are things that you can actually cultivate as habits.
3460880	3469880	And because education is supposed to be value neutral, and you know, it's left to people's religion or private conscience or family or something.
3469880	3475880	Most people don't get any religious teaching anymore at home, or in a church or anywhere else.
3475880	3488880	And, and some school teachers be afraid to teach any of these things for fear of being accused of imposing their personal subjective values or ideology on children.
3488880	3496880	So the result is there's a kind of moral vacuum. And it's very harmful, I think.
3496880	3501880	But one thing to end on, I'd love to just mention pilgrimage, because there's something I'm very keen on.
3501880	3510880	And the revival of pilgrimage, which is going on all over Europe at the moment, and here in Britain through the British Pilgrimage Trust,
3510880	3521880	is reopening ancient footpath pilgrimage routes, walking through the countryside on footpaths to holy places, which can be springs, wells, mountain tops,
3521880	3529880	and also our great cathedrals and churches and, and or pre-Christian stone circles and so on.
3529880	3538880	That it's a wonderful thing to do. I do it myself, and I did it every year with a godson, a teenage godson, until recently when he stopped being a teenager.
3538880	3550880	Every year we went on a one day pilgrimage, five or six miles through the countryside to one of the great cathedrals, Lincoln, Wells, Ely, Winchester.
3550880	3560880	Each year we did a different cathedral. And now one of the things the British Pilgrimage Trust is doing is trying to open up the idea of school pilgrimages.
3560880	3570880	There's a few schools that already do them. There's a school near here in London where I live. In year three, their teacher, their religious teacher,
3570880	3579880	who's also Anglican priest, takes them to Westminster Abbey. Year four, St Paul's. Year five, they spend three days at Walsingham in Norfolk,
3579880	3587880	and visit the shrine of Our Lady, and they walk barefoot. 30% of these children are Muslim. They love going on these pilgrimages.
3587880	3599880	And then year five, six, they go to St Albans Cathedral. And the chap who leads this, who's called Father Graham, is very...
3599880	3605880	He's quite charismatic with the children, and he says the children absolutely love it, because it's learning by doing.
3605880	3612880	They're learning about history. They're learning about nature. They're learning about sacred places.
3612880	3617880	When they get there, they light a candle and say a prayer, their own prayer, whatever they want to pray for.
3617880	3623880	And he says, when he goes to Walsingham, sometimes he sees school groups there where they're dressed up in fake medieval outfits,
3623880	3632880	pretending to be pilgrims. And he says that his children find it so much more satisfying, because they actually are pilgrims.
3632880	3640880	And I think that school pilgrimage is a wonderful educational, experiential way of learning, and it's fun.
3640880	3645880	So I'm really keen on that at the moment.
3645880	3652880	There's a website called BritishPilgrimage.org, which gives all these different routes.
3652880	3659880	So if anyone's interested, they can look at that, and they can get in touch too, because there's a coordinator now
3659880	3662880	who's helping to coordinate school pilgrimages.
3662880	3670880	Right. Thank you for that. I'll look into it, and I'll put a link to it in the show notes and recommend it to my school-based friends.
3670880	3678880	And thank you for that as well, because I think it was a recent podcast that I heard, the podcast you do with Mark Vernon.
3678880	3679880	Is it Mark?
3679880	3680880	Yes.
3680880	3689880	And there's quite a few about these issues, and about just how sort of hidden, how forgotten and in decline churches are,
3689880	3694880	and people don't go to churches, don't go to cathedrals, don't go to even song, there are all these amazing things.
3694880	3701880	And I've started to re-engage with those things in my local community, so thank you for that, because it's really opened things up for me.
3701880	3710880	I was raised in a Christian tradition, and then sort of like many people like yourself became a scientist later on and sort of fell out of the habit of it.
3710880	3722880	But, you know, there's all kinds of interesting things that people do, people of faith, they sing together, they pray, they do things that are really good for you,
3722880	3726880	that those militant atheists are missing out on.
3726880	3731880	So thank you for reopening my eyes to that side of life.
3731880	3737880	Good. Well, it's great you're doing what you're doing, and I'm very pleased we had this chance to chat.
3737880	3741880	Yes, yeah, me too. Well, thank you very much. I know that you need to head off now.
3741880	3745880	So, yeah, thank you very much. I've really enjoyed this conversation.
3745880	3747880	All right, thanks so much for today.
3747880	3749880	Bye for now then, James.
3749880	3751880	Take care. Bye bye.
3809880	3817880	Let's do what's right and not what is right.
3817880	3824880	Let's let them, let's explore.
3824880	3831880	Let's bring back the love to get the fear of being fight.
3831880	3837880	We're forced to wreck the children as nothing wrecks the schools.
3837880	3843880	So let's rethink education.
3843880	3850880	We have a lack of agency. We're trapped inside the system.
3850880	3856880	So let's rethink education.
3856880	3863880	A place of transformation that embraces community.
3863880	3869880	School is the heart.
3869880	3876880	A place to dream, a place to play, a place to think and love.
3876880	3885880	Feeling free.
3885880	3892880	So let's trust, let's be brave.
3892880	3898880	Let's do what's right and not what is required.
3898880	3904880	Let's have fun, let's explore.
3904880	3911880	Let's bring back the love to get the fear of being fight.
3911880	3917880	Let's trust, let's be brave.
3917880	3923880	Let's do what's right and not what is required.
3923880	3929880	Let's have fun, let's explore.
3929880	3937880	Let's bring back the love to get the fear of being fight.
3941880	3946880	Thank you for watching.
