1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
On the one hand, I see that James is afraid

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,840
of the weaponization of Christianity

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,480
in his attack on Christian nationalism.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,560
But on the other hand, I see him doing the exact same thing

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,720
in trying to get the Christians on board with him

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,040
so that he can create his democratic secular enlightenment

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,280
utopia, which doesn't exist, which is not possible.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,240
And so that's why I do believe that the only solution

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,280
to our predicament is a true return to Christianity,

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,880
like not a pretend one, not a unit.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,280
And that's why most of my interactions

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,560
are not political at all.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,160
Jonathan Pajot, you have risen in prominence

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,040
over the last couple of years.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,120
In part, I think, because of your work with JBP,

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,360
what is the sort of the message that you're sharing

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,720
with people that is getting through,

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,320
that's cutting through, that's connecting?

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,080
Briefly, what are you saying that's getting through?

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,400
Well, I think that we're in a situation

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,400
where people are finding that the promises of the enlightenment

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,480
or the promises of the scientific revolution

23
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,240
are, although they have brought some great success

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,800
in terms of material wealth and in terms of comfort,

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
all of this is actually quite wonderful

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,840
that there seems to be something missing,

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,600
which is a connection to meaning, to purpose.

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,360
And we also struggle to understand

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,280
how and why it is that we exist together.

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,640
And so it seems like it's an interesting time

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,880
to be able to speak into this

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,920
and to help people re-understand our religious stories,

33
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,280
the mythologies, the images, the icons,

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,160
the structures of meaning that informed our ancestors

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,200
for thousands of years and how they can actually help us,

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,600
first of all, understand why it is we need that,

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,560
why it is we need purpose and meaning and cohesion,

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,280
and how it is that these stories,

39
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,360
and also especially the participation that comes from them,

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,360
can help us reconnect and find meaning again.

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,120
Brilliant, there's a huge amount in there.

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,800
Now, just for our viewers and listeners,

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,560
your background is as an icon maker.

44
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,520
What's the verb?

45
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,480
How do you describe yourself?

46
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, I mean, I guess you could say,

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,800
I mean, icon carver, icon maker,

48
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,760
but it's really important to understand the icon making

49
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,720
as an application of a worldview

50
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,960
that I embraced a very long time ago.

51
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,320
And so it, I mean, I'm happy to take that title,

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,760
but it isn't somewhere as reductive

53
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,280
because the, like I said,

54
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,000
in some ways it was discovering a cohesive worldview

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,600
and embracing it and participating in it

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,040
that led me to want to apply that in my life

57
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,400
at different levels.

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,280
And one of them ended up being professionally

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,360
as making images for churches.

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
As I understood the images

61
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,480
and as I kind of understood this web of meaning

62
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,120
that is there in the Christian tradition,

63
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,840
it was a way to apply it practically,

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,800
and not just it'd be like a mental game that I engage with.

65
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,680
Right, but you were an artist before that, right?

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,680
Yes, I studied art in school,

67
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,160
but then I kind of abandoned art

68
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,160
and then went on a long arc of studying of reading

69
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,000
and ultimately coming back to traditional art.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,680
Okay, gotcha.

71
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,120
Now, Jonathan, about a month ago,

72
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,160
we had James Lindsay on the podcast.

73
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,080
We had a fantastic discussion.

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,600
And you had a bit of a disagreement,

75
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,600
which I think is really cuts to some of the core issues

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,100
in the public debate at the moment.

77
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,920
So let's get into that.

78
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,120
On Twitter, you wrote,

79
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,800
the future is religious,

80
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,920
and no one can stop that anymore.

81
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,040
The question remaining is what that religiosity

82
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,120
will be turned toward?

83
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,480
Do you want to just unpack that for us

84
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,360
and give a sense of the way in which Lindsay

85
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,040
disagreed with you?

86
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,800
Yeah, I don't even remember exactly

87
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,520
how the argument started.

88
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,120
I mean, he came after me for something I wrote,

89
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,080
but I think he identified me first of all

90
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,680
with something that he had in his mind,

91
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,960
which is Christian nationalism

92
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,400
and kind of identified me with that

93
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,400
and therefore framed the things I was saying

94
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,320
in that perspective.

95
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,240
But it's related to what I said at the outset,

96
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,720
which is that we're noticing the religious crash

97
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,000
back into our story and whether you see it,

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,580
whether it's through woke ideology,

99
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,540
whether it is through worship of the environment,

100
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,620
whether it is its worship of the state,

101
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,620
and whether it's going to be worship of AI.

102
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,220
It doesn't really matter.

103
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,260
There seems to be different ways

104
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,540
in which this is coming back,

105
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,540
or whether it is like your uneducated aunt

106
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,780
that goes to the new age shop and has crystals

107
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,100
and has all this kind of stuff in their house.

108
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,940
The idea is that people are looking for ways

109
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,940
to make sense of their world, which is beyond reason.

110
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,220
It is beyond reason because it also has to encompass

111
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,860
the manner in which there's coherence,

112
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,100
the manner in which we come together,

113
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,220
the manner in which we align ourselves with our purposes

114
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,300
and the purposes of others in the world,

115
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,700
and that ends up looking like religious participation

116
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,980
or religious affiliation

117
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,140
because it has to do with celebration.

118
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,820
Like we actually follow that which we celebrate.

119
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,740
We live in that which we celebrate

120
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,420
and that ends up looking like religion.

121
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,420
It's like, what do you worship basically?

122
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,980
What do you put as the highest?

123
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,380
And what do you celebrate?

124
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,500
And so without traditional religions,

125
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,460
we end up with weird things like Earth Day

126
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,460
and LGBT Month and just this constant desire

127
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,420
to have insert holidays and celebrations

128
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,860
that are re-injecting religiosity into the world.

129
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,860
So my contention is that this is happening to us.

130
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,140
You know, the Enlightenment model,

131
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,220
the Enlightenment idea that we could all just be

132
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,260
rationalistic individuals like that live next to each other

133
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,340
is not working.

134
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,700
That gives the suburbs.

135
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,140
It gives the urban sprawl.

136
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,220
It gives the breakdown of the family.

137
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,580
It gives the breakdown of communities

138
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,220
and it turns us into these little consumers

139
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,700
that live next to each other but don't know each other

140
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,980
and don't interact with each other.

141
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,060
And everybody's feeling like that is not sufficient

142
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,260
because people are depressed, people are miserable

143
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,820
and they're looking for something more.

144
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,820
Now the question is, what is that going to be?

145
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,700
There's no, like I said,

146
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,860
I don't think there's a way around it.

147
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,180
Is it going to be Islam?

148
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,660
Is it going to be all these weird new kind of religiosities

149
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,820
that we see in globalism?

150
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,940
You know, I do believe that Christianity is our best bet

151
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,940
as Westerners and as let's say people who want to be able

152
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,700
to preserve the best of what the Enlightenment has given us

153
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,140
because the Enlightenment has provided powerful things

154
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,700
but it's insufficient.

155
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,580
It's not enough to hold people together.

156
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,580
It tends towards the problems we're seeing now.

157
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,460
Okay, so how are we understanding the word the Enlightenment?

158
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,700
We're talking about the sort of 17th, 18th century

159
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,660
movement in Europe.

160
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,940
We have in mind figures like Kant, David Hume, Newton.

161
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,540
Do you want to expand on what you have in mind there?

162
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,300
Yeah, and so, I mean, the Enlightenment

163
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,180
is properly understood as a continuation of a movement

164
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,580
that started, let's say, in the Renaissance

165
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,220
with the Scientific Revolution.

166
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,220
In some ways, it is the winning of reason,

167
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,220
like the notion that human beings are reasonable

168
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,060
and that reason is the way by which we're going to exist

169
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,220
and then applying that thinking, that reason,

170
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,940
and also the methods of scientific exploration

171
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,900
and analysis to the world.

172
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,900
And so we have a method in order to be able

173
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,180
to predict phenomena, to be able to understand phenomena.

174
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,700
We have a method by which we can analyze things

175
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,300
and that method is very powerful

176
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,340
and it yields power.

177
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,700
Like it's the best way to understand it.

178
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,580
It yields more capacity to control

179
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,580
and to manage reality, manage physical reality,

180
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,940
make spaceships, make all the things that we enjoy,

181
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,380
which are quite wonderful.

182
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,580
But there's also a blind spot in that.

183
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,820
There's a blind spot in this Enlightenment,

184
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,300
especially as it moves towards secularism

185
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,980
and especially as it moves towards atheism.

186
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,900
Because there's a sense in which we start to believe

187
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,500
that this reason and this capacity for reason is ultimate

188
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,100
and that it's sufficient.

189
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,220
And then we apply it, we apply it, we apply it,

190
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,820
but the problem actually happens

191
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,780
when we start to then turn it on ourselves.

192
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,660
When we come to the point where we now have to understand

193
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,820
ourselves as agents, as conscious beings,

194
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,260
then reason starts to become loopy.

195
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,220
It starts to not completely be enough,

196
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,140
especially when understanding how identities function.

197
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,820
Reason does not provide identity.

198
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,580
Reason provides analysis for identities

199
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,180
that are already given.

200
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,660
But the identity is seen to be a given

201
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,260
or to come, to use religious language.

202
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,180
They come from heaven.

203
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,300
Like you knew the identity before

204
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
you can apply the methods of science.

205
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,980
And so because of that, it leaves humans

206
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,620
with something missing in their experience

207
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,940
that they know is real, that they experience all the time,

208
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,140
but that cannot be contained by this process.

209
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,420
Yeah.

210
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,100
So one descriptor that's used

211
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,260
for the Enlightenment is the Age of Reason.

212
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,900
Now I really just like this

213
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,740
because I love the medieval figures.

214
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,740
And of course the medieval figures like Aquinas,

215
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,300
Scotus, Occam, early medieval like Anselm,

216
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,940
I mean, these guys use the reason.

217
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,940
So in what sense is reason really triumphant enlightenment?

218
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,540
Some people say that it's reason

219
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,700
plus the throwing off of authority.

220
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,420
Religious authority, Alistair McIntyre thinks

221
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,940
it's reason plus throwing off the fixed sense

222
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,220
of human nature.

223
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,060
Yeah.

224
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,660
Well, it's religion and pride.

225
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,740
It's the pride, sorry, it's the pride of reason.

226
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,780
It's the best way to understand it.

227
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,300
And so the manner in which the medieval's understood reason

228
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,940
was that it was derivative and manifested

229
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,060
by something transcendent.

230
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,940
Like a mystery which is beyond understanding

231
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,020
which reveals itself in reason.

232
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,220
And so there's always an aspect of the real

233
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,940
which it cannot be probed.

234
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,340
And you'll find that in all the medieval,

235
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,020
you know, whether west or east or west,

236
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,300
there's something beyond reason that cannot be probed

237
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,800
and it gives to reason and reason flows out of it.

238
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,900
And what it does is that it means

239
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,740
that reason is not sufficient.

240
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,860
Reason does not contain all things.

241
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,620
And what it also, how can I say this?

242
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,620
It also eliminates the problem of the pride of reason.

243
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,380
And so in the Enlightenment, the idea is like,

244
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,220
we can do this, we are the ones, we have it.

245
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,260
We try to contain reality within reason.

246
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,100
And sometimes it's the beginning of a revolutionary trope.

247
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,220
It's the beginning of the revolutionary structure

248
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,940
where the human tries to take from God, right?

249
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,300
The top of the hierarchy tries to say, no, we are the top.

250
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,060
We are the ones who can, with our reason

251
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,460
and our mind can analyze the world.

252
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,340
But as soon as that happens, then things start to devolve.

253
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,380
And you find yourself, at the end of that process,

254
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,900
you find yourself in a situation

255
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,460
that is not reasonable at all,

256
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,060
that is actually completely unreasonable,

257
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,740
but not unreasonable in the sense

258
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,580
that God is beyond reason, unreasonable in the sense

259
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,340
that our passions and our desires and our whims

260
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,500
end up ruling in the end.

261
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,500
And so this, in my conflict with Lindsay,

262
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,620
I quoted Goya's famous statement,

263
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,260
here's a print by Goya,

264
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,300
which says, the sleep of reason produces monsters.

265
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,900
Or the dream of reason produces monsters, right?

266
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,700
And that is the situation that we find ourselves in,

267
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,740
is that having insisted so much on reason

268
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,540
and having pushed to the margin

269
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,340
the things which are not reasonable,

270
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,860
they at some point, that unreason just crashes back in.

271
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,100
And like you said, in the medieval world,

272
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,060
that unreason or that which exceeds reason

273
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,900
would in some ways have been pushed up

274
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,740
towards the glory of God, right?

275
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,300
Would have been something like the excess of a church

276
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,820
in a village, like the golden,

277
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,740
all of this kind of unreasonable excess

278
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,900
that we experience in reality,

279
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,660
we give it up as glory to God.

280
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,260
But if you don't do that,

281
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,180
then it turns into the hybrid demons

282
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,700
that come in poke you at night,

283
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,700
like all these freaks and intermediary beings

284
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,140
that start to appear in the world

285
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,180
and will try to destroy reason that way.

286
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,940
Interesting, yeah.

287
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,180
Yeah, I mean, it certainly doesn't seem to me

288
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,260
that this sort of standards of racial inquiry

289
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,500
got much better with the Enlightenment.

290
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,740
It doesn't strike me that Hume is any smarter

291
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,100
than Occam or Aquinas,

292
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,820
but certainly I like your way of describing it

293
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,580
as this elevating reason, the pride of reason.

294
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,620
And I guess I put this actually to Pete Boghossian as well.

295
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,620
Last week, this idea that we need both reason and mystery,

296
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,180
because that's roughly kind of what you're getting at.

297
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,940
And is your criticism, or not even your criticism,

298
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,620
your understanding of Lindsay,

299
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,860
and to some extent, Pete,

300
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,700
is they just want to have reason, is that right?

301
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,740
Well, that's what you see.

302
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,660
And you see that in the Stephen Hicks,

303
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,660
Pete Pinker, Lindsay, all of that crew,

304
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,780
they have this, in my impression, a twisted image,

305
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,100
first of all, of what humans are,

306
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,500
and second of all, of how reality works.

307
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,100
And it can look very convincing at the outset,

308
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,680
because what they're saying is, if we were reasonable,

309
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,820
if we were just reasonable,

310
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,260
then we would have a perfect society, wouldn't we?

311
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,340
And so it's one of those like,

312
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,380
communism has never been tried problems,

313
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,060
which is that humans are not only reasonable.

314
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,220
Reality cannot be limited to that, which is reasonable.

315
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,700
And it just cannot, even epistemologically,

316
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,620
we cannot access all of reality through reason.

317
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,660
And we're starting to know that even scientifically,

318
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,580
this point, is that we cannot quantify all things.

319
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,980
We cannot analyze all of reality.

320
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,460
There always has to be some miracle,

321
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,140
whether the miracle is the big bang or whatever,

322
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,980
or something at the outset that is not part of the system,

323
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,340
that is just an inevitable aspect

324
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,060
of how being lays itself out.

325
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,140
And so it becomes difficult because they'll say,

326
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,780
if we were only reasonable and reasonable individuals,

327
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,980
then all things would work, but we are not that.

328
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,700
Human beings are not just that,

329
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,940
they are that to some extent.

330
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,300
And so then again, it has this problem.

331
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,740
It's like, if you have a blind spot,

332
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,620
you have this blind spot, which is the aspect,

333
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,740
unreasonable aspect, whether you understand it

334
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,500
as that which is beyond reason

335
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,100
or that which is below reason,

336
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,420
there's an aspect of reality,

337
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,660
which cannot be reduced to reason.

338
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,580
If you just keep it on the side as a blind spot,

339
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,740
at some point it comes crashing back in.

340
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,100
And so then you can complain as much as you want

341
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,260
about like crazy leftists

342
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,420
or kind of our intercategories

343
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,540
that are smashing into our world and hybridization

344
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,940
and all of this weird stuff that we're seeing happening,

345
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,540
but that is what's going to happen.

346
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,820
Yeah, and this is what's happened to Dawkins as well.

347
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,100
Of course, he was, I mean,

348
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,460
at this sort of rational scientific utopia,

349
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,060
but then what was it, back in 2014,

350
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,580
he lost his Humanist of the Year award

351
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,540
because of something he'd said about men

352
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,020
not being able to become women or something.

353
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,620
Yeah, because he didn't want to play that.

354
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,180
So that's a great example.

355
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,060
Like the great example of what happens

356
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,020
if you don't have the proper mystery at the outset,

357
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,700
at the beginning of your reasonable process,

358
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,100
then you'll have other mysteries that will be inserted,

359
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,340
other dogmas and other aporias and contradictions.

360
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,500
And so someone will say exactly that,

361
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,060
like a man can be a woman straight faced and look at you.

362
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,580
And what they're yearning for,

363
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,180
like what they're desiring for,

364
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,500
it's something like the Trinity, for example.

365
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,820
It's something like there is a mystery

366
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,220
about how unity and multiplicity coexist

367
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,660
and how they infinitely coexist

368
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,820
because we can't completely account

369
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,660
for the man in which one and many function

370
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,540
in our experience of the world.

371
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,460
And so we perceive, we have insight

372
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,620
about an infinite, transcendent way

373
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,180
in which those two are joined together.

374
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,260
And so that's the kind of mystery

375
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,780
that the medieval, for example,

376
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,820
could see as the outlet of reality.

377
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,780
But if you don't have that,

378
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,060
then you'll end up with a man as a woman.

379
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,660
Yeah, so I get unity and multiplicity

380
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,500
when it comes to the Trinity.

381
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,820
How's the man as a woman,

382
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,060
how's the desire for unity and multiplicity

383
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,140
being expressed there?

384
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,500
It's the desire for something to be itself and not itself.

385
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,900
It's the desire for something to be,

386
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,420
how can they say this, to be trans categorical?

387
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,420
Right?

388
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,540
And you can see it, by the way,

389
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,220
you probably know about the trans is sacred

390
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,300
like aspect that has happened over the last few years.

391
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,620
And there was the,

392
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,700
and even when they put on a version of,

393
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,980
what was it?

394
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,900
They put on a play with,

395
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,620
why is it my brain sometimes breaks down?

396
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,420
What's the name of the woman who was a knight

397
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,260
in the 14th century?

398
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,020
Joan of Arc.

399
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,060
They put on a play of Joan of Arc where Joan of Arc is trans.

400
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,900
And in the beginning of the play,

401
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,100
he, she says, I am one in many.

402
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,860
I am beyond category.

403
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,340
I am sacred.

404
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,380
I am like God.

405
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,220
I am.

406
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,460
And she literally says I am

407
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,780
because she's using the categories

408
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,860
of trans-rational infinite,

409
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,460
but applying it to what is intercategorical.

410
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,860
And so that's the problem that happens.

411
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,820
That's why postmodernism was like

412
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,940
an inevitable side effect of the enlightenment.

413
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,900
And this is obviously something that people

414
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,340
like Pinker and Lindsay and all these guys won't like,

415
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,180
but that he himself said that his project

416
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,500
was the enlightenment.

417
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,220
He believed that his project was the continuation

418
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,540
of the enlightenment because there's this reaching

419
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,260
into the intercategorical.

420
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,300
Do you understand how the intercategorical is like

421
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:29,300
is a trick to make you confuse that which transcends reason?

422
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,780
Because that's what intercategorical things do

423
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,460
is that the elude reason.

424
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,580
Okay.

425
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,700
So let's just get this clear.

426
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,420
Because so categories, what I'm hearing is that

427
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,740
in the transgender move, it's this desire to throw off

428
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,900
these, finish the sentence,

429
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,380
these rational categories that have been put on us,

430
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,140
this sort of search for transcendence.

431
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,860
Is that what you're getting at?

432
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,460
It's a desire to use the intercategorical

433
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,060
to destroy the categories.

434
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,220
That's what, first of all, if you want to one simple,

435
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,140
not to destroy, but to undermine the categories.

436
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,060
If you want to understand postmodernism,

437
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,660
like you could, that's maybe one definition

438
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,300
of what postmodernism is.

439
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:22,300
It's the perception that the intercategorical,

440
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,180
the indefinite, you could use the word indefinite,

441
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,420
the indeterminate, you could use that word too,

442
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,220
that all of these categories,

443
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,220
they undermine the hierarchy of reasonable categories.

444
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,820
And so the image, all the images that you see now,

445
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,900
for example, like even the image of the stranger,

446
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,140
or the idea of the migrant as an intercategorical figure,

447
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,700
as a figure that it doesn't have his own identity

448
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,020
based on the place where he is.

449
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,020
He's a kind of exception to the rule.

450
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,580
He's, the migrant is someone that doesn't fit,

451
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,660
that isn't a citizen, that cannot be,

452
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,500
cannot be accounted for by the system.

453
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,580
Like all of these, all of these types,

454
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,180
all of these types of categories that are used

455
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:18,060
by postmodern thinkers are there to do that,

456
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,900
are there to undermine reason.

457
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,460
Okay, so just to clarify,

458
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,700
because of course, when we're talking about categorizing,

459
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,740
we're going back all the way to Aristotle.

460
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,460
So in what way, because my sense,

461
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,780
I don't know your thought very well,

462
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,820
but my sense is you're going to have more time

463
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,180
for the ancient Greeks.

464
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,180
So Aristotle was engaged in that practice of categorizing.

465
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,860
So how did the enlightenment go wrong in that sense?

466
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,820
Was it that Aristotle held categorizing

467
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,140
alongside the transcendent?

468
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,940
Is that why it went, it was acceptable?

469
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,460
No, it's, the problem with the enlightenment

470
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,740
is that it, at least on the face of it,

471
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,340
it wanted to, let's say, systematize,

472
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,540
turn the world into an encyclopedia, right?

473
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,300
You know, like, that's one of the reasons

474
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,440
why the encyclopedia was such a great part

475
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,700
of the enlightenment project.

476
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,480
It's like, we're going to define everything.

477
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,020
We're going to measure everything.

478
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,820
We're going to quantify everything.

479
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,580
And we'll have, we'll basically understand reality.

480
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,860
But it's ignoring an aspect,

481
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,700
which is that there are aspects of reality

482
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,120
which cannot be categorized for different reasons.

483
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,740
And one of that is the intercategorical, the monster.

484
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,800
The monster cannot be categorized.

485
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,640
That is one.

486
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,980
And then the other one is rather the transcategorical,

487
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,700
like, or the supracategorical,

488
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,020
that which gives, that which gives way for categories,

489
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,140
the infinite, you know, being itself,

490
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,780
or the different aspects that are beyond

491
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,260
simple analytical categories.

492
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:06,100
But what I'm saying is that in removing the religious part,

493
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,500
removing the transcendent aspect, what happened now,

494
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,420
and this is why postmodernism in some ways

495
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,980
is inevitable to the enlightenment,

496
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,660
is that need for that which is beyond reason

497
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,260
is not going away in people.

498
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,020
It's just part of how humans are,

499
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,500
but they can find it in the monster.

500
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Like they can find that titillation of the transgressive,

501
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,220
the titillation of that which is beyond categories

502
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,900
in the intercategorical, you know?

503
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,660
And so that's what you find in the, sorry.

504
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,660
So I get that.

505
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,780
I just still, I hear you saying that the enlightenment

506
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,820
we're trying to put everything away in their boxes,

507
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,660
but I'm not an Aristotle expert,

508
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,620
but I mean, he was engaged in that sort of activity

509
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,620
way back then, granted he had more openness to the transcendent,

510
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,620
but...

511
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,420
If there's nothing, no, but there's nothing wrong

512
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,500
with trying to categorize reality.

513
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,260
So as soon as you're getting rid of, yeah.

514
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,740
It's just as you tried, but ultimately.

515
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,140
Now, the problem, again, the issue with enlightenment

516
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,340
is not just that, is that the enlightenment already,

517
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,260
even at the outset, was not completely that project.

518
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,820
There's a dark side to the enlightenment,

519
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,820
which people call the counter-enlightenment.

520
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,620
And like you said, Kant is part of the enlightenment.

521
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,100
It's hilarious because ask Steven Hicks

522
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,820
if Kant is part of the enlightenment.

523
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,620
He'll tell you, no, Kant is the counter-enlightenment.

524
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,460
And so it's like this weird idea that the enlightenment thinkers,

525
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,700
there are aspects to them

526
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,540
that a lot of the modern enlightenment defenders don't like.

527
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,980
And they put them in what they call the counter-enlightenment,

528
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,340
which is in some ways aspects of what reason and magic

529
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,420
and hermeticism and all of this stuff,

530
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,620
which is like a weird parasite on the enlightenment

531
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,140
that you can't completely get rid of.

532
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,260
It continues on through characters like Swedenborg

533
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,260
or Jacob Berm or all of these esotericists

534
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,260
in the Western canon that are not opposite to the enlightenment.

535
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,180
They're the same people.

536
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,820
It's like Dick Duff spent a lot of his life

537
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,220
trying to contact the order of the Rosicross.

538
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,020
And it's like, so these are the same people.

539
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,660
They're not different types.

540
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,820
So there's this weird parasite in the enlightenment

541
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,820
of magic and esotericism and Freemasonry, all this stuff.

542
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,180
Freemasonry, yeah, interesting.

543
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,140
Now, there's loads we could get into,

544
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,020
but you brought up Pinkham,

545
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,340
and I was just reading his Enlightenment now.

546
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,580
And you were at the ARC conference.

547
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,580
I was at it back in October, and it does seem like...

548
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,180
I think people are tired of nihilism.

549
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,140
So there's not many that are good.

550
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,020
There's not many that are going for full-on nihilism these days.

551
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,980
You mentioned Islam and woke,

552
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,220
but it seems at least within the ARC crowd,

553
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,020
the main worldviews that are emerging are Christianity

554
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,180
and Enlightenment humanism.

555
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:19,180
And that's why I think your discussion with Lindsay

556
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:25,180
was so revealing, because, well, it revealed this crack,

557
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,580
and it'll be very interesting to see

558
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,980
where that goes over the next couple of years.

559
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,580
Now, that's a speculative question,

560
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,340
but do you have any thoughts on that?

561
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,940
Well, I want to say, first of all,

562
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,940
that I really admire James Lindsay.

563
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,340
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I want to...

564
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,340
I want it to be careful that, you know,

565
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,940
I mean, he went after me quite aggressively,

566
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,540
but I don't feel the same about him.

567
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,940
I think that the work that he's doing is really useful,

568
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,340
and that all the effort he's putting into helping people

569
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,340
see the kind of communistic stuff is amazing.

570
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,740
So I think that's important to really understand

571
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,740
because I actually don't have a problem with James Lindsay at all.

572
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,740
But what I do have a problem with, let's say,

573
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,740
I agree with him in terms of his attack on communism

574
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,740
and all the stuff, but I do not believe

575
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,740
that we can have a fully secular society

576
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,740
that I don't think that that's possible.

577
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,740
And I really do believe that the kind of secular humanism

578
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,740
that the Enlightenment proposed

579
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,740
ran aground.

580
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,740
It is not sufficient to hold societies together.

581
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,740
It's not sufficient to hold us together as people.

582
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:43,740
Now, the danger is we also cannot weaponize religion.

583
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,740
You can try.

584
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,740
But if you weaponize religion,

585
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,740
then you turn it into that which it is not.

586
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,740
That is, if you try to make religion

587
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,740
into something that will help you keep your society together,

588
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,740
then it will become an opportunity

589
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,740
and so the worship of God, you could say,

590
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,740
or the acknowledging of the absolutely transcendent

591
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,740
and our submission to it and our participation in it

592
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,740
is a good in itself.

593
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,740
And downstream from that,

594
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,740
you do have all the gifts of civilization that come with it.

595
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,740
And so on the one hand, how can I say this?

596
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,740
On the one hand, I see that James is afraid

597
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,740
of the weaponization of Christianity

598
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,740
in his attack on Christian nationalism.

599
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,740
But on the other hand,

600
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,740
I see him doing the exact same thing

601
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,740
in trying to get the Christians on board with him

602
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,740
so that he can create his democratic

603
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,740
so secular Enlightenment utopia,

604
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,740
which doesn't exist, which is not possible.

605
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,740
And so that's why I do believe

606
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,740
that the only solution to our predicament

607
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,740
is a true return to Christianity,

608
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,740
like not a pretend one, not a...

609
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,740
And that's why most of my interactions

610
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,740
are not political at all.

611
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,740
Then nothing to do with politics.

612
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,740
It's mostly trying to help people reconnect

613
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,740
with the deepest aspects of our tradition

614
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,740
to give them the right orientation

615
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,740
for the rest of their other participations.

616
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,740
By the way, if you want to know

617
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,740
if you're sure the culture war isn't over,

618
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,740
we're going to see a lot more of the conflict.

619
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,740
But in the end, the truth is that

620
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:29,740
the secularist voice is going to grow weaker and weaker

621
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,740
as things come.

622
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,740
And I don't say that.

623
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,740
I'm not saying that in a celebratory tone.

624
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,740
I just don't see any other way for the future.

625
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,740
And the question, again, is going to be

626
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,740
which one is which.

627
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,740
New religious perspective is going to be dominant.

628
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,740
And there are several possibilities.

629
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,740
One is a weird new globalist religion

630
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,740
that worships AI and the earth

631
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,740
and all this kind of stuff that we're seeing.

632
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,740
The other is Islam.

633
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,740
That is definitely a real possibility.

634
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,740
And the third is, I believe,

635
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,740
the possibility of some kind of Christian reawakening

636
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,740
to the roots of who we are

637
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:18,740
and all our ethics and all that we believe in

638
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:25,740
are writing on this ontology based on love

639
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,740
that Christianity presents,

640
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,740
like this idea that the world is held together by love,

641
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,740
that that is the mode of existence of reality.

642
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,740
Those are the possibilities.

643
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,740
I don't see, maybe there are others,

644
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,740
but those are the possibilities I see.

645
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,740
Yeah.

646
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,740
So let's get clear on what the concern is.

647
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,740
The concern from people like Lindsay

648
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,740
isn't that Christians are going to say vote pro-life

649
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,740
or something like that.

650
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,740
So try and influence politics in that way.

651
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,740
The concern must be that the Christians

652
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,740
are going to try and get in charge

653
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,740
and inflict their views on the rest of society.

654
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,740
Is that how you understand this

655
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,740
or push back against Christian nationalism?

656
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,740
That's possible.

657
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,740
I don't know if that's his complete,

658
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:20,740
like what the reason for his such a strong reaction.

659
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:29,740
Now, this is a difficult situation

660
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,740
that we find ourselves in,

661
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:35,740
because if we realize that that which affords

662
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:43,740
the type of freedom that you love is based in a way of being

663
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,740
that is Christian and it's based on a message

664
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:51,740
and a way of seeing the world that is basically Christian,

665
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:58,740
but you also don't want Christians to back off,

666
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,740
then you're ultimately going to lose the freedom that you love.

667
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,740
And so I understand that it's a difficult situation

668
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,740
because you also understand what somebody would not want

669
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:18,740
Christians to completely impose their worldview on others.

670
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,740
And so to be honest,

671
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,740
I don't completely know what the solution is,

672
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:29,740
but in the end, that's going to happen no matter what.

673
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,740
I don't know what to say.

674
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:36,740
If you think that whatever happened to COVID isn't coming back,

675
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,740
I mean, you have to be so naive.

676
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,740
What happened to COVID is going to happen again, folks.

677
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,740
What's that going to be?

678
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,740
I know it's going to be,

679
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,740
but what I mean is that the capacity to impose the world on us

680
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,740
and to impose the way we live and the way we,

681
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:59,740
and a kind of social credit system or some kind of something

682
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,740
is coming towards us at full speed.

683
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,740
Now, the question is, what do we have to mitigate that?

684
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:16,740
And I do believe that when I look at all the solutions in front of me,

685
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:25,740
I do believe that the foundation of Christian love is the best solution,

686
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,740
but I don't know how it's going to play out.

687
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,740
I also don't have that much hope that it's going to...

688
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:35,740
This is also maybe the reason why I don't totally understand Lindsay's thing

689
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,740
is that I don't really believe that even Christianity,

690
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,740
if it returns, at least in the short term,

691
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,740
at least for 150 years, 100 years,

692
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,740
is going to have the power to take over society.

693
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,740
It's mostly a way for people to be able to live

694
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,740
approximately in their families, in their communities,

695
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,740
in their parishes, in their more local settings

696
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,740
in order to be able to live the best life possible

697
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,740
and to make the most of things.

698
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,740
That's the way that I see it.

699
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,740
And in some ways, maybe plant a seed for the future,

700
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,740
but the idea of some kind of Christian fascism in the United States

701
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,740
I don't know, it's like I just don't see it.

702
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,740
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm naive.

703
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,740
I just do not see that as a...

704
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,740
So it's a real drarer sort of thing.

705
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,740
Yeah, it's more like it definitely is going to do wrong.

706
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,740
Yeah, yeah.

707
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,740
It's just a rather...

708
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,740
I totally agree on this idea,

709
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,740
like that in some ways that his Benedict option,

710
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,740
you know, not that if we're treating home society,

711
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,740
but rather being deliberate about your community,

712
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,740
about your choices, about what it is that you want to be,

713
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,740
is the way to go.

714
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,740
But I don't see it...

715
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,740
I don't think we're going to save the world.

716
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,740
Yeah, it's funny.

717
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,740
We had Oliver at Donovan on a few weeks ago.

718
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,740
He's arguably the top Christian political thinker

719
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,740
of the last 100 years.

720
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,740
And we put this to him partly,

721
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
but he was just like,

722
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,740
look, you have to deal with what's realistic.

723
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,740
And a return to Christendom is just not on the cards.

724
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,740
Now, I know plenty of people who are pushing for it.

725
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,740
I sort of knew Christendom, but certainly in his view,

726
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,740
it's not realistic.

727
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,740
But do you know many people that are pushing for it legitimately

728
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,740
or as an aesthetic?

729
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,740
I know there's a meme aspect to it,

730
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:27,740
which is the idea of pushing the idea of a Christian world

731
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,740
as a driving, as something that drives you, right?

732
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,740
As something that kind of gives you hope

733
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,740
and gives you a vision to move towards.

734
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,740
Maybe it's because I'm not in the same circle to you,

735
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,740
but I don't think I've ever met anyone who really thinks

736
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,740
that we're going to have a Christian emperor.

737
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,740
I don't know what exactly they can imagine.

738
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,740
Well, there's integralism from the Roman Catholic perspective.

739
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,740
I'm not Roman Catholic.

740
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,740
I don't know well.

741
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:58,740
No, in the strongest versions of it, as I understand it,

742
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,740
people like me, Protestants, we can survive,

743
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,740
but we're not allowed to share our views in public.

744
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,740
Again, that's in the strongest version.

745
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,740
Is that happening in the United States of America

746
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,740
or in Europe, in England?

747
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,740
Look, this isn't my view at all.

748
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,740
Exactly, I'm just naive.

749
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,740
Maybe there's a Christian emperor over the hill.

750
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,740
Who knows?

751
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,740
I just really do not see that as a possibility at all.

752
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,740
Yeah, I make a habit of speaking to people

753
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,740
with wildly different views from me.

754
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,740
This is one of the views that comes up,

755
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,740
but basically, what they'll say is that the problems

756
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,740
are that large, that that sort of solution.

757
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,740
I'm just going to get very dark before that solution is available.

758
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,740
I'm not defending it.

759
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,740
I'm just saying some people say it.

760
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,740
Sorry, do you want to say something?

761
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,740
No, if they say it's going to get very dark

762
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,740
in the sense that things are going to get so completely out of control

763
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,740
that people are going to desire a Christian,

764
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:11,740
that the nation will yearn for a kind of Christian culture,

765
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,740
then maybe, but that's not anytime soon.

766
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,740
And if that happens, then that'll happen.

767
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,740
I mean, it's like, if it happens that people see how dark

768
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,740
our kind of nihilistic freedoms can become

769
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,740
and that they turn their heart to the Lord,

770
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:37,740
like Nineveh, all of people turning towards a better morality,

771
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,740
let's say, then I don't see why that would be a problem.

772
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,740
That would just be what happens.

773
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,740
But the idea of some Christian king that comes

774
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,740
and just imposes it on everybody, that's ridiculous.

775
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,740
I don't see that's the most ridiculous.

776
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,740
But they don't, it's not a king.

777
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,740
It's sort of a, it's a new elite they have in mind.

778
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,740
Again, it's not my view.

779
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,740
So McGillchrist, just brief few final questions.

780
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,740
McGillchrist, we had Ian on a month or two ago.

781
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,740
I'm reading, I'm in the middle of the matter of things.

782
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,740
So I read Master and the Mystery years ago.

783
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,740
I'm in the matter of things now.

784
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,740
I'm going to go as far as say I'm almost a disciple of him,

785
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,740
because I'm so obsessed with his thought.

786
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,740
And I think he's on point.

787
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,740
And he just seems to be saying something similar to you,

788
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,740
that we need reason and intuition, reason and mystery.

789
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,740
No, I totally agree.

790
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,740
I definitely agree with McGillchrist.

791
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,740
I also interviewed him once on my own channel.

792
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,740
I think that we are very similar in terms of our perspective.

793
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,740
And, you know, a lot of the cognitive psychologist types,

794
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,740
John Revekey as well and in our Bernardo Castro,

795
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:53,740
and there are several right now that are just showing

796
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,740
the inevitability of this question.

797
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,740
Like that we cannot, that the idea that analytic processes

798
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,740
and this kind of, that is not sufficient to human experience,

799
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,740
that there is an entire other aspect,

800
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,740
which is the grasping, which is the intuition,

801
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,740
which is the seeming of the shining meaning

802
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,740
that is beyond the multiplicity.

803
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,740
This holistic, let's say, vision of the world.

804
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:25,740
This is, you know, not only is it accounted for in every single

805
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,740
religion and tradition from the beginning of time,

806
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:32,740
but now, like I said, it seems from the cognitive psychologist

807
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,740
that they're realizing this is inevitable.

808
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,740
You know, and I think I'm not, I don't have the courage

809
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,740
to get into the matter of things,

810
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,740
because even when I contemplate the brick, like I, like, who, who.

811
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,740
I know, I thought the same way, but it's amazing.

812
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,740
It's, I'm just obsessed.

813
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,740
I've put a copy that I'm giving it to everyone in my department.

814
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,740
We're going to read and discuss it.

815
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,740
It's really quite something.

816
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,740
I think, so I'm really on board with McGillchrist,

817
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,740
but I do think, though, that in terms of the analytic tradition,

818
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,740
as you know, there was something of a renaissance

819
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,740
of Christian philosophy of religion in the last 60 years.

820
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:13,740
Alvin Plankton, Richard Swinburne, Eleanor Stump,

821
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,740
William Lane Creeks, the big popularizer.

822
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,740
I do think, though, there is, there's a lot to be said

823
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,740
for the work they've done, and they can at least present

824
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,740
the Christian faith in a way that connects with

825
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,740
the sort of Lindsay Boghossian outlook.

826
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,740
No, I put it to Pete last week, and he was like,

827
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,740
yeah, I just don't think their arguments are good,

828
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,740
but I mean, their arguments are being taken seriously

829
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,740
by really top analytic philosophers,

830
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,740
ones who aren't even theists.

831
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,740
Well, maybe I'm not, I'm not, myself,

832
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,740
I'm not a big fan of that type of argumentation,

833
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,740
but it's also because I'm a, you know,

834
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,740
I really come from a more mystical tradition,

835
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:56,740
like orthodoxy, I think I have a beauty-first approach,

836
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,740
let's say, to the question, you know,

837
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,740
and I think that that's why I'm closer to the cognitive psychologist,

838
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,740
let's say, in terms of a phenomenological point of view,

839
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,740
you know, the idea that there are certain ways

840
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,740
in which reality, you know, lays itself out to us

841
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,740
that have this dance, right, that have this pattern in it,

842
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,740
and we can't completely, we can't ignore it

843
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,740
because it is the structure of our experience.

844
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:27,740
So I tend to go there more to kind of outlay

845
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,740
the structure of our experience and show how it is captured

846
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:35,740
in the, let's say, the liturgical life of the church

847
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,740
in the aiming towards mystery, right,

848
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,740
this idea of that there's something, you know,

849
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,740
there's something hidden behind the veil

850
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,740
that is making everything exist

851
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:51,740
and you can't completely capture it, right,

852
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,740
it eludes our capacity to analyze it.

853
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,740
Anyway, so that's been my approach,

854
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,740
but I mean, I'm happy that if that type of argumentation

855
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,740
can help some people, you know.

856
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,740
Yeah, yeah, I got that.

857
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,740
I think the final point is,

858
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,740
because we always have this problem

859
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,740
with false teachers and false prophets.

860
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,740
I mean, my own history is a complicated one.

861
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,740
As a teenager, I was mentored by a guy who claimed to be a prophet

862
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,740
and he turned out to be, I think, a sociopath.

863
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,740
He was exposed two years ago

864
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,740
when he stole a church worth $60 million

865
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,740
and blamed it on the Holy Spirit

866
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,740
and it was in the newspapers and everything.

867
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,740
So, I've seen these guys that appeal to mystery

868
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,740
and, of course, this guy appeals even now.

869
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,740
He's appealing to the Holy Spirit as to why he necked this church

870
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,740
and I think one thing that we can do with reason

871
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,740
and one of the reasons I've benefited from being trained

872
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:51,740
in the analytic tradition, even though I'm very aware of its weakness,

873
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,740
the sort of McGilchrist-like weaknesses,

874
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:58,740
is that you can spot the BS, basically.

875
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,740
You definitely need to spot the BS.

876
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,740
That's one of the reasons for tradition.

877
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:11,740
Tradition is there to help you also, let's say, spot the BS

878
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:16,740
because there's a manner in which the people that say they're prophets,

879
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,740
they can't just fly off the handle.

880
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,740
They can't just do whatever they want

881
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,740
because they have to be down in a certain way of being in a certain tradition.

882
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,740
So, tradition helps to prevent that kind of stuff.

883
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,740
There's a method of discernment, let's say.

884
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,740
I'm not Catholic, but in the Catholic Church, for example,

885
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,740
they actually have quite a method of discernment

886
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,740
to be able to know if someone's visions are legitimate.

887
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:50,740
I think it's a little even too, let's say, rigorous,

888
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,740
but it's pretty rigorous.

889
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,740
If you want to have some kind of recognition

890
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,740
as someone who has visions,

891
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:00,740
they'll send someone to study you for months

892
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,740
and they'll ask you all the questions

893
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,740
and they'll try to figure out what intentions you have

894
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,740
and what it is that's motivating you

895
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:14,740
and they can discern the spirits, let's say.

896
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,740
But you're right that, for sure,

897
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,740
the world of religion has always been a world of bullshit.

898
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,740
There's no way around that.

899
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,740
The question is, this is the problem again with the whole thing.

900
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:31,740
It's like the world of religion has always been available

901
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:36,740
to those who want to trick others and use bullshit.

902
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,740
So then what?

903
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,740
So now you just cast it aside, you just say

904
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,740
that because some people use mystery to trick people,

905
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,740
therefore there is no mystery,

906
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,740
or because some people are dishonest in their religious approach

907
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,740
to use people's desire to follow, for example,

908
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,740
to deceive them and use that to make money

909
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,740
or to get sexual favors or whatever,

910
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,740
you're not going to get rid of people's desire to follow.

911
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:08,740
And so either they follow the stupid idiotic guru

912
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,740
or they follow Taylor Swift

913
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:14,740
or they follow whatever nonsense on TikTok.

914
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,740
So what are they going to follow?

915
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,740
And that's again, that's one of the blind spots again,

916
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,740
is to say, well, if people could all just be reasonable,

917
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,740
reasonable like me,

918
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,740
then we would have no problems.

919
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,740
But that's just not how it is.

920
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,740
Yeah, it's throwing the baby out with the bath water.

921
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:39,740
Yes, you have holy oils coming from saints

922
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:42,740
that are recognized as being virtuous

923
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:46,740
and true to the transcendent,

924
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,740
and people take them and they sometimes use them in words

925
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,740
or maybe a little superstitious, that's possible.

926
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:57,740
You have that or you have like the new age shop

927
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,740
and people go and get crystals

928
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,740
and we don't know what it's related to.

929
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,740
It has no connection to the rest of our engagement with reality.

930
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,740
I know that that might sound like I'm being cynical,

931
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,740
but I'm not being cynical.

932
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:15,740
I'm actually seeing that people need these markers of participation.

933
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,740
They just need them.

934
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,740
Yeah, and I believe you're Orthodox,

935
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,740
so you have that sense of tradition.

936
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:24,740
I think the problem is in a lot of the non-dom Protestant churches,

937
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,740
they just don't have a sense of tradition.

938
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,740
They've got the Apostles Creed and whatever,

939
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,740
but after that it's just the Bible

940
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:34,740
and there is no sort of inherited wisdom.

941
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,740
Jonathan Paju, thank you so much.

942
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,740
That was a very rich and very discussion.

943
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,740
Thank you very much for joining us.

944
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,740
I hope it was useful.

945
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,740
Brilliant, man.

946
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,740
