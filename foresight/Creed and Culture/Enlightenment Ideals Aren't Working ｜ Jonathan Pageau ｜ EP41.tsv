0	2760	On the one hand, I see that James is afraid
2760	4840	of the weaponization of Christianity
4840	7480	in his attack on Christian nationalism.
7480	10560	But on the other hand, I see him doing the exact same thing
10560	13720	in trying to get the Christians on board with him
13720	18040	so that he can create his democratic secular enlightenment
18040	22280	utopia, which doesn't exist, which is not possible.
22280	27240	And so that's why I do believe that the only solution
27280	32280	to our predicament is a true return to Christianity,
32560	34880	like not a pretend one, not a unit.
34880	37280	And that's why most of my interactions
37280	38560	are not political at all.
42200	46160	Jonathan Pajot, you have risen in prominence
46160	48040	over the last couple of years.
48040	52120	In part, I think, because of your work with JBP,
52120	55360	what is the sort of the message that you're sharing
55400	57720	with people that is getting through,
57720	59320	that's cutting through, that's connecting?
59320	62080	Briefly, what are you saying that's getting through?
63560	65400	Well, I think that we're in a situation
65400	70400	where people are finding that the promises of the enlightenment
70840	73480	or the promises of the scientific revolution
73480	77240	are, although they have brought some great success
77240	79800	in terms of material wealth and in terms of comfort,
79800	81800	all of this is actually quite wonderful
81800	83840	that there seems to be something missing,
83840	86600	which is a connection to meaning, to purpose.
86600	89360	And we also struggle to understand
89360	92280	how and why it is that we exist together.
92280	95640	And so it seems like it's an interesting time
95640	96880	to be able to speak into this
96880	100920	and to help people re-understand our religious stories,
100920	104280	the mythologies, the images, the icons,
104280	107160	the structures of meaning that informed our ancestors
107160	110200	for thousands of years and how they can actually help us,
110200	113600	first of all, understand why it is we need that,
113600	116560	why it is we need purpose and meaning and cohesion,
116560	118280	and how it is that these stories,
118280	121360	and also especially the participation that comes from them,
121360	125360	can help us reconnect and find meaning again.
125360	127120	Brilliant, there's a huge amount in there.
127120	128800	Now, just for our viewers and listeners,
128800	133560	your background is as an icon maker.
133560	134520	What's the verb?
134520	135480	How do you describe yourself?
135480	137000	Yeah, I mean, I guess you could say,
137000	139800	I mean, icon carver, icon maker,
139800	143760	but it's really important to understand the icon making
143760	145720	as an application of a worldview
145720	148960	that I embraced a very long time ago.
148960	152320	And so it, I mean, I'm happy to take that title,
152320	153760	but it isn't somewhere as reductive
153760	156280	because the, like I said,
156280	160000	in some ways it was discovering a cohesive worldview
160000	162600	and embracing it and participating in it
162600	165040	that led me to want to apply that in my life
165040	166400	at different levels.
166400	169280	And one of them ended up being professionally
169280	171360	as making images for churches.
171360	173040	As I understood the images
173040	175480	and as I kind of understood this web of meaning
175480	178120	that is there in the Christian tradition,
178120	179840	it was a way to apply it practically,
179840	182800	and not just it'd be like a mental game that I engage with.
182800	187680	Right, but you were an artist before that, right?
187680	191680	Yes, I studied art in school,
191680	193160	but then I kind of abandoned art
193160	198160	and then went on a long arc of studying of reading
198960	202000	and ultimately coming back to traditional art.
202000	203680	Okay, gotcha.
203680	206120	Now, Jonathan, about a month ago,
206120	209160	we had James Lindsay on the podcast.
209160	211080	We had a fantastic discussion.
212360	214600	And you had a bit of a disagreement,
214600	219600	which I think is really cuts to some of the core issues
220560	224100	in the public debate at the moment.
224100	225920	So let's get into that.
225960	228120	On Twitter, you wrote,
228120	231800	the future is religious,
231800	233920	and no one can stop that anymore.
234960	238040	The question remaining is what that religiosity
238040	240120	will be turned toward?
240120	242480	Do you want to just unpack that for us
242480	247360	and give a sense of the way in which Lindsay
247360	249040	disagreed with you?
249040	252800	Yeah, I don't even remember exactly
252800	254520	how the argument started.
254520	257120	I mean, he came after me for something I wrote,
257120	259080	but I think he identified me first of all
259080	261680	with something that he had in his mind,
261680	262960	which is Christian nationalism
262960	264400	and kind of identified me with that
264400	267400	and therefore framed the things I was saying
267400	269320	in that perspective.
269320	273240	But it's related to what I said at the outset,
273240	277720	which is that we're noticing the religious crash
277720	282000	back into our story and whether you see it,
282000	283580	whether it's through woke ideology,
283580	286540	whether it is through worship of the environment,
286540	289620	whether it is its worship of the state,
289620	291620	and whether it's going to be worship of AI.
291620	293220	It doesn't really matter.
293220	295260	There seems to be different ways
295260	296540	in which this is coming back,
296540	299540	or whether it is like your uneducated aunt
299540	302780	that goes to the new age shop and has crystals
302780	305100	and has all this kind of stuff in their house.
305100	308940	The idea is that people are looking for ways
308940	311940	to make sense of their world, which is beyond reason.
312940	316220	It is beyond reason because it also has to encompass
316220	317860	the manner in which there's coherence,
317860	319100	the manner in which we come together,
319100	323220	the manner in which we align ourselves with our purposes
323220	325300	and the purposes of others in the world,
325300	329700	and that ends up looking like religious participation
329700	330980	or religious affiliation
330980	334140	because it has to do with celebration.
334140	336820	Like we actually follow that which we celebrate.
336820	338740	We live in that which we celebrate
338740	341420	and that ends up looking like religion.
341540	343420	It's like, what do you worship basically?
343420	344980	What do you put as the highest?
344980	346380	And what do you celebrate?
346380	348500	And so without traditional religions,
348500	350460	we end up with weird things like Earth Day
350460	355460	and LGBT Month and just this constant desire
356100	360420	to have insert holidays and celebrations
360420	363860	that are re-injecting religiosity into the world.
363860	368860	So my contention is that this is happening to us.
369860	372140	You know, the Enlightenment model,
372140	374220	the Enlightenment idea that we could all just be
374220	378260	rationalistic individuals like that live next to each other
378260	379340	is not working.
379340	380700	That gives the suburbs.
380700	383140	It gives the urban sprawl.
383140	385220	It gives the breakdown of the family.
385220	388580	It gives the breakdown of communities
388580	391220	and it turns us into these little consumers
391220	393700	that live next to each other but don't know each other
393700	394980	and don't interact with each other.
394980	398060	And everybody's feeling like that is not sufficient
398060	401260	because people are depressed, people are miserable
401260	402820	and they're looking for something more.
402820	405820	Now the question is, what is that going to be?
405820	407700	There's no, like I said,
407700	408860	I don't think there's a way around it.
408860	410180	Is it going to be Islam?
410180	414660	Is it going to be all these weird new kind of religiosities
414660	416820	that we see in globalism?
417980	421940	You know, I do believe that Christianity is our best bet
421940	426940	as Westerners and as let's say people who want to be able
426940	429700	to preserve the best of what the Enlightenment has given us
429700	434140	because the Enlightenment has provided powerful things
434140	435700	but it's insufficient.
435700	437580	It's not enough to hold people together.
437580	442580	It tends towards the problems we're seeing now.
443460	448460	Okay, so how are we understanding the word the Enlightenment?
449580	452700	We're talking about the sort of 17th, 18th century
453580	455660	movement in Europe.
455660	459940	We have in mind figures like Kant, David Hume, Newton.
459940	463540	Do you want to expand on what you have in mind there?
463540	465300	Yeah, and so, I mean, the Enlightenment
466460	469180	is properly understood as a continuation of a movement
469180	470580	that started, let's say, in the Renaissance
470580	472220	with the Scientific Revolution.
472220	477220	In some ways, it is the winning of reason,
479140	482220	like the notion that human beings are reasonable
482300	486060	and that reason is the way by which we're going to exist
486060	489220	and then applying that thinking, that reason,
489220	493940	and also the methods of scientific exploration
493940	495900	and analysis to the world.
495900	499900	And so we have a method in order to be able
499900	503180	to predict phenomena, to be able to understand phenomena.
503180	506700	We have a method by which we can analyze things
506700	509300	and that method is very powerful
509300	512340	and it yields power.
512340	513700	Like it's the best way to understand it.
513700	516580	It yields more capacity to control
516580	521580	and to manage reality, manage physical reality,
522380	525940	make spaceships, make all the things that we enjoy,
525940	527380	which are quite wonderful.
528660	531580	But there's also a blind spot in that.
531580	533820	There's a blind spot in this Enlightenment,
533820	536300	especially as it moves towards secularism
536300	538980	and especially as it moves towards atheism.
538980	540900	Because there's a sense in which we start to believe
540900	545500	that this reason and this capacity for reason is ultimate
546420	548100	and that it's sufficient.
548100	550220	And then we apply it, we apply it, we apply it,
550220	551820	but the problem actually happens
551820	554780	when we start to then turn it on ourselves.
554780	557660	When we come to the point where we now have to understand
557660	561820	ourselves as agents, as conscious beings,
561820	565260	then reason starts to become loopy.
565260	570220	It starts to not completely be enough,
570220	574140	especially when understanding how identities function.
574140	575820	Reason does not provide identity.
575820	578580	Reason provides analysis for identities
578580	580180	that are already given.
580180	583660	But the identity is seen to be a given
583660	586260	or to come, to use religious language.
586260	587180	They come from heaven.
587180	589300	Like you knew the identity before
589300	591300	you can apply the methods of science.
591980	596980	And so because of that, it leaves humans
598620	603620	with something missing in their experience
604900	607940	that they know is real, that they experience all the time,
607940	612140	but that cannot be contained by this process.
612140	613420	Yeah.
613420	617100	So one descriptor that's used
617100	619260	for the Enlightenment is the Age of Reason.
619260	620900	Now I really just like this
620900	622740	because I love the medieval figures.
622740	625740	And of course the medieval figures like Aquinas,
625740	629300	Scotus, Occam, early medieval like Anselm,
629300	631940	I mean, these guys use the reason.
631940	636940	So in what sense is reason really triumphant enlightenment?
637900	640540	Some people say that it's reason
640540	643700	plus the throwing off of authority.
643700	646420	Religious authority, Alistair McIntyre thinks
647140	650940	it's reason plus throwing off the fixed sense
650940	653220	of human nature.
653220	654060	Yeah.
654060	655660	Well, it's religion and pride.
655660	659740	It's the pride, sorry, it's the pride of reason.
659740	661780	It's the best way to understand it.
661780	665300	And so the manner in which the medieval's understood reason
665300	669940	was that it was derivative and manifested
669940	672060	by something transcendent.
672060	675940	Like a mystery which is beyond understanding
675980	678020	which reveals itself in reason.
678020	680220	And so there's always an aspect of the real
680220	681940	which it cannot be probed.
681940	684340	And you'll find that in all the medieval,
684340	687020	you know, whether west or east or west,
687020	690300	there's something beyond reason that cannot be probed
690300	694800	and it gives to reason and reason flows out of it.
696140	698900	And what it does is that it means
698900	701740	that reason is not sufficient.
701740	704860	Reason does not contain all things.
704860	708620	And what it also, how can I say this?
708620	713620	It also eliminates the problem of the pride of reason.
714260	716380	And so in the Enlightenment, the idea is like,
716380	719220	we can do this, we are the ones, we have it.
719220	722260	We try to contain reality within reason.
722260	726100	And sometimes it's the beginning of a revolutionary trope.
726100	729220	It's the beginning of the revolutionary structure
729220	733940	where the human tries to take from God, right?
733940	737300	The top of the hierarchy tries to say, no, we are the top.
737300	740060	We are the ones who can, with our reason
740060	742460	and our mind can analyze the world.
742460	747340	But as soon as that happens, then things start to devolve.
747340	750380	And you find yourself, at the end of that process,
750380	752900	you find yourself in a situation
752900	754460	that is not reasonable at all,
754460	757060	that is actually completely unreasonable,
757060	758740	but not unreasonable in the sense
758740	761580	that God is beyond reason, unreasonable in the sense
761620	765340	that our passions and our desires and our whims
765340	767500	end up ruling in the end.
767500	772500	And so this, in my conflict with Lindsay,
774620	776620	I quoted Goya's famous statement,
776620	778260	here's a print by Goya,
778260	781300	which says, the sleep of reason produces monsters.
782180	784900	Or the dream of reason produces monsters, right?
785940	789700	And that is the situation that we find ourselves in,
789700	792740	is that having insisted so much on reason
792740	794540	and having pushed to the margin
794540	797340	the things which are not reasonable,
797340	801860	they at some point, that unreason just crashes back in.
801860	804100	And like you said, in the medieval world,
804100	808060	that unreason or that which exceeds reason
808060	809900	would in some ways have been pushed up
809900	811740	towards the glory of God, right?
811740	815300	Would have been something like the excess of a church
815300	817820	in a village, like the golden,
817820	820740	all of this kind of unreasonable excess
820740	822900	that we experience in reality,
822900	824660	we give it up as glory to God.
824660	826260	But if you don't do that,
826260	830180	then it turns into the hybrid demons
830180	831700	that come in poke you at night,
831700	836700	like all these freaks and intermediary beings
837820	840140	that start to appear in the world
840140	843180	and will try to destroy reason that way.
843180	844940	Interesting, yeah.
844940	847180	Yeah, I mean, it certainly doesn't seem to me
847220	850260	that this sort of standards of racial inquiry
851340	854500	got much better with the Enlightenment.
854500	856740	It doesn't strike me that Hume is any smarter
856740	860100	than Occam or Aquinas,
860100	862820	but certainly I like your way of describing it
862820	867580	as this elevating reason, the pride of reason.
867580	870620	And I guess I put this actually to Pete Boghossian as well.
870620	875620	Last week, this idea that we need both reason and mystery,
875660	878180	because that's roughly kind of what you're getting at.
878180	881940	And is your criticism, or not even your criticism,
881940	883620	your understanding of Lindsay,
883620	884860	and to some extent, Pete,
884860	888700	is they just want to have reason, is that right?
888700	889740	Well, that's what you see.
889740	893660	And you see that in the Stephen Hicks,
893660	898660	Pete Pinker, Lindsay, all of that crew,
898780	903780	they have this, in my impression, a twisted image,
904580	906100	first of all, of what humans are,
906100	908500	and second of all, of how reality works.
908500	913100	And it can look very convincing at the outset,
913100	916680	because what they're saying is, if we were reasonable,
917580	918820	if we were just reasonable,
918820	921260	then we would have a perfect society, wouldn't we?
922260	924340	And so it's one of those like,
924340	927380	communism has never been tried problems,
927380	930060	which is that humans are not only reasonable.
930060	934220	Reality cannot be limited to that, which is reasonable.
934220	938700	And it just cannot, even epistemologically,
938700	941620	we cannot access all of reality through reason.
941620	944660	And we're starting to know that even scientifically,
944660	947580	this point, is that we cannot quantify all things.
947580	950980	We cannot analyze all of reality.
950980	953460	There always has to be some miracle,
953460	956140	whether the miracle is the big bang or whatever,
956140	959980	or something at the outset that is not part of the system,
960540	963340	that is just an inevitable aspect
963340	965060	of how being lays itself out.
966500	971140	And so it becomes difficult because they'll say,
971140	974780	if we were only reasonable and reasonable individuals,
974780	977980	then all things would work, but we are not that.
977980	979700	Human beings are not just that,
979700	981940	they are that to some extent.
981940	984300	And so then again, it has this problem.
984300	986740	It's like, if you have a blind spot,
986740	989620	you have this blind spot, which is the aspect,
989620	991740	unreasonable aspect, whether you understand it
991740	993500	as that which is beyond reason
993500	995100	or that which is below reason,
995100	996420	there's an aspect of reality,
996420	998660	which cannot be reduced to reason.
998660	1001580	If you just keep it on the side as a blind spot,
1001580	1004740	at some point it comes crashing back in.
1004740	1007100	And so then you can complain as much as you want
1007100	1010260	about like crazy leftists
1010260	1013420	or kind of our intercategories
1013420	1016540	that are smashing into our world and hybridization
1017020	1020940	and all of this weird stuff that we're seeing happening,
1020940	1024540	but that is what's going to happen.
1024540	1026820	Yeah, and this is what's happened to Dawkins as well.
1026820	1028100	Of course, he was, I mean,
1028100	1030460	at this sort of rational scientific utopia,
1030460	1034060	but then what was it, back in 2014,
1034060	1037580	he lost his Humanist of the Year award
1037580	1040540	because of something he'd said about men
1040540	1042020	not being able to become women or something.
1042020	1043620	Yeah, because he didn't want to play that.
1043620	1045180	So that's a great example.
1045180	1048060	Like the great example of what happens
1048060	1052020	if you don't have the proper mystery at the outset,
1052020	1054700	at the beginning of your reasonable process,
1054700	1058100	then you'll have other mysteries that will be inserted,
1058100	1061340	other dogmas and other aporias and contradictions.
1061340	1063500	And so someone will say exactly that,
1063500	1067060	like a man can be a woman straight faced and look at you.
1067060	1069580	And what they're yearning for,
1069580	1071180	like what they're desiring for,
1071180	1073500	it's something like the Trinity, for example.
1073500	1075820	It's something like there is a mystery
1075820	1079220	about how unity and multiplicity coexist
1079220	1082660	and how they infinitely coexist
1082660	1085820	because we can't completely account
1085820	1088660	for the man in which one and many function
1088660	1090540	in our experience of the world.
1090540	1093460	And so we perceive, we have insight
1093460	1097620	about an infinite, transcendent way
1097620	1100180	in which those two are joined together.
1100180	1102260	And so that's the kind of mystery
1103020	1104780	that the medieval, for example,
1104780	1106820	could see as the outlet of reality.
1106820	1107780	But if you don't have that,
1107780	1112060	then you'll end up with a man as a woman.
1112060	1114660	Yeah, so I get unity and multiplicity
1114660	1116500	when it comes to the Trinity.
1116500	1118820	How's the man as a woman,
1118820	1122060	how's the desire for unity and multiplicity
1122060	1123140	being expressed there?
1123140	1126500	It's the desire for something to be itself and not itself.
1126500	1129900	It's the desire for something to be,
1129900	1132420	how can they say this, to be trans categorical?
1133580	1134420	Right?
1134420	1135540	And you can see it, by the way,
1135540	1138220	you probably know about the trans is sacred
1138220	1143300	like aspect that has happened over the last few years.
1143300	1145620	And there was the,
1146620	1148700	and even when they put on a version of,
1151580	1152980	what was it?
1152980	1155900	They put on a play with,
1155900	1158620	why is it my brain sometimes breaks down?
1158620	1161420	What's the name of the woman who was a knight
1161420	1163260	in the 14th century?
1164180	1165020	Joan of Arc.
1165020	1168060	They put on a play of Joan of Arc where Joan of Arc is trans.
1168060	1170900	And in the beginning of the play,
1170900	1175100	he, she says, I am one in many.
1175100	1176860	I am beyond category.
1176860	1178340	I am sacred.
1178340	1179380	I am like God.
1179380	1180220	I am.
1181340	1183460	And she literally says I am
1183460	1186780	because she's using the categories
1186780	1189860	of trans-rational infinite,
1189860	1193460	but applying it to what is intercategorical.
1193460	1195860	And so that's the problem that happens.
1195860	1197820	That's why postmodernism was like
1197820	1201940	an inevitable side effect of the enlightenment.
1201940	1203900	And this is obviously something that people
1203900	1206340	like Pinker and Lindsay and all these guys won't like,
1206340	1210180	but that he himself said that his project
1210180	1211500	was the enlightenment.
1211500	1214220	He believed that his project was the continuation
1214220	1217540	of the enlightenment because there's this reaching
1217540	1219260	into the intercategorical.
1221620	1224300	Do you understand how the intercategorical is like
1224300	1229300	is a trick to make you confuse that which transcends reason?
1231300	1233780	Because that's what intercategorical things do
1233780	1235460	is that the elude reason.
1236740	1237580	Okay.
1237580	1239700	So let's just get this clear.
1239700	1242420	Because so categories, what I'm hearing is that
1242420	1245740	in the transgender move, it's this desire to throw off
1245740	1249900	these, finish the sentence,
1249900	1252380	these rational categories that have been put on us,
1252380	1255140	this sort of search for transcendence.
1255140	1256860	Is that what you're getting at?
1257860	1262460	It's a desire to use the intercategorical
1262460	1264060	to destroy the categories.
1264060	1266220	That's what, first of all, if you want to one simple,
1266220	1270140	not to destroy, but to undermine the categories.
1270180	1273060	If you want to understand postmodernism,
1273060	1275660	like you could, that's maybe one definition
1275660	1277300	of what postmodernism is.
1277300	1282300	It's the perception that the intercategorical,
1282300	1286180	the indefinite, you could use the word indefinite,
1286180	1288420	the indeterminate, you could use that word too,
1288420	1290220	that all of these categories,
1290220	1295220	they undermine the hierarchy of reasonable categories.
1296220	1300820	And so the image, all the images that you see now,
1300820	1303900	for example, like even the image of the stranger,
1303900	1308140	or the idea of the migrant as an intercategorical figure,
1308140	1312700	as a figure that it doesn't have his own identity
1312700	1314020	based on the place where he is.
1314020	1316020	He's a kind of exception to the rule.
1316020	1319580	He's, the migrant is someone that doesn't fit,
1319580	1323660	that isn't a citizen, that cannot be,
1323700	1326500	cannot be accounted for by the system.
1326500	1328580	Like all of these, all of these types,
1328580	1333180	all of these types of categories that are used
1333180	1338060	by postmodern thinkers are there to do that,
1338060	1340900	are there to undermine reason.
1340900	1342460	Okay, so just to clarify,
1342460	1344700	because of course, when we're talking about categorizing,
1344700	1346740	we're going back all the way to Aristotle.
1346740	1350460	So in what way, because my sense,
1350460	1351780	I don't know your thought very well,
1351780	1355820	but my sense is you're going to have more time
1355820	1357180	for the ancient Greeks.
1357180	1362180	So Aristotle was engaged in that practice of categorizing.
1362460	1366860	So how did the enlightenment go wrong in that sense?
1366860	1368820	Was it that Aristotle held categorizing
1368820	1372140	alongside the transcendent?
1372140	1374940	Is that why it went, it was acceptable?
1374940	1379460	No, it's, the problem with the enlightenment
1379460	1383740	is that it, at least on the face of it,
1383740	1387340	it wanted to, let's say, systematize,
1387340	1390540	turn the world into an encyclopedia, right?
1390540	1392300	You know, like, that's one of the reasons
1392300	1394440	why the encyclopedia was such a great part
1394440	1395700	of the enlightenment project.
1395700	1397480	It's like, we're going to define everything.
1397480	1399020	We're going to measure everything.
1399020	1400820	We're going to quantify everything.
1400820	1404580	And we'll have, we'll basically understand reality.
1405780	1407860	But it's ignoring an aspect,
1407860	1411700	which is that there are aspects of reality
1411700	1416120	which cannot be categorized for different reasons.
1416120	1419740	And one of that is the intercategorical, the monster.
1419740	1421800	The monster cannot be categorized.
1421800	1422640	That is one.
1422640	1425980	And then the other one is rather the transcategorical,
1425980	1427700	like, or the supracategorical,
1427700	1432020	that which gives, that which gives way for categories,
1432020	1434140	the infinite, you know, being itself,
1434980	1437780	or the different aspects that are beyond
1437780	1440260	simple analytical categories.
1441100	1446100	But what I'm saying is that in removing the religious part,
1446460	1449500	removing the transcendent aspect, what happened now,
1449500	1452420	and this is why postmodernism in some ways
1452420	1454980	is inevitable to the enlightenment,
1454980	1459660	is that need for that which is beyond reason
1459660	1462260	is not going away in people.
1462300	1465020	It's just part of how humans are,
1465020	1468500	but they can find it in the monster.
1468500	1473500	Like they can find that titillation of the transgressive,
1473540	1476220	the titillation of that which is beyond categories
1476220	1478900	in the intercategorical, you know?
1478900	1482660	And so that's what you find in the, sorry.
1482660	1483660	So I get that.
1483660	1486780	I just still, I hear you saying that the enlightenment
1486780	1489820	we're trying to put everything away in their boxes,
1489820	1491660	but I'm not an Aristotle expert,
1491660	1495620	but I mean, he was engaged in that sort of activity
1495620	1500620	way back then, granted he had more openness to the transcendent,
1500780	1502620	but...
1502620	1504420	If there's nothing, no, but there's nothing wrong
1504420	1506500	with trying to categorize reality.
1506500	1508260	So as soon as you're getting rid of, yeah.
1508260	1510740	It's just as you tried, but ultimately.
1510740	1514140	Now, the problem, again, the issue with enlightenment
1514140	1517340	is not just that, is that the enlightenment already,
1517340	1521260	even at the outset, was not completely that project.
1521820	1523820	There's a dark side to the enlightenment,
1523820	1527820	which people call the counter-enlightenment.
1527820	1529620	And like you said, Kant is part of the enlightenment.
1529620	1533100	It's hilarious because ask Steven Hicks
1533100	1534820	if Kant is part of the enlightenment.
1534820	1537620	He'll tell you, no, Kant is the counter-enlightenment.
1538580	1542460	And so it's like this weird idea that the enlightenment thinkers,
1542460	1543700	there are aspects to them
1543700	1548540	that a lot of the modern enlightenment defenders don't like.
1548540	1551980	And they put them in what they call the counter-enlightenment,
1551980	1556340	which is in some ways aspects of what reason and magic
1556340	1559420	and hermeticism and all of this stuff,
1559420	1562620	which is like a weird parasite on the enlightenment
1562620	1564140	that you can't completely get rid of.
1564140	1567260	It continues on through characters like Swedenborg
1567260	1570260	or Jacob Berm or all of these esotericists
1570260	1575260	in the Western canon that are not opposite to the enlightenment.
1575780	1578180	They're the same people.
1578180	1580820	It's like Dick Duff spent a lot of his life
1580820	1584220	trying to contact the order of the Rosicross.
1584220	1586020	And it's like, so these are the same people.
1586020	1589660	They're not different types.
1589660	1591820	So there's this weird parasite in the enlightenment
1591820	1595820	of magic and esotericism and Freemasonry, all this stuff.
1595820	1599180	Freemasonry, yeah, interesting.
1599180	1601140	Now, there's loads we could get into,
1601140	1603020	but you brought up Pinkham,
1603140	1605340	and I was just reading his Enlightenment now.
1605340	1608580	And you were at the ARC conference.
1608580	1612580	I was at it back in October, and it does seem like...
1612580	1615180	I think people are tired of nihilism.
1615180	1619140	So there's not many that are good.
1619140	1623020	There's not many that are going for full-on nihilism these days.
1623020	1624980	You mentioned Islam and woke,
1624980	1629220	but it seems at least within the ARC crowd,
1629540	1633020	the main worldviews that are emerging are Christianity
1633020	1635180	and Enlightenment humanism.
1635180	1639180	And that's why I think your discussion with Lindsay
1639180	1645180	was so revealing, because, well, it revealed this crack,
1645180	1647580	and it'll be very interesting to see
1647580	1649980	where that goes over the next couple of years.
1649980	1652580	Now, that's a speculative question,
1652580	1654340	but do you have any thoughts on that?
1655340	1656940	Well, I want to say, first of all,
1656940	1658940	that I really admire James Lindsay.
1658940	1660340	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I want to...
1660340	1662340	I want it to be careful that, you know,
1662340	1664940	I mean, he went after me quite aggressively,
1664940	1666540	but I don't feel the same about him.
1666540	1671940	I think that the work that he's doing is really useful,
1671940	1675340	and that all the effort he's putting into helping people
1675340	1678340	see the kind of communistic stuff is amazing.
1678340	1680740	So I think that's important to really understand
1681740	1685740	because I actually don't have a problem with James Lindsay at all.
1685740	1688740	But what I do have a problem with, let's say,
1688740	1691740	I agree with him in terms of his attack on communism
1691740	1695740	and all the stuff, but I do not believe
1695740	1699740	that we can have a fully secular society
1699740	1701740	that I don't think that that's possible.
1701740	1706740	And I really do believe that the kind of secular humanism
1706740	1708740	that the Enlightenment proposed
1709740	1710740	ran aground.
1710740	1714740	It is not sufficient to hold societies together.
1714740	1717740	It's not sufficient to hold us together as people.
1717740	1723740	Now, the danger is we also cannot weaponize religion.
1723740	1724740	You can try.
1724740	1726740	But if you weaponize religion,
1726740	1729740	then you turn it into that which it is not.
1729740	1730740	That is, if you try to make religion
1730740	1733740	into something that will help you keep your society together,
1733740	1735740	then it will become an opportunity
1736740	1740740	and so the worship of God, you could say,
1740740	1743740	or the acknowledging of the absolutely transcendent
1743740	1746740	and our submission to it and our participation in it
1746740	1748740	is a good in itself.
1748740	1751740	And downstream from that,
1751740	1755740	you do have all the gifts of civilization that come with it.
1755740	1759740	And so on the one hand, how can I say this?
1759740	1762740	On the one hand, I see that James is afraid
1762740	1764740	of the weaponization of Christianity
1764740	1767740	in his attack on Christian nationalism.
1767740	1768740	But on the other hand,
1768740	1770740	I see him doing the exact same thing
1770740	1773740	in trying to get the Christians on board with him
1773740	1775740	so that he can create his democratic
1775740	1778740	so secular Enlightenment utopia,
1778740	1781740	which doesn't exist, which is not possible.
1781740	1785740	And so that's why I do believe
1785740	1788740	that the only solution to our predicament
1788740	1792740	is a true return to Christianity,
1792740	1794740	like not a pretend one, not a...
1794740	1796740	And that's why most of my interactions
1796740	1798740	are not political at all.
1798740	1799740	Then nothing to do with politics.
1799740	1801740	It's mostly trying to help people reconnect
1801740	1803740	with the deepest aspects of our tradition
1803740	1806740	to give them the right orientation
1806740	1810740	for the rest of their other participations.
1813740	1815740	By the way, if you want to know
1815740	1817740	if you're sure the culture war isn't over,
1817740	1820740	we're going to see a lot more of the conflict.
1820740	1824740	But in the end, the truth is that
1824740	1829740	the secularist voice is going to grow weaker and weaker
1829740	1830740	as things come.
1830740	1831740	And I don't say that.
1831740	1834740	I'm not saying that in a celebratory tone.
1834740	1838740	I just don't see any other way for the future.
1838740	1840740	And the question, again, is going to be
1840740	1842740	which one is which.
1843740	1848740	New religious perspective is going to be dominant.
1848740	1850740	And there are several possibilities.
1850740	1853740	One is a weird new globalist religion
1853740	1855740	that worships AI and the earth
1855740	1857740	and all this kind of stuff that we're seeing.
1857740	1858740	The other is Islam.
1858740	1861740	That is definitely a real possibility.
1861740	1864740	And the third is, I believe,
1864740	1869740	the possibility of some kind of Christian reawakening
1870740	1872740	to the roots of who we are
1872740	1878740	and all our ethics and all that we believe in
1878740	1885740	are writing on this ontology based on love
1885740	1886740	that Christianity presents,
1886740	1890740	like this idea that the world is held together by love,
1890740	1895740	that that is the mode of existence of reality.
1895740	1896740	Those are the possibilities.
1897740	1899740	I don't see, maybe there are others,
1899740	1901740	but those are the possibilities I see.
1901740	1902740	Yeah.
1902740	1903740	So let's get clear on what the concern is.
1903740	1905740	The concern from people like Lindsay
1905740	1910740	isn't that Christians are going to say vote pro-life
1910740	1911740	or something like that.
1911740	1914740	So try and influence politics in that way.
1914740	1915740	The concern must be that the Christians
1915740	1918740	are going to try and get in charge
1918740	1923740	and inflict their views on the rest of society.
1923740	1925740	Is that how you understand this
1925740	1928740	or push back against Christian nationalism?
1931740	1932740	That's possible.
1932740	1935740	I don't know if that's his complete,
1935740	1940740	like what the reason for his such a strong reaction.
1940740	1949740	Now, this is a difficult situation
1949740	1950740	that we find ourselves in,
1950740	1955740	because if we realize that that which affords
1955740	1963740	the type of freedom that you love is based in a way of being
1963740	1966740	that is Christian and it's based on a message
1966740	1971740	and a way of seeing the world that is basically Christian,
1971740	1978740	but you also don't want Christians to back off,
1978740	1983740	then you're ultimately going to lose the freedom that you love.
1983740	1987740	And so I understand that it's a difficult situation
1987740	1991740	because you also understand what somebody would not want
1991740	1998740	Christians to completely impose their worldview on others.
1998740	1999740	And so to be honest,
1999740	2002740	I don't completely know what the solution is,
2002740	2009740	but in the end, that's going to happen no matter what.
2009740	2010740	I don't know what to say.
2010740	2016740	If you think that whatever happened to COVID isn't coming back,
2016740	2019740	I mean, you have to be so naive.
2019740	2023740	What happened to COVID is going to happen again, folks.
2023740	2025740	What's that going to be?
2025740	2027740	I know it's going to be,
2027740	2031740	but what I mean is that the capacity to impose the world on us
2031740	2034740	and to impose the way we live and the way we,
2034740	2039740	and a kind of social credit system or some kind of something
2039740	2042740	is coming towards us at full speed.
2042740	2046740	Now, the question is, what do we have to mitigate that?
2046740	2056740	And I do believe that when I look at all the solutions in front of me,
2056740	2065740	I do believe that the foundation of Christian love is the best solution,
2065740	2067740	but I don't know how it's going to play out.
2067740	2071740	I also don't have that much hope that it's going to...
2071740	2075740	This is also maybe the reason why I don't totally understand Lindsay's thing
2075740	2079740	is that I don't really believe that even Christianity,
2079740	2082740	if it returns, at least in the short term,
2082740	2085740	at least for 150 years, 100 years,
2085740	2089740	is going to have the power to take over society.
2089740	2092740	It's mostly a way for people to be able to live
2092740	2095740	approximately in their families, in their communities,
2095740	2098740	in their parishes, in their more local settings
2098740	2101740	in order to be able to live the best life possible
2101740	2103740	and to make the most of things.
2103740	2105740	That's the way that I see it.
2105740	2107740	And in some ways, maybe plant a seed for the future,
2107740	2111740	but the idea of some kind of Christian fascism in the United States
2112740	2114740	I don't know, it's like I just don't see it.
2114740	2116740	Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm naive.
2116740	2119740	I just do not see that as a...
2119740	2121740	So it's a real drarer sort of thing.
2121740	2124740	Yeah, it's more like it definitely is going to do wrong.
2124740	2125740	Yeah, yeah.
2125740	2126740	It's just a rather...
2126740	2128740	I totally agree on this idea,
2128740	2131740	like that in some ways that his Benedict option,
2131740	2133740	you know, not that if we're treating home society,
2133740	2136740	but rather being deliberate about your community,
2136740	2139740	about your choices, about what it is that you want to be,
2139740	2141740	is the way to go.
2141740	2142740	But I don't see it...
2142740	2144740	I don't think we're going to save the world.
2145740	2146740	Yeah, it's funny.
2146740	2149740	We had Oliver at Donovan on a few weeks ago.
2149740	2152740	He's arguably the top Christian political thinker
2152740	2154740	of the last 100 years.
2154740	2157740	And we put this to him partly,
2157740	2158740	but he was just like,
2158740	2161740	look, you have to deal with what's realistic.
2161740	2165740	And a return to Christendom is just not on the cards.
2165740	2168740	Now, I know plenty of people who are pushing for it.
2168740	2171740	I sort of knew Christendom, but certainly in his view,
2171740	2173740	it's not realistic.
2173740	2176740	But do you know many people that are pushing for it legitimately
2176740	2178740	or as an aesthetic?
2178740	2181740	I know there's a meme aspect to it,
2181740	2187740	which is the idea of pushing the idea of a Christian world
2187740	2191740	as a driving, as something that drives you, right?
2191740	2194740	As something that kind of gives you hope
2194740	2196740	and gives you a vision to move towards.
2197740	2199740	Maybe it's because I'm not in the same circle to you,
2199740	2202740	but I don't think I've ever met anyone who really thinks
2202740	2204740	that we're going to have a Christian emperor.
2204740	2207740	I don't know what exactly they can imagine.
2207740	2211740	Well, there's integralism from the Roman Catholic perspective.
2211740	2212740	I'm not Roman Catholic.
2212740	2214740	I don't know well.
2214740	2218740	No, in the strongest versions of it, as I understand it,
2218740	2223740	people like me, Protestants, we can survive,
2223740	2225740	but we're not allowed to share our views in public.
2225740	2228740	Again, that's in the strongest version.
2228740	2231740	Is that happening in the United States of America
2231740	2234740	or in Europe, in England?
2234740	2236740	Look, this isn't my view at all.
2236740	2238740	Exactly, I'm just naive.
2238740	2241740	Maybe there's a Christian emperor over the hill.
2241740	2242740	Who knows?
2242740	2247740	I just really do not see that as a possibility at all.
2247740	2252740	Yeah, I make a habit of speaking to people
2252740	2254740	with wildly different views from me.
2255740	2257740	This is one of the views that comes up,
2257740	2262740	but basically, what they'll say is that the problems
2262740	2266740	are that large, that that sort of solution.
2266740	2269740	I'm just going to get very dark before that solution is available.
2269740	2270740	I'm not defending it.
2270740	2272740	I'm just saying some people say it.
2272740	2274740	Sorry, do you want to say something?
2274740	2277740	No, if they say it's going to get very dark
2277740	2281740	in the sense that things are going to get so completely out of control
2281740	2285740	that people are going to desire a Christian,
2285740	2291740	that the nation will yearn for a kind of Christian culture,
2291740	2293740	then maybe, but that's not anytime soon.
2293740	2296740	And if that happens, then that'll happen.
2296740	2301740	I mean, it's like, if it happens that people see how dark
2301740	2305740	our kind of nihilistic freedoms can become
2305740	2308740	and that they turn their heart to the Lord,
2309740	2317740	like Nineveh, all of people turning towards a better morality,
2317740	2321740	let's say, then I don't see why that would be a problem.
2321740	2323740	That would just be what happens.
2323740	2326740	But the idea of some Christian king that comes
2326740	2329740	and just imposes it on everybody, that's ridiculous.
2329740	2332740	I don't see that's the most ridiculous.
2333740	2336740	But they don't, it's not a king.
2336740	2341740	It's sort of a, it's a new elite they have in mind.
2341740	2343740	Again, it's not my view.
2343740	2347740	So McGillchrist, just brief few final questions.
2347740	2351740	McGillchrist, we had Ian on a month or two ago.
2351740	2354740	I'm reading, I'm in the middle of the matter of things.
2354740	2357740	So I read Master and the Mystery years ago.
2357740	2359740	I'm in the matter of things now.
2359740	2361740	I'm going to go as far as say I'm almost a disciple of him,
2361740	2363740	because I'm so obsessed with his thought.
2363740	2365740	And I think he's on point.
2365740	2368740	And he just seems to be saying something similar to you,
2368740	2371740	that we need reason and intuition, reason and mystery.
2371740	2373740	No, I totally agree.
2373740	2375740	I definitely agree with McGillchrist.
2375740	2378740	I also interviewed him once on my own channel.
2378740	2382740	I think that we are very similar in terms of our perspective.
2382740	2385740	And, you know, a lot of the cognitive psychologist types,
2385740	2388740	John Revekey as well and in our Bernardo Castro,
2388740	2393740	and there are several right now that are just showing
2393740	2395740	the inevitability of this question.
2395740	2400740	Like that we cannot, that the idea that analytic processes
2400740	2405740	and this kind of, that is not sufficient to human experience,
2405740	2408740	that there is an entire other aspect,
2408740	2410740	which is the grasping, which is the intuition,
2410740	2414740	which is the seeming of the shining meaning
2414740	2417740	that is beyond the multiplicity.
2417740	2421740	This holistic, let's say, vision of the world.
2421740	2425740	This is, you know, not only is it accounted for in every single
2425740	2428740	religion and tradition from the beginning of time,
2428740	2432740	but now, like I said, it seems from the cognitive psychologist
2432740	2434740	that they're realizing this is inevitable.
2434740	2437740	You know, and I think I'm not, I don't have the courage
2437740	2439740	to get into the matter of things,
2439740	2444740	because even when I contemplate the brick, like I, like, who, who.
2444740	2447740	I know, I thought the same way, but it's amazing.
2447740	2449740	It's, I'm just obsessed.
2449740	2452740	I've put a copy that I'm giving it to everyone in my department.
2452740	2454740	We're going to read and discuss it.
2454740	2456740	It's really quite something.
2456740	2459740	I think, so I'm really on board with McGillchrist,
2459740	2463740	but I do think, though, that in terms of the analytic tradition,
2463740	2466740	as you know, there was something of a renaissance
2466740	2469740	of Christian philosophy of religion in the last 60 years.
2469740	2473740	Alvin Plankton, Richard Swinburne, Eleanor Stump,
2473740	2475740	William Lane Creeks, the big popularizer.
2475740	2478740	I do think, though, there is, there's a lot to be said
2478740	2482740	for the work they've done, and they can at least present
2482740	2485740	the Christian faith in a way that connects with
2485740	2488740	the sort of Lindsay Boghossian outlook.
2488740	2490740	No, I put it to Pete last week, and he was like,
2490740	2492740	yeah, I just don't think their arguments are good,
2492740	2495740	but I mean, their arguments are being taken seriously
2495740	2497740	by really top analytic philosophers,
2497740	2500740	ones who aren't even theists.
2500740	2502740	Well, maybe I'm not, I'm not, myself,
2502740	2505740	I'm not a big fan of that type of argumentation,
2505740	2508740	but it's also because I'm a, you know,
2508740	2510740	I really come from a more mystical tradition,
2510740	2516740	like orthodoxy, I think I have a beauty-first approach,
2516740	2519740	let's say, to the question, you know,
2519740	2523740	and I think that that's why I'm closer to the cognitive psychologist,
2523740	2527740	let's say, in terms of a phenomenological point of view,
2527740	2530740	you know, the idea that there are certain ways
2530740	2534740	in which reality, you know, lays itself out to us
2534740	2537740	that have this dance, right, that have this pattern in it,
2537740	2539740	and we can't completely, we can't ignore it
2539740	2543740	because it is the structure of our experience.
2543740	2547740	So I tend to go there more to kind of outlay
2547740	2550740	the structure of our experience and show how it is captured
2550740	2555740	in the, let's say, the liturgical life of the church
2555740	2558740	in the aiming towards mystery, right,
2558740	2561740	this idea of that there's something, you know,
2561740	2563740	there's something hidden behind the veil
2563740	2565740	that is making everything exist
2565740	2571740	and you can't completely capture it, right,
2571740	2575740	it eludes our capacity to analyze it.
2575740	2577740	Anyway, so that's been my approach,
2577740	2581740	but I mean, I'm happy that if that type of argumentation
2581740	2583740	can help some people, you know.
2583740	2585740	Yeah, yeah, I got that.
2585740	2587740	I think the final point is,
2587740	2589740	because we always have this problem
2589740	2592740	with false teachers and false prophets.
2592740	2594740	I mean, my own history is a complicated one.
2594740	2597740	As a teenager, I was mentored by a guy who claimed to be a prophet
2597740	2600740	and he turned out to be, I think, a sociopath.
2600740	2603740	He was exposed two years ago
2603740	2606740	when he stole a church worth $60 million
2606740	2608740	and blamed it on the Holy Spirit
2608740	2610740	and it was in the newspapers and everything.
2610740	2613740	So, I've seen these guys that appeal to mystery
2613740	2616740	and, of course, this guy appeals even now.
2616740	2619740	He's appealing to the Holy Spirit as to why he necked this church
2619740	2622740	and I think one thing that we can do with reason
2622740	2626740	and one of the reasons I've benefited from being trained
2626740	2631740	in the analytic tradition, even though I'm very aware of its weakness,
2631740	2633740	the sort of McGilchrist-like weaknesses,
2633740	2638740	is that you can spot the BS, basically.
2639740	2642740	You definitely need to spot the BS.
2642740	2645740	That's one of the reasons for tradition.
2645740	2651740	Tradition is there to help you also, let's say, spot the BS
2651740	2656740	because there's a manner in which the people that say they're prophets,
2656740	2660740	they can't just fly off the handle.
2660740	2662740	They can't just do whatever they want
2662740	2667740	because they have to be down in a certain way of being in a certain tradition.
2667740	2671740	So, tradition helps to prevent that kind of stuff.
2671740	2675740	There's a method of discernment, let's say.
2675740	2678740	I'm not Catholic, but in the Catholic Church, for example,
2678740	2681740	they actually have quite a method of discernment
2681740	2685740	to be able to know if someone's visions are legitimate.
2685740	2690740	I think it's a little even too, let's say, rigorous,
2690740	2692740	but it's pretty rigorous.
2692740	2694740	If you want to have some kind of recognition
2694740	2696740	as someone who has visions,
2696740	2700740	they'll send someone to study you for months
2700740	2703740	and they'll ask you all the questions
2703740	2706740	and they'll try to figure out what intentions you have
2706740	2708740	and what it is that's motivating you
2708740	2714740	and they can discern the spirits, let's say.
2714740	2716740	But you're right that, for sure,
2716740	2720740	the world of religion has always been a world of bullshit.
2720740	2722740	There's no way around that.
2722740	2726740	The question is, this is the problem again with the whole thing.
2726740	2731740	It's like the world of religion has always been available
2731740	2736740	to those who want to trick others and use bullshit.
2736740	2739740	So then what?
2739740	2742740	So now you just cast it aside, you just say
2742740	2745740	that because some people use mystery to trick people,
2745740	2747740	therefore there is no mystery,
2747740	2749740	or because some people are dishonest in their religious approach
2749740	2752740	to use people's desire to follow, for example,
2752740	2756740	to deceive them and use that to make money
2756740	2759740	or to get sexual favors or whatever,
2759740	2763740	you're not going to get rid of people's desire to follow.
2763740	2768740	And so either they follow the stupid idiotic guru
2768740	2770740	or they follow Taylor Swift
2770740	2774740	or they follow whatever nonsense on TikTok.
2774740	2777740	So what are they going to follow?
2777740	2781740	And that's again, that's one of the blind spots again,
2781740	2784740	is to say, well, if people could all just be reasonable,
2784740	2786740	reasonable like me,
2786740	2789740	then we would have no problems.
2789740	2792740	But that's just not how it is.
2792740	2795740	Yeah, it's throwing the baby out with the bath water.
2795740	2799740	Yes, you have holy oils coming from saints
2799740	2802740	that are recognized as being virtuous
2802740	2806740	and true to the transcendent,
2806740	2809740	and people take them and they sometimes use them in words
2809740	2812740	or maybe a little superstitious, that's possible.
2812740	2817740	You have that or you have like the new age shop
2817740	2819740	and people go and get crystals
2819740	2821740	and we don't know what it's related to.
2821740	2825740	It has no connection to the rest of our engagement with reality.
2825740	2829740	I know that that might sound like I'm being cynical,
2829740	2831740	but I'm not being cynical.
2831740	2835740	I'm actually seeing that people need these markers of participation.
2835740	2837740	They just need them.
2837740	2839740	Yeah, and I believe you're Orthodox,
2839740	2841740	so you have that sense of tradition.
2841740	2844740	I think the problem is in a lot of the non-dom Protestant churches,
2844740	2846740	they just don't have a sense of tradition.
2846740	2848740	They've got the Apostles Creed and whatever,
2848740	2850740	but after that it's just the Bible
2850740	2854740	and there is no sort of inherited wisdom.
2854740	2856740	Jonathan Paju, thank you so much.
