WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.760
On the one hand, I see that James is afraid

00:02.760 --> 00:04.840
of the weaponization of Christianity

00:04.840 --> 00:07.480
in his attack on Christian nationalism.

00:07.480 --> 00:10.560
But on the other hand, I see him doing the exact same thing

00:10.560 --> 00:13.720
in trying to get the Christians on board with him

00:13.720 --> 00:18.040
so that he can create his democratic secular enlightenment

00:18.040 --> 00:22.280
utopia, which doesn't exist, which is not possible.

00:22.280 --> 00:27.240
And so that's why I do believe that the only solution

00:27.280 --> 00:32.280
to our predicament is a true return to Christianity,

00:32.560 --> 00:34.880
like not a pretend one, not a unit.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.280
And that's why most of my interactions

00:37.280 --> 00:38.560
are not political at all.

00:42.200 --> 00:46.160
Jonathan Pajot, you have risen in prominence

00:46.160 --> 00:48.040
over the last couple of years.

00:48.040 --> 00:52.120
In part, I think, because of your work with JBP,

00:52.120 --> 00:55.360
what is the sort of the message that you're sharing

00:55.400 --> 00:57.720
with people that is getting through,

00:57.720 --> 00:59.320
that's cutting through, that's connecting?

00:59.320 --> 01:02.080
Briefly, what are you saying that's getting through?

01:03.560 --> 01:05.400
Well, I think that we're in a situation

01:05.400 --> 01:10.400
where people are finding that the promises of the enlightenment

01:10.840 --> 01:13.480
or the promises of the scientific revolution

01:13.480 --> 01:17.240
are, although they have brought some great success

01:17.240 --> 01:19.800
in terms of material wealth and in terms of comfort,

01:19.800 --> 01:21.800
all of this is actually quite wonderful

01:21.800 --> 01:23.840
that there seems to be something missing,

01:23.840 --> 01:26.600
which is a connection to meaning, to purpose.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.360
And we also struggle to understand

01:29.360 --> 01:32.280
how and why it is that we exist together.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.640
And so it seems like it's an interesting time

01:35.640 --> 01:36.880
to be able to speak into this

01:36.880 --> 01:40.920
and to help people re-understand our religious stories,

01:40.920 --> 01:44.280
the mythologies, the images, the icons,

01:44.280 --> 01:47.160
the structures of meaning that informed our ancestors

01:47.160 --> 01:50.200
for thousands of years and how they can actually help us,

01:50.200 --> 01:53.600
first of all, understand why it is we need that,

01:53.600 --> 01:56.560
why it is we need purpose and meaning and cohesion,

01:56.560 --> 01:58.280
and how it is that these stories,

01:58.280 --> 02:01.360
and also especially the participation that comes from them,

02:01.360 --> 02:05.360
can help us reconnect and find meaning again.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.120
Brilliant, there's a huge amount in there.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.800
Now, just for our viewers and listeners,

02:08.800 --> 02:13.560
your background is as an icon maker.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.520
What's the verb?

02:14.520 --> 02:15.480
How do you describe yourself?

02:15.480 --> 02:17.000
Yeah, I mean, I guess you could say,

02:17.000 --> 02:19.800
I mean, icon carver, icon maker,

02:19.800 --> 02:23.760
but it's really important to understand the icon making

02:23.760 --> 02:25.720
as an application of a worldview

02:25.720 --> 02:28.960
that I embraced a very long time ago.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.320
And so it, I mean, I'm happy to take that title,

02:32.320 --> 02:33.760
but it isn't somewhere as reductive

02:33.760 --> 02:36.280
because the, like I said,

02:36.280 --> 02:40.000
in some ways it was discovering a cohesive worldview

02:40.000 --> 02:42.600
and embracing it and participating in it

02:42.600 --> 02:45.040
that led me to want to apply that in my life

02:45.040 --> 02:46.400
at different levels.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.280
And one of them ended up being professionally

02:49.280 --> 02:51.360
as making images for churches.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.040
As I understood the images

02:53.040 --> 02:55.480
and as I kind of understood this web of meaning

02:55.480 --> 02:58.120
that is there in the Christian tradition,

02:58.120 --> 02:59.840
it was a way to apply it practically,

02:59.840 --> 03:02.800
and not just it'd be like a mental game that I engage with.

03:02.800 --> 03:07.680
Right, but you were an artist before that, right?

03:07.680 --> 03:11.680
Yes, I studied art in school,

03:11.680 --> 03:13.160
but then I kind of abandoned art

03:13.160 --> 03:18.160
and then went on a long arc of studying of reading

03:18.960 --> 03:22.000
and ultimately coming back to traditional art.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.680
Okay, gotcha.

03:23.680 --> 03:26.120
Now, Jonathan, about a month ago,

03:26.120 --> 03:29.160
we had James Lindsay on the podcast.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.080
We had a fantastic discussion.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.600
And you had a bit of a disagreement,

03:34.600 --> 03:39.600
which I think is really cuts to some of the core issues

03:40.560 --> 03:44.100
in the public debate at the moment.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.920
So let's get into that.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.120
On Twitter, you wrote,

03:48.120 --> 03:51.800
the future is religious,

03:51.800 --> 03:53.920
and no one can stop that anymore.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.040
The question remaining is what that religiosity

03:58.040 --> 04:00.120
will be turned toward?

04:00.120 --> 04:02.480
Do you want to just unpack that for us

04:02.480 --> 04:07.360
and give a sense of the way in which Lindsay

04:07.360 --> 04:09.040
disagreed with you?

04:09.040 --> 04:12.800
Yeah, I don't even remember exactly

04:12.800 --> 04:14.520
how the argument started.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.120
I mean, he came after me for something I wrote,

04:17.120 --> 04:19.080
but I think he identified me first of all

04:19.080 --> 04:21.680
with something that he had in his mind,

04:21.680 --> 04:22.960
which is Christian nationalism

04:22.960 --> 04:24.400
and kind of identified me with that

04:24.400 --> 04:27.400
and therefore framed the things I was saying

04:27.400 --> 04:29.320
in that perspective.

04:29.320 --> 04:33.240
But it's related to what I said at the outset,

04:33.240 --> 04:37.720
which is that we're noticing the religious crash

04:37.720 --> 04:42.000
back into our story and whether you see it,

04:42.000 --> 04:43.580
whether it's through woke ideology,

04:43.580 --> 04:46.540
whether it is through worship of the environment,

04:46.540 --> 04:49.620
whether it is its worship of the state,

04:49.620 --> 04:51.620
and whether it's going to be worship of AI.

04:51.620 --> 04:53.220
It doesn't really matter.

04:53.220 --> 04:55.260
There seems to be different ways

04:55.260 --> 04:56.540
in which this is coming back,

04:56.540 --> 04:59.540
or whether it is like your uneducated aunt

04:59.540 --> 05:02.780
that goes to the new age shop and has crystals

05:02.780 --> 05:05.100
and has all this kind of stuff in their house.

05:05.100 --> 05:08.940
The idea is that people are looking for ways

05:08.940 --> 05:11.940
to make sense of their world, which is beyond reason.

05:12.940 --> 05:16.220
It is beyond reason because it also has to encompass

05:16.220 --> 05:17.860
the manner in which there's coherence,

05:17.860 --> 05:19.100
the manner in which we come together,

05:19.100 --> 05:23.220
the manner in which we align ourselves with our purposes

05:23.220 --> 05:25.300
and the purposes of others in the world,

05:25.300 --> 05:29.700
and that ends up looking like religious participation

05:29.700 --> 05:30.980
or religious affiliation

05:30.980 --> 05:34.140
because it has to do with celebration.

05:34.140 --> 05:36.820
Like we actually follow that which we celebrate.

05:36.820 --> 05:38.740
We live in that which we celebrate

05:38.740 --> 05:41.420
and that ends up looking like religion.

05:41.540 --> 05:43.420
It's like, what do you worship basically?

05:43.420 --> 05:44.980
What do you put as the highest?

05:44.980 --> 05:46.380
And what do you celebrate?

05:46.380 --> 05:48.500
And so without traditional religions,

05:48.500 --> 05:50.460
we end up with weird things like Earth Day

05:50.460 --> 05:55.460
and LGBT Month and just this constant desire

05:56.100 --> 06:00.420
to have insert holidays and celebrations

06:00.420 --> 06:03.860
that are re-injecting religiosity into the world.

06:03.860 --> 06:08.860
So my contention is that this is happening to us.

06:09.860 --> 06:12.140
You know, the Enlightenment model,

06:12.140 --> 06:14.220
the Enlightenment idea that we could all just be

06:14.220 --> 06:18.260
rationalistic individuals like that live next to each other

06:18.260 --> 06:19.340
is not working.

06:19.340 --> 06:20.700
That gives the suburbs.

06:20.700 --> 06:23.140
It gives the urban sprawl.

06:23.140 --> 06:25.220
It gives the breakdown of the family.

06:25.220 --> 06:28.580
It gives the breakdown of communities

06:28.580 --> 06:31.220
and it turns us into these little consumers

06:31.220 --> 06:33.700
that live next to each other but don't know each other

06:33.700 --> 06:34.980
and don't interact with each other.

06:34.980 --> 06:38.060
And everybody's feeling like that is not sufficient

06:38.060 --> 06:41.260
because people are depressed, people are miserable

06:41.260 --> 06:42.820
and they're looking for something more.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.820
Now the question is, what is that going to be?

06:45.820 --> 06:47.700
There's no, like I said,

06:47.700 --> 06:48.860
I don't think there's a way around it.

06:48.860 --> 06:50.180
Is it going to be Islam?

06:50.180 --> 06:54.660
Is it going to be all these weird new kind of religiosities

06:54.660 --> 06:56.820
that we see in globalism?

06:57.980 --> 07:01.940
You know, I do believe that Christianity is our best bet

07:01.940 --> 07:06.940
as Westerners and as let's say people who want to be able

07:06.940 --> 07:09.700
to preserve the best of what the Enlightenment has given us

07:09.700 --> 07:14.140
because the Enlightenment has provided powerful things

07:14.140 --> 07:15.700
but it's insufficient.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.580
It's not enough to hold people together.

07:17.580 --> 07:22.580
It tends towards the problems we're seeing now.

07:23.460 --> 07:28.460
Okay, so how are we understanding the word the Enlightenment?

07:29.580 --> 07:32.700
We're talking about the sort of 17th, 18th century

07:33.580 --> 07:35.660
movement in Europe.

07:35.660 --> 07:39.940
We have in mind figures like Kant, David Hume, Newton.

07:39.940 --> 07:43.540
Do you want to expand on what you have in mind there?

07:43.540 --> 07:45.300
Yeah, and so, I mean, the Enlightenment

07:46.460 --> 07:49.180
is properly understood as a continuation of a movement

07:49.180 --> 07:50.580
that started, let's say, in the Renaissance

07:50.580 --> 07:52.220
with the Scientific Revolution.

07:52.220 --> 07:57.220
In some ways, it is the winning of reason,

07:59.140 --> 08:02.220
like the notion that human beings are reasonable

08:02.300 --> 08:06.060
and that reason is the way by which we're going to exist

08:06.060 --> 08:09.220
and then applying that thinking, that reason,

08:09.220 --> 08:13.940
and also the methods of scientific exploration

08:13.940 --> 08:15.900
and analysis to the world.

08:15.900 --> 08:19.900
And so we have a method in order to be able

08:19.900 --> 08:23.180
to predict phenomena, to be able to understand phenomena.

08:23.180 --> 08:26.700
We have a method by which we can analyze things

08:26.700 --> 08:29.300
and that method is very powerful

08:29.300 --> 08:32.340
and it yields power.

08:32.340 --> 08:33.700
Like it's the best way to understand it.

08:33.700 --> 08:36.580
It yields more capacity to control

08:36.580 --> 08:41.580
and to manage reality, manage physical reality,

08:42.380 --> 08:45.940
make spaceships, make all the things that we enjoy,

08:45.940 --> 08:47.380
which are quite wonderful.

08:48.660 --> 08:51.580
But there's also a blind spot in that.

08:51.580 --> 08:53.820
There's a blind spot in this Enlightenment,

08:53.820 --> 08:56.300
especially as it moves towards secularism

08:56.300 --> 08:58.980
and especially as it moves towards atheism.

08:58.980 --> 09:00.900
Because there's a sense in which we start to believe

09:00.900 --> 09:05.500
that this reason and this capacity for reason is ultimate

09:06.420 --> 09:08.100
and that it's sufficient.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.220
And then we apply it, we apply it, we apply it,

09:10.220 --> 09:11.820
but the problem actually happens

09:11.820 --> 09:14.780
when we start to then turn it on ourselves.

09:14.780 --> 09:17.660
When we come to the point where we now have to understand

09:17.660 --> 09:21.820
ourselves as agents, as conscious beings,

09:21.820 --> 09:25.260
then reason starts to become loopy.

09:25.260 --> 09:30.220
It starts to not completely be enough,

09:30.220 --> 09:34.140
especially when understanding how identities function.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.820
Reason does not provide identity.

09:35.820 --> 09:38.580
Reason provides analysis for identities

09:38.580 --> 09:40.180
that are already given.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.660
But the identity is seen to be a given

09:43.660 --> 09:46.260
or to come, to use religious language.

09:46.260 --> 09:47.180
They come from heaven.

09:47.180 --> 09:49.300
Like you knew the identity before

09:49.300 --> 09:51.300
you can apply the methods of science.

09:51.980 --> 09:56.980
And so because of that, it leaves humans

09:58.620 --> 10:03.620
with something missing in their experience

10:04.900 --> 10:07.940
that they know is real, that they experience all the time,

10:07.940 --> 10:12.140
but that cannot be contained by this process.

10:12.140 --> 10:13.420
Yeah.

10:13.420 --> 10:17.100
So one descriptor that's used

10:17.100 --> 10:19.260
for the Enlightenment is the Age of Reason.

10:19.260 --> 10:20.900
Now I really just like this

10:20.900 --> 10:22.740
because I love the medieval figures.

10:22.740 --> 10:25.740
And of course the medieval figures like Aquinas,

10:25.740 --> 10:29.300
Scotus, Occam, early medieval like Anselm,

10:29.300 --> 10:31.940
I mean, these guys use the reason.

10:31.940 --> 10:36.940
So in what sense is reason really triumphant enlightenment?

10:37.900 --> 10:40.540
Some people say that it's reason

10:40.540 --> 10:43.700
plus the throwing off of authority.

10:43.700 --> 10:46.420
Religious authority, Alistair McIntyre thinks

10:47.140 --> 10:50.940
it's reason plus throwing off the fixed sense

10:50.940 --> 10:53.220
of human nature.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.060
Yeah.

10:54.060 --> 10:55.660
Well, it's religion and pride.

10:55.660 --> 10:59.740
It's the pride, sorry, it's the pride of reason.

10:59.740 --> 11:01.780
It's the best way to understand it.

11:01.780 --> 11:05.300
And so the manner in which the medieval's understood reason

11:05.300 --> 11:09.940
was that it was derivative and manifested

11:09.940 --> 11:12.060
by something transcendent.

11:12.060 --> 11:15.940
Like a mystery which is beyond understanding

11:15.980 --> 11:18.020
which reveals itself in reason.

11:18.020 --> 11:20.220
And so there's always an aspect of the real

11:20.220 --> 11:21.940
which it cannot be probed.

11:21.940 --> 11:24.340
And you'll find that in all the medieval,

11:24.340 --> 11:27.020
you know, whether west or east or west,

11:27.020 --> 11:30.300
there's something beyond reason that cannot be probed

11:30.300 --> 11:34.800
and it gives to reason and reason flows out of it.

11:36.140 --> 11:38.900
And what it does is that it means

11:38.900 --> 11:41.740
that reason is not sufficient.

11:41.740 --> 11:44.860
Reason does not contain all things.

11:44.860 --> 11:48.620
And what it also, how can I say this?

11:48.620 --> 11:53.620
It also eliminates the problem of the pride of reason.

11:54.260 --> 11:56.380
And so in the Enlightenment, the idea is like,

11:56.380 --> 11:59.220
we can do this, we are the ones, we have it.

11:59.220 --> 12:02.260
We try to contain reality within reason.

12:02.260 --> 12:06.100
And sometimes it's the beginning of a revolutionary trope.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.220
It's the beginning of the revolutionary structure

12:09.220 --> 12:13.940
where the human tries to take from God, right?

12:13.940 --> 12:17.300
The top of the hierarchy tries to say, no, we are the top.

12:17.300 --> 12:20.060
We are the ones who can, with our reason

12:20.060 --> 12:22.460
and our mind can analyze the world.

12:22.460 --> 12:27.340
But as soon as that happens, then things start to devolve.

12:27.340 --> 12:30.380
And you find yourself, at the end of that process,

12:30.380 --> 12:32.900
you find yourself in a situation

12:32.900 --> 12:34.460
that is not reasonable at all,

12:34.460 --> 12:37.060
that is actually completely unreasonable,

12:37.060 --> 12:38.740
but not unreasonable in the sense

12:38.740 --> 12:41.580
that God is beyond reason, unreasonable in the sense

12:41.620 --> 12:45.340
that our passions and our desires and our whims

12:45.340 --> 12:47.500
end up ruling in the end.

12:47.500 --> 12:52.500
And so this, in my conflict with Lindsay,

12:54.620 --> 12:56.620
I quoted Goya's famous statement,

12:56.620 --> 12:58.260
here's a print by Goya,

12:58.260 --> 13:01.300
which says, the sleep of reason produces monsters.

13:02.180 --> 13:04.900
Or the dream of reason produces monsters, right?

13:05.940 --> 13:09.700
And that is the situation that we find ourselves in,

13:09.700 --> 13:12.740
is that having insisted so much on reason

13:12.740 --> 13:14.540
and having pushed to the margin

13:14.540 --> 13:17.340
the things which are not reasonable,

13:17.340 --> 13:21.860
they at some point, that unreason just crashes back in.

13:21.860 --> 13:24.100
And like you said, in the medieval world,

13:24.100 --> 13:28.060
that unreason or that which exceeds reason

13:28.060 --> 13:29.900
would in some ways have been pushed up

13:29.900 --> 13:31.740
towards the glory of God, right?

13:31.740 --> 13:35.300
Would have been something like the excess of a church

13:35.300 --> 13:37.820
in a village, like the golden,

13:37.820 --> 13:40.740
all of this kind of unreasonable excess

13:40.740 --> 13:42.900
that we experience in reality,

13:42.900 --> 13:44.660
we give it up as glory to God.

13:44.660 --> 13:46.260
But if you don't do that,

13:46.260 --> 13:50.180
then it turns into the hybrid demons

13:50.180 --> 13:51.700
that come in poke you at night,

13:51.700 --> 13:56.700
like all these freaks and intermediary beings

13:57.820 --> 14:00.140
that start to appear in the world

14:00.140 --> 14:03.180
and will try to destroy reason that way.

14:03.180 --> 14:04.940
Interesting, yeah.

14:04.940 --> 14:07.180
Yeah, I mean, it certainly doesn't seem to me

14:07.220 --> 14:10.260
that this sort of standards of racial inquiry

14:11.340 --> 14:14.500
got much better with the Enlightenment.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.740
It doesn't strike me that Hume is any smarter

14:16.740 --> 14:20.100
than Occam or Aquinas,

14:20.100 --> 14:22.820
but certainly I like your way of describing it

14:22.820 --> 14:27.580
as this elevating reason, the pride of reason.

14:27.580 --> 14:30.620
And I guess I put this actually to Pete Boghossian as well.

14:30.620 --> 14:35.620
Last week, this idea that we need both reason and mystery,

14:35.660 --> 14:38.180
because that's roughly kind of what you're getting at.

14:38.180 --> 14:41.940
And is your criticism, or not even your criticism,

14:41.940 --> 14:43.620
your understanding of Lindsay,

14:43.620 --> 14:44.860
and to some extent, Pete,

14:44.860 --> 14:48.700
is they just want to have reason, is that right?

14:48.700 --> 14:49.740
Well, that's what you see.

14:49.740 --> 14:53.660
And you see that in the Stephen Hicks,

14:53.660 --> 14:58.660
Pete Pinker, Lindsay, all of that crew,

14:58.780 --> 15:03.780
they have this, in my impression, a twisted image,

15:04.580 --> 15:06.100
first of all, of what humans are,

15:06.100 --> 15:08.500
and second of all, of how reality works.

15:08.500 --> 15:13.100
And it can look very convincing at the outset,

15:13.100 --> 15:16.680
because what they're saying is, if we were reasonable,

15:17.580 --> 15:18.820
if we were just reasonable,

15:18.820 --> 15:21.260
then we would have a perfect society, wouldn't we?

15:22.260 --> 15:24.340
And so it's one of those like,

15:24.340 --> 15:27.380
communism has never been tried problems,

15:27.380 --> 15:30.060
which is that humans are not only reasonable.

15:30.060 --> 15:34.220
Reality cannot be limited to that, which is reasonable.

15:34.220 --> 15:38.700
And it just cannot, even epistemologically,

15:38.700 --> 15:41.620
we cannot access all of reality through reason.

15:41.620 --> 15:44.660
And we're starting to know that even scientifically,

15:44.660 --> 15:47.580
this point, is that we cannot quantify all things.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.980
We cannot analyze all of reality.

15:50.980 --> 15:53.460
There always has to be some miracle,

15:53.460 --> 15:56.140
whether the miracle is the big bang or whatever,

15:56.140 --> 15:59.980
or something at the outset that is not part of the system,

16:00.540 --> 16:03.340
that is just an inevitable aspect

16:03.340 --> 16:05.060
of how being lays itself out.

16:06.500 --> 16:11.140
And so it becomes difficult because they'll say,

16:11.140 --> 16:14.780
if we were only reasonable and reasonable individuals,

16:14.780 --> 16:17.980
then all things would work, but we are not that.

16:17.980 --> 16:19.700
Human beings are not just that,

16:19.700 --> 16:21.940
they are that to some extent.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.300
And so then again, it has this problem.

16:24.300 --> 16:26.740
It's like, if you have a blind spot,

16:26.740 --> 16:29.620
you have this blind spot, which is the aspect,

16:29.620 --> 16:31.740
unreasonable aspect, whether you understand it

16:31.740 --> 16:33.500
as that which is beyond reason

16:33.500 --> 16:35.100
or that which is below reason,

16:35.100 --> 16:36.420
there's an aspect of reality,

16:36.420 --> 16:38.660
which cannot be reduced to reason.

16:38.660 --> 16:41.580
If you just keep it on the side as a blind spot,

16:41.580 --> 16:44.740
at some point it comes crashing back in.

16:44.740 --> 16:47.100
And so then you can complain as much as you want

16:47.100 --> 16:50.260
about like crazy leftists

16:50.260 --> 16:53.420
or kind of our intercategories

16:53.420 --> 16:56.540
that are smashing into our world and hybridization

16:57.020 --> 17:00.940
and all of this weird stuff that we're seeing happening,

17:00.940 --> 17:04.540
but that is what's going to happen.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.820
Yeah, and this is what's happened to Dawkins as well.

17:06.820 --> 17:08.100
Of course, he was, I mean,

17:08.100 --> 17:10.460
at this sort of rational scientific utopia,

17:10.460 --> 17:14.060
but then what was it, back in 2014,

17:14.060 --> 17:17.580
he lost his Humanist of the Year award

17:17.580 --> 17:20.540
because of something he'd said about men

17:20.540 --> 17:22.020
not being able to become women or something.

17:22.020 --> 17:23.620
Yeah, because he didn't want to play that.

17:23.620 --> 17:25.180
So that's a great example.

17:25.180 --> 17:28.060
Like the great example of what happens

17:28.060 --> 17:32.020
if you don't have the proper mystery at the outset,

17:32.020 --> 17:34.700
at the beginning of your reasonable process,

17:34.700 --> 17:38.100
then you'll have other mysteries that will be inserted,

17:38.100 --> 17:41.340
other dogmas and other aporias and contradictions.

17:41.340 --> 17:43.500
And so someone will say exactly that,

17:43.500 --> 17:47.060
like a man can be a woman straight faced and look at you.

17:47.060 --> 17:49.580
And what they're yearning for,

17:49.580 --> 17:51.180
like what they're desiring for,

17:51.180 --> 17:53.500
it's something like the Trinity, for example.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.820
It's something like there is a mystery

17:55.820 --> 17:59.220
about how unity and multiplicity coexist

17:59.220 --> 18:02.660
and how they infinitely coexist

18:02.660 --> 18:05.820
because we can't completely account

18:05.820 --> 18:08.660
for the man in which one and many function

18:08.660 --> 18:10.540
in our experience of the world.

18:10.540 --> 18:13.460
And so we perceive, we have insight

18:13.460 --> 18:17.620
about an infinite, transcendent way

18:17.620 --> 18:20.180
in which those two are joined together.

18:20.180 --> 18:22.260
And so that's the kind of mystery

18:23.020 --> 18:24.780
that the medieval, for example,

18:24.780 --> 18:26.820
could see as the outlet of reality.

18:26.820 --> 18:27.780
But if you don't have that,

18:27.780 --> 18:32.060
then you'll end up with a man as a woman.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.660
Yeah, so I get unity and multiplicity

18:34.660 --> 18:36.500
when it comes to the Trinity.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.820
How's the man as a woman,

18:38.820 --> 18:42.060
how's the desire for unity and multiplicity

18:42.060 --> 18:43.140
being expressed there?

18:43.140 --> 18:46.500
It's the desire for something to be itself and not itself.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.900
It's the desire for something to be,

18:49.900 --> 18:52.420
how can they say this, to be trans categorical?

18:53.580 --> 18:54.420
Right?

18:54.420 --> 18:55.540
And you can see it, by the way,

18:55.540 --> 18:58.220
you probably know about the trans is sacred

18:58.220 --> 19:03.300
like aspect that has happened over the last few years.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.620
And there was the,

19:06.620 --> 19:08.700
and even when they put on a version of,

19:11.580 --> 19:12.980
what was it?

19:12.980 --> 19:15.900
They put on a play with,

19:15.900 --> 19:18.620
why is it my brain sometimes breaks down?

19:18.620 --> 19:21.420
What's the name of the woman who was a knight

19:21.420 --> 19:23.260
in the 14th century?

19:24.180 --> 19:25.020
Joan of Arc.

19:25.020 --> 19:28.060
They put on a play of Joan of Arc where Joan of Arc is trans.

19:28.060 --> 19:30.900
And in the beginning of the play,

19:30.900 --> 19:35.100
he, she says, I am one in many.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.860
I am beyond category.

19:36.860 --> 19:38.340
I am sacred.

19:38.340 --> 19:39.380
I am like God.

19:39.380 --> 19:40.220
I am.

19:41.340 --> 19:43.460
And she literally says I am

19:43.460 --> 19:46.780
because she's using the categories

19:46.780 --> 19:49.860
of trans-rational infinite,

19:49.860 --> 19:53.460
but applying it to what is intercategorical.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.860
And so that's the problem that happens.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.820
That's why postmodernism was like

19:57.820 --> 20:01.940
an inevitable side effect of the enlightenment.

20:01.940 --> 20:03.900
And this is obviously something that people

20:03.900 --> 20:06.340
like Pinker and Lindsay and all these guys won't like,

20:06.340 --> 20:10.180
but that he himself said that his project

20:10.180 --> 20:11.500
was the enlightenment.

20:11.500 --> 20:14.220
He believed that his project was the continuation

20:14.220 --> 20:17.540
of the enlightenment because there's this reaching

20:17.540 --> 20:19.260
into the intercategorical.

20:21.620 --> 20:24.300
Do you understand how the intercategorical is like

20:24.300 --> 20:29.300
is a trick to make you confuse that which transcends reason?

20:31.300 --> 20:33.780
Because that's what intercategorical things do

20:33.780 --> 20:35.460
is that the elude reason.

20:36.740 --> 20:37.580
Okay.

20:37.580 --> 20:39.700
So let's just get this clear.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.420
Because so categories, what I'm hearing is that

20:42.420 --> 20:45.740
in the transgender move, it's this desire to throw off

20:45.740 --> 20:49.900
these, finish the sentence,

20:49.900 --> 20:52.380
these rational categories that have been put on us,

20:52.380 --> 20:55.140
this sort of search for transcendence.

20:55.140 --> 20:56.860
Is that what you're getting at?

20:57.860 --> 21:02.460
It's a desire to use the intercategorical

21:02.460 --> 21:04.060
to destroy the categories.

21:04.060 --> 21:06.220
That's what, first of all, if you want to one simple,

21:06.220 --> 21:10.140
not to destroy, but to undermine the categories.

21:10.180 --> 21:13.060
If you want to understand postmodernism,

21:13.060 --> 21:15.660
like you could, that's maybe one definition

21:15.660 --> 21:17.300
of what postmodernism is.

21:17.300 --> 21:22.300
It's the perception that the intercategorical,

21:22.300 --> 21:26.180
the indefinite, you could use the word indefinite,

21:26.180 --> 21:28.420
the indeterminate, you could use that word too,

21:28.420 --> 21:30.220
that all of these categories,

21:30.220 --> 21:35.220
they undermine the hierarchy of reasonable categories.

21:36.220 --> 21:40.820
And so the image, all the images that you see now,

21:40.820 --> 21:43.900
for example, like even the image of the stranger,

21:43.900 --> 21:48.140
or the idea of the migrant as an intercategorical figure,

21:48.140 --> 21:52.700
as a figure that it doesn't have his own identity

21:52.700 --> 21:54.020
based on the place where he is.

21:54.020 --> 21:56.020
He's a kind of exception to the rule.

21:56.020 --> 21:59.580
He's, the migrant is someone that doesn't fit,

21:59.580 --> 22:03.660
that isn't a citizen, that cannot be,

22:03.700 --> 22:06.500
cannot be accounted for by the system.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.580
Like all of these, all of these types,

22:08.580 --> 22:13.180
all of these types of categories that are used

22:13.180 --> 22:18.060
by postmodern thinkers are there to do that,

22:18.060 --> 22:20.900
are there to undermine reason.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.460
Okay, so just to clarify,

22:22.460 --> 22:24.700
because of course, when we're talking about categorizing,

22:24.700 --> 22:26.740
we're going back all the way to Aristotle.

22:26.740 --> 22:30.460
So in what way, because my sense,

22:30.460 --> 22:31.780
I don't know your thought very well,

22:31.780 --> 22:35.820
but my sense is you're going to have more time

22:35.820 --> 22:37.180
for the ancient Greeks.

22:37.180 --> 22:42.180
So Aristotle was engaged in that practice of categorizing.

22:42.460 --> 22:46.860
So how did the enlightenment go wrong in that sense?

22:46.860 --> 22:48.820
Was it that Aristotle held categorizing

22:48.820 --> 22:52.140
alongside the transcendent?

22:52.140 --> 22:54.940
Is that why it went, it was acceptable?

22:54.940 --> 22:59.460
No, it's, the problem with the enlightenment

22:59.460 --> 23:03.740
is that it, at least on the face of it,

23:03.740 --> 23:07.340
it wanted to, let's say, systematize,

23:07.340 --> 23:10.540
turn the world into an encyclopedia, right?

23:10.540 --> 23:12.300
You know, like, that's one of the reasons

23:12.300 --> 23:14.440
why the encyclopedia was such a great part

23:14.440 --> 23:15.700
of the enlightenment project.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.480
It's like, we're going to define everything.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.020
We're going to measure everything.

23:19.020 --> 23:20.820
We're going to quantify everything.

23:20.820 --> 23:24.580
And we'll have, we'll basically understand reality.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.860
But it's ignoring an aspect,

23:27.860 --> 23:31.700
which is that there are aspects of reality

23:31.700 --> 23:36.120
which cannot be categorized for different reasons.

23:36.120 --> 23:39.740
And one of that is the intercategorical, the monster.

23:39.740 --> 23:41.800
The monster cannot be categorized.

23:41.800 --> 23:42.640
That is one.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.980
And then the other one is rather the transcategorical,

23:45.980 --> 23:47.700
like, or the supracategorical,

23:47.700 --> 23:52.020
that which gives, that which gives way for categories,

23:52.020 --> 23:54.140
the infinite, you know, being itself,

23:54.980 --> 23:57.780
or the different aspects that are beyond

23:57.780 --> 24:00.260
simple analytical categories.

24:01.100 --> 24:06.100
But what I'm saying is that in removing the religious part,

24:06.460 --> 24:09.500
removing the transcendent aspect, what happened now,

24:09.500 --> 24:12.420
and this is why postmodernism in some ways

24:12.420 --> 24:14.980
is inevitable to the enlightenment,

24:14.980 --> 24:19.660
is that need for that which is beyond reason

24:19.660 --> 24:22.260
is not going away in people.

24:22.300 --> 24:25.020
It's just part of how humans are,

24:25.020 --> 24:28.500
but they can find it in the monster.

24:28.500 --> 24:33.500
Like they can find that titillation of the transgressive,

24:33.540 --> 24:36.220
the titillation of that which is beyond categories

24:36.220 --> 24:38.900
in the intercategorical, you know?

24:38.900 --> 24:42.660
And so that's what you find in the, sorry.

24:42.660 --> 24:43.660
So I get that.

24:43.660 --> 24:46.780
I just still, I hear you saying that the enlightenment

24:46.780 --> 24:49.820
we're trying to put everything away in their boxes,

24:49.820 --> 24:51.660
but I'm not an Aristotle expert,

24:51.660 --> 24:55.620
but I mean, he was engaged in that sort of activity

24:55.620 --> 25:00.620
way back then, granted he had more openness to the transcendent,

25:00.780 --> 25:02.620
but...

25:02.620 --> 25:04.420
If there's nothing, no, but there's nothing wrong

25:04.420 --> 25:06.500
with trying to categorize reality.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.260
So as soon as you're getting rid of, yeah.

25:08.260 --> 25:10.740
It's just as you tried, but ultimately.

25:10.740 --> 25:14.140
Now, the problem, again, the issue with enlightenment

25:14.140 --> 25:17.340
is not just that, is that the enlightenment already,

25:17.340 --> 25:21.260
even at the outset, was not completely that project.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.820
There's a dark side to the enlightenment,

25:23.820 --> 25:27.820
which people call the counter-enlightenment.

25:27.820 --> 25:29.620
And like you said, Kant is part of the enlightenment.

25:29.620 --> 25:33.100
It's hilarious because ask Steven Hicks

25:33.100 --> 25:34.820
if Kant is part of the enlightenment.

25:34.820 --> 25:37.620
He'll tell you, no, Kant is the counter-enlightenment.

25:38.580 --> 25:42.460
And so it's like this weird idea that the enlightenment thinkers,

25:42.460 --> 25:43.700
there are aspects to them

25:43.700 --> 25:48.540
that a lot of the modern enlightenment defenders don't like.

25:48.540 --> 25:51.980
And they put them in what they call the counter-enlightenment,

25:51.980 --> 25:56.340
which is in some ways aspects of what reason and magic

25:56.340 --> 25:59.420
and hermeticism and all of this stuff,

25:59.420 --> 26:02.620
which is like a weird parasite on the enlightenment

26:02.620 --> 26:04.140
that you can't completely get rid of.

26:04.140 --> 26:07.260
It continues on through characters like Swedenborg

26:07.260 --> 26:10.260
or Jacob Berm or all of these esotericists

26:10.260 --> 26:15.260
in the Western canon that are not opposite to the enlightenment.

26:15.780 --> 26:18.180
They're the same people.

26:18.180 --> 26:20.820
It's like Dick Duff spent a lot of his life

26:20.820 --> 26:24.220
trying to contact the order of the Rosicross.

26:24.220 --> 26:26.020
And it's like, so these are the same people.

26:26.020 --> 26:29.660
They're not different types.

26:29.660 --> 26:31.820
So there's this weird parasite in the enlightenment

26:31.820 --> 26:35.820
of magic and esotericism and Freemasonry, all this stuff.

26:35.820 --> 26:39.180
Freemasonry, yeah, interesting.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.140
Now, there's loads we could get into,

26:41.140 --> 26:43.020
but you brought up Pinkham,

26:43.140 --> 26:45.340
and I was just reading his Enlightenment now.

26:45.340 --> 26:48.580
And you were at the ARC conference.

26:48.580 --> 26:52.580
I was at it back in October, and it does seem like...

26:52.580 --> 26:55.180
I think people are tired of nihilism.

26:55.180 --> 26:59.140
So there's not many that are good.

26:59.140 --> 27:03.020
There's not many that are going for full-on nihilism these days.

27:03.020 --> 27:04.980
You mentioned Islam and woke,

27:04.980 --> 27:09.220
but it seems at least within the ARC crowd,

27:09.540 --> 27:13.020
the main worldviews that are emerging are Christianity

27:13.020 --> 27:15.180
and Enlightenment humanism.

27:15.180 --> 27:19.180
And that's why I think your discussion with Lindsay

27:19.180 --> 27:25.180
was so revealing, because, well, it revealed this crack,

27:25.180 --> 27:27.580
and it'll be very interesting to see

27:27.580 --> 27:29.980
where that goes over the next couple of years.

27:29.980 --> 27:32.580
Now, that's a speculative question,

27:32.580 --> 27:34.340
but do you have any thoughts on that?

27:35.340 --> 27:36.940
Well, I want to say, first of all,

27:36.940 --> 27:38.940
that I really admire James Lindsay.

27:38.940 --> 27:40.340
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I want to...

27:40.340 --> 27:42.340
I want it to be careful that, you know,

27:42.340 --> 27:44.940
I mean, he went after me quite aggressively,

27:44.940 --> 27:46.540
but I don't feel the same about him.

27:46.540 --> 27:51.940
I think that the work that he's doing is really useful,

27:51.940 --> 27:55.340
and that all the effort he's putting into helping people

27:55.340 --> 27:58.340
see the kind of communistic stuff is amazing.

27:58.340 --> 28:00.740
So I think that's important to really understand

28:01.740 --> 28:05.740
because I actually don't have a problem with James Lindsay at all.

28:05.740 --> 28:08.740
But what I do have a problem with, let's say,

28:08.740 --> 28:11.740
I agree with him in terms of his attack on communism

28:11.740 --> 28:15.740
and all the stuff, but I do not believe

28:15.740 --> 28:19.740
that we can have a fully secular society

28:19.740 --> 28:21.740
that I don't think that that's possible.

28:21.740 --> 28:26.740
And I really do believe that the kind of secular humanism

28:26.740 --> 28:28.740
that the Enlightenment proposed

28:29.740 --> 28:30.740
ran aground.

28:30.740 --> 28:34.740
It is not sufficient to hold societies together.

28:34.740 --> 28:37.740
It's not sufficient to hold us together as people.

28:37.740 --> 28:43.740
Now, the danger is we also cannot weaponize religion.

28:43.740 --> 28:44.740
You can try.

28:44.740 --> 28:46.740
But if you weaponize religion,

28:46.740 --> 28:49.740
then you turn it into that which it is not.

28:49.740 --> 28:50.740
That is, if you try to make religion

28:50.740 --> 28:53.740
into something that will help you keep your society together,

28:53.740 --> 28:55.740
then it will become an opportunity

28:56.740 --> 29:00.740
and so the worship of God, you could say,

29:00.740 --> 29:03.740
or the acknowledging of the absolutely transcendent

29:03.740 --> 29:06.740
and our submission to it and our participation in it

29:06.740 --> 29:08.740
is a good in itself.

29:08.740 --> 29:11.740
And downstream from that,

29:11.740 --> 29:15.740
you do have all the gifts of civilization that come with it.

29:15.740 --> 29:19.740
And so on the one hand, how can I say this?

29:19.740 --> 29:22.740
On the one hand, I see that James is afraid

29:22.740 --> 29:24.740
of the weaponization of Christianity

29:24.740 --> 29:27.740
in his attack on Christian nationalism.

29:27.740 --> 29:28.740
But on the other hand,

29:28.740 --> 29:30.740
I see him doing the exact same thing

29:30.740 --> 29:33.740
in trying to get the Christians on board with him

29:33.740 --> 29:35.740
so that he can create his democratic

29:35.740 --> 29:38.740
so secular Enlightenment utopia,

29:38.740 --> 29:41.740
which doesn't exist, which is not possible.

29:41.740 --> 29:45.740
And so that's why I do believe

29:45.740 --> 29:48.740
that the only solution to our predicament

29:48.740 --> 29:52.740
is a true return to Christianity,

29:52.740 --> 29:54.740
like not a pretend one, not a...

29:54.740 --> 29:56.740
And that's why most of my interactions

29:56.740 --> 29:58.740
are not political at all.

29:58.740 --> 29:59.740
Then nothing to do with politics.

29:59.740 --> 30:01.740
It's mostly trying to help people reconnect

30:01.740 --> 30:03.740
with the deepest aspects of our tradition

30:03.740 --> 30:06.740
to give them the right orientation

30:06.740 --> 30:10.740
for the rest of their other participations.

30:13.740 --> 30:15.740
By the way, if you want to know

30:15.740 --> 30:17.740
if you're sure the culture war isn't over,

30:17.740 --> 30:20.740
we're going to see a lot more of the conflict.

30:20.740 --> 30:24.740
But in the end, the truth is that

30:24.740 --> 30:29.740
the secularist voice is going to grow weaker and weaker

30:29.740 --> 30:30.740
as things come.

30:30.740 --> 30:31.740
And I don't say that.

30:31.740 --> 30:34.740
I'm not saying that in a celebratory tone.

30:34.740 --> 30:38.740
I just don't see any other way for the future.

30:38.740 --> 30:40.740
And the question, again, is going to be

30:40.740 --> 30:42.740
which one is which.

30:43.740 --> 30:48.740
New religious perspective is going to be dominant.

30:48.740 --> 30:50.740
And there are several possibilities.

30:50.740 --> 30:53.740
One is a weird new globalist religion

30:53.740 --> 30:55.740
that worships AI and the earth

30:55.740 --> 30:57.740
and all this kind of stuff that we're seeing.

30:57.740 --> 30:58.740
The other is Islam.

30:58.740 --> 31:01.740
That is definitely a real possibility.

31:01.740 --> 31:04.740
And the third is, I believe,

31:04.740 --> 31:09.740
the possibility of some kind of Christian reawakening

31:10.740 --> 31:12.740
to the roots of who we are

31:12.740 --> 31:18.740
and all our ethics and all that we believe in

31:18.740 --> 31:25.740
are writing on this ontology based on love

31:25.740 --> 31:26.740
that Christianity presents,

31:26.740 --> 31:30.740
like this idea that the world is held together by love,

31:30.740 --> 31:35.740
that that is the mode of existence of reality.

31:35.740 --> 31:36.740
Those are the possibilities.

31:37.740 --> 31:39.740
I don't see, maybe there are others,

31:39.740 --> 31:41.740
but those are the possibilities I see.

31:41.740 --> 31:42.740
Yeah.

31:42.740 --> 31:43.740
So let's get clear on what the concern is.

31:43.740 --> 31:45.740
The concern from people like Lindsay

31:45.740 --> 31:50.740
isn't that Christians are going to say vote pro-life

31:50.740 --> 31:51.740
or something like that.

31:51.740 --> 31:54.740
So try and influence politics in that way.

31:54.740 --> 31:55.740
The concern must be that the Christians

31:55.740 --> 31:58.740
are going to try and get in charge

31:58.740 --> 32:03.740
and inflict their views on the rest of society.

32:03.740 --> 32:05.740
Is that how you understand this

32:05.740 --> 32:08.740
or push back against Christian nationalism?

32:11.740 --> 32:12.740
That's possible.

32:12.740 --> 32:15.740
I don't know if that's his complete,

32:15.740 --> 32:20.740
like what the reason for his such a strong reaction.

32:20.740 --> 32:29.740
Now, this is a difficult situation

32:29.740 --> 32:30.740
that we find ourselves in,

32:30.740 --> 32:35.740
because if we realize that that which affords

32:35.740 --> 32:43.740
the type of freedom that you love is based in a way of being

32:43.740 --> 32:46.740
that is Christian and it's based on a message

32:46.740 --> 32:51.740
and a way of seeing the world that is basically Christian,

32:51.740 --> 32:58.740
but you also don't want Christians to back off,

32:58.740 --> 33:03.740
then you're ultimately going to lose the freedom that you love.

33:03.740 --> 33:07.740
And so I understand that it's a difficult situation

33:07.740 --> 33:11.740
because you also understand what somebody would not want

33:11.740 --> 33:18.740
Christians to completely impose their worldview on others.

33:18.740 --> 33:19.740
And so to be honest,

33:19.740 --> 33:22.740
I don't completely know what the solution is,

33:22.740 --> 33:29.740
but in the end, that's going to happen no matter what.

33:29.740 --> 33:30.740
I don't know what to say.

33:30.740 --> 33:36.740
If you think that whatever happened to COVID isn't coming back,

33:36.740 --> 33:39.740
I mean, you have to be so naive.

33:39.740 --> 33:43.740
What happened to COVID is going to happen again, folks.

33:43.740 --> 33:45.740
What's that going to be?

33:45.740 --> 33:47.740
I know it's going to be,

33:47.740 --> 33:51.740
but what I mean is that the capacity to impose the world on us

33:51.740 --> 33:54.740
and to impose the way we live and the way we,

33:54.740 --> 33:59.740
and a kind of social credit system or some kind of something

33:59.740 --> 34:02.740
is coming towards us at full speed.

34:02.740 --> 34:06.740
Now, the question is, what do we have to mitigate that?

34:06.740 --> 34:16.740
And I do believe that when I look at all the solutions in front of me,

34:16.740 --> 34:25.740
I do believe that the foundation of Christian love is the best solution,

34:25.740 --> 34:27.740
but I don't know how it's going to play out.

34:27.740 --> 34:31.740
I also don't have that much hope that it's going to...

34:31.740 --> 34:35.740
This is also maybe the reason why I don't totally understand Lindsay's thing

34:35.740 --> 34:39.740
is that I don't really believe that even Christianity,

34:39.740 --> 34:42.740
if it returns, at least in the short term,

34:42.740 --> 34:45.740
at least for 150 years, 100 years,

34:45.740 --> 34:49.740
is going to have the power to take over society.

34:49.740 --> 34:52.740
It's mostly a way for people to be able to live

34:52.740 --> 34:55.740
approximately in their families, in their communities,

34:55.740 --> 34:58.740
in their parishes, in their more local settings

34:58.740 --> 35:01.740
in order to be able to live the best life possible

35:01.740 --> 35:03.740
and to make the most of things.

35:03.740 --> 35:05.740
That's the way that I see it.

35:05.740 --> 35:07.740
And in some ways, maybe plant a seed for the future,

35:07.740 --> 35:11.740
but the idea of some kind of Christian fascism in the United States

35:12.740 --> 35:14.740
I don't know, it's like I just don't see it.

35:14.740 --> 35:16.740
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm naive.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.740
I just do not see that as a...

35:19.740 --> 35:21.740
So it's a real drarer sort of thing.

35:21.740 --> 35:24.740
Yeah, it's more like it definitely is going to do wrong.

35:24.740 --> 35:25.740
Yeah, yeah.

35:25.740 --> 35:26.740
It's just a rather...

35:26.740 --> 35:28.740
I totally agree on this idea,

35:28.740 --> 35:31.740
like that in some ways that his Benedict option,

35:31.740 --> 35:33.740
you know, not that if we're treating home society,

35:33.740 --> 35:36.740
but rather being deliberate about your community,

35:36.740 --> 35:39.740
about your choices, about what it is that you want to be,

35:39.740 --> 35:41.740
is the way to go.

35:41.740 --> 35:42.740
But I don't see it...

35:42.740 --> 35:44.740
I don't think we're going to save the world.

35:45.740 --> 35:46.740
Yeah, it's funny.

35:46.740 --> 35:49.740
We had Oliver at Donovan on a few weeks ago.

35:49.740 --> 35:52.740
He's arguably the top Christian political thinker

35:52.740 --> 35:54.740
of the last 100 years.

35:54.740 --> 35:57.740
And we put this to him partly,

35:57.740 --> 35:58.740
but he was just like,

35:58.740 --> 36:01.740
look, you have to deal with what's realistic.

36:01.740 --> 36:05.740
And a return to Christendom is just not on the cards.

36:05.740 --> 36:08.740
Now, I know plenty of people who are pushing for it.

36:08.740 --> 36:11.740
I sort of knew Christendom, but certainly in his view,

36:11.740 --> 36:13.740
it's not realistic.

36:13.740 --> 36:16.740
But do you know many people that are pushing for it legitimately

36:16.740 --> 36:18.740
or as an aesthetic?

36:18.740 --> 36:21.740
I know there's a meme aspect to it,

36:21.740 --> 36:27.740
which is the idea of pushing the idea of a Christian world

36:27.740 --> 36:31.740
as a driving, as something that drives you, right?

36:31.740 --> 36:34.740
As something that kind of gives you hope

36:34.740 --> 36:36.740
and gives you a vision to move towards.

36:37.740 --> 36:39.740
Maybe it's because I'm not in the same circle to you,

36:39.740 --> 36:42.740
but I don't think I've ever met anyone who really thinks

36:42.740 --> 36:44.740
that we're going to have a Christian emperor.

36:44.740 --> 36:47.740
I don't know what exactly they can imagine.

36:47.740 --> 36:51.740
Well, there's integralism from the Roman Catholic perspective.

36:51.740 --> 36:52.740
I'm not Roman Catholic.

36:52.740 --> 36:54.740
I don't know well.

36:54.740 --> 36:58.740
No, in the strongest versions of it, as I understand it,

36:58.740 --> 37:03.740
people like me, Protestants, we can survive,

37:03.740 --> 37:05.740
but we're not allowed to share our views in public.

37:05.740 --> 37:08.740
Again, that's in the strongest version.

37:08.740 --> 37:11.740
Is that happening in the United States of America

37:11.740 --> 37:14.740
or in Europe, in England?

37:14.740 --> 37:16.740
Look, this isn't my view at all.

37:16.740 --> 37:18.740
Exactly, I'm just naive.

37:18.740 --> 37:21.740
Maybe there's a Christian emperor over the hill.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.740
Who knows?

37:22.740 --> 37:27.740
I just really do not see that as a possibility at all.

37:27.740 --> 37:32.740
Yeah, I make a habit of speaking to people

37:32.740 --> 37:34.740
with wildly different views from me.

37:35.740 --> 37:37.740
This is one of the views that comes up,

37:37.740 --> 37:42.740
but basically, what they'll say is that the problems

37:42.740 --> 37:46.740
are that large, that that sort of solution.

37:46.740 --> 37:49.740
I'm just going to get very dark before that solution is available.

37:49.740 --> 37:50.740
I'm not defending it.

37:50.740 --> 37:52.740
I'm just saying some people say it.

37:52.740 --> 37:54.740
Sorry, do you want to say something?

37:54.740 --> 37:57.740
No, if they say it's going to get very dark

37:57.740 --> 38:01.740
in the sense that things are going to get so completely out of control

38:01.740 --> 38:05.740
that people are going to desire a Christian,

38:05.740 --> 38:11.740
that the nation will yearn for a kind of Christian culture,

38:11.740 --> 38:13.740
then maybe, but that's not anytime soon.

38:13.740 --> 38:16.740
And if that happens, then that'll happen.

38:16.740 --> 38:21.740
I mean, it's like, if it happens that people see how dark

38:21.740 --> 38:25.740
our kind of nihilistic freedoms can become

38:25.740 --> 38:28.740
and that they turn their heart to the Lord,

38:29.740 --> 38:37.740
like Nineveh, all of people turning towards a better morality,

38:37.740 --> 38:41.740
let's say, then I don't see why that would be a problem.

38:41.740 --> 38:43.740
That would just be what happens.

38:43.740 --> 38:46.740
But the idea of some Christian king that comes

38:46.740 --> 38:49.740
and just imposes it on everybody, that's ridiculous.

38:49.740 --> 38:52.740
I don't see that's the most ridiculous.

38:53.740 --> 38:56.740
But they don't, it's not a king.

38:56.740 --> 39:01.740
It's sort of a, it's a new elite they have in mind.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.740
Again, it's not my view.

39:03.740 --> 39:07.740
So McGillchrist, just brief few final questions.

39:07.740 --> 39:11.740
McGillchrist, we had Ian on a month or two ago.

39:11.740 --> 39:14.740
I'm reading, I'm in the middle of the matter of things.

39:14.740 --> 39:17.740
So I read Master and the Mystery years ago.

39:17.740 --> 39:19.740
I'm in the matter of things now.

39:19.740 --> 39:21.740
I'm going to go as far as say I'm almost a disciple of him,

39:21.740 --> 39:23.740
because I'm so obsessed with his thought.

39:23.740 --> 39:25.740
And I think he's on point.

39:25.740 --> 39:28.740
And he just seems to be saying something similar to you,

39:28.740 --> 39:31.740
that we need reason and intuition, reason and mystery.

39:31.740 --> 39:33.740
No, I totally agree.

39:33.740 --> 39:35.740
I definitely agree with McGillchrist.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.740
I also interviewed him once on my own channel.

39:38.740 --> 39:42.740
I think that we are very similar in terms of our perspective.

39:42.740 --> 39:45.740
And, you know, a lot of the cognitive psychologist types,

39:45.740 --> 39:48.740
John Revekey as well and in our Bernardo Castro,

39:48.740 --> 39:53.740
and there are several right now that are just showing

39:53.740 --> 39:55.740
the inevitability of this question.

39:55.740 --> 40:00.740
Like that we cannot, that the idea that analytic processes

40:00.740 --> 40:05.740
and this kind of, that is not sufficient to human experience,

40:05.740 --> 40:08.740
that there is an entire other aspect,

40:08.740 --> 40:10.740
which is the grasping, which is the intuition,

40:10.740 --> 40:14.740
which is the seeming of the shining meaning

40:14.740 --> 40:17.740
that is beyond the multiplicity.

40:17.740 --> 40:21.740
This holistic, let's say, vision of the world.

40:21.740 --> 40:25.740
This is, you know, not only is it accounted for in every single

40:25.740 --> 40:28.740
religion and tradition from the beginning of time,

40:28.740 --> 40:32.740
but now, like I said, it seems from the cognitive psychologist

40:32.740 --> 40:34.740
that they're realizing this is inevitable.

40:34.740 --> 40:37.740
You know, and I think I'm not, I don't have the courage

40:37.740 --> 40:39.740
to get into the matter of things,

40:39.740 --> 40:44.740
because even when I contemplate the brick, like I, like, who, who.

40:44.740 --> 40:47.740
I know, I thought the same way, but it's amazing.

40:47.740 --> 40:49.740
It's, I'm just obsessed.

40:49.740 --> 40:52.740
I've put a copy that I'm giving it to everyone in my department.

40:52.740 --> 40:54.740
We're going to read and discuss it.

40:54.740 --> 40:56.740
It's really quite something.

40:56.740 --> 40:59.740
I think, so I'm really on board with McGillchrist,

40:59.740 --> 41:03.740
but I do think, though, that in terms of the analytic tradition,

41:03.740 --> 41:06.740
as you know, there was something of a renaissance

41:06.740 --> 41:09.740
of Christian philosophy of religion in the last 60 years.

41:09.740 --> 41:13.740
Alvin Plankton, Richard Swinburne, Eleanor Stump,

41:13.740 --> 41:15.740
William Lane Creeks, the big popularizer.

41:15.740 --> 41:18.740
I do think, though, there is, there's a lot to be said

41:18.740 --> 41:22.740
for the work they've done, and they can at least present

41:22.740 --> 41:25.740
the Christian faith in a way that connects with

41:25.740 --> 41:28.740
the sort of Lindsay Boghossian outlook.

41:28.740 --> 41:30.740
No, I put it to Pete last week, and he was like,

41:30.740 --> 41:32.740
yeah, I just don't think their arguments are good,

41:32.740 --> 41:35.740
but I mean, their arguments are being taken seriously

41:35.740 --> 41:37.740
by really top analytic philosophers,

41:37.740 --> 41:40.740
ones who aren't even theists.

41:40.740 --> 41:42.740
Well, maybe I'm not, I'm not, myself,

41:42.740 --> 41:45.740
I'm not a big fan of that type of argumentation,

41:45.740 --> 41:48.740
but it's also because I'm a, you know,

41:48.740 --> 41:50.740
I really come from a more mystical tradition,

41:50.740 --> 41:56.740
like orthodoxy, I think I have a beauty-first approach,

41:56.740 --> 41:59.740
let's say, to the question, you know,

41:59.740 --> 42:03.740
and I think that that's why I'm closer to the cognitive psychologist,

42:03.740 --> 42:07.740
let's say, in terms of a phenomenological point of view,

42:07.740 --> 42:10.740
you know, the idea that there are certain ways

42:10.740 --> 42:14.740
in which reality, you know, lays itself out to us

42:14.740 --> 42:17.740
that have this dance, right, that have this pattern in it,

42:17.740 --> 42:19.740
and we can't completely, we can't ignore it

42:19.740 --> 42:23.740
because it is the structure of our experience.

42:23.740 --> 42:27.740
So I tend to go there more to kind of outlay

42:27.740 --> 42:30.740
the structure of our experience and show how it is captured

42:30.740 --> 42:35.740
in the, let's say, the liturgical life of the church

42:35.740 --> 42:38.740
in the aiming towards mystery, right,

42:38.740 --> 42:41.740
this idea of that there's something, you know,

42:41.740 --> 42:43.740
there's something hidden behind the veil

42:43.740 --> 42:45.740
that is making everything exist

42:45.740 --> 42:51.740
and you can't completely capture it, right,

42:51.740 --> 42:55.740
it eludes our capacity to analyze it.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.740
Anyway, so that's been my approach,

42:57.740 --> 43:01.740
but I mean, I'm happy that if that type of argumentation

43:01.740 --> 43:03.740
can help some people, you know.

43:03.740 --> 43:05.740
Yeah, yeah, I got that.

43:05.740 --> 43:07.740
I think the final point is,

43:07.740 --> 43:09.740
because we always have this problem

43:09.740 --> 43:12.740
with false teachers and false prophets.

43:12.740 --> 43:14.740
I mean, my own history is a complicated one.

43:14.740 --> 43:17.740
As a teenager, I was mentored by a guy who claimed to be a prophet

43:17.740 --> 43:20.740
and he turned out to be, I think, a sociopath.

43:20.740 --> 43:23.740
He was exposed two years ago

43:23.740 --> 43:26.740
when he stole a church worth $60 million

43:26.740 --> 43:28.740
and blamed it on the Holy Spirit

43:28.740 --> 43:30.740
and it was in the newspapers and everything.

43:30.740 --> 43:33.740
So, I've seen these guys that appeal to mystery

43:33.740 --> 43:36.740
and, of course, this guy appeals even now.

43:36.740 --> 43:39.740
He's appealing to the Holy Spirit as to why he necked this church

43:39.740 --> 43:42.740
and I think one thing that we can do with reason

43:42.740 --> 43:46.740
and one of the reasons I've benefited from being trained

43:46.740 --> 43:51.740
in the analytic tradition, even though I'm very aware of its weakness,

43:51.740 --> 43:53.740
the sort of McGilchrist-like weaknesses,

43:53.740 --> 43:58.740
is that you can spot the BS, basically.

43:59.740 --> 44:02.740
You definitely need to spot the BS.

44:02.740 --> 44:05.740
That's one of the reasons for tradition.

44:05.740 --> 44:11.740
Tradition is there to help you also, let's say, spot the BS

44:11.740 --> 44:16.740
because there's a manner in which the people that say they're prophets,

44:16.740 --> 44:20.740
they can't just fly off the handle.

44:20.740 --> 44:22.740
They can't just do whatever they want

44:22.740 --> 44:27.740
because they have to be down in a certain way of being in a certain tradition.

44:27.740 --> 44:31.740
So, tradition helps to prevent that kind of stuff.

44:31.740 --> 44:35.740
There's a method of discernment, let's say.

44:35.740 --> 44:38.740
I'm not Catholic, but in the Catholic Church, for example,

44:38.740 --> 44:41.740
they actually have quite a method of discernment

44:41.740 --> 44:45.740
to be able to know if someone's visions are legitimate.

44:45.740 --> 44:50.740
I think it's a little even too, let's say, rigorous,

44:50.740 --> 44:52.740
but it's pretty rigorous.

44:52.740 --> 44:54.740
If you want to have some kind of recognition

44:54.740 --> 44:56.740
as someone who has visions,

44:56.740 --> 45:00.740
they'll send someone to study you for months

45:00.740 --> 45:03.740
and they'll ask you all the questions

45:03.740 --> 45:06.740
and they'll try to figure out what intentions you have

45:06.740 --> 45:08.740
and what it is that's motivating you

45:08.740 --> 45:14.740
and they can discern the spirits, let's say.

45:14.740 --> 45:16.740
But you're right that, for sure,

45:16.740 --> 45:20.740
the world of religion has always been a world of bullshit.

45:20.740 --> 45:22.740
There's no way around that.

45:22.740 --> 45:26.740
The question is, this is the problem again with the whole thing.

45:26.740 --> 45:31.740
It's like the world of religion has always been available

45:31.740 --> 45:36.740
to those who want to trick others and use bullshit.

45:36.740 --> 45:39.740
So then what?

45:39.740 --> 45:42.740
So now you just cast it aside, you just say

45:42.740 --> 45:45.740
that because some people use mystery to trick people,

45:45.740 --> 45:47.740
therefore there is no mystery,

45:47.740 --> 45:49.740
or because some people are dishonest in their religious approach

45:49.740 --> 45:52.740
to use people's desire to follow, for example,

45:52.740 --> 45:56.740
to deceive them and use that to make money

45:56.740 --> 45:59.740
or to get sexual favors or whatever,

45:59.740 --> 46:03.740
you're not going to get rid of people's desire to follow.

46:03.740 --> 46:08.740
And so either they follow the stupid idiotic guru

46:08.740 --> 46:10.740
or they follow Taylor Swift

46:10.740 --> 46:14.740
or they follow whatever nonsense on TikTok.

46:14.740 --> 46:17.740
So what are they going to follow?

46:17.740 --> 46:21.740
And that's again, that's one of the blind spots again,

46:21.740 --> 46:24.740
is to say, well, if people could all just be reasonable,

46:24.740 --> 46:26.740
reasonable like me,

46:26.740 --> 46:29.740
then we would have no problems.

46:29.740 --> 46:32.740
But that's just not how it is.

46:32.740 --> 46:35.740
Yeah, it's throwing the baby out with the bath water.

46:35.740 --> 46:39.740
Yes, you have holy oils coming from saints

46:39.740 --> 46:42.740
that are recognized as being virtuous

46:42.740 --> 46:46.740
and true to the transcendent,

46:46.740 --> 46:49.740
and people take them and they sometimes use them in words

46:49.740 --> 46:52.740
or maybe a little superstitious, that's possible.

46:52.740 --> 46:57.740
You have that or you have like the new age shop

46:57.740 --> 46:59.740
and people go and get crystals

46:59.740 --> 47:01.740
and we don't know what it's related to.

47:01.740 --> 47:05.740
It has no connection to the rest of our engagement with reality.

47:05.740 --> 47:09.740
I know that that might sound like I'm being cynical,

47:09.740 --> 47:11.740
but I'm not being cynical.

47:11.740 --> 47:15.740
I'm actually seeing that people need these markers of participation.

47:15.740 --> 47:17.740
They just need them.

47:17.740 --> 47:19.740
Yeah, and I believe you're Orthodox,

47:19.740 --> 47:21.740
so you have that sense of tradition.

47:21.740 --> 47:24.740
I think the problem is in a lot of the non-dom Protestant churches,

47:24.740 --> 47:26.740
they just don't have a sense of tradition.

47:26.740 --> 47:28.740
They've got the Apostles Creed and whatever,

47:28.740 --> 47:30.740
but after that it's just the Bible

47:30.740 --> 47:34.740
and there is no sort of inherited wisdom.

47:34.740 --> 47:36.740
Jonathan Paju, thank you so much.

47:36.740 --> 47:40.740
That was a very rich and very discussion.
