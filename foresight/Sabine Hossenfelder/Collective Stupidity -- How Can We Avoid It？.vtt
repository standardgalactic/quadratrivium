00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
You and I together are more than the sum of the parts, it's not just that I know some

00:05.280 --> 00:10.320
things you don't know and you know some things I don't know, like how to prevent hair from

00:10.320 --> 00:16.400
looking like sauerkraut. No, there's more to it. Maybe, hopefully, every once in a while,

00:16.400 --> 00:22.720
I point one of you into a new direction and you see something I couldn't see. Together,

00:22.720 --> 00:28.560
we're more intelligent than either of us alone. But collective intelligence has a flip side,

00:28.640 --> 00:34.240
collective stupidity. Sometimes, we're more stupid together than we are on our own.

00:34.960 --> 00:41.600
But what makes some groups of people intelligent and others stupid? That's what we'll talk about today.

00:45.920 --> 00:49.920
Everything around you is made of just a few types of elementary particles.

00:49.920 --> 00:55.200
Fundamentally, there's little difference between you and a cheesecracker. Both are made from up

00:55.200 --> 01:01.200
and down quarks with electrons held together by gluons and photons. If you combine many of those

01:01.200 --> 01:07.440
particles, you get increasingly complex systems. First, you get atoms, then molecules, and those

01:07.440 --> 01:14.000
molecules can combine to living beings, which can combine to societies. Each time you combine

01:14.000 --> 01:20.400
many constituents with their interactions, you can get completely new behavior. We call this behavior

01:20.400 --> 01:26.240
emergent. The difference between you and a cheesecracker isn't on the fundamental level.

01:26.240 --> 01:32.640
It's on the emergent level. You talk. A cheesecracker doesn't, or if it does,

01:32.640 --> 01:39.360
maybe cut back on those THC gummies. A simple example of emergent behavior is a wave. If you

01:39.360 --> 01:46.320
combine a lot of water molecules, you get waves. But waves don't exist for single molecules.

01:46.320 --> 01:51.920
This makes no sense. Waves only exist on the collective level. This is what it means for

01:51.920 --> 01:57.600
something to be emergent. It's a property that doesn't make sense on the fundamental level.

01:57.600 --> 02:03.680
It's not only particles that have emergent behavior. Living beings have, too. People can do

02:03.680 --> 02:10.480
a la-ola wave. Sheep flow like fluids through gates, and starlings do mesmerizing murmurations.

02:11.120 --> 02:17.040
And it's not only motion that living beings coordinate. They also coordinate the exchange

02:17.040 --> 02:23.120
of information. Fungi, for example, coordinate their growth to optimize the transport of

02:23.120 --> 02:29.840
nutrients. According to a study that was just published last year, they do this by using directional

02:29.840 --> 02:36.080
memory and collision-induced branching. This emergent behavior can even be exploited to get

02:36.080 --> 02:43.360
fungi to produce microscopic devices. For example, slime mold has been coaxed into growing a network

02:43.360 --> 02:49.680
that can transport dyes. In another experiment, the mold networks were connected to create

02:49.680 --> 02:56.160
logical circuits. While these are remarkable examples of collective behavior, scientists

02:56.160 --> 03:02.080
don't think that fungi are actually collectively intelligent, though I think that's exactly what

03:02.080 --> 03:07.280
the fungi want us to think. The animals that are probably best known for their collective

03:07.280 --> 03:13.760
intelligence are bees. They use motion, often called the bee dance, to share information about

03:13.760 --> 03:19.600
food sources, and they build hives together with a sophisticated division of labor to raise their

03:19.600 --> 03:26.400
young. We call them collectively intelligent not just because they are able to share information,

03:26.400 --> 03:32.880
but because they base decisions on their shared information they learn from each other.

03:32.880 --> 03:38.720
Ants show a similar intelligence in colonies. They communicate with each other by pheromones to

03:38.720 --> 03:45.600
signal where food can be found, and together they can defeat enemies much larger than themselves.

03:45.600 --> 03:51.760
But ants also show us the problems with collective intelligence. Ants try to follow each other's

03:51.840 --> 03:57.760
trails, and if some of them accidentally draw such a trail into a circle, they'll walk in

03:57.760 --> 04:04.960
circles until they die. This death spiral isn't collective intelligence, it's collective stupidity.

04:04.960 --> 04:10.480
It's what happens when a usually beneficial behavior goes badly wrong, and the same thing

04:10.480 --> 04:16.560
can happen for humans. Two heads are better than one, the saying goes, and sometimes it's true.

04:16.560 --> 04:21.840
Contestants of the quiz show, who wants to be a millionaire, can ask the audience to answer a

04:21.840 --> 04:28.240
limited number of questions for them. The audience then collectively votes on what they believe the

04:28.240 --> 04:34.000
correct answer to be. It doesn't always work, but statistically the audience gets it right

04:34.000 --> 04:40.800
91% of the time. But the wisdom of the crowds wasn't born with quiz shows. The idea is much

04:40.800 --> 04:47.120
older. It dates back to 1907 when Francis Galton went to a livestock exhibition in Plymouth

04:47.120 --> 04:53.040
and asked a group of about 800 people to guess the weight of an ox that was on display. He

04:53.040 --> 05:01.040
collected the results and calculated the average value of all estimates. The result was 1,207 pounds,

05:01.040 --> 05:07.760
almost exactly the right weight of 1,198 pounds. He published the results of this cutting-edge

05:08.000 --> 05:13.280
search in Nature. Those were the days, people. Broadly speaking, the reason large groups are

05:13.280 --> 05:18.800
better than individuals in answering simple questions is that some people in the group

05:18.800 --> 05:25.600
are knowledgeable about the topic, and the rest make errors that average out. This tells you

05:25.600 --> 05:30.720
that asking the audience isn't going to make you a millionaire if there are very few people who

05:30.720 --> 05:36.640
know the answer. But if you ever need to know the weight of an ox, then asking people at a 19th

05:36.640 --> 05:42.880
century farmer's market is a pretty good idea. There are more modern applications of this idea too.

05:42.880 --> 05:49.680
Average guesses of crowds are valuable information. It's why companies use crowdsourcing to collect

05:49.680 --> 05:56.000
feedback from some customers to make recommendations for others. It's why they solicit reviews to

05:56.000 --> 06:02.480
judge the quality of products and services. It's why YouTube wants to know how long you

06:02.480 --> 06:09.360
watch a video and whether you can be bothered to click like. This information is worth real money.

06:09.360 --> 06:15.040
Better still, people provide it for free. Another example of collective intelligence that you're

06:15.040 --> 06:20.800
all familiar with is Wikipedia. Yes, it has its problems, which is why I've given up

06:20.800 --> 06:26.960
correcting entries on quantum mechanics, but it's good enough to be useful just by collecting

06:26.960 --> 06:33.840
information. Indeed, Wikipedia usefully has an entry about the reliability of Wikipedia

06:33.840 --> 06:39.440
that collects studies on the subject. Results depend on topic, but by and large they found

06:39.440 --> 06:46.400
that Wikipedia tends to be as accurate as other encyclopedias, though it's frequently incomplete

06:46.400 --> 06:52.320
of completely omitting relevant information. A particularly impressive use of collective

06:52.320 --> 06:58.880
human intelligence are stock markets. Yes, they have a bad reputation, but that's because most

06:58.880 --> 07:04.880
of us only take note of the stock market when something goes wrong. Most of the time, however,

07:04.880 --> 07:11.440
the stock exchange guides investment to all our advantage. It works because the incentives of

07:11.440 --> 07:18.240
individual traders are aligned with the optimal distribution of resources, at least in theory.

07:18.240 --> 07:25.360
But this only works so long as we have appropriate regulations that govern trade. Like if you signed

07:25.360 --> 07:31.360
it, you're bound to it. If you agree to pay $44 billion for a social media platform and put your

07:31.360 --> 07:36.960
name on the paper, then you can't just change your mind the next day. You're also not allowed to

07:36.960 --> 07:43.120
trade insider information. Monopolies must be broken up, and there's a lot of other regulations on

07:43.120 --> 07:49.840
trade, because without them, the stock market wouldn't produce results that we want. It'd still

07:49.840 --> 07:56.560
collect information from individuals, but the outcome would no longer be what we desire, and that

07:56.560 --> 08:02.880
brings us to the problem. The problem is groups are only collectively intelligent when the mechanism

08:02.880 --> 08:09.200
to collect their information is carefully set up. If you crowdsource information from a group

08:09.200 --> 08:14.880
and want errors to average out, then the members of the group must put forward their private

08:14.880 --> 08:20.800
information independently of the others. This means most importantly, you shouldn't know what

08:20.800 --> 08:27.680
other people have said before you put forward your own guess. This is why they only show you poll

08:27.680 --> 08:35.360
results after you've voted yourself, and they ask the audience is set up that way too. But if that's

08:35.440 --> 08:41.280
not the case, if people know what others have said before making up their own mind, then the

08:41.280 --> 08:48.560
information can become systematically biased. This can lead to all kinds of trouble. The famous

08:48.560 --> 08:54.800
Ash experiment from the 1950s illustrates this. In this experiment, participants were assigned

08:54.800 --> 09:00.960
to groups with confederates of the experimenter and were asked to match the length of line zone

09:00.960 --> 09:08.160
cards with a comparison line. The confederates consistently gave obviously incorrect answers,

09:08.160 --> 09:13.760
but many participants agreed with them, even though their own perceptions told them that

09:13.760 --> 09:20.560
the answers were wrong. Now that the participants agreed with the wrong answers doesn't necessarily

09:20.560 --> 09:25.760
mean they believed them. If I was in a room with a group of people who insisted that the

09:25.760 --> 09:31.120
longer line is actually the shorter one, I'd also agree with them. I'd also keep my back

09:31.120 --> 09:37.760
to the wall and inch towards the exit. This is why, even though the Ash experiment has been

09:37.760 --> 09:44.160
reproduced in many different variants, just how to interpret it has remained somewhat controversial.

09:44.800 --> 09:50.720
People might have many reasons to agree with others, even if they don't believe them. But

09:50.800 --> 09:57.360
while the interpretation for why people act this way has remained unclear, there's little doubt

09:57.360 --> 10:04.080
that they do. And this is how information cascades work. An information cascade happens when

10:04.080 --> 10:10.080
individuals ignore the information that they privately hold and instead pass on the information

10:10.080 --> 10:16.960
they obtain from others for whatever reasons. Like all collective behaviors, this one isn't

10:16.960 --> 10:23.840
necessarily bad. In fact, it's usually beneficial. You've all seen information cascades on social

10:23.840 --> 10:30.080
media. In the early days of the Covid pandemic, information was sparse and we passed on what

10:30.080 --> 10:35.920
little we heard about symptoms and prevention. That's an example for how information cascades

10:35.920 --> 10:42.400
can be useful. But misinformation can spread the same way. This is, for example, how panic

10:42.400 --> 10:49.040
buying comes about. No one actually thinks they need 100 rolls of toilet paper. But if everyone

10:49.040 --> 10:55.760
else thinks they need it, maybe these people know something I don't know. Better safe than sorry.

10:55.760 --> 11:02.000
For crowd judgment to become systematically skewed, it isn't necessary that people completely

11:02.000 --> 11:07.760
ignore their information. It's sufficient already if they're influenced. And this happens

11:07.760 --> 11:13.120
everywhere around us. Multiple studies have found that information cascades happen for

11:13.120 --> 11:21.040
software adoption, online reading, product ratings and other everyday instances. Since I know you

11:21.040 --> 11:26.480
don't come here for the fluff, sociologists distinguish such information cascades from

11:26.480 --> 11:33.360
hurt behavior. Hurt behavior just means that individuals behave the same way, but not necessarily

11:33.360 --> 11:40.000
that in doing so they ignore their own information. In reality, we often see a mix of information

11:40.000 --> 11:46.320
cascades and hurt behavior. A particularly influential example of hurt behavior comes from

11:46.320 --> 11:52.880
an experiment by Milgram in the 1960s. Yes, that's the same Milgram who did the much discussed

11:52.880 --> 11:59.120
prisoner experiments. But this one was a little more innocent. He recruited a few people to stand

11:59.200 --> 12:05.840
in the street corner and point at nothing in the sky. Sure enough, other people came to join them

12:05.840 --> 12:12.320
to look at nothing. YouTube is basically built on this idea. If you come across a video that's

12:12.320 --> 12:18.560
been watched by a million people, you're more likely to watch it than if it had only 10 views.

12:18.560 --> 12:24.160
And most of the time, that's probably a good decision. But it also means that social media

12:24.160 --> 12:30.240
has a strong rich get richer trend, where you eventually end up with some people who are popular

12:30.240 --> 12:35.920
for being popular. They're interesting just because others think they're interesting.

12:35.920 --> 12:41.680
Many financial crashes are due to information cascades, and that's certainly nothing new.

12:41.680 --> 12:48.000
In the 18th century, the Scottish businessman John Law founded the Mississippi Company,

12:48.000 --> 12:53.200
whose purpose it was to develop the French territory near the Mississippi River.

12:53.200 --> 13:00.000
His stocks sold like warm bagels all over Europe, and Law was granted a monopoly on the trade.

13:00.800 --> 13:07.120
This was already a bad idea, but things got worse when the French government began printing

13:07.120 --> 13:14.000
more money so that everyone could buy more Mississippi stocks. Inevitably, eventually,

13:14.000 --> 13:19.600
investors realized there was no way the supposed wealth was ever to become real.

13:19.600 --> 13:23.840
They tried to get their money out of the bank, and the bubble collapsed,

13:23.840 --> 13:28.640
leaving many people bankrupt, economic growth seriously damaged,

13:28.640 --> 13:35.120
and trust in the financial system in shambles. The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s worked

13:35.120 --> 13:40.960
like that too. Everyone and their dog were investing into internet startups, even though

13:40.960 --> 13:46.720
no one really knew how those were supposed to eventually make money. The value of these

13:46.720 --> 13:52.880
stocks became incredibly overinflated, when those startups eventually went live,

13:52.880 --> 13:58.720
but created little to no revenue, the bubble burst. A more recent example of an information

13:58.720 --> 14:05.440
cascade was the 2008 financial crash. Banks were handing out mortgages to borrowers who couldn't

14:05.440 --> 14:11.680
reasonably be expected to pay them back. The banks then collected the mortgages and other loans

14:11.680 --> 14:18.720
into packages called securities that were sold to investors. When interest rates went up,

14:18.720 --> 14:24.960
it became clear that these mortgages and loans wouldn't be paid back. The value of the securities

14:24.960 --> 14:32.080
dropped rather suddenly and caused a big wave of bankruptcies. The 2008 financial crisis is

14:32.080 --> 14:38.640
particularly tragic in that it was preventable. Many people working in those banks knew that

14:38.640 --> 14:44.720
handing out those loans was a really bad idea that would eventually go wrong. But if they hadn't

14:44.720 --> 14:51.520
played along, they'd have lost their job, so the cascade rolled on. What do we learn from all that?

14:51.520 --> 14:57.840
Can we use some of this information to our own advantage? Well, yes. First of all, we learn that

14:57.840 --> 15:02.960
if you want to make good use of the collected intelligence of a group, you have to try and

15:02.960 --> 15:09.520
find a format in which everyone is comfortable coming forward with their information. And you

15:09.520 --> 15:17.120
need a way to prevent one person from being biased by another person to the extent possible. That is,

15:17.120 --> 15:22.000
of course, if coming to an intelligent decision is what you want in the first place. If you want

15:22.000 --> 15:27.760
the meeting to just be over quickly, then I suggest you ask the most aggressive dude for an opinion

15:27.840 --> 15:34.480
first and let him shout down anyone who dares disagree. Of course, making good use of collective

15:34.480 --> 15:42.400
intelligence is easier said than done. So let me mention two things that I found useful. First,

15:42.400 --> 15:48.880
we have a natural tendency to focus on the issues that come up more often. But those aren't

15:48.880 --> 15:55.200
necessarily the most important ones. This is why managers like to use tables to identify

15:55.200 --> 16:01.200
how important and urgent a problem is before spending time on it. I know that academics tend

16:01.200 --> 16:07.040
to find those tables somewhat silly, but it's indeed a way to prevent collective stupidity.

16:07.600 --> 16:12.800
The second useful thing to know is that just reminding people that their opinion might be

16:12.800 --> 16:19.920
biased can help to reduce the effect. That's for small teams whose decision making you can influence.

16:20.480 --> 16:26.400
But what about the large crowds that you find on social media? One thing that I mentioned already

16:26.400 --> 16:32.960
in my earlier video about social media is that just stepping back and thinking about what you're

16:32.960 --> 16:40.160
doing is a way to prevent regrets. And I formulate that so carefully because for some people maybe

16:40.160 --> 16:45.920
preventing a cascade of false information isn't what they want in the first place. But more

16:45.920 --> 16:52.560
interestingly, you can beat the crowd by being part of a group. I know this sounds somewhat

16:52.560 --> 16:59.680
contradictory, but let me explain. Numerous studies have found that small groups make better

16:59.680 --> 17:06.480
decisions than individuals on objective tasks. That is, tasks for which there is an answer that

17:06.480 --> 17:13.360
is either right or wrong, such as which way is the baggage claim left or right? Ask your family

17:13.360 --> 17:17.840
and you're less likely to find yourself next to a broken vending machine at the far end of the

17:17.840 --> 17:24.640
terminal. It's easy to see how this is useful on social media. Not sure whether that email is

17:24.640 --> 17:31.520
legit or a scam? Ask a few friends. Another useful thing to know is that the biggest problem for

17:31.520 --> 17:38.400
groups in getting things right is having members which are confident but often wrong. That's because

17:38.400 --> 17:44.960
the confident people make up their mind first and this then causes an information cascade which

17:44.960 --> 17:50.880
sways the less confident people. So be careful around confident people. It's not that they are

17:50.880 --> 17:58.080
necessarily wrong, but if they are, they amplify errors. Another issue is that we tend to overrate

17:58.080 --> 18:05.440
the relevance of our own opinion compared to that of others. It's called egocentric bias. A way to

18:05.440 --> 18:10.400
beat this issue is to hold back on forming an opinion, but of course that doesn't work if

18:10.400 --> 18:16.960
everyone does it. In summary, making intelligent decisions isn't easy and we're not naturally

18:16.960 --> 18:22.720
good at it. Whether a group of people makes intelligent or dumb decisions depends strongly on

18:22.720 --> 18:28.640
how the information is aggregated. Under certain circumstances, errors can amplify each other

18:28.640 --> 18:34.800
rather than canceling out. As you see, it isn't easy being sharper than a cheesecracker.

18:34.880 --> 18:40.640
Collective intelligence is all well and fine, but as they say, garbage in, garbage out. The most

18:40.640 --> 18:47.120
important thing you can do for your intelligence is to pick your input wisely and if you like quality

18:47.120 --> 18:53.440
input about scientific discoveries, I recommend you check out our sponsor Nautilus. Nautilus is a

18:53.440 --> 18:59.600
literary science magazine. They care about writing and they use it to its full potential.

18:59.600 --> 19:05.200
What I particularly like about them is that they cover all areas of science, from astronomy to

19:05.200 --> 19:11.600
economics, history, neuroscience, philosophy and physics. They'll keep you well informed on topics

19:11.600 --> 19:16.880
of current interest and it's always a pleasure to read. I've written several contributions for

19:16.880 --> 19:23.040
Nautilus myself about quantum gravity and black holes and other stuff that I normally write about,

19:23.040 --> 19:29.200
but what makes Nautilus so fun is the breadth of the topics they cover. A recent masterpiece is

19:29.200 --> 19:35.360
for example Amanda Gefter's essay What Plants Are Saying About Us. This will really make you

19:35.360 --> 19:40.880
question what you know about cognition. Or if you're interested in the intersection of art and

19:40.880 --> 19:47.280
science, they have a recent essay by Elena Kazamiya, The Enemy Made Visible, about a sculpture

19:47.280 --> 19:53.120
representing the COVID virus. The artist herself said it's by far the best she has read on the

19:53.120 --> 19:59.760
sculpture. So there you go, science, art, philosophy and great writing all in one place.

19:59.760 --> 20:05.040
You can join Nautilus as a digital only member or get a print subscription to receive six of

20:05.040 --> 20:11.120
their beautifully illustrated editions. In addition to full access to all the stories in Nautilus,

20:11.120 --> 20:17.840
members receive benefits like priority access to events, exclusive products and product discounts.

20:17.840 --> 20:22.800
For example, they recently partnered with the Australian streetwear company Jungles

20:22.800 --> 20:28.400
to draw attention to ocean science. The revenue goes to their Ocean Conservation Fund.

20:28.400 --> 20:34.480
Nautilus is really much more than just a magazine. And of course we do have a special offer for you.
