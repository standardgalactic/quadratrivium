0	6320	artificial intelligence. It seems like lately everyone talks about it everywhere all at once.
6320	12160	But is artificial intelligence really intelligent? What do we even mean by intelligent? And if it's
12160	18240	not yet intelligent, how would we find out if it were to become intelligent? That's what we'll talk
18240	27440	about today. Paul Graham, computer scientist, writer and investor, recently wrote that what
27440	32400	worries him about artificial intelligence is that few things are harder to predict than the
32400	38400	ways in which someone much smarter than you might outsmart you. Sabina Hossenfelder, theoretical
38400	44080	physicist, writer and involuntary comedian knows from personal experience that you don't have to
44080	50320	be smart to appear smart and that worries her much more. When it comes to AI, the question of
50320	56160	consciousness receives all the attention, but intelligence is much more difficult to define.
56160	62240	For example, few of my colleagues would doubt I'm conscious, but opinions on my intelligence
62240	67280	diverge. While there's no agreed upon definition for intelligence, there are two
67280	73040	ingredients that I believe most of us would agree are aspects of intelligence. First,
73040	79280	there's the ability to solve a large variety of problems, especially new ones. This requires
79360	86800	knowledge transfer, creativity and the ability to learn from mistakes. Second, there's the ability
86800	92080	to think abstractly, to understand concepts and their relations and deduce new properties.
92640	98000	This relies heavily on the use of logic and reasoning. The relation between knowledge
98000	103760	and intelligence is especially difficult to untangle. This is well illustrated by a 1980
103760	108880	thought experiment from the philosopher John Searle, known as the Chinese Room.
108880	114640	Searle asks us to imagine we're in a room with a book that contains instructions for responding to
114640	121120	Chinese text. From outside the room, people send in pieces of paper with Chinese characters,
121120	126720	because that's totally a thing people do. We use our book to figure out how to respond to these
126720	133120	messages and return an answer. The person outside might get away thinking there's someone in the
133120	139040	room who understands Chinese, even though that isn't so. Searle used this thought experiment
139040	145120	to argue that a piece of software doesn't really understand what it's doing. I explained in my
145120	150880	earlier video why that's a bad analogy for artificial intelligence, but why the Chinese
150880	156720	Room doesn't tell us much about understanding, it illustrates nicely the difference between
156720	163040	knowledge and intelligence. In the Chinese Room, we and our instruction book undoubtedly have
163040	169680	knowledge, but we're not intelligent. We can't solve any new problems, we can't transfer knowledge,
169680	176080	we have no capacity for abstract thought or logical reasoning, we're just following instructions.
176080	182400	But as long as the person outside is just asking for knowledge, they won't be able to tell whether
182400	187920	we're intelligent. Okay, so we have a vague intuitive idea for what it means to be intelligent,
187920	193200	but can we make this more precise? If you can't measure it, does it even exist?
193200	198320	Trying to measure intelligence is not a new idea. The first attempt has been attributed to Sir
198320	204720	Francis Galton, a British polymath and cousin of Charles Darwin. But Galton's work on intelligence
204720	211120	focused on sensory and perceptual tasks. He developed tests for skills such as reaction
211120	217920	time and visual acuity. A good start, I guess, but it conflates cognitive with physical abilities.
217920	224320	The next step was taken by Charles Spearman at the beginning of the 20th century. He introduced the
224320	230560	g-factor, a measure for what he called general intelligence as opposed to specific factors
230560	236080	that might be a talent in a particular domain. Spearman wasn't trying to say you're done if
236080	241840	you don't know everything. It was rather that he thought everyone is a genius in some area,
241840	246240	but it takes suitable tests to figure out just what that area is.
246800	252560	Briefly after that, but unrelated to Spearman's work, psychologist Alfa Benet and Th√©odore
252560	258400	Seymour took on the task of developing a test to quantify intellectual ability in children.
258400	263920	It was an assignment by the French government with the aim of identifying children who needed
263920	270480	special support. The Benet-Seymour test came out first in 1905. It includes questions of
270480	275840	comprehension, for example about the content of short stories, the meaning of words,
275840	282000	counting backwards, memorizing images and stuff like that. Similar tests are still used in some
282000	288400	places to assess whether children are old enough to start primary school. In a story that my mum
288400	294480	never tires of telling, I failed my primary school assessment because I refused to hop on one leg.
295040	299600	So please forgive me if I'm somewhat cynical about assessment tests.
299600	306400	The idea of the intelligence quotient IQ for short goes back to these early ideas from Spearman,
306400	312400	Benet and Seymour. If you want to take an IQ test today, you could try to assemble a piece
312400	318240	of furniture from a certain Swedish retailer. But the standard way to do it is to see a psychologist
318240	323680	and have them walk you through a certified test. There are several institutions who regularly
323680	328800	update these tests and who sell the most recent version to licensed practitioners.
329360	335360	These tests are not meant to be taken on your own, though you find some similar versions online.
335360	341120	The most commonly used IQ test might be the Wexler Intelligence Scale that comes in a version
341120	347440	for children and one for adults. It measures intellectual ability with several subtests that
347440	354240	assess verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, mathematical ability and processing
354240	360080	speed. One big disadvantage of this test is, however, that verbal comprehension strongly
360080	365920	depends on what language you've grown up with and what education you've gone through. In most
365920	372080	cases, it's a good proxy for general intelligence, but some people fall through the cracks because of
372080	377920	their social and cultural background. A popular alternative is therefore Raven's Progressive
377920	384320	Matrices, a non-verbal test for abstract reasoning skills that works by completing patterns.
384320	389280	There's also the Cato Cultural Fair Test, which also relies on abstract patterns
389280	395280	and that was specifically designed to minimize cultural bias. The scores for these tests are
395280	400800	calculated by recruiting a sample group, setting their average score to 100 points
400880	408000	and one standard deviation to 15 points. That means that about 68% of people will score between
408000	416880	85 and 115 points. One tricky point is that since the IQ is defined relative to that sample group,
416880	422880	the average IQ of the entire population that the sample is supposedly representative for
422880	429440	will generically not be exactly 100. Generally, the IQ of any group will depend on the comparative
429440	435360	sample. This is why in an international comparison, the average IQ of people in different countries
435360	442960	can noticeably diverge from 100. It's because the score 100 was based on a global average sample,
442960	449600	so nations can come out higher or lower. In a recent global comparison, the highest scoring
449600	457600	country was Japan with an average IQ of 106, closely followed by Taiwan. Germany came in 10th
457600	466000	with almost exactly 100 on average. The UK came in 20th with 99 and the United States 28th with 99.5.
466640	471600	At the bottom of the list, you find countries where malnutrition is rampant and illiteracy is
471600	478160	common, such as Nicaragua and Nepal. This brings up the question just what these IQ tests measure.
478720	483680	Studies have shown that the IQ changes with education, health, environment and age.
483680	489040	We also know that it has a strong heritable component, but it can fluctuate wildly.
489040	493840	According to a study by researchers from University College London in 2011, IQ and
493840	500000	teenagers changed by as much as 21 points over four years, and that was only on the days when
500000	505280	the teenagers could find their brain to begin with. There's also some evidence that cognitive
505280	512240	training can improve parts of the performance on IQ tests, such as working memory and verbal abilities.
512880	519120	So in the end, what does the IQ test tell us? As the psychologist Edwin Boring put it already
519120	525440	in 1923, intelligence is what the tests test. Basically, the psychologist's version of
525440	530400	shut up and calculate. And this is fine if what you want is just a number to find out what it's
530400	536000	correlated with. But in the end, we don't just want a number. We want to know what someone or
536000	542400	something can do with this supposed intelligence. We want to know what we can expect from them.
542400	548800	We want to know how far we can trust them not to be stupid. And while measuring things is all
548800	555360	well and fine, the idea that intelligence can be reduced to a single number is itself problematic.
555920	561120	Of course, we're not the first to point that out, which is why some smart people have thought of
561120	567520	more intelligent ways of measuring intelligence. One popular alternative to the IQ is the theory
567520	574480	of multiple intelligences proposed in 1983 by the developmental psychologist Howard Gardner.
574480	580480	According to Gardner, the IQ is too narrow a measure for intelligence. Gardner argued that
580480	586480	intelligence is not just a singular entity, but rather a collection of eight different ones.
586480	593680	That's linguistic, logical, mathematical, musical, spatial, bodily kinesthetic, interpersonal,
593680	600000	interpersonal, and naturalistic intelligence. While Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences
600000	605280	offers an appealingly inclusive view of intelligence, it's been criticized for being
605280	610400	subjective, lacking empirical evidence, and being in practice too difficult to use.
610960	615920	You see, it's a nice idea in principle to say there's no easy way to measure intelligence,
615920	623040	but in reality, it's rather useless. If you feel that eight types of intelligence are a little excessive,
623040	629440	maybe Robert Sternberg's triarchic theory of intelligence is more to your liking. In his 1985
629440	635680	book Beyond IQ, Sternberg proposed that intelligence is not solely based on cognitive abilities,
635680	641440	but also on practical intelligence and creative intelligence. By practical intelligence, he means
641440	647120	the ability to adapt to real-life situations, and creative intelligence is the capacity to
647120	653600	generate novel and valuable ideas. But Sternberg's triarchic theory has the same basic problem as
653600	659200	Gardner's eight levels. The definition is vague and in practice, it's difficult to assess,
659200	663920	so it's never been widely used. Okay, now that we have some idea of what we mean by
663920	669280	intelligence in humans, let's talk about intelligent software. Computer scientists
669280	675600	distinguish three different types of artificial intelligence. First, there's narrow AI, also
675600	682400	known as weak AI. It's designed to perform specific tasks with high proficiency. This includes AI
682400	688800	systems that can recognize speech, play games, or identify objects and images. Every AI you've
688800	695520	met so far was a narrow AI. Second, there's the idea of general artificial intelligence,
695520	702160	also referred to as strong AI. It's supposed to have an intelligence comparable to that of humans,
702160	708400	useful across a wide range of tasks and domains, except understanding English spelling, which is
708400	714640	something humans weren't meant to understand. Finally, there could be super-intelligent AI,
714640	720800	which is one that surpasses human intelligence in most, if not all, tasks. This brings up the
720800	726400	interesting question whether we'd notice if a super-intelligent AI pretends to be dumb
726400	732880	so as to not scare us into shutting it down. So how could we find out whether an AI is intelligent?
733440	739280	Well, the most obvious thing you can do is give it an IQ test. There are a few problems with this,
739280	746400	though. The first problem is that the current IQ test for humans tests things such as working speed
746400	751840	and memory, and even a dumb computer will easily outperform humans on these measures,
752400	757520	which makes me wonder whether these tasks should ever have been part of an intelligence test.
758080	763600	They arguably matter for cognitive function and are therefore correlated with intelligence,
764240	769440	but are a good memory and processing speed really a sign of intelligence on their own?
770080	776080	The second problem is that IQ tests for humans use different types of verbal and visual
776080	782400	input, and at the moment, fewer AIs are good at all of these tasks. But leaving aside memory and
782400	789760	speed tests and focusing only on the tasks chat GPT can do, Ika Rovainen, an assessment psychologist
789760	796320	in Finland, gave everybody's favorite AI the verbal part of the previously mentioned vexler test.
797040	803680	This includes questions about the meaning of words or the similarity between words or phrases.
803680	809840	It also includes questions of general knowledge, like who elects the president or what's the capital
809840	818240	of Iceland. Chat GPT scored 155. But as we've all learned in the past couple of months, chat GPT's
818240	824480	knowledge is extremely narrow, even when it comes to verbal intelligence. A sunny example is that
824480	830480	while it's been trained on text, it doesn't understand the idea of letters. If you ask
830480	836480	it to write a paragraph on a particular topic, say animals, that doesn't contain say the letter
836480	842960	in, it has no idea what to do, but doesn't know that it doesn't know what to do. It also can't
842960	848560	count the number of letters in a sentence, though it'll still answer the question if you ask it to.
849200	855600	This tells us three things. First, the issue isn't that an AI doesn't know some things,
855600	861200	but rather that it doesn't know what it doesn't know. Second, in practice, we often measure
861200	867120	dumbness rather than intelligence. We look for negatives. We want to know where someone or
867120	873680	something fails and use that to assess its intelligence. Third, we use our own intelligence
873680	880160	to search for these failures, which is an approach that will inevitably eventually fail.
880160	886880	The Turing test is based on this idea that we can use our own intelligence to judge that of an AI.
886880	891440	The Turing test is named after the British mathematician and computer scientist Ellen
891440	898240	Turing, who proposed it in 1950. It relies on an operator asking questions to an artificial
898240	904720	intelligence and a human to try to figure out which is which. If the human evaluator can't
904720	909600	distinguish the machine's response from the human's, the machine passes the test.
910240	916160	There have been a few claims in the past 10 years or so that a chatbot has passed the Turing test,
916160	921200	but they didn't have the best scientific standards. I suspect that someone's going
921200	927520	to stage a Turing test later this year just to make a point and will see AI pass it.
927520	932000	However, the Turing test doesn't so much prove that the machine is intelligent,
932000	936640	but rather that it has the ability to pretend to be intelligent.
936640	941680	Another problem with the Turing test is that, well, it depends on how smart the person is
941680	947520	who asks the questions. To take at least this issue out of the picture, Terry Winograd,
947520	952560	a professor of computer science at Stanford University, came up with the Winograd Schema
952560	958480	Challenge for AI. The challenge involves a series of questions that are designed to be
958480	965120	easy for humans to answer but hard for computers. Each question is based on a sentence that
965120	970400	contains an ambiguity, and the correct interpretation of the sentence requires
970400	974720	common sense reasoning about the context. Here is an example.
974720	980640	The city councilman refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.
980640	987040	The challenge is to determine who they refers to in this sentence, the city councilman or the
987040	994000	demonstrators. Or maybe I should say that's what the challenge was because several AIs have
994000	1001520	passed the test already in 2019 with more than 90% accuracy. But this test only looks for verbal
1001520	1008560	ability. You can also test AIs based on the IQ tests used for human intelligence that we discussed
1008560	1014320	earlier. For example, Raven's progressive matrices have been proposed for testing the
1014320	1021200	visual abilities of AIs. In 2020, two German scientists developed an AI that was able to
1021200	1028560	generate a fitting image from scratch. It solved an AI-adapted variant of the test with 98% accuracy.
1029120	1035440	More recently, in March 2023, another group developed an AI that scored 87% accuracy on
1035440	1041040	the regular test. There are further tests that are specifically designed for AIs,
1041040	1046800	such as variants of the Bongad problems. This is a software-generated data set of abstract
1046800	1053280	sketches, some of which match a pattern and some that don't. The AI must decide if new
1053280	1061040	sketches match the pattern. In a 2020 study, researchers found that AIs reach 60-70% accuracy,
1061040	1067840	whereas humans tend to reach more than 90%. So this one's still somewhat of a challenge for AIs.
1067840	1074640	Good news for our egos, I guess. In summary, researchers are using a number of ways to measure
1074640	1080960	how intelligent artificial intelligence is and how it progresses. AIs have always been ahead of
1080960	1087360	humans in terms of memory and processing speed and have recently rapidly caught up on verbal
1087360	1094560	and visual tasks. While there's still nowhere near humans in terms of general reasoning skills,
1094560	1100880	I think it's only a matter of time until they get there. And I agree with Paul Graham, we should
1100880	1106960	worry less about consciousness and more about intelligence, because of the two, intelligence
1106960	1113440	is much more dangerous. How will we know when an AI becomes intelligent? Probably because it'll
1113440	1119360	start arguing with us about what we mean by intelligence. If you want to boost your intelligence,
