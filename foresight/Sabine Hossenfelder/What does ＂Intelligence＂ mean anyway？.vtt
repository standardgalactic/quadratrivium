00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
artificial intelligence. It seems like lately everyone talks about it everywhere all at once.

00:06.320 --> 00:12.160
But is artificial intelligence really intelligent? What do we even mean by intelligent? And if it's

00:12.160 --> 00:18.240
not yet intelligent, how would we find out if it were to become intelligent? That's what we'll talk

00:18.240 --> 00:27.440
about today. Paul Graham, computer scientist, writer and investor, recently wrote that what

00:27.440 --> 00:32.400
worries him about artificial intelligence is that few things are harder to predict than the

00:32.400 --> 00:38.400
ways in which someone much smarter than you might outsmart you. Sabina Hossenfelder, theoretical

00:38.400 --> 00:44.080
physicist, writer and involuntary comedian knows from personal experience that you don't have to

00:44.080 --> 00:50.320
be smart to appear smart and that worries her much more. When it comes to AI, the question of

00:50.320 --> 00:56.160
consciousness receives all the attention, but intelligence is much more difficult to define.

00:56.160 --> 01:02.240
For example, few of my colleagues would doubt I'm conscious, but opinions on my intelligence

01:02.240 --> 01:07.280
diverge. While there's no agreed upon definition for intelligence, there are two

01:07.280 --> 01:13.040
ingredients that I believe most of us would agree are aspects of intelligence. First,

01:13.040 --> 01:19.280
there's the ability to solve a large variety of problems, especially new ones. This requires

01:19.360 --> 01:26.800
knowledge transfer, creativity and the ability to learn from mistakes. Second, there's the ability

01:26.800 --> 01:32.080
to think abstractly, to understand concepts and their relations and deduce new properties.

01:32.640 --> 01:38.000
This relies heavily on the use of logic and reasoning. The relation between knowledge

01:38.000 --> 01:43.760
and intelligence is especially difficult to untangle. This is well illustrated by a 1980

01:43.760 --> 01:48.880
thought experiment from the philosopher John Searle, known as the Chinese Room.

01:48.880 --> 01:54.640
Searle asks us to imagine we're in a room with a book that contains instructions for responding to

01:54.640 --> 02:01.120
Chinese text. From outside the room, people send in pieces of paper with Chinese characters,

02:01.120 --> 02:06.720
because that's totally a thing people do. We use our book to figure out how to respond to these

02:06.720 --> 02:13.120
messages and return an answer. The person outside might get away thinking there's someone in the

02:13.120 --> 02:19.040
room who understands Chinese, even though that isn't so. Searle used this thought experiment

02:19.040 --> 02:25.120
to argue that a piece of software doesn't really understand what it's doing. I explained in my

02:25.120 --> 02:30.880
earlier video why that's a bad analogy for artificial intelligence, but why the Chinese

02:30.880 --> 02:36.720
Room doesn't tell us much about understanding, it illustrates nicely the difference between

02:36.720 --> 02:43.040
knowledge and intelligence. In the Chinese Room, we and our instruction book undoubtedly have

02:43.040 --> 02:49.680
knowledge, but we're not intelligent. We can't solve any new problems, we can't transfer knowledge,

02:49.680 --> 02:56.080
we have no capacity for abstract thought or logical reasoning, we're just following instructions.

02:56.080 --> 03:02.400
But as long as the person outside is just asking for knowledge, they won't be able to tell whether

03:02.400 --> 03:07.920
we're intelligent. Okay, so we have a vague intuitive idea for what it means to be intelligent,

03:07.920 --> 03:13.200
but can we make this more precise? If you can't measure it, does it even exist?

03:13.200 --> 03:18.320
Trying to measure intelligence is not a new idea. The first attempt has been attributed to Sir

03:18.320 --> 03:24.720
Francis Galton, a British polymath and cousin of Charles Darwin. But Galton's work on intelligence

03:24.720 --> 03:31.120
focused on sensory and perceptual tasks. He developed tests for skills such as reaction

03:31.120 --> 03:37.920
time and visual acuity. A good start, I guess, but it conflates cognitive with physical abilities.

03:37.920 --> 03:44.320
The next step was taken by Charles Spearman at the beginning of the 20th century. He introduced the

03:44.320 --> 03:50.560
g-factor, a measure for what he called general intelligence as opposed to specific factors

03:50.560 --> 03:56.080
that might be a talent in a particular domain. Spearman wasn't trying to say you're done if

03:56.080 --> 04:01.840
you don't know everything. It was rather that he thought everyone is a genius in some area,

04:01.840 --> 04:06.240
but it takes suitable tests to figure out just what that area is.

04:06.800 --> 04:12.560
Briefly after that, but unrelated to Spearman's work, psychologist Alfa Benet and ThÃ©odore

04:12.560 --> 04:18.400
Seymour took on the task of developing a test to quantify intellectual ability in children.

04:18.400 --> 04:23.920
It was an assignment by the French government with the aim of identifying children who needed

04:23.920 --> 04:30.480
special support. The Benet-Seymour test came out first in 1905. It includes questions of

04:30.480 --> 04:35.840
comprehension, for example about the content of short stories, the meaning of words,

04:35.840 --> 04:42.000
counting backwards, memorizing images and stuff like that. Similar tests are still used in some

04:42.000 --> 04:48.400
places to assess whether children are old enough to start primary school. In a story that my mum

04:48.400 --> 04:54.480
never tires of telling, I failed my primary school assessment because I refused to hop on one leg.

04:55.040 --> 04:59.600
So please forgive me if I'm somewhat cynical about assessment tests.

04:59.600 --> 05:06.400
The idea of the intelligence quotient IQ for short goes back to these early ideas from Spearman,

05:06.400 --> 05:12.400
Benet and Seymour. If you want to take an IQ test today, you could try to assemble a piece

05:12.400 --> 05:18.240
of furniture from a certain Swedish retailer. But the standard way to do it is to see a psychologist

05:18.240 --> 05:23.680
and have them walk you through a certified test. There are several institutions who regularly

05:23.680 --> 05:28.800
update these tests and who sell the most recent version to licensed practitioners.

05:29.360 --> 05:35.360
These tests are not meant to be taken on your own, though you find some similar versions online.

05:35.360 --> 05:41.120
The most commonly used IQ test might be the Wexler Intelligence Scale that comes in a version

05:41.120 --> 05:47.440
for children and one for adults. It measures intellectual ability with several subtests that

05:47.440 --> 05:54.240
assess verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, mathematical ability and processing

05:54.240 --> 06:00.080
speed. One big disadvantage of this test is, however, that verbal comprehension strongly

06:00.080 --> 06:05.920
depends on what language you've grown up with and what education you've gone through. In most

06:05.920 --> 06:12.080
cases, it's a good proxy for general intelligence, but some people fall through the cracks because of

06:12.080 --> 06:17.920
their social and cultural background. A popular alternative is therefore Raven's Progressive

06:17.920 --> 06:24.320
Matrices, a non-verbal test for abstract reasoning skills that works by completing patterns.

06:24.320 --> 06:29.280
There's also the Cato Cultural Fair Test, which also relies on abstract patterns

06:29.280 --> 06:35.280
and that was specifically designed to minimize cultural bias. The scores for these tests are

06:35.280 --> 06:40.800
calculated by recruiting a sample group, setting their average score to 100 points

06:40.880 --> 06:48.000
and one standard deviation to 15 points. That means that about 68% of people will score between

06:48.000 --> 06:56.880
85 and 115 points. One tricky point is that since the IQ is defined relative to that sample group,

06:56.880 --> 07:02.880
the average IQ of the entire population that the sample is supposedly representative for

07:02.880 --> 07:09.440
will generically not be exactly 100. Generally, the IQ of any group will depend on the comparative

07:09.440 --> 07:15.360
sample. This is why in an international comparison, the average IQ of people in different countries

07:15.360 --> 07:22.960
can noticeably diverge from 100. It's because the score 100 was based on a global average sample,

07:22.960 --> 07:29.600
so nations can come out higher or lower. In a recent global comparison, the highest scoring

07:29.600 --> 07:37.600
country was Japan with an average IQ of 106, closely followed by Taiwan. Germany came in 10th

07:37.600 --> 07:46.000
with almost exactly 100 on average. The UK came in 20th with 99 and the United States 28th with 99.5.

07:46.640 --> 07:51.600
At the bottom of the list, you find countries where malnutrition is rampant and illiteracy is

07:51.600 --> 07:58.160
common, such as Nicaragua and Nepal. This brings up the question just what these IQ tests measure.

07:58.720 --> 08:03.680
Studies have shown that the IQ changes with education, health, environment and age.

08:03.680 --> 08:09.040
We also know that it has a strong heritable component, but it can fluctuate wildly.

08:09.040 --> 08:13.840
According to a study by researchers from University College London in 2011, IQ and

08:13.840 --> 08:20.000
teenagers changed by as much as 21 points over four years, and that was only on the days when

08:20.000 --> 08:25.280
the teenagers could find their brain to begin with. There's also some evidence that cognitive

08:25.280 --> 08:32.240
training can improve parts of the performance on IQ tests, such as working memory and verbal abilities.

08:32.880 --> 08:39.120
So in the end, what does the IQ test tell us? As the psychologist Edwin Boring put it already

08:39.120 --> 08:45.440
in 1923, intelligence is what the tests test. Basically, the psychologist's version of

08:45.440 --> 08:50.400
shut up and calculate. And this is fine if what you want is just a number to find out what it's

08:50.400 --> 08:56.000
correlated with. But in the end, we don't just want a number. We want to know what someone or

08:56.000 --> 09:02.400
something can do with this supposed intelligence. We want to know what we can expect from them.

09:02.400 --> 09:08.800
We want to know how far we can trust them not to be stupid. And while measuring things is all

09:08.800 --> 09:15.360
well and fine, the idea that intelligence can be reduced to a single number is itself problematic.

09:15.920 --> 09:21.120
Of course, we're not the first to point that out, which is why some smart people have thought of

09:21.120 --> 09:27.520
more intelligent ways of measuring intelligence. One popular alternative to the IQ is the theory

09:27.520 --> 09:34.480
of multiple intelligences proposed in 1983 by the developmental psychologist Howard Gardner.

09:34.480 --> 09:40.480
According to Gardner, the IQ is too narrow a measure for intelligence. Gardner argued that

09:40.480 --> 09:46.480
intelligence is not just a singular entity, but rather a collection of eight different ones.

09:46.480 --> 09:53.680
That's linguistic, logical, mathematical, musical, spatial, bodily kinesthetic, interpersonal,

09:53.680 --> 10:00.000
interpersonal, and naturalistic intelligence. While Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences

10:00.000 --> 10:05.280
offers an appealingly inclusive view of intelligence, it's been criticized for being

10:05.280 --> 10:10.400
subjective, lacking empirical evidence, and being in practice too difficult to use.

10:10.960 --> 10:15.920
You see, it's a nice idea in principle to say there's no easy way to measure intelligence,

10:15.920 --> 10:23.040
but in reality, it's rather useless. If you feel that eight types of intelligence are a little excessive,

10:23.040 --> 10:29.440
maybe Robert Sternberg's triarchic theory of intelligence is more to your liking. In his 1985

10:29.440 --> 10:35.680
book Beyond IQ, Sternberg proposed that intelligence is not solely based on cognitive abilities,

10:35.680 --> 10:41.440
but also on practical intelligence and creative intelligence. By practical intelligence, he means

10:41.440 --> 10:47.120
the ability to adapt to real-life situations, and creative intelligence is the capacity to

10:47.120 --> 10:53.600
generate novel and valuable ideas. But Sternberg's triarchic theory has the same basic problem as

10:53.600 --> 10:59.200
Gardner's eight levels. The definition is vague and in practice, it's difficult to assess,

10:59.200 --> 11:03.920
so it's never been widely used. Okay, now that we have some idea of what we mean by

11:03.920 --> 11:09.280
intelligence in humans, let's talk about intelligent software. Computer scientists

11:09.280 --> 11:15.600
distinguish three different types of artificial intelligence. First, there's narrow AI, also

11:15.600 --> 11:22.400
known as weak AI. It's designed to perform specific tasks with high proficiency. This includes AI

11:22.400 --> 11:28.800
systems that can recognize speech, play games, or identify objects and images. Every AI you've

11:28.800 --> 11:35.520
met so far was a narrow AI. Second, there's the idea of general artificial intelligence,

11:35.520 --> 11:42.160
also referred to as strong AI. It's supposed to have an intelligence comparable to that of humans,

11:42.160 --> 11:48.400
useful across a wide range of tasks and domains, except understanding English spelling, which is

11:48.400 --> 11:54.640
something humans weren't meant to understand. Finally, there could be super-intelligent AI,

11:54.640 --> 12:00.800
which is one that surpasses human intelligence in most, if not all, tasks. This brings up the

12:00.800 --> 12:06.400
interesting question whether we'd notice if a super-intelligent AI pretends to be dumb

12:06.400 --> 12:12.880
so as to not scare us into shutting it down. So how could we find out whether an AI is intelligent?

12:13.440 --> 12:19.280
Well, the most obvious thing you can do is give it an IQ test. There are a few problems with this,

12:19.280 --> 12:26.400
though. The first problem is that the current IQ test for humans tests things such as working speed

12:26.400 --> 12:31.840
and memory, and even a dumb computer will easily outperform humans on these measures,

12:32.400 --> 12:37.520
which makes me wonder whether these tasks should ever have been part of an intelligence test.

12:38.080 --> 12:43.600
They arguably matter for cognitive function and are therefore correlated with intelligence,

12:44.240 --> 12:49.440
but are a good memory and processing speed really a sign of intelligence on their own?

12:50.080 --> 12:56.080
The second problem is that IQ tests for humans use different types of verbal and visual

12:56.080 --> 13:02.400
input, and at the moment, fewer AIs are good at all of these tasks. But leaving aside memory and

13:02.400 --> 13:09.760
speed tests and focusing only on the tasks chat GPT can do, Ika Rovainen, an assessment psychologist

13:09.760 --> 13:16.320
in Finland, gave everybody's favorite AI the verbal part of the previously mentioned vexler test.

13:17.040 --> 13:23.680
This includes questions about the meaning of words or the similarity between words or phrases.

13:23.680 --> 13:29.840
It also includes questions of general knowledge, like who elects the president or what's the capital

13:29.840 --> 13:38.240
of Iceland. Chat GPT scored 155. But as we've all learned in the past couple of months, chat GPT's

13:38.240 --> 13:44.480
knowledge is extremely narrow, even when it comes to verbal intelligence. A sunny example is that

13:44.480 --> 13:50.480
while it's been trained on text, it doesn't understand the idea of letters. If you ask

13:50.480 --> 13:56.480
it to write a paragraph on a particular topic, say animals, that doesn't contain say the letter

13:56.480 --> 14:02.960
in, it has no idea what to do, but doesn't know that it doesn't know what to do. It also can't

14:02.960 --> 14:08.560
count the number of letters in a sentence, though it'll still answer the question if you ask it to.

14:09.200 --> 14:15.600
This tells us three things. First, the issue isn't that an AI doesn't know some things,

14:15.600 --> 14:21.200
but rather that it doesn't know what it doesn't know. Second, in practice, we often measure

14:21.200 --> 14:27.120
dumbness rather than intelligence. We look for negatives. We want to know where someone or

14:27.120 --> 14:33.680
something fails and use that to assess its intelligence. Third, we use our own intelligence

14:33.680 --> 14:40.160
to search for these failures, which is an approach that will inevitably eventually fail.

14:40.160 --> 14:46.880
The Turing test is based on this idea that we can use our own intelligence to judge that of an AI.

14:46.880 --> 14:51.440
The Turing test is named after the British mathematician and computer scientist Ellen

14:51.440 --> 14:58.240
Turing, who proposed it in 1950. It relies on an operator asking questions to an artificial

14:58.240 --> 15:04.720
intelligence and a human to try to figure out which is which. If the human evaluator can't

15:04.720 --> 15:09.600
distinguish the machine's response from the human's, the machine passes the test.

15:10.240 --> 15:16.160
There have been a few claims in the past 10 years or so that a chatbot has passed the Turing test,

15:16.160 --> 15:21.200
but they didn't have the best scientific standards. I suspect that someone's going

15:21.200 --> 15:27.520
to stage a Turing test later this year just to make a point and will see AI pass it.

15:27.520 --> 15:32.000
However, the Turing test doesn't so much prove that the machine is intelligent,

15:32.000 --> 15:36.640
but rather that it has the ability to pretend to be intelligent.

15:36.640 --> 15:41.680
Another problem with the Turing test is that, well, it depends on how smart the person is

15:41.680 --> 15:47.520
who asks the questions. To take at least this issue out of the picture, Terry Winograd,

15:47.520 --> 15:52.560
a professor of computer science at Stanford University, came up with the Winograd Schema

15:52.560 --> 15:58.480
Challenge for AI. The challenge involves a series of questions that are designed to be

15:58.480 --> 16:05.120
easy for humans to answer but hard for computers. Each question is based on a sentence that

16:05.120 --> 16:10.400
contains an ambiguity, and the correct interpretation of the sentence requires

16:10.400 --> 16:14.720
common sense reasoning about the context. Here is an example.

16:14.720 --> 16:20.640
The city councilman refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.

16:20.640 --> 16:27.040
The challenge is to determine who they refers to in this sentence, the city councilman or the

16:27.040 --> 16:34.000
demonstrators. Or maybe I should say that's what the challenge was because several AIs have

16:34.000 --> 16:41.520
passed the test already in 2019 with more than 90% accuracy. But this test only looks for verbal

16:41.520 --> 16:48.560
ability. You can also test AIs based on the IQ tests used for human intelligence that we discussed

16:48.560 --> 16:54.320
earlier. For example, Raven's progressive matrices have been proposed for testing the

16:54.320 --> 17:01.200
visual abilities of AIs. In 2020, two German scientists developed an AI that was able to

17:01.200 --> 17:08.560
generate a fitting image from scratch. It solved an AI-adapted variant of the test with 98% accuracy.

17:09.120 --> 17:15.440
More recently, in March 2023, another group developed an AI that scored 87% accuracy on

17:15.440 --> 17:21.040
the regular test. There are further tests that are specifically designed for AIs,

17:21.040 --> 17:26.800
such as variants of the Bongad problems. This is a software-generated data set of abstract

17:26.800 --> 17:33.280
sketches, some of which match a pattern and some that don't. The AI must decide if new

17:33.280 --> 17:41.040
sketches match the pattern. In a 2020 study, researchers found that AIs reach 60-70% accuracy,

17:41.040 --> 17:47.840
whereas humans tend to reach more than 90%. So this one's still somewhat of a challenge for AIs.

17:47.840 --> 17:54.640
Good news for our egos, I guess. In summary, researchers are using a number of ways to measure

17:54.640 --> 18:00.960
how intelligent artificial intelligence is and how it progresses. AIs have always been ahead of

18:00.960 --> 18:07.360
humans in terms of memory and processing speed and have recently rapidly caught up on verbal

18:07.360 --> 18:14.560
and visual tasks. While there's still nowhere near humans in terms of general reasoning skills,

18:14.560 --> 18:20.880
I think it's only a matter of time until they get there. And I agree with Paul Graham, we should

18:20.880 --> 18:26.960
worry less about consciousness and more about intelligence, because of the two, intelligence

18:26.960 --> 18:33.440
is much more dangerous. How will we know when an AI becomes intelligent? Probably because it'll

18:33.440 --> 18:39.360
start arguing with us about what we mean by intelligence. If you want to boost your intelligence,

18:39.360 --> 18:45.040
just sitting there and watching a video isn't going to help much. But if you want to exercise

18:45.040 --> 18:50.400
your brain in general or learn more about artificial intelligence in particular, I know

18:50.400 --> 18:56.480
just the place for you. Brilliant.org. Brilliant offers courses on a large variety of topics in

18:56.480 --> 19:02.320
science and mathematics with interactive visualizations and follow-up questions. To learn

19:02.320 --> 19:07.600
more about artificial intelligence, have a look, for example, at their course on computer science

19:07.600 --> 19:13.520
fundamentals, their introduction to neural networks, and their course on artificial neural

19:13.520 --> 19:20.000
networks. I found Brilliant to be a highly effective way to understand and also to remember

19:20.000 --> 19:26.480
material. And they're adding new content each month. I like looking things up on Brilliant,

19:26.480 --> 19:31.920
and I now even have my own course there. It's an introduction to quantum mechanics that covers

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
topics such as interference, superpositions and entanglement, the uncertainty principle,

19:38.000 --> 19:44.240
and Bell's theorem. It's a beginner's course that you can take without prior knowledge.

19:44.240 --> 19:49.600
And afterwards, maybe you want to continue learning more about quantum computing or

19:49.600 --> 19:55.680
special relativity or wherever your interest takes you. If you want to try Brilliant out,

19:55.680 --> 20:02.000
