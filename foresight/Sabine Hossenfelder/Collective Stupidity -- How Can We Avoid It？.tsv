0	5280	You and I together are more than the sum of the parts, it's not just that I know some
5280	10320	things you don't know and you know some things I don't know, like how to prevent hair from
10320	16400	looking like sauerkraut. No, there's more to it. Maybe, hopefully, every once in a while,
16400	22720	I point one of you into a new direction and you see something I couldn't see. Together,
22720	28560	we're more intelligent than either of us alone. But collective intelligence has a flip side,
28640	34240	collective stupidity. Sometimes, we're more stupid together than we are on our own.
34960	41600	But what makes some groups of people intelligent and others stupid? That's what we'll talk about today.
45920	49920	Everything around you is made of just a few types of elementary particles.
49920	55200	Fundamentally, there's little difference between you and a cheesecracker. Both are made from up
55200	61200	and down quarks with electrons held together by gluons and photons. If you combine many of those
61200	67440	particles, you get increasingly complex systems. First, you get atoms, then molecules, and those
67440	74000	molecules can combine to living beings, which can combine to societies. Each time you combine
74000	80400	many constituents with their interactions, you can get completely new behavior. We call this behavior
80400	86240	emergent. The difference between you and a cheesecracker isn't on the fundamental level.
86240	92640	It's on the emergent level. You talk. A cheesecracker doesn't, or if it does,
92640	99360	maybe cut back on those THC gummies. A simple example of emergent behavior is a wave. If you
99360	106320	combine a lot of water molecules, you get waves. But waves don't exist for single molecules.
106320	111920	This makes no sense. Waves only exist on the collective level. This is what it means for
111920	117600	something to be emergent. It's a property that doesn't make sense on the fundamental level.
117600	123680	It's not only particles that have emergent behavior. Living beings have, too. People can do
123680	130480	a la-ola wave. Sheep flow like fluids through gates, and starlings do mesmerizing murmurations.
131120	137040	And it's not only motion that living beings coordinate. They also coordinate the exchange
137040	143120	of information. Fungi, for example, coordinate their growth to optimize the transport of
143120	149840	nutrients. According to a study that was just published last year, they do this by using directional
149840	156080	memory and collision-induced branching. This emergent behavior can even be exploited to get
156080	163360	fungi to produce microscopic devices. For example, slime mold has been coaxed into growing a network
163360	169680	that can transport dyes. In another experiment, the mold networks were connected to create
169680	176160	logical circuits. While these are remarkable examples of collective behavior, scientists
176160	182080	don't think that fungi are actually collectively intelligent, though I think that's exactly what
182080	187280	the fungi want us to think. The animals that are probably best known for their collective
187280	193760	intelligence are bees. They use motion, often called the bee dance, to share information about
193760	199600	food sources, and they build hives together with a sophisticated division of labor to raise their
199600	206400	young. We call them collectively intelligent not just because they are able to share information,
206400	212880	but because they base decisions on their shared information they learn from each other.
212880	218720	Ants show a similar intelligence in colonies. They communicate with each other by pheromones to
218720	225600	signal where food can be found, and together they can defeat enemies much larger than themselves.
225600	231760	But ants also show us the problems with collective intelligence. Ants try to follow each other's
231840	237760	trails, and if some of them accidentally draw such a trail into a circle, they'll walk in
237760	244960	circles until they die. This death spiral isn't collective intelligence, it's collective stupidity.
244960	250480	It's what happens when a usually beneficial behavior goes badly wrong, and the same thing
250480	256560	can happen for humans. Two heads are better than one, the saying goes, and sometimes it's true.
256560	261840	Contestants of the quiz show, who wants to be a millionaire, can ask the audience to answer a
261840	268240	limited number of questions for them. The audience then collectively votes on what they believe the
268240	274000	correct answer to be. It doesn't always work, but statistically the audience gets it right
274000	280800	91% of the time. But the wisdom of the crowds wasn't born with quiz shows. The idea is much
280800	287120	older. It dates back to 1907 when Francis Galton went to a livestock exhibition in Plymouth
287120	293040	and asked a group of about 800 people to guess the weight of an ox that was on display. He
293040	301040	collected the results and calculated the average value of all estimates. The result was 1,207 pounds,
301040	307760	almost exactly the right weight of 1,198 pounds. He published the results of this cutting-edge
308000	313280	search in Nature. Those were the days, people. Broadly speaking, the reason large groups are
313280	318800	better than individuals in answering simple questions is that some people in the group
318800	325600	are knowledgeable about the topic, and the rest make errors that average out. This tells you
325600	330720	that asking the audience isn't going to make you a millionaire if there are very few people who
330720	336640	know the answer. But if you ever need to know the weight of an ox, then asking people at a 19th
336640	342880	century farmer's market is a pretty good idea. There are more modern applications of this idea too.
342880	349680	Average guesses of crowds are valuable information. It's why companies use crowdsourcing to collect
349680	356000	feedback from some customers to make recommendations for others. It's why they solicit reviews to
356000	362480	judge the quality of products and services. It's why YouTube wants to know how long you
362480	369360	watch a video and whether you can be bothered to click like. This information is worth real money.
369360	375040	Better still, people provide it for free. Another example of collective intelligence that you're
375040	380800	all familiar with is Wikipedia. Yes, it has its problems, which is why I've given up
380800	386960	correcting entries on quantum mechanics, but it's good enough to be useful just by collecting
386960	393840	information. Indeed, Wikipedia usefully has an entry about the reliability of Wikipedia
393840	399440	that collects studies on the subject. Results depend on topic, but by and large they found
399440	406400	that Wikipedia tends to be as accurate as other encyclopedias, though it's frequently incomplete
406400	412320	of completely omitting relevant information. A particularly impressive use of collective
412320	418880	human intelligence are stock markets. Yes, they have a bad reputation, but that's because most
418880	424880	of us only take note of the stock market when something goes wrong. Most of the time, however,
424880	431440	the stock exchange guides investment to all our advantage. It works because the incentives of
431440	438240	individual traders are aligned with the optimal distribution of resources, at least in theory.
438240	445360	But this only works so long as we have appropriate regulations that govern trade. Like if you signed
445360	451360	it, you're bound to it. If you agree to pay $44 billion for a social media platform and put your
451360	456960	name on the paper, then you can't just change your mind the next day. You're also not allowed to
456960	463120	trade insider information. Monopolies must be broken up, and there's a lot of other regulations on
463120	469840	trade, because without them, the stock market wouldn't produce results that we want. It'd still
469840	476560	collect information from individuals, but the outcome would no longer be what we desire, and that
476560	482880	brings us to the problem. The problem is groups are only collectively intelligent when the mechanism
482880	489200	to collect their information is carefully set up. If you crowdsource information from a group
489200	494880	and want errors to average out, then the members of the group must put forward their private
494880	500800	information independently of the others. This means most importantly, you shouldn't know what
500800	507680	other people have said before you put forward your own guess. This is why they only show you poll
507680	515360	results after you've voted yourself, and they ask the audience is set up that way too. But if that's
515440	521280	not the case, if people know what others have said before making up their own mind, then the
521280	528560	information can become systematically biased. This can lead to all kinds of trouble. The famous
528560	534800	Ash experiment from the 1950s illustrates this. In this experiment, participants were assigned
534800	540960	to groups with confederates of the experimenter and were asked to match the length of line zone
540960	548160	cards with a comparison line. The confederates consistently gave obviously incorrect answers,
548160	553760	but many participants agreed with them, even though their own perceptions told them that
553760	560560	the answers were wrong. Now that the participants agreed with the wrong answers doesn't necessarily
560560	565760	mean they believed them. If I was in a room with a group of people who insisted that the
565760	571120	longer line is actually the shorter one, I'd also agree with them. I'd also keep my back
571120	577760	to the wall and inch towards the exit. This is why, even though the Ash experiment has been
577760	584160	reproduced in many different variants, just how to interpret it has remained somewhat controversial.
584800	590720	People might have many reasons to agree with others, even if they don't believe them. But
590800	597360	while the interpretation for why people act this way has remained unclear, there's little doubt
597360	604080	that they do. And this is how information cascades work. An information cascade happens when
604080	610080	individuals ignore the information that they privately hold and instead pass on the information
610080	616960	they obtain from others for whatever reasons. Like all collective behaviors, this one isn't
616960	623840	necessarily bad. In fact, it's usually beneficial. You've all seen information cascades on social
623840	630080	media. In the early days of the Covid pandemic, information was sparse and we passed on what
630080	635920	little we heard about symptoms and prevention. That's an example for how information cascades
635920	642400	can be useful. But misinformation can spread the same way. This is, for example, how panic
642400	649040	buying comes about. No one actually thinks they need 100 rolls of toilet paper. But if everyone
649040	655760	else thinks they need it, maybe these people know something I don't know. Better safe than sorry.
655760	662000	For crowd judgment to become systematically skewed, it isn't necessary that people completely
662000	667760	ignore their information. It's sufficient already if they're influenced. And this happens
667760	673120	everywhere around us. Multiple studies have found that information cascades happen for
673120	681040	software adoption, online reading, product ratings and other everyday instances. Since I know you
681040	686480	don't come here for the fluff, sociologists distinguish such information cascades from
686480	693360	hurt behavior. Hurt behavior just means that individuals behave the same way, but not necessarily
693360	700000	that in doing so they ignore their own information. In reality, we often see a mix of information
700000	706320	cascades and hurt behavior. A particularly influential example of hurt behavior comes from
706320	712880	an experiment by Milgram in the 1960s. Yes, that's the same Milgram who did the much discussed
712880	719120	prisoner experiments. But this one was a little more innocent. He recruited a few people to stand
719200	725840	in the street corner and point at nothing in the sky. Sure enough, other people came to join them
725840	732320	to look at nothing. YouTube is basically built on this idea. If you come across a video that's
732320	738560	been watched by a million people, you're more likely to watch it than if it had only 10 views.
738560	744160	And most of the time, that's probably a good decision. But it also means that social media
744160	750240	has a strong rich get richer trend, where you eventually end up with some people who are popular
750240	755920	for being popular. They're interesting just because others think they're interesting.
755920	761680	Many financial crashes are due to information cascades, and that's certainly nothing new.
761680	768000	In the 18th century, the Scottish businessman John Law founded the Mississippi Company,
768000	773200	whose purpose it was to develop the French territory near the Mississippi River.
773200	780000	His stocks sold like warm bagels all over Europe, and Law was granted a monopoly on the trade.
780800	787120	This was already a bad idea, but things got worse when the French government began printing
787120	794000	more money so that everyone could buy more Mississippi stocks. Inevitably, eventually,
794000	799600	investors realized there was no way the supposed wealth was ever to become real.
799600	803840	They tried to get their money out of the bank, and the bubble collapsed,
803840	808640	leaving many people bankrupt, economic growth seriously damaged,
808640	815120	and trust in the financial system in shambles. The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s worked
815120	820960	like that too. Everyone and their dog were investing into internet startups, even though
820960	826720	no one really knew how those were supposed to eventually make money. The value of these
826720	832880	stocks became incredibly overinflated, when those startups eventually went live,
832880	838720	but created little to no revenue, the bubble burst. A more recent example of an information
838720	845440	cascade was the 2008 financial crash. Banks were handing out mortgages to borrowers who couldn't
845440	851680	reasonably be expected to pay them back. The banks then collected the mortgages and other loans
851680	858720	into packages called securities that were sold to investors. When interest rates went up,
858720	864960	it became clear that these mortgages and loans wouldn't be paid back. The value of the securities
864960	872080	dropped rather suddenly and caused a big wave of bankruptcies. The 2008 financial crisis is
872080	878640	particularly tragic in that it was preventable. Many people working in those banks knew that
878640	884720	handing out those loans was a really bad idea that would eventually go wrong. But if they hadn't
884720	891520	played along, they'd have lost their job, so the cascade rolled on. What do we learn from all that?
891520	897840	Can we use some of this information to our own advantage? Well, yes. First of all, we learn that
897840	902960	if you want to make good use of the collected intelligence of a group, you have to try and
902960	909520	find a format in which everyone is comfortable coming forward with their information. And you
909520	917120	need a way to prevent one person from being biased by another person to the extent possible. That is,
917120	922000	of course, if coming to an intelligent decision is what you want in the first place. If you want
922000	927760	the meeting to just be over quickly, then I suggest you ask the most aggressive dude for an opinion
927840	934480	first and let him shout down anyone who dares disagree. Of course, making good use of collective
934480	942400	intelligence is easier said than done. So let me mention two things that I found useful. First,
942400	948880	we have a natural tendency to focus on the issues that come up more often. But those aren't
948880	955200	necessarily the most important ones. This is why managers like to use tables to identify
955200	961200	how important and urgent a problem is before spending time on it. I know that academics tend
961200	967040	to find those tables somewhat silly, but it's indeed a way to prevent collective stupidity.
967600	972800	The second useful thing to know is that just reminding people that their opinion might be
972800	979920	biased can help to reduce the effect. That's for small teams whose decision making you can influence.
980480	986400	But what about the large crowds that you find on social media? One thing that I mentioned already
986400	992960	in my earlier video about social media is that just stepping back and thinking about what you're
992960	1000160	doing is a way to prevent regrets. And I formulate that so carefully because for some people maybe
1000160	1005920	preventing a cascade of false information isn't what they want in the first place. But more
1005920	1012560	interestingly, you can beat the crowd by being part of a group. I know this sounds somewhat
1012560	1019680	contradictory, but let me explain. Numerous studies have found that small groups make better
1019680	1026480	decisions than individuals on objective tasks. That is, tasks for which there is an answer that
1026480	1033360	is either right or wrong, such as which way is the baggage claim left or right? Ask your family
1033360	1037840	and you're less likely to find yourself next to a broken vending machine at the far end of the
1037840	1044640	terminal. It's easy to see how this is useful on social media. Not sure whether that email is
1044640	1051520	legit or a scam? Ask a few friends. Another useful thing to know is that the biggest problem for
1051520	1058400	groups in getting things right is having members which are confident but often wrong. That's because
1058400	1064960	the confident people make up their mind first and this then causes an information cascade which
1064960	1070880	sways the less confident people. So be careful around confident people. It's not that they are
1070880	1078080	necessarily wrong, but if they are, they amplify errors. Another issue is that we tend to overrate
1078080	1085440	the relevance of our own opinion compared to that of others. It's called egocentric bias. A way to
1085440	1090400	beat this issue is to hold back on forming an opinion, but of course that doesn't work if
1090400	1096960	everyone does it. In summary, making intelligent decisions isn't easy and we're not naturally
1096960	1102720	good at it. Whether a group of people makes intelligent or dumb decisions depends strongly on
1102720	1108640	how the information is aggregated. Under certain circumstances, errors can amplify each other
1108640	1114800	rather than canceling out. As you see, it isn't easy being sharper than a cheesecracker.
1114880	1120640	Collective intelligence is all well and fine, but as they say, garbage in, garbage out. The most
1120640	1127120	important thing you can do for your intelligence is to pick your input wisely and if you like quality
1127120	1133440	input about scientific discoveries, I recommend you check out our sponsor Nautilus. Nautilus is a
1133440	1139600	literary science magazine. They care about writing and they use it to its full potential.
1139600	1145200	What I particularly like about them is that they cover all areas of science, from astronomy to
1145200	1151600	economics, history, neuroscience, philosophy and physics. They'll keep you well informed on topics
1151600	1156880	of current interest and it's always a pleasure to read. I've written several contributions for
1156880	1163040	Nautilus myself about quantum gravity and black holes and other stuff that I normally write about,
1163040	1169200	but what makes Nautilus so fun is the breadth of the topics they cover. A recent masterpiece is
1169200	1175360	for example Amanda Gefter's essay What Plants Are Saying About Us. This will really make you
1175360	1180880	question what you know about cognition. Or if you're interested in the intersection of art and
1180880	1187280	science, they have a recent essay by Elena Kazamiya, The Enemy Made Visible, about a sculpture
1187280	1193120	representing the COVID virus. The artist herself said it's by far the best she has read on the
1193120	1199760	sculpture. So there you go, science, art, philosophy and great writing all in one place.
1199760	1205040	You can join Nautilus as a digital only member or get a print subscription to receive six of
1205040	1211120	their beautifully illustrated editions. In addition to full access to all the stories in Nautilus,
1211120	1217840	members receive benefits like priority access to events, exclusive products and product discounts.
1217840	1222800	For example, they recently partnered with the Australian streetwear company Jungles
1222800	1228400	to draw attention to ocean science. The revenue goes to their Ocean Conservation Fund.
1228400	1234480	Nautilus is really much more than just a magazine. And of course we do have a special offer for you.
1234480	1240640	If you use our custom link Nautil.us slash Sabine, you'll get 15% off your membership
1240640	1245680	subscription. So go and check this out. Thanks for watching. See you next week.
