1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
artificial intelligence. It seems like lately everyone talks about it everywhere all at once.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,160
But is artificial intelligence really intelligent? What do we even mean by intelligent? And if it's

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,240
not yet intelligent, how would we find out if it were to become intelligent? That's what we'll talk

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:27,440
about today. Paul Graham, computer scientist, writer and investor, recently wrote that what

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,400
worries him about artificial intelligence is that few things are harder to predict than the

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,400
ways in which someone much smarter than you might outsmart you. Sabina Hossenfelder, theoretical

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,080
physicist, writer and involuntary comedian knows from personal experience that you don't have to

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:50,320
be smart to appear smart and that worries her much more. When it comes to AI, the question of

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,160
consciousness receives all the attention, but intelligence is much more difficult to define.

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,240
For example, few of my colleagues would doubt I'm conscious, but opinions on my intelligence

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,280
diverge. While there's no agreed upon definition for intelligence, there are two

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,040
ingredients that I believe most of us would agree are aspects of intelligence. First,

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,280
there's the ability to solve a large variety of problems, especially new ones. This requires

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,800
knowledge transfer, creativity and the ability to learn from mistakes. Second, there's the ability

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,080
to think abstractly, to understand concepts and their relations and deduce new properties.

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,000
This relies heavily on the use of logic and reasoning. The relation between knowledge

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,760
and intelligence is especially difficult to untangle. This is well illustrated by a 1980

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,880
thought experiment from the philosopher John Searle, known as the Chinese Room.

19
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,640
Searle asks us to imagine we're in a room with a book that contains instructions for responding to

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,120
Chinese text. From outside the room, people send in pieces of paper with Chinese characters,

21
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,720
because that's totally a thing people do. We use our book to figure out how to respond to these

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:13,120
messages and return an answer. The person outside might get away thinking there's someone in the

23
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,040
room who understands Chinese, even though that isn't so. Searle used this thought experiment

24
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,120
to argue that a piece of software doesn't really understand what it's doing. I explained in my

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,880
earlier video why that's a bad analogy for artificial intelligence, but why the Chinese

26
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,720
Room doesn't tell us much about understanding, it illustrates nicely the difference between

27
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,040
knowledge and intelligence. In the Chinese Room, we and our instruction book undoubtedly have

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,680
knowledge, but we're not intelligent. We can't solve any new problems, we can't transfer knowledge,

29
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,080
we have no capacity for abstract thought or logical reasoning, we're just following instructions.

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,400
But as long as the person outside is just asking for knowledge, they won't be able to tell whether

31
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,920
we're intelligent. Okay, so we have a vague intuitive idea for what it means to be intelligent,

32
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,200
but can we make this more precise? If you can't measure it, does it even exist?

33
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,320
Trying to measure intelligence is not a new idea. The first attempt has been attributed to Sir

34
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,720
Francis Galton, a British polymath and cousin of Charles Darwin. But Galton's work on intelligence

35
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,120
focused on sensory and perceptual tasks. He developed tests for skills such as reaction

36
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,920
time and visual acuity. A good start, I guess, but it conflates cognitive with physical abilities.

37
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,320
The next step was taken by Charles Spearman at the beginning of the 20th century. He introduced the

38
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:50,560
g-factor, a measure for what he called general intelligence as opposed to specific factors

39
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,080
that might be a talent in a particular domain. Spearman wasn't trying to say you're done if

40
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,840
you don't know everything. It was rather that he thought everyone is a genius in some area,

41
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,240
but it takes suitable tests to figure out just what that area is.

42
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,560
Briefly after that, but unrelated to Spearman's work, psychologist Alfa Benet and ThÃ©odore

43
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,400
Seymour took on the task of developing a test to quantify intellectual ability in children.

44
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,920
It was an assignment by the French government with the aim of identifying children who needed

45
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,480
special support. The Benet-Seymour test came out first in 1905. It includes questions of

46
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,840
comprehension, for example about the content of short stories, the meaning of words,

47
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,000
counting backwards, memorizing images and stuff like that. Similar tests are still used in some

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,400
places to assess whether children are old enough to start primary school. In a story that my mum

49
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,480
never tires of telling, I failed my primary school assessment because I refused to hop on one leg.

50
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,600
So please forgive me if I'm somewhat cynical about assessment tests.

51
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,400
The idea of the intelligence quotient IQ for short goes back to these early ideas from Spearman,

52
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Benet and Seymour. If you want to take an IQ test today, you could try to assemble a piece

53
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,240
of furniture from a certain Swedish retailer. But the standard way to do it is to see a psychologist

54
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,680
and have them walk you through a certified test. There are several institutions who regularly

55
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,800
update these tests and who sell the most recent version to licensed practitioners.

56
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,360
These tests are not meant to be taken on your own, though you find some similar versions online.

57
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,120
The most commonly used IQ test might be the Wexler Intelligence Scale that comes in a version

58
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,440
for children and one for adults. It measures intellectual ability with several subtests that

59
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,240
assess verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, mathematical ability and processing

60
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,080
speed. One big disadvantage of this test is, however, that verbal comprehension strongly

61
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,920
depends on what language you've grown up with and what education you've gone through. In most

62
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:12,080
cases, it's a good proxy for general intelligence, but some people fall through the cracks because of

63
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,920
their social and cultural background. A popular alternative is therefore Raven's Progressive

64
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:24,320
Matrices, a non-verbal test for abstract reasoning skills that works by completing patterns.

65
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,280
There's also the Cato Cultural Fair Test, which also relies on abstract patterns

66
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,280
and that was specifically designed to minimize cultural bias. The scores for these tests are

67
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,800
calculated by recruiting a sample group, setting their average score to 100 points

68
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,000
and one standard deviation to 15 points. That means that about 68% of people will score between

69
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,880
85 and 115 points. One tricky point is that since the IQ is defined relative to that sample group,

70
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,880
the average IQ of the entire population that the sample is supposedly representative for

71
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,440
will generically not be exactly 100. Generally, the IQ of any group will depend on the comparative

72
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,360
sample. This is why in an international comparison, the average IQ of people in different countries

73
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,960
can noticeably diverge from 100. It's because the score 100 was based on a global average sample,

74
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,600
so nations can come out higher or lower. In a recent global comparison, the highest scoring

75
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:37,600
country was Japan with an average IQ of 106, closely followed by Taiwan. Germany came in 10th

76
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:46,000
with almost exactly 100 on average. The UK came in 20th with 99 and the United States 28th with 99.5.

77
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,600
At the bottom of the list, you find countries where malnutrition is rampant and illiteracy is

78
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:58,160
common, such as Nicaragua and Nepal. This brings up the question just what these IQ tests measure.

79
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,680
Studies have shown that the IQ changes with education, health, environment and age.

80
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,040
We also know that it has a strong heritable component, but it can fluctuate wildly.

81
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,840
According to a study by researchers from University College London in 2011, IQ and

82
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,000
teenagers changed by as much as 21 points over four years, and that was only on the days when

83
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,280
the teenagers could find their brain to begin with. There's also some evidence that cognitive

84
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,240
training can improve parts of the performance on IQ tests, such as working memory and verbal abilities.

85
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,120
So in the end, what does the IQ test tell us? As the psychologist Edwin Boring put it already

86
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,440
in 1923, intelligence is what the tests test. Basically, the psychologist's version of

87
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,400
shut up and calculate. And this is fine if what you want is just a number to find out what it's

88
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,000
correlated with. But in the end, we don't just want a number. We want to know what someone or

89
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,400
something can do with this supposed intelligence. We want to know what we can expect from them.

90
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,800
We want to know how far we can trust them not to be stupid. And while measuring things is all

91
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,360
well and fine, the idea that intelligence can be reduced to a single number is itself problematic.

92
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,120
Of course, we're not the first to point that out, which is why some smart people have thought of

93
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,520
more intelligent ways of measuring intelligence. One popular alternative to the IQ is the theory

94
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:34,480
of multiple intelligences proposed in 1983 by the developmental psychologist Howard Gardner.

95
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,480
According to Gardner, the IQ is too narrow a measure for intelligence. Gardner argued that

96
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,480
intelligence is not just a singular entity, but rather a collection of eight different ones.

97
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,680
That's linguistic, logical, mathematical, musical, spatial, bodily kinesthetic, interpersonal,

98
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,000
interpersonal, and naturalistic intelligence. While Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences

99
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,280
offers an appealingly inclusive view of intelligence, it's been criticized for being

100
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,400
subjective, lacking empirical evidence, and being in practice too difficult to use.

101
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,920
You see, it's a nice idea in principle to say there's no easy way to measure intelligence,

102
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:23,040
but in reality, it's rather useless. If you feel that eight types of intelligence are a little excessive,

103
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,440
maybe Robert Sternberg's triarchic theory of intelligence is more to your liking. In his 1985

104
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,680
book Beyond IQ, Sternberg proposed that intelligence is not solely based on cognitive abilities,

105
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,440
but also on practical intelligence and creative intelligence. By practical intelligence, he means

106
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,120
the ability to adapt to real-life situations, and creative intelligence is the capacity to

107
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,600
generate novel and valuable ideas. But Sternberg's triarchic theory has the same basic problem as

108
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,200
Gardner's eight levels. The definition is vague and in practice, it's difficult to assess,

109
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,920
so it's never been widely used. Okay, now that we have some idea of what we mean by

110
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,280
intelligence in humans, let's talk about intelligent software. Computer scientists

111
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:15,600
distinguish three different types of artificial intelligence. First, there's narrow AI, also

112
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,400
known as weak AI. It's designed to perform specific tasks with high proficiency. This includes AI

113
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:28,800
systems that can recognize speech, play games, or identify objects and images. Every AI you've

114
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,520
met so far was a narrow AI. Second, there's the idea of general artificial intelligence,

115
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:42,160
also referred to as strong AI. It's supposed to have an intelligence comparable to that of humans,

116
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,400
useful across a wide range of tasks and domains, except understanding English spelling, which is

117
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,640
something humans weren't meant to understand. Finally, there could be super-intelligent AI,

118
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,800
which is one that surpasses human intelligence in most, if not all, tasks. This brings up the

119
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,400
interesting question whether we'd notice if a super-intelligent AI pretends to be dumb

120
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:12,880
so as to not scare us into shutting it down. So how could we find out whether an AI is intelligent?

121
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,280
Well, the most obvious thing you can do is give it an IQ test. There are a few problems with this,

122
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:26,400
though. The first problem is that the current IQ test for humans tests things such as working speed

123
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,840
and memory, and even a dumb computer will easily outperform humans on these measures,

124
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,520
which makes me wonder whether these tasks should ever have been part of an intelligence test.

125
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,600
They arguably matter for cognitive function and are therefore correlated with intelligence,

126
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,440
but are a good memory and processing speed really a sign of intelligence on their own?

127
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,080
The second problem is that IQ tests for humans use different types of verbal and visual

128
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,400
input, and at the moment, fewer AIs are good at all of these tasks. But leaving aside memory and

129
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:09,760
speed tests and focusing only on the tasks chat GPT can do, Ika Rovainen, an assessment psychologist

130
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,320
in Finland, gave everybody's favorite AI the verbal part of the previously mentioned vexler test.

131
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,680
This includes questions about the meaning of words or the similarity between words or phrases.

132
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,840
It also includes questions of general knowledge, like who elects the president or what's the capital

133
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:38,240
of Iceland. Chat GPT scored 155. But as we've all learned in the past couple of months, chat GPT's

134
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,480
knowledge is extremely narrow, even when it comes to verbal intelligence. A sunny example is that

135
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,480
while it's been trained on text, it doesn't understand the idea of letters. If you ask

136
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,480
it to write a paragraph on a particular topic, say animals, that doesn't contain say the letter

137
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,960
in, it has no idea what to do, but doesn't know that it doesn't know what to do. It also can't

138
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,560
count the number of letters in a sentence, though it'll still answer the question if you ask it to.

139
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,600
This tells us three things. First, the issue isn't that an AI doesn't know some things,

140
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,200
but rather that it doesn't know what it doesn't know. Second, in practice, we often measure

141
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,120
dumbness rather than intelligence. We look for negatives. We want to know where someone or

142
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,680
something fails and use that to assess its intelligence. Third, we use our own intelligence

143
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,160
to search for these failures, which is an approach that will inevitably eventually fail.

144
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,880
The Turing test is based on this idea that we can use our own intelligence to judge that of an AI.

145
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,440
The Turing test is named after the British mathematician and computer scientist Ellen

146
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,240
Turing, who proposed it in 1950. It relies on an operator asking questions to an artificial

147
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,720
intelligence and a human to try to figure out which is which. If the human evaluator can't

148
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,600
distinguish the machine's response from the human's, the machine passes the test.

149
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,160
There have been a few claims in the past 10 years or so that a chatbot has passed the Turing test,

150
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,200
but they didn't have the best scientific standards. I suspect that someone's going

151
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:27,520
to stage a Turing test later this year just to make a point and will see AI pass it.

152
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,000
However, the Turing test doesn't so much prove that the machine is intelligent,

153
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,640
but rather that it has the ability to pretend to be intelligent.

154
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,680
Another problem with the Turing test is that, well, it depends on how smart the person is

155
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,520
who asks the questions. To take at least this issue out of the picture, Terry Winograd,

156
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,560
a professor of computer science at Stanford University, came up with the Winograd Schema

157
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,480
Challenge for AI. The challenge involves a series of questions that are designed to be

158
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:05,120
easy for humans to answer but hard for computers. Each question is based on a sentence that

159
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,400
contains an ambiguity, and the correct interpretation of the sentence requires

160
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,720
common sense reasoning about the context. Here is an example.

161
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,640
The city councilman refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.

162
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:27,040
The challenge is to determine who they refers to in this sentence, the city councilman or the

163
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:34,000
demonstrators. Or maybe I should say that's what the challenge was because several AIs have

164
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,520
passed the test already in 2019 with more than 90% accuracy. But this test only looks for verbal

165
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:48,560
ability. You can also test AIs based on the IQ tests used for human intelligence that we discussed

166
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,320
earlier. For example, Raven's progressive matrices have been proposed for testing the

167
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:01,200
visual abilities of AIs. In 2020, two German scientists developed an AI that was able to

168
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:08,560
generate a fitting image from scratch. It solved an AI-adapted variant of the test with 98% accuracy.

169
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,440
More recently, in March 2023, another group developed an AI that scored 87% accuracy on

170
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,040
the regular test. There are further tests that are specifically designed for AIs,

171
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,800
such as variants of the Bongad problems. This is a software-generated data set of abstract

172
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:33,280
sketches, some of which match a pattern and some that don't. The AI must decide if new

173
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:41,040
sketches match the pattern. In a 2020 study, researchers found that AIs reach 60-70% accuracy,

174
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,840
whereas humans tend to reach more than 90%. So this one's still somewhat of a challenge for AIs.

175
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,640
Good news for our egos, I guess. In summary, researchers are using a number of ways to measure

176
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,960
how intelligent artificial intelligence is and how it progresses. AIs have always been ahead of

177
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,360
humans in terms of memory and processing speed and have recently rapidly caught up on verbal

178
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:14,560
and visual tasks. While there's still nowhere near humans in terms of general reasoning skills,

179
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,880
I think it's only a matter of time until they get there. And I agree with Paul Graham, we should

180
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,960
worry less about consciousness and more about intelligence, because of the two, intelligence

181
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,440
is much more dangerous. How will we know when an AI becomes intelligent? Probably because it'll

182
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,360
start arguing with us about what we mean by intelligence. If you want to boost your intelligence,

183
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,040
just sitting there and watching a video isn't going to help much. But if you want to exercise

184
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,400
your brain in general or learn more about artificial intelligence in particular, I know

185
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,480
just the place for you. Brilliant.org. Brilliant offers courses on a large variety of topics in

186
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,320
science and mathematics with interactive visualizations and follow-up questions. To learn

187
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,600
more about artificial intelligence, have a look, for example, at their course on computer science

188
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,520
fundamentals, their introduction to neural networks, and their course on artificial neural

189
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,000
networks. I found Brilliant to be a highly effective way to understand and also to remember

190
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,480
material. And they're adding new content each month. I like looking things up on Brilliant,

191
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,920
and I now even have my own course there. It's an introduction to quantum mechanics that covers

192
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
topics such as interference, superpositions and entanglement, the uncertainty principle,

193
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,240
and Bell's theorem. It's a beginner's course that you can take without prior knowledge.

194
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,600
And afterwards, maybe you want to continue learning more about quantum computing or

195
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,680
special relativity or wherever your interest takes you. If you want to try Brilliant out,
