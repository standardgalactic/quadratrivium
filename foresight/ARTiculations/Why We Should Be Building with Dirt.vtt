00:00.000 --> 00:05.840
Did you know Earth, the ground we walk on and grow our crops in, is the most abundantly used

00:05.840 --> 00:11.440
building material on the planet? With over 3 billion people living, working, learning, playing,

00:11.440 --> 00:17.440
and socializing in buildings constructed from materials such as soil, clay, mud, and cob.

00:17.440 --> 00:23.440
Earth material technology has also been studied, improved upon, and refined for thousands of years.

00:23.440 --> 00:29.200
However, building with Earth is often associated with being poor, backward, and primitive.

00:29.200 --> 00:34.160
All over the world, industrialization has led to an abandonment of Earth building traditions,

00:34.160 --> 00:40.240
replaced by heavy investments into expensive and fossil-fuel-dependent materials such as

00:40.240 --> 00:45.440
steel and concrete. Earth, on the other hand, is a material with excellent thermal mass properties

00:45.440 --> 00:46.960
and low embodied energy.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.960
In West Africa, building with clay or adobe can be traced back thousands of years.

00:59.200 --> 01:04.560
The Dogon people of what is today Mali and Northwestern Burkina Faso had developed a

01:04.560 --> 01:09.120
highly sophisticated Earth building technique that is now at risk of disappearing due to the

01:09.120 --> 01:14.640
ongoing military conflicts. In Vitruvius's 10 books on architecture, a seminal architectural

01:14.640 --> 01:20.080
treatise from classical antiquity, there is an entire chapter dedicated to mud brick masonry.

01:20.080 --> 01:25.120
Vitruvius saw it as a material that exemplifies what he believed to be the primary qualities

01:25.120 --> 01:30.400
of architecture, fromitas, utilitas, and venusitas. The Egyptian architect Hassan Fathi,

01:30.400 --> 01:34.640
known for reviving and improving the techniques of traditional mud construction in Egypt,

01:34.640 --> 01:39.600
utilized the thermodynamic properties of Earth to create passively cooled structures on a large

01:39.600 --> 01:44.640
urban scale. His highly influential book, Architecture for the Poor, demonstrated how mud

01:44.640 --> 01:50.320
brick is a low-cost, sustainable, and beautiful material available to essentially everyone on

01:50.800 --> 01:55.040
Earth. The reason Earth building materials are excellent thermal masses is because they

01:55.040 --> 02:00.240
act as natural thermal batteries that absorb heat during the day and slowly release heat

02:00.240 --> 02:04.160
at night, which can maintain comfortable interior temperatures without the need for

02:04.160 --> 02:09.440
mechanical heating and cooling during all seasons. Earth assemblies generally have a high R value,

02:09.440 --> 02:14.240
which means it's a very insulating material that can lead to lower energy consumption,

02:14.240 --> 02:19.040
even when mechanical heating and cooling are used. Earth also requires very little energy to

02:19.040 --> 02:24.240
extract and manufacture, and is made of highly recyclable content. At the end of an Earth-constructed

02:24.240 --> 02:29.520
building's life, they simply melt back into the ground, which can be reused to grow vegetation

02:29.520 --> 02:35.760
or harnessed in the future for building materials again. So why has the industrial world largely

02:35.760 --> 02:40.800
rejected Earth construction? It may be due to the fact that soil composition differs from region to

02:40.800 --> 02:46.240
region, making it difficult to standardize on a large industrial scale. It is in fact illegal

02:46.240 --> 02:51.040
to build with mud brick in some regions due to building code regulations. Are these decisions

02:51.040 --> 02:56.560
made entirely for safety reasons, or were they results of lobbying by industrial material

02:56.560 --> 03:02.800
manufacturers not wanting their businesses to be threatened by such a low-cost, abundantly available

03:02.800 --> 03:07.840
and versatile material? While mud bricks are not permitted by certain building codes,

03:07.840 --> 03:13.840
the use of compressed Earth blocks, CEBs, is often welcomed. CEB was first invented by French

03:13.840 --> 03:19.680
architect François Cointreau in 1803 when he developed a mechanical press to compact Earth

03:19.680 --> 03:25.440
into dense blocks. In 1952, Colombian engineer Raúl Ramirez made a critical advancement to

03:25.440 --> 03:31.440
CEB technology by inventing a manually operated machine that is small, portable, and capable of

03:31.440 --> 03:36.880
mass production. A critical ingredient of CEB is mixing a small percentage of cement to stabilize

03:36.880 --> 03:42.080
it, resulting in higher material strength and weather resistance. CEB also requires very little

03:42.080 --> 03:47.120
moisture to produce, does not require firing or curing, can be used straight out of the machine,

03:47.120 --> 03:52.080
do not shrink or crack, has a smooth surface which can be left exposed without a finishing

03:52.080 --> 03:57.680
overcoat, and is considered aesthetically pleasing due to its natural appearance appealing to human's

03:57.680 --> 04:04.000
affinity to biophilic materials. An innovative example of CEB construction is by the architect

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
Diabato Francis Carey, who employs the use of locally available resources, traditional material

04:10.000 --> 04:16.080
techniques in concert with modern solutions, and local community participation in the design

04:16.080 --> 04:22.160
and building process. Carey is from Gando, a small remote village in Burkina Faso, which is a land

04:22.160 --> 04:27.760
locked, low-income West African nation with limited natural resources. The nation has also been

04:27.760 --> 04:34.000
experiencing frequent extreme climate events and tremendous political instability in recent years.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.600
There is little to no access to education in Gando. In 1985, Carey received a scholarship

04:39.600 --> 04:45.120
to study carpentry in Germany, and in 1995, he decided to enroll into the architecture program

04:45.120 --> 04:51.200
at Berlin's Techniche Universität. While he was studying at TU, villagers back in Gando asked him

04:51.200 --> 04:57.920
for help with repairing the village's only school built after he left, which was at risk of collapse.

04:57.920 --> 05:02.720
In 1998, he established a charity, School Building Blocks for Gando, to raise money for

05:02.720 --> 05:06.880
building a new school, and began working closely with the community on the design.

05:06.880 --> 05:11.680
The new primary school building, completed in 2001, is comprised of three detached,

05:11.680 --> 05:16.720
rectangular classrooms under a single inclined roof. The walls are built from compressed earth

05:16.720 --> 05:22.720
blocks connected by earth mortar. Giving people a good education is very important to Francis Carey.

05:22.720 --> 05:27.120
So before I tell you more about his school design, I want to tell you a bit about today's highly

05:27.120 --> 05:32.000
educational sponsor. Architects, engineers, construction and design professionals know

05:32.000 --> 05:38.080
that continuing education isn't just a requirement of maintaining professional credentials or licensing.

05:38.080 --> 05:42.800
It also helps them to stay on top of industry information and ahead of design trends to keep

05:42.800 --> 05:48.240
their skills in demand. AEC Daily offers over a thousand free accredited courses to keep you

05:48.240 --> 05:52.720
up to date and your careers moving ahead. They offer relevant training in construction risk

05:52.720 --> 05:57.680
evaluation, safety, international building codes and regulations, project management,

05:57.680 --> 06:02.160
lead and more. I have actually personally used AEC Daily for years to keep up with my

06:02.160 --> 06:07.200
continuing education credits so I can personally vouch for their fantastic library of interesting

06:07.200 --> 06:13.280
and beneficial courses. So head over to aecdaily.com for your source of free accredited courses.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.880
Link in the description below. Now back to talking about dirt.

06:16.880 --> 06:22.320
Industrial materials like concrete and steel are hard to come by in Gando and wood is minimally

06:22.320 --> 06:28.000
available due to deforestation. Thus clay is a material widely used for buildings in the region

06:28.000 --> 06:33.040
for the past several hundred years. However, it's often considered a temporary material as it tends

06:33.040 --> 06:38.640
to wash away under heavy rains. Kerry believed in the use of clay because it's free and locally

06:38.640 --> 06:44.000
available. The reddish earth color fits organically into the surroundings and it has a historical

06:44.000 --> 06:50.640
connection with the people. To improve performance, the clay compound was mixed with about 6% cement

06:50.640 --> 06:55.760
to achieve stable and uniform bricks that are more weather resistant. He also introduced the

06:55.760 --> 07:02.480
portable manually operated press making it possible to easily produce CEBs on site. To address the

07:02.480 --> 07:07.840
sweltering hot conditions where temperatures can often get as hot as 45 degrees celsius,

07:07.840 --> 07:13.360
Kerry pulled the building's roof away from the top of the classroom. This results in a stack effect

07:13.360 --> 07:18.880
that creates a continuous air circulation by drawing in cool air from the windows which rises

07:18.880 --> 07:23.360
through the porphyrated clay ceilings and vents out the perimeter gap below the roof canopy.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.320
This design feature alleviates the need for costly and energy intensive air conditioning,

07:28.320 --> 07:33.920
thus a passively cooled building with a low ecological footprint was created out of necessity.

07:33.920 --> 07:40.160
Francis Kerry's designs are able to achieve durability, usefulness and beauty through paying

07:40.160 --> 07:45.760
close attention to the simplest building block of architecture, the material. He also demonstrates

07:45.760 --> 07:51.520
why a deep connection to material culture may be the key to achieving economic independence for

07:51.520 --> 07:57.360
developing african nations as well as creating a more sustainable future for the rest of the world.

07:57.360 --> 08:03.520
So is earth this building material of the past actually the material of the future? Maybe,

08:03.520 --> 08:07.840
I personally think we should be building with mud and clay a lot more than we currently do,

08:07.840 --> 08:12.480
but it obviously isn't a solution in every scenario. I think the more important lesson we

08:12.560 --> 08:17.520
should take away from earth construction is a careful consideration of limited resources,

08:17.520 --> 08:22.000
passive building techniques, human factors and local cultures. Let me know what you guys think in

08:22.000 --> 08:26.640
the comments below. As always, thank you guys so much for watching. I recently decided to go back

08:26.640 --> 08:31.520
to school for a master's degree and this video is actually an adaptation of one of my assignments.

08:31.520 --> 08:36.560
If you enjoyed this video, feel free to check out more like it right here and I'll see you guys next time.

08:46.880 --> 08:52.560
Are these decisions made entirely for safety reasons? I don't know. I don't know the answer to that.
