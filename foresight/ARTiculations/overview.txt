Checking ARTiculations/Why We Should Be Building with Dirt.txt
 Earth, or soil-based materials, have been used for construction for millennia and are gaining renewed interest as sustainable building solutions. Despite the prevalence of industrial materials like concrete and steel, earth has several advantages: it's widely available, low in embodied energy, and when stabilized with a small amount of cement, can be weather-resistant and durable.

Historically, many cultures have utilized earth for construction, but its use has waned in modern times due to a variety of factors, including perceptions about durability and the influence of industrialization. However, as we face challenges like climate change, resource depletion, and economic disparity, there is a resurgence of interest in earth construction, particularly in regions where materials like concrete and steel are scarce or expensive.

Francis Kerry, an architect who studied in Germany and returned to his home village of Gando, Mali, exemplifies the potential of earth building. In Gando, where resources like concrete and wood are limited, Kerry used locally sourced compressed earth blocks (CEBs) to build a primary school that is both culturally relevant and sustainable. The design incorporates passive cooling techniques that reduce reliance on energy-intensive air conditioning.

Kerry's work demonstrates the importance of considering local materials, cultures, and environmental conditions in architecture. His approach not only provides economic benefits but also aligns with global sustainability goals.

The decision to favor industrial materials over earth construction is multifaceted, involving considerations of safety, tradition, economics, and environmental impact. The key takeaway is the need for a balanced approach that respects local contexts while aiming for sustainable practices.

Educational sponsor AEC Daily offers resources for architects, engineers, and construction professionals to stay informed about industry trends and sustainability through their free accredited courses.

In conclusion, earth may indeed be a building material of the past and the future, offering valuable lessons on resource management, passive design strategies, cultural relevance, and sustainable practices. The broader implications of earth construction extend beyond individual building projects to encompass global environmental and economic challenges.
