0	5840	Did you know Earth, the ground we walk on and grow our crops in, is the most abundantly used
5840	11440	building material on the planet? With over 3 billion people living, working, learning, playing,
11440	17440	and socializing in buildings constructed from materials such as soil, clay, mud, and cob.
17440	23440	Earth material technology has also been studied, improved upon, and refined for thousands of years.
23440	29200	However, building with Earth is often associated with being poor, backward, and primitive.
29200	34160	All over the world, industrialization has led to an abandonment of Earth building traditions,
34160	40240	replaced by heavy investments into expensive and fossil-fuel-dependent materials such as
40240	45440	steel and concrete. Earth, on the other hand, is a material with excellent thermal mass properties
45440	46960	and low embodied energy.
54320	58960	In West Africa, building with clay or adobe can be traced back thousands of years.
59200	64560	The Dogon people of what is today Mali and Northwestern Burkina Faso had developed a
64560	69120	highly sophisticated Earth building technique that is now at risk of disappearing due to the
69120	74640	ongoing military conflicts. In Vitruvius's 10 books on architecture, a seminal architectural
74640	80080	treatise from classical antiquity, there is an entire chapter dedicated to mud brick masonry.
80080	85120	Vitruvius saw it as a material that exemplifies what he believed to be the primary qualities
85120	90400	of architecture, fromitas, utilitas, and venusitas. The Egyptian architect Hassan Fathi,
90400	94640	known for reviving and improving the techniques of traditional mud construction in Egypt,
94640	99600	utilized the thermodynamic properties of Earth to create passively cooled structures on a large
99600	104640	urban scale. His highly influential book, Architecture for the Poor, demonstrated how mud
104640	110320	brick is a low-cost, sustainable, and beautiful material available to essentially everyone on
110800	115040	Earth. The reason Earth building materials are excellent thermal masses is because they
115040	120240	act as natural thermal batteries that absorb heat during the day and slowly release heat
120240	124160	at night, which can maintain comfortable interior temperatures without the need for
124160	129440	mechanical heating and cooling during all seasons. Earth assemblies generally have a high R value,
129440	134240	which means it's a very insulating material that can lead to lower energy consumption,
134240	139040	even when mechanical heating and cooling are used. Earth also requires very little energy to
139040	144240	extract and manufacture, and is made of highly recyclable content. At the end of an Earth-constructed
144240	149520	building's life, they simply melt back into the ground, which can be reused to grow vegetation
149520	155760	or harnessed in the future for building materials again. So why has the industrial world largely
155760	160800	rejected Earth construction? It may be due to the fact that soil composition differs from region to
160800	166240	region, making it difficult to standardize on a large industrial scale. It is in fact illegal
166240	171040	to build with mud brick in some regions due to building code regulations. Are these decisions
171040	176560	made entirely for safety reasons, or were they results of lobbying by industrial material
176560	182800	manufacturers not wanting their businesses to be threatened by such a low-cost, abundantly available
182800	187840	and versatile material? While mud bricks are not permitted by certain building codes,
187840	193840	the use of compressed Earth blocks, CEBs, is often welcomed. CEB was first invented by French
193840	199680	architect François Cointreau in 1803 when he developed a mechanical press to compact Earth
199680	205440	into dense blocks. In 1952, Colombian engineer Raúl Ramirez made a critical advancement to
205440	211440	CEB technology by inventing a manually operated machine that is small, portable, and capable of
211440	216880	mass production. A critical ingredient of CEB is mixing a small percentage of cement to stabilize
216880	222080	it, resulting in higher material strength and weather resistance. CEB also requires very little
222080	227120	moisture to produce, does not require firing or curing, can be used straight out of the machine,
227120	232080	do not shrink or crack, has a smooth surface which can be left exposed without a finishing
232080	237680	overcoat, and is considered aesthetically pleasing due to its natural appearance appealing to human's
237680	244000	affinity to biophilic materials. An innovative example of CEB construction is by the architect
244000	250000	Diabato Francis Carey, who employs the use of locally available resources, traditional material
250000	256080	techniques in concert with modern solutions, and local community participation in the design
256080	262160	and building process. Carey is from Gando, a small remote village in Burkina Faso, which is a land
262160	267760	locked, low-income West African nation with limited natural resources. The nation has also been
267760	274000	experiencing frequent extreme climate events and tremendous political instability in recent years.
274000	279600	There is little to no access to education in Gando. In 1985, Carey received a scholarship
279600	285120	to study carpentry in Germany, and in 1995, he decided to enroll into the architecture program
285120	291200	at Berlin's Techniche Universität. While he was studying at TU, villagers back in Gando asked him
291200	297920	for help with repairing the village's only school built after he left, which was at risk of collapse.
297920	302720	In 1998, he established a charity, School Building Blocks for Gando, to raise money for
302720	306880	building a new school, and began working closely with the community on the design.
306880	311680	The new primary school building, completed in 2001, is comprised of three detached,
311680	316720	rectangular classrooms under a single inclined roof. The walls are built from compressed earth
316720	322720	blocks connected by earth mortar. Giving people a good education is very important to Francis Carey.
322720	327120	So before I tell you more about his school design, I want to tell you a bit about today's highly
327120	332000	educational sponsor. Architects, engineers, construction and design professionals know
332000	338080	that continuing education isn't just a requirement of maintaining professional credentials or licensing.
338080	342800	It also helps them to stay on top of industry information and ahead of design trends to keep
342800	348240	their skills in demand. AEC Daily offers over a thousand free accredited courses to keep you
348240	352720	up to date and your careers moving ahead. They offer relevant training in construction risk
352720	357680	evaluation, safety, international building codes and regulations, project management,

373280	376880	Link in the description below. Now back to talking about dirt.
376880	382320	Industrial materials like concrete and steel are hard to come by in Gando and wood is minimally
382320	388000	available due to deforestation. Thus clay is a material widely used for buildings in the region
388000	393040	for the past several hundred years. However, it's often considered a temporary material as it tends
393040	398640	to wash away under heavy rains. Kerry believed in the use of clay because it's free and locally
398640	404000	available. The reddish earth color fits organically into the surroundings and it has a historical
404000	410640	connection with the people. To improve performance, the clay compound was mixed with about 6% cement
410640	415760	to achieve stable and uniform bricks that are more weather resistant. He also introduced the
415760	422480	portable manually operated press making it possible to easily produce CEBs on site. To address the
422480	427840	sweltering hot conditions where temperatures can often get as hot as 45 degrees celsius,
427840	433360	Kerry pulled the building's roof away from the top of the classroom. This results in a stack effect
433360	438880	that creates a continuous air circulation by drawing in cool air from the windows which rises
438880	443360	through the porphyrated clay ceilings and vents out the perimeter gap below the roof canopy.
443360	448320	This design feature alleviates the need for costly and energy intensive air conditioning,
448320	453920	thus a passively cooled building with a low ecological footprint was created out of necessity.
453920	460160	Francis Kerry's designs are able to achieve durability, usefulness and beauty through paying
460160	465760	close attention to the simplest building block of architecture, the material. He also demonstrates
465760	471520	why a deep connection to material culture may be the key to achieving economic independence for
471520	477360	developing african nations as well as creating a more sustainable future for the rest of the world.
477360	483520	So is earth this building material of the past actually the material of the future? Maybe,
483520	487840	I personally think we should be building with mud and clay a lot more than we currently do,
487840	492480	but it obviously isn't a solution in every scenario. I think the more important lesson we
492560	497520	should take away from earth construction is a careful consideration of limited resources,
497520	502000	passive building techniques, human factors and local cultures. Let me know what you guys think in
502000	506640	the comments below. As always, thank you guys so much for watching. I recently decided to go back
506640	511520	to school for a master's degree and this video is actually an adaptation of one of my assignments.
511520	516560	If you enjoyed this video, feel free to check out more like it right here and I'll see you guys next time.
526880	532560	Are these decisions made entirely for safety reasons? I don't know. I don't know the answer to that.
