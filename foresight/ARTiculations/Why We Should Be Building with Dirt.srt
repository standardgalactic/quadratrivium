1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Did you know Earth, the ground we walk on and grow our crops in, is the most abundantly used

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,440
building material on the planet? With over 3 billion people living, working, learning, playing,

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,440
and socializing in buildings constructed from materials such as soil, clay, mud, and cob.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,440
Earth material technology has also been studied, improved upon, and refined for thousands of years.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,200
However, building with Earth is often associated with being poor, backward, and primitive.

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,160
All over the world, industrialization has led to an abandonment of Earth building traditions,

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,240
replaced by heavy investments into expensive and fossil-fuel-dependent materials such as

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,440
steel and concrete. Earth, on the other hand, is a material with excellent thermal mass properties

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,960
and low embodied energy.

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,960
In West Africa, building with clay or adobe can be traced back thousands of years.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,560
The Dogon people of what is today Mali and Northwestern Burkina Faso had developed a

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,120
highly sophisticated Earth building technique that is now at risk of disappearing due to the

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,640
ongoing military conflicts. In Vitruvius's 10 books on architecture, a seminal architectural

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,080
treatise from classical antiquity, there is an entire chapter dedicated to mud brick masonry.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,120
Vitruvius saw it as a material that exemplifies what he believed to be the primary qualities

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,400
of architecture, fromitas, utilitas, and venusitas. The Egyptian architect Hassan Fathi,

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,640
known for reviving and improving the techniques of traditional mud construction in Egypt,

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,600
utilized the thermodynamic properties of Earth to create passively cooled structures on a large

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,640
urban scale. His highly influential book, Architecture for the Poor, demonstrated how mud

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,320
brick is a low-cost, sustainable, and beautiful material available to essentially everyone on

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,040
Earth. The reason Earth building materials are excellent thermal masses is because they

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,240
act as natural thermal batteries that absorb heat during the day and slowly release heat

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,160
at night, which can maintain comfortable interior temperatures without the need for

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,440
mechanical heating and cooling during all seasons. Earth assemblies generally have a high R value,

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,240
which means it's a very insulating material that can lead to lower energy consumption,

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,040
even when mechanical heating and cooling are used. Earth also requires very little energy to

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,240
extract and manufacture, and is made of highly recyclable content. At the end of an Earth-constructed

28
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,520
building's life, they simply melt back into the ground, which can be reused to grow vegetation

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,760
or harnessed in the future for building materials again. So why has the industrial world largely

30
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,800
rejected Earth construction? It may be due to the fact that soil composition differs from region to

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,240
region, making it difficult to standardize on a large industrial scale. It is in fact illegal

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,040
to build with mud brick in some regions due to building code regulations. Are these decisions

33
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,560
made entirely for safety reasons, or were they results of lobbying by industrial material

34
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,800
manufacturers not wanting their businesses to be threatened by such a low-cost, abundantly available

35
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,840
and versatile material? While mud bricks are not permitted by certain building codes,

36
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,840
the use of compressed Earth blocks, CEBs, is often welcomed. CEB was first invented by French

37
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,680
architect François Cointreau in 1803 when he developed a mechanical press to compact Earth

38
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,440
into dense blocks. In 1952, Colombian engineer Raúl Ramirez made a critical advancement to

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,440
CEB technology by inventing a manually operated machine that is small, portable, and capable of

40
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,880
mass production. A critical ingredient of CEB is mixing a small percentage of cement to stabilize

41
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,080
it, resulting in higher material strength and weather resistance. CEB also requires very little

42
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,120
moisture to produce, does not require firing or curing, can be used straight out of the machine,

43
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,080
do not shrink or crack, has a smooth surface which can be left exposed without a finishing

44
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,680
overcoat, and is considered aesthetically pleasing due to its natural appearance appealing to human's

45
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,000
affinity to biophilic materials. An innovative example of CEB construction is by the architect

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Diabato Francis Carey, who employs the use of locally available resources, traditional material

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,080
techniques in concert with modern solutions, and local community participation in the design

48
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:22,160
and building process. Carey is from Gando, a small remote village in Burkina Faso, which is a land

49
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,760
locked, low-income West African nation with limited natural resources. The nation has also been

50
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,000
experiencing frequent extreme climate events and tremendous political instability in recent years.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,600
There is little to no access to education in Gando. In 1985, Carey received a scholarship

52
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,120
to study carpentry in Germany, and in 1995, he decided to enroll into the architecture program

53
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,200
at Berlin's Techniche Universität. While he was studying at TU, villagers back in Gando asked him

54
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,920
for help with repairing the village's only school built after he left, which was at risk of collapse.

55
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,720
In 1998, he established a charity, School Building Blocks for Gando, to raise money for

56
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,880
building a new school, and began working closely with the community on the design.

57
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,680
The new primary school building, completed in 2001, is comprised of three detached,

58
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,720
rectangular classrooms under a single inclined roof. The walls are built from compressed earth

59
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,720
blocks connected by earth mortar. Giving people a good education is very important to Francis Carey.

60
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,120
So before I tell you more about his school design, I want to tell you a bit about today's highly

61
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,000
educational sponsor. Architects, engineers, construction and design professionals know

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,080
that continuing education isn't just a requirement of maintaining professional credentials or licensing.

63
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,800
It also helps them to stay on top of industry information and ahead of design trends to keep

64
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,240
their skills in demand. AEC Daily offers over a thousand free accredited courses to keep you

65
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,720

and beneficial courses. So head over to aecdaily.com for your source of free accredited courses.

70
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,880
Link in the description below. Now back to talking about dirt.

71
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,320
Industrial materials like concrete and steel are hard to come by in Gando and wood is minimally

72
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,000
available due to deforestation. Thus clay is a material widely used for buildings in the region

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,040
for the past several hundred years. However, it's often considered a temporary material as it tends

74
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,640
to wash away under heavy rains. Kerry believed in the use of clay because it's free and locally

75
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,000
available. The reddish earth color fits organically into the surroundings and it has a historical

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,640
connection with the people. To improve performance, the clay compound was mixed with about 6% cement

77
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,760
to achieve stable and uniform bricks that are more weather resistant. He also introduced the

78
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,480
portable manually operated press making it possible to easily produce CEBs on site. To address the

79
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,840
sweltering hot conditions where temperatures can often get as hot as 45 degrees celsius,

80
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,360
Kerry pulled the building's roof away from the top of the classroom. This results in a stack effect

81
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,880
that creates a continuous air circulation by drawing in cool air from the windows which rises

82
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,360
through the porphyrated clay ceilings and vents out the perimeter gap below the roof canopy.

83
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,320
This design feature alleviates the need for costly and energy intensive air conditioning,

84
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,920
thus a passively cooled building with a low ecological footprint was created out of necessity.

85
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:40,160
Francis Kerry's designs are able to achieve durability, usefulness and beauty through paying

86
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,760
close attention to the simplest building block of architecture, the material. He also demonstrates

87
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,520
why a deep connection to material culture may be the key to achieving economic independence for

88
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,360
developing african nations as well as creating a more sustainable future for the rest of the world.

89
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,520
So is earth this building material of the past actually the material of the future? Maybe,

90
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,840
I personally think we should be building with mud and clay a lot more than we currently do,

91
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,480
but it obviously isn't a solution in every scenario. I think the more important lesson we

92
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,520
should take away from earth construction is a careful consideration of limited resources,

93
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,000
passive building techniques, human factors and local cultures. Let me know what you guys think in

94
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,640
the comments below. As always, thank you guys so much for watching. I recently decided to go back

95
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,520
to school for a master's degree and this video is actually an adaptation of one of my assignments.

96
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,560
If you enjoyed this video, feel free to check out more like it right here and I'll see you guys next time.

97
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,560
Are these decisions made entirely for safety reasons? I don't know. I don't know the answer to that.
